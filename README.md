Working title: Navigation in Collections of Speech Recordings.

Motivation/Background; 
Recordings of speech, such as podcasts, talks, or radio programmes contain large amounts of information. Though speech recording is nowadays probably the easiest way to store information, acquiring the information from speech collections is still problematic, mainly due to the linear structure of the recordings. Information can be typically only accessed using the meta-data which is provided by the creator of the content or using Spoken Content Retrieval methods [2]. The goal of this thesis is to make speech collections more accessible. This work will investigate, explore, design and implement alternative approaches for navigating in large collections of speech recordings, which would make an access to information and knowledge stored in speech collections easier.

Task; 
The main aim of this thesis is to explore the existing navigational and browsing tools for speech collections, identify and then implement the most promising methods for alternative browsing approaches. The browsing and navigational methods should be proposed to particularly ease the process of exploratory search. An example of navigational methods might be creating clusters of similar recordings or segments in the recordings, creating links between similar recordings, creating links between the mentioned entities or using visual representations of the spoken content. A possible scenario in which the tools would be used might be a user trying to find all the information regarding her/his home town about which she/he is writing a review. The method will be implemented on an existing collection of spoken data, such as for example Malach collection [2].

The thesis is suitable for one or two students.

Objectives; 
Explore existing navigational approaches for the speech collections

Propose and develop a novel approach for browsing and navigation and apply it on an existing speech collection
