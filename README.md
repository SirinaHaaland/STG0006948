Mind Map: Navigating Speech Collections Overview

Mind Map is a web application engineered to transform how users interact with vast collections of spoken content, including lectures, podcasts, and seminars. The project is developed by Sirina Håland and Trond Karlsen Strøm as part of their Bachelor Thesis in Computer Science at the University of Stavanger (UiS). Utilizing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, the application categorizes spoken content into intuitive, searchable topics, facilitating rapid information retrieval tailored to user interests and research needs.

Motivation

The linear structure of speech recordings, such as podcasts and talks, often makes accessing stored information challenging. Mind Map addresses this by providing innovative navigation and browsing tools that make it easier to access knowledge within these recordings. This work builds upon existing navigational methods, adding visual representations and link-based explorations to enhance the user's ability to conduct exploratory searches.

Features

AI-Enhanced Visuals: AI-generated visuals provide a pictorial summary of talk content, enhancing user engagement.
Search and Filtering Capabilities: Allows users to swiftly navigate through topics using keywords or curated filters.
Interactive Transcripts: Users can follow along with transcripts synchronized to audio, helping them quickly determine the relevance of content.

How It Works

At the core of Mind Map is a sophisticated topic modeling system that processes audio transcripts to categorize topics using techniques such as TF-IDF and K-means clustering. This enables users to interact with a responsive interface, navigating topics and accessing audio and transcripts directly. The system leverages the latest AI technology to improve topic identification and visual representation, making exploration both engaging and insightful.

Installation and Usage

For detailed installation and running instructions, please see the [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) file.
Ensure that all prerequisites are met to set up the application on your local machine or server.

Contribution

Mind Map and its associated preprocessing and topic modeling scripts are open source, hosted on GitHub at this repository. We encourage the community to contribute to the project by extending its capabilities or adapting its methodologies to new collections of spoken data.
