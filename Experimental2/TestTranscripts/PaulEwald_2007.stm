 what i 'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter and actually all the way down into the sewer because i want to talk about diarrhea  and
in particular i want to talk about the design of diarrhea
 and when evolutionary biologists talk about design they really mean
design by natural selection 
and that brings me to the title of the talk using evolution to design disease organisms intelligently and i also have a little bit of a sort of smartass
subtitle to this  
but i 'm not just doing this to be cute  i really think that this subtitle explains what somebody like me who 's sort of a darwin wannabe  how they actually look at
one 's role in sort of coming into this field of health
 sciences and medicine 
it 's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists  you actually see a great potential but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf and may actually be very resistant 
 when one tries to introduce ideas  so  all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions
 why are some disease organisms more harmful and a very closely related question which is how can we take control of this situation once we understand the answer to the first question how can we make
the harmful organisms more mild  and i 'm going to be talking to begin with as i said about diarrheal disease organisms  and the focus when i 'm talking about the diarrheal organisms as well as the focus when i 'm talking about any organisms that cause acute infectious disease 
is to
think about the problem from a germ 's point of view
 and in particular to think about a fundamental idea which i think makes sense out of a tremendous amount 
of variation in the harmfulness of disease organisms  and that idea
is that from the germ 's eye point of view disease organisms have to get from one host to another and often they have to rely on the
 of the host to move them to another host but not always 
sometimes you get disease organisms that don 't rely on host mobility at all for transmission and when you have that then
evolutionary theory tells us that natural selection will favor the more exploitative more
so natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage if instead transmission to another host requires host mobility then we expect that
the winners of the competition will be the
 organisms so if the pathogen doesn 't need the host to be healthy and active  
and actual selection favors pathogens that take advantage of those hosts the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts for their own
reproductive success  but if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen  then it 's the benign ones that tend to be the winners
 going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways they can be transmitted from person to person contact
 contact when somebody eats contaminated food or they can be transmitted through the water  and when they 're transmitted through the water  unlike the first two modes of transmission  
these pathogens don 't rely on a healthy host for transmission a person can be sick in bed and still
 even hundreds of other individuals to sort of illustrate that this diagram
emphasizes that if you 've got a sick person in bed somebody 's going to be taking out the contaminated materials they 're going to wash those contaminated materials  
and then the water may move into sources of drinking water people will come in to
those places where you 've got contaminated drinking water bring things back to the family may drink right at that point the whole point
is that a person who can 't move can still infect many other individuals  and so the theory tells us that
 when diarrheal disease organisms are are transported by water  
we expect them to be more predator like more harmful and you can test these ideas so one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water  tend to be more harmful and the answer is yep they are now i put those names in there just for the
bacteria buffs
 lot of them here i can tell
the main point here is that those data points all show a very strong positive association between
the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water  and how harmful they are how much death they cause per untreated infection 
so this suggests we 're on the right track  but this  to me suggests that we really
need to ask some additional questions remember the second question that i raised at the outset was
 how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild  
now this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission  you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right hand side of that graph to the left hand side of the graph but it doesn 't tell you how long 
 i mean if this would require thousands of years then it 's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens but if it could occur in just a few years  then it might be a very important way to control some of the
 nasty problems that we haven 't been able to control in other words 
this suggests that we could domesticate these organisms we could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us  and so  as i was thinking about this i focused on this organism which is the el tor biotype of the organism called vibrio cholerae and that is
the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera  and the reason i thought this is a really great organism to look
 at is that we understand why it 's so harmful it 's harmful because
it produces a toxin and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract it causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen the internal 
 chamber of our intestine and then that fluid goes the only way it can which is out the other end and it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the vibrios
so what happens if you 've got an organism it produces a lot of toxin after a few days of infection you end up having the fecal material really isn 't so disgusting as we might imagine it 's sort of cloudy water  and if you took a drop of that water  you might find
a million diarrheal organisms if the organism produced a lot of toxin you might find ten million or one hundred million if it didn 't produce a lot of this toxin
 the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted
by person to person contact or person food person contact both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission  
now i can think of some of some possible experiments one would be to take a lot of different strains of this
 organism some that produce a lot of toxins some that produce a little and
take those strains and and spew them out in different countries some countries that might have clean water supplies so that you can 't get waterborne transmission  you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there 
other countries in which you 've got a lot of waterborne transmission  there you expect these organisms to evolve
towards a high level of harmfulness right there 's a little ethical problem in this
 experiment  i was hoping to hear a few gasps at least that makes me worry a little bit but anyhow the laughter
makes me feel a little bit better
 and this ethical problem 's a big problem just to emphasize this  this is what we 're really talking about here 's a girl who 's almost dead she got rehydration therapy she
perked up within a few days she was looking like a completely different person so we don 't want to run an experiment like that but interestingly
that thing happened in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one in one  thousand 
nine hundred and ninety one this cholera organism got into lima peru and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas  now 
i don 't know how that happened  and i didn 't have anything to do with it i
promise you i don 't think anybody knows but i 'm not averse
 once that 's happened to see whether or not the prediction that we would make that i did make before actually holds up did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like chile 
which has some of the most well protected water supplies in latin america  and did it
evolve to be more harmful in a place like ecuador which has some of the least well protected and peru 's got something sort of in between  and so  with
funding
 i got a lot of strains from these different countries and we measured their toxin production in the lab and we found that in chile
within two months of the invasion of peru you had strains entering chile
and when you look at those strains in the very far left hand side of this graph you see a lot of variation in the toxin production each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person a
lot of variation on which natural selection can act but the interesting point is if you look over the 1990s within a few years the organisms
 evolved to be more mild they evolved to produce less toxin and to just give you a sense of how important this might be if we look in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five we find
that there 's only one case of cholera on average reported from chile
every two years so it 's controlled that 's how much we have in america cholera that 's acquired
endemically and we don 't think we 've
 they solved the problem in chile 
but before we get too confident we 'd better look at some of those other countries and make sure that this organism doesn 't just always evolve toward mildness  well  in peru it didn 't  
and in ecuador remember this is the place where it has the highest potential waterborne transmission it looked like it got more harmful in every case there 's a lot of variation but
something about the environment the people are living in and i think the only realistic explanation is that it 's the
the degree of waterborne transmission  favored the harmful strains in one place
 and mild strains in another  
so this is very encouraging it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow if we had enough money could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck it would make these organisms evolve to mildness  so that even though people 
 might be getting infected they 'd be infected with mild strains it wouldn 't be causing severe disease  but there 's another really interesting aspect of this  and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence evolution of harmfulness  then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance and the
 is very simple if you 've got a harmful organism a high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic a high proportion of the people are going to be going
to get antibiotics you 've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance so you get
increased virulence leading to the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance  and
once you get increased antibiotic resistance the antibiotics aren 't knocking out the harmful strains anymore so you 've got a higher level of virulence so you get this vicious cycle the goal is to turn this around  if you could
cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance so we can go to the same countries and look and see 
 did chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance  whereas did ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem if
 in this case on the y axis we 've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity and i won 't go into that but we 've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in chile peru and ecuador and no trend across the years  but if we look at the end of the 1990s just
half a decade later  
we see that in ecuador they started having a resistance problem antibiotic sensitivity was going down  and in chile  you still had antibiotic sensitivity so it looks like chile dodged two bullets they got the organism to evolve to mildness  
and they got no development of antibiotic resistance
 now these ideas should apply
across the board as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence  and i want to give you just one more example because we 've talked a little bit about malaria  and the example
i want to deal with is 
or the idea i want to deal with the question is what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness  
now malaria 's transmitted by a mosquito and normally if you 're
infected with malaria and you 're feeling sick
 makes it even easier for the mosquito to to bite you and you can show just by looking at data from literature that vector borne diseases are more harmful than non vector borne diseases  
but
i think there 's a really fascinating example of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this in the case of waterborne transmission we 'd like to clean up the water supplies
 see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness in the case of malaria what we 'd like to do
is
mosquito proof houses
 and the logic 's a little more subtle here if you mosquito proof houses when people get sick they 're sitting in bed or in mosquito proof hospitals they 're sitting in a hospital bed
and the mosquitoes can 't get to them so if you 're a harmful variant in a place where you 've got mosquito proof housing  then you 're a loser 
the only pathogens that get transmitted are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy
 to walk outside and get mosquito bites 
so if you were to mosquito proof houses you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness and there 's a really wonderful experiment that was done that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this  and that experiment was done in
northern alabama just to give you a little perspective on this i 've given you a star at the intellectual center
of the united states which is right there in louisville kentucky
 and this really cool experiment was done about two hundred miles south of there in northern alabama by the tennessee valley authority they had
dammed up the tennessee river they 'd caused
the water to back up they needed electric hydroelectric power  
and when you get stagnant water you get mosquitoes they found in the late ' 30s ten years after they 'd made these dams
that the
people in northern alabama
were infected with malaria about a third a third to half of them were infected with malaria
this shows you the positions of some of these dams 
ok so the tennessee valley authority was in a little bit of a bind there wasn 't ddt 
there wasn 't chloroquines what do they do well they decided to mosquito proof every house in northern alabama 
so they did they divided northern alabama into eleven zones  and within three years about one hundred dollars per house
 they mosquito proofed every house 
and these are the data every row across here represents one of those eleven zones and the asterisks represent the time at which the mosquito proofing was complete  and so what 
 you can see is that just the mosquito proofed housing and nothing else caused the eradication of malaria  and this was incidentally published in one thousand nine hundred and forty nine in the leading textbook of malaria called boyd 's malariology but almost no malaria experts
 know it exists  this is important  because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses now i would suggest that
you could do this in a lot of places like you know just
as you get into the malaria zone sub saharan africa but as you move to really intense biting rate areas like nigeria you
 that 's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness  so to me it 's 
an experiment that 's waiting to happen and if it confirms the prediction then we should have a very powerful tool in a way much more powerful than the kind of tools we 're looking at because most of what 's being 
 done today is to rely on things like anti malarial drugs and we know that although it 's great to make those anti malarial drugs available at really low cost and
 when you make them highly available you 're going to get resistance to those drugs and so it 's a short term solution this 
 i 'm suggesting here
is that we could get evolution working in the direction we want it to go rather than always having to battle evolution as a problem that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen for example with anti malarial drugs  
so  this table i
 given just to emphasize that i 've only talked about two
examples but as i said earlier this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases and it ought to 
because when we 're dealing with infectious diseases we 're dealing with living systems we 're dealing with living systems we 're dealing with systems that evolve  and so if you do something with those systems 
they 're going to evolve one way or another and all i 'm saying is that we need to figure out how they 'll evolve so that we need to
 adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck  so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go  so i don 't really have time to talk about those things but i did want to put them up there just to give you a sense that there really are solutions
to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we 're confronted with  
and this this links up with a lot of the
 how do you really lower
sexual transmission of hiv what this emphasizes is that
we need to figure out how it will work will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area it may get lowered if we intervene in ways that encourage people to stay more
faithful to partners and so on but the key thing is to figure out how to lower it because if we lower it we 'll get an evolutionary change
 the virus and the data really do support this that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness and that will just add to the
effectiveness of our our control efforts so the other thing i really like about this  besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension into the study
of
control of disease is that often the kinds of interventions that you want that it indicates should be done are the kinds of interventions interventions that people
 want anyhow but people just haven 't been able to justify the cost 
so this is the kind of thing i 'm talking about  if we know that we 're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water  then
i think that we can say  let 's push the effort into that aspect of the control  so that we can actually
solve the problem  even though if you just look at the frequency of infection you would suggest that you can 't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply
