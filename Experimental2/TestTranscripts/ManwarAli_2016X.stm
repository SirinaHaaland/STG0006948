 today i stand before you as a man who lives life to the full
in the here and now but for a long time i lived for death  
i was a young man who believed that jihad
is to be understood in the language of force and violence
i tried to right wrongs through power and aggression i had deep concerns
for the suffering of others and a strong desire to help and bring relief to them 
i thought violent jihad was noble chivalrous and the best way to help
at a time when so many of our people young people especially are at risk of radicalization
through groups like al qaeda islamic state and others when these groups are claiming that their
horrific brutality and violence
are true jihad i want to say that their idea of jihad is wrong completely wrong
 as was mine  then 
jihad means to strive to one 's utmost it includes exertion and spirituality
and devotion 
it refers to positive transformation through learning  wisdom
and remembrance of god the word jihad stands for all those meanings as a whole
jihad may at times
take the form of fighting but only sometimes under strict conditions  
within rules and limits 
in islam the benefit of an act must outweigh
the harm or hardship it entails more importantly the verses in the
 koran that are connected to jihad or fighting do not cancel out the verses that talk about
forgiveness  benevolence or patience  
but now i believe that there are no circumstances on earth
where violent jihad is permissible because it will lead to greater harm
but now the idea of jihad has been hijacked it has been perverted to mean violent struggle wherever muslims are undergoing difficulties  
and turned into terrorism
by fascistic islamists like al qaeda islamic state and others  but i have come to understand that true jihad
means striving to the utmost
to strengthen and live those qualities which god loves  
honesty  trustworthiness  compassion benevolence reliability respect  truthfulness
human values
that so many of us share  
i was born in bangladesh but grew up mostly in england  and i went to school here my father
 was an academic  and we were in the uk through his work
in one thousand nine hundred and seventy one we were in bangladesh when everything changed 
the war of independence impacted upon us terribly  pitting family against family  neighbor against neighbor and at
the age of twelve i experienced war destitution in my family 
the deaths of
twenty two of my relatives in horrible ways as well as the murder of my elder brother 
i witnessed killing  
animals feeding on corpses in the streets  starvation all around me  wanton horrific violence senseless
 i was a young man teenager  fascinated by
ideas i wanted to learn  but i could not go to school for four years  
after the war of independence my father was put in prison for two and a half years  
and i used to visit him every week in prison and homeschooled myself
 he fled to england as a refugee  and we soon followed him  i was seventeen so these experiences gave me
a sharp awareness of the atrocities and injustices in the world  
and i had a strong desire a very keen deep desire to right wrongs and help the victims of oppression 
while studying at college in the uk i
 met others
who showed me how i could channel that desire
and help through my religion  and i was radicalized enough
to consider violence correct even a virtue under certain circumstances 
so i became involved in the jihad in afghanistan  i wanted to protect the muslim afghan
 population against the soviet army  
and i thought that that was jihad my sacred duty 
which would be rewarded by god 
i became a preacher  
i was one of the pioneers of violent jihad in the uk  i recruited i raised
 funds  i trained  i confused true jihad with this perversion as presented by the fascist islamists
these people who use the idea of jihad
to justify their lust for power authority and control on earth 
a perversion perpetuated today by fascist islamist groups like
 state and others for a period of around fifteen years
 i fought for short periods of time in kashmir and burma  besides afghanistan  
our aim was to remove the invaders
 to bring relief to the oppressed victims
and of course to establish an islamic state a caliphate for god 's rule
and i did this openly 
i didn 't break any laws  i was proud and grateful to be british i still am  
and i bore no hostility
against this my country 
 and i still don 't  
during one battle in afghanistan  some british men and i formed a special bond with a 
afghani boy  abdullah an innocent  loving and lovable kid
who was always eager to please he was poor  and boys like him did menial tasks in the
 camp  and he seemed happy enough  but i couldn 't help wonder his parents must have missed him dearly  
and they must have dreamt about a better future for him 
a victim of circumstance caught up in a war  cruelly thrust upon him by the cruel circumstances of the time
 one day i picked up this unexploded mortar shell
in a trench  and i had it deposited in a makeshift makeshift mud hut lab  
and i went out on a short pointless skirmish always pointless  
and i came back a few hours later to discover he was dead 
he had tried to recover explosives from that shell it exploded and he
 died a violent death  blown to bits by the very same device that had proved harmless to me 
so i started to question
how did his death serve any purpose  
why did he die and i lived i carried on i fought in kashmir  i also recruited
 for the philippines  bosnia and chechnya and the questions grew 
later in burma  i came across rohingya fighters who were barely teenagers 
born and brought up in the jungle  carrying machine guns and grenade launchers  
 with soft manners and gentle voices  looking at me they begged me to take them away to england
they simply wanted to go to school that was their dream 
my family my children of the same age were living at home
in the uk  going to school living a safe life  
and i couldn 't help wonder how much these young boys must have spoken to one another
about their dreams for such a life 
victims of circumstances 
these two young boys sleeping rough on the ground looking up at the stars  cynically exploited by their
 leaders
for their personal lust for glory and power  
i soon witnessed boys like them killing one another in conflicts between rival groups 
and it was the same everywhere afghanistan kashmir burma  philippines  chechnya
 petty warlords got the young and vulnerable to kill one another in the name of jihad 
muslims against muslims not protecting anyone
against invaders or occupiers not bringing relief to the oppressed 
children being used  cynically exploited people dying in conflicts which i was supporting in the name of jihad
and it still carries on today 
realizing that the
violent jihad i had
engaged in abroad
was so different such a chasm between
 what i had experienced and what i thought was sacred duty i had to reflect on my activities here in the uk  
i had to consider my preaching  recruiting fund raising training  
but most importantly  radicalizing
sending young people to fight and die as i was doing all totally wrong
so i got involved in violent jihad in the mid ' 80s 
starting with afghanistan  
and by the time i finished it was
in the year two thousand
i was completely immersed in it all around me people supported  applauded even celebrated what we were doing in their name 
but by the time i learned to get out
 completely disillusioned in the year two thousand  fifteen years had passed 
so what goes wrong 
we were so busy talking about virtue  and 
 we were blinded by a cause  
and we did not give ourselves a chance to develop
a virtuous character we told ourselves we were fighting
for the oppressed but these were unwinnable wars 
we became the very instrument through which more deaths occurred  complicit
in causing further misery for the selfish benefit of the
 a very long time 
i opened my eyes  
i began to dare
to face the truth to think to face the hard questions i got in touch with my soul
what have i learned 
that people
who engage in violent jihadism that people who are drawn to these types of
 are not that different to everyone else  but i believe such people can change 
they can regain their hearts and restore them
by filling them with human values that heal 
when we ignore the realities 
we discover
that we accept what we are told without critical reflection
and we ignore the gifts and advantages that many of us would cherish even for a single moment in their lives 
i engaged in actions i thought were correct  
but now i began to question how i knew what i knew
 endlessly told others to accept the truth  
but i failed to give doubt doubt its rightful place 
this conviction that people can change is rooted
in my experience my own journey 
 i discovered i realized that islamists ' world of us and them is false and unjust 
through considering the uncertainties in all that we had asserted 
to the inviolable truths  incontestable truths  
i developed a more nuanced understanding
i realized
that in a world crowded with variation and contradiction 
foolish preachers only foolish preachers like i used to be see no paradox in the myths and fictions they use
 so i understood the vital importance of self knowledge political awareness and the necessity for a deep
and wide understanding of our commitments and our actions how they affect others  
so my plea today to everyone especially those who sincerely believe in
 go of anger  hatred
and violence 
learn to right wrongs without even attempting to justify cruel 
unjust and futile behavior  
instead create a few beautiful and useful things that outlive us
 approach the world life with love
learn to develop or cultivate your hearts to see goodness  beauty and truth in others and in the world 
that way we do matter more to ourselves 
to each other to our communities and for me to god this is jihad
my true jihad
thank you
