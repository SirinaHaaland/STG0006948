 is a question that parents ask me all the time 
why did my child develop autism as a pediatrician as a geneticist as a researcher
 we try and address that question 
but autism is not a single condition it 's actually a spectrum of disorders 
a spectrum that ranges for instance from justin a 13 year old boy who 's not verbal who can 't speak 
who communicates by using an ipad to touch pictures to communicate his thoughts and his concerns 
a little boy who when he gets upset will
start rocking and eventually when he 's disturbed enough will bang his head to the point that he can actually cut it open and require stitches  
that same diagnosis of autism though  also applies to gabriel  
another  13 year old boy who has quite a different set of challenges  he 's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics he can multiple three numbers by three numbers in his head with ease  
yet when it comes to trying to have a conversation  
he has great difficulty
he doesn 't make eye contact  he has difficulty starting a conversation feels awkward  and when he gets nervous  he actually shuts down 
yet both of these boys have the same diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder 
one of the things that concerns us is whether or not there really is an epidemic
 these days one in eighty eight children will be diagnosed with autism  
and the question is why does this graph look this way has that number been increasing dramatically over time 
or is it because we have now started labeling individuals with autism  simply giving them a diagnosis when they were still present there before yet simply
 legislation was passed that actually provided individuals with autism with resources with access to educational materials that would help them 
with that increased awareness more parents more pediatricians  more educators learned to recognize the features of autism 
as a result of that more individuals were diagnosed and got access to the
 resources they needed  
in addition  we 've changed our definition over time  so in fact we 've widened the definition of autism  and that accounts for some of the increased prevalence that we see 
the next question everyone wonders is what caused autism  
and a common misconception is that vaccines cause autism  
but let me be very clear
 vaccines do not cause autism 
in fact the original research study that suggested that was the case was completely fraudulent  
it was actually retracted from the journal lancet in which it was published  and that author a physician
 physician had his medical license taken away from him 
the institute of medicine the centers for disease control have repeatedly investigated this and there is no credible evidence
that vaccines cause autism  
 one of the ingredients in vaccines something called thimerosal was thought to be what the cause of autism was that was actually removed from vaccines 
in the year one thousand nine hundred and ninety two and you can see that it really did not have an effect in what happened with the prevalence of autism  
 in fact there 's probably not one single answer  just as autism is a spectrum there 's a spectrum of etiologies a spectrum of causes  based on epidemiological data 
 we know that one of the causes or one of the associations i should say is advanced paternal age that is increasing age of the father at the time of conception 
 while the fetal brain is developing we know that exposure to certain agents can actually increase the risk of autism  
in particular there 's a medication valproic acid which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take  we know can increase that risk of autism  
in addition there can be some infectious agents that can also
 and one of the things i 'm going to spend a lot of time focusing on are the genes that can cause autism  
i 'm focusing on this not because genes are the only cause of autism  but it 's a cause of autism that we can readily define and be able to better understand the 
 biology and understand better how the brain works so that we can come up with strategies to be able to intervene 
 one of the genetic factors that we don 't understand however is the difference that we see in terms of males and females males are affected four to one 
 compared to females with autism  and we really don 't understand what that cause is 
 what 's the probability that another sibling in that family will have autism  
and we can look in particular at three types of siblings  
identical twins  twins that actually share one hundred percent of their genetic information and shared the same intrauterine environment  
versus fraternal twins  twins that actually share fifty percent of their genetic information  versus
 also sharing fifty percent of their genetic information yet not sharing the same intrauterine environment  
and when you look at those concordance ratios one of the striking things that you will see is that in identical twins that concordance rate is seventy seven percent 
remarkably though  it 's not one hundred percent  it is not that genes account for all of the risk for
 but yet they account for a lot of that risk because when you look at fraternal twins that concordance rate is only thirty one percent 
on the other hand  there is a difference between those fraternal twins and the siblings  suggesting that there are common exposures for those fraternal twins that may not be shared as commonly with siblings alone 
so this provides some of the data that autism is genetic well how genetic is it when we compare it to other conditions that we 're familiar with
things like cancer  heart disease diabetes in fact genetics plays a much larger role in autism than it does in any of these other conditions 
 but with this that doesn 't tell us what the genes are it doesn 't even tell us in any one child is it one gene or potentially a combination of genes  
 genetic 
that is that it is one single powerful deterministic gene that causes the autism  
however in other individuals  it 's genetic 
that is that it 's actually a combination of genes in part with the developmental process that ultimately determines that risk for autism
 we don 't know in any one person necessarily  which of those two answers it is until we start digging deeper 
so the question becomes how can we start to identify what exactly those genes are and let me pose something that might not be intuitive  
in certain individuals  
they can have autism for a reason that is genetic but yet not because of autism running in the family 
and the reason is because in certain individuals they can actually have
 genetic changes or mutations that are not passed down from the mother or from the father but actually start brand new in them 
mutations that are present in the egg or the sperm at the time of conception but have not been passed down generation through generation within the family  
and we can actually use that strategy to now understand and to identify those genes causing autism in those
 individuals 
so in fact at the simons foundation we took two  thousand six hundred individuals that had no family history of autism  
and we took that child and their mother and father and used them to try and understand what were those genes causing autism in those cases 
to do that we actually had to comprehensively be able to look at all that genetic information and determine what those
 differences were between the mother the father and the child  
in doing so i apologize i 'm going to use an outdated analogy of encyclopedias rather than wikipedia  
but i 'm going to do so to try and help make the point that as we did this inventory we needed to be able to look at massive amounts of information 
our genetic information is organized into a set of
 and when we did that we had to be able to account for each of those forty six volumes  because in some cases with autism  there 's actually a single volume that 's missing  we had to get more granular than that though  and so we had to start opening those books 
and in some cases the genetic change was more subtle 
it might have been a single paragraph that was missing 
or yet even more subtle than that a single letter
 one out of three billion letters that was changed that was altered yet had profound effects in terms of how the brain functions and affects behavior  
in doing this within these families  we were able to account for approximately twenty five percent of the individuals and determine that there was a single powerful genetic factor that caused autism within those families
 on the other hand there 's seventy five percent that we still haven 't figured out 
as we did this though it was really quite humbling 
because we realized that there was not simply one gene for autism in fact the current estimates are that there are two hundred to four hundred different genes that can cause autism  
and that explains in part why we see such a broad spectrum in terms of its effects
 although there are that many genes  there is some method to the madness  it 's not simply random two hundred four hundred different genes  but in fact they fit together 
they fit together in a pathway they fit together in a network that 's starting to make sense now in terms of how the brain functions we
 they interact together to make that neuron work  understanding how those neurons interact together to make circuits work and understand how those circuits work to now control behavior 
 and understand that both in individuals with autism as well as individuals who have normal cognition 
where we have the ability to transform to be able to impact that growing developing brain is critical  
and so folks like ami klin have developed methods to be able to take infants small babies and be able to use biomarkers in this case 
eye contact and eye tracking to identify an infant at risk this particular infant you can see making very good eye contact
 with this woman as she 's singing itsy bitsy spider in fact is not going to develop autism  this baby we know is going to be in the clear  
on the other hand this other baby is going to go on to develop autism in this particular child you can see it 's not making good eye contact instead of the eyes focusing in and having that social connection 
looking at the mouth looking at the nose
 looking off in another direction  but not again socially connecting 
and being able to do this on a very large scale screen infants screen children for autism  through something very robust very reliable is going to be very helpful 
 to us in terms of being able to intervene at an early stage when we can have the greatest impact
 how are we going to intervene it
's probably going to be a combination of factors in part in some individuals we 're going to try and use medications  and so in fact identifying the genes for autism 
 is important for us to identify drug targets to identify things that we might be able to impact and can be certain that that 's really what we need to do in autism  but that 's not going to be the only answer  
 some of them are wired a little bit differently they learn in a different way they absorb their surroundings in a different way and we need to be able to educate them in a way that serves them best  
beyond that there are a lot of individuals in this room who have great ideas in terms of new technologies we can use 
everything from devices we can use to train the brain to be able to make it more efficient and to compensate for areas in which
 it has a little bit of trouble 
to even things like google glass you could imagine for instance gabriel with his social awkwardness might be able to wear google glass with an earpiece in his ear  and have a coach be able to help him be able to help
think about conversations 
 being able to even perhaps one day invite a girl out on a date
 be able to help think about
be able to make
