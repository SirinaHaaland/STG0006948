  share with you
 the story of one of my patients called celine celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district of cameroon in west central africa 
  six years ago at the time of her hiv diagnosis she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial which was running in her health district at the time 
 when i first met celine a little over a year ago  she had gone for eighteen months without any antiretroviral therapy  
 and she was very ill 
 she told me that she stopped coming to the clinic when the trial ended
 because she had no money for the bus fare
 and was too ill to walk the
  distance  
 now during the clinical trial she 'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge  
 and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds  
 all of these ended once the trial was completed  leaving celine with no alternatives  
 she was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she 'd received during the trial or even what the trial had been about
  i didn 't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were
 because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue  yet what puzzled me most
 was celine had given her informed consent to be a part of this trial  yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a participant
 or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed
  now i have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted  
 maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results  maybe it even got published in a high profile scientific journal  
 maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the
  it would have done so at a price to hundreds of patients who like celine  were left to their own devices
 once the research had been completed  
 i do not stand here today to suggest in any way that conducting hiv clinical trials in developing countries is bad 
 on the contrary clinical trials are extremely useful tools  and are much needed to address the burden of
  disease in developing countries  however  the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding
 pose a real risk for exploitation especially in the context of 
 research 
 sadly enough the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer
  countries which fund the research  i 'm sure you must be asking yourselves
 what makes developing countries especially those in sub saharan africa  so attractive for these hiv clinical trials 
 well in order for a clinical trial to generate valid and widely applicable results 
 they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants
 and preferably on
  population with a high incidence of new hiv infections 
 sub saharan africa largely fits this description 
 with twenty two million people living with hiv an estimated seventy percent of the thirty million people who are infected worldwide  
 also research within the continent
 is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty  endemic diseases
 and inadequate health care systems a clinical trial that is considered to be potentially beneficial to the population
 is more likely to be authorized and in the absence of good health care systems  almost any offer of medical assistance
 is accepted as better than nothing even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation less rigorous
 ethical reviews  and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure 
 as
 funding for hiv research increases in developing countries and ethical review in richer countries become more strict 
 you can see why this context
  very attractive the high prevalence of hiv drives researchers
 to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable but on many levels
 ethically questionable  
 how then can we ensure that in our search for the cure we do not take an unfair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pandemic  
 i invite you to consider four areas i think we can focus on
 in order to improve the way in which
  things are done  
 the first of these is informed consent 
 now in order for a clinical trial to be
 considered ethically acceptable participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand 
 and must freely consent to participate
 in the trial this is especially important in developing countries where a lot of participants consent to
  research
 because they believe it is the only way in which they can receive medical care or other benefits 
 consent procedures that are used in richer countries are often inappropriate or ineffective in a lot of developing countries 
 for example it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant like
  sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read let alone understand  
 local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials as well as the incentives for participation  
 the information in these trials needs to be given to the potential participants
 in linguistically and culturally acceptable
  the second point i would like for you to consider
 is the standard of care that is provided to participants within any clinical trial  now this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy 
 should the control group in the clinical trial be given the best current treatment which is available
 anywhere in the world or should they be given an alternative standard of care such
  the best current treatment available in the country in which the research is being conducted 
 is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen which may not be affordable or accessible to the study participants once the research has been completed  
 now in a situation where the best current treatment is inexpensive and simple to deliver  the answer is straightforward  
  the best current treatment available anywhere in the world is often very difficult to provide in developing countries  
 it is important to assess the potential risks and benefits
 of the standard of care which is to be provided to participants in any clinical trial  and establish one
 which is relevant for the context of the study and most beneficial for the participants within the study 
 that brings us to the third point i want you think about the
  review of research 
 an effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants within any clinical trial  
 unfortunately this is often
 lacking or inefficient in a lot of developing countries  local governments
  set up effective systems for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials which are authorized in different developing countries 
 and they need to do this by setting up ethical review committees that are independent of the government
 and research sponsors  public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency
 and independent review by nongovernmental and
 international organizations as appropriate  the final point i would like for you to consider tonight
 is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed  
 i think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin in the first place without a clear plan for what would happen to the participants once the trial has ended  
 now  researchers need to make every effort to ensure that an intervention that has been shown
  to be beneficial during a clinical trial
 is accessible to the participants of the trial once the trial has been completed  
 in addition they should be able to consider the possibility of introducing and maintaining effective treatments
 in the wider community once the trial ends  
  for any reason they feel that this might not be possible then i think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place  
 now fortunately for celine  our meeting did not end in my office  i was able to get her enrolled into a free hiv treatment program
 closer to her home  and with a support group to help her cope 
  her story has a positive ending but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortunate  
 although she may not know this my encounter with celine
 has completely changed the way in which i view
 hiv clinical trials in developing countries and made me even more determined to be part of the movement to change the way in which things are done
  i believe that every single person listening to me tonight
 can be part of that change 
 if you are a researcher i hold you to a higher standard of moral conscience to remain ethical in your research 
 and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers  
 if you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company  i challenge you to hold your employers
  to fund research that is ethically sound 
 if you come from a developing country like myself  
 i urge you to hold your government to a more thorough review of the clinical trials which are authorized in your country  
 yes there is a need for us to find a cure for hiv to find an effective vaccine for malaria to find
 a diagnostic tool that works for t b but i believe that we owe it to those who willingly and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials to do this in a humane way
