  what is so special about the human brain  why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us 
 what does a human brain have or do that no other brain does  
 when i became interested in these questions about ten years ago  scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of though it was based on very
  little evidence many scientists thought that all mammalian brains including the human brain  were made in the same way with a number of neurons that was always proportional to the size of the brain 
 this means that two brains of the same size like these two with a respectable four hundred grams should have similar numbers of neurons  
 now  if neurons are the functional information processing units of the brain then the owners of these two brains should have similar
  cognitive abilities  and yet one is a chimp  and the other is a cow 
 now maybe cows have a really rich internal mental life and are so smart that they choose not to let us realize it 
 but we eat them  i think most people will agree that chimps are capable of much more
  elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are so this is a first indication that the all brains are made the same way scenario is not quite right  
 but let 's play along  
 if all brains were made the same way and you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes larger brains should always have more neurons than smaller brains and the larger the brain the more cognitively able its owner should be  
 so the largest brain around should also be the most cognitively able  and here comes the bad news our brain
  largest one around it
 seems quite vexing our brain weighs between one point two and one point five kilos  but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos  
 which is why scientists used to resort to saying that our brain must be special to explain our cognitive
  it must be really extraordinary  an exception to the rule  
 theirs may be bigger  but ours is better  
 and it could be better for example in that it seems larger than it should be with a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have for the size of our bodies  so that would give us extra cortex to do more 
  interesting things than just operating the body that 's because the size of the brain usually follows
  the size of the body  so the main reason for saying that our brain is larger than it should be actually comes from comparing ourselves to great apes  
 gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are so their brains should also be larger than ours but instead it 's the other way around our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain 
 the human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses  although it weighs only two
  percent of all the energy that your body requires to run per day that 's five hundred calories out of a total of two thousand calories 
 just to keep your brain working  so
 the human brain is larger than it should be it uses much more energy than it should so it 's special  
 and this is where the story started to bother me 
 in biology we look for rules that apply to all animals and to life in general so why should the rules of evolution apply to everybody else but
 not to us  
 maybe the problem was with the basic assumption that all brains are made in the same way  maybe two brains of a similar size can actually be made of very different numbers of neurons maybe a very large brain
 does not necessarily have more neurons than a more modest sized brain
 maybe the human brain actually has the most neurons of any brain regardless of its size especially in the cerebral cortex  
 so this to me became
  the important question to answer how many neurons does the human brain have and how does that compare to other animals 
 now you may have heard or read somewhere that we have one hundred billion neurons  so ten years ago i asked my colleagues if they knew where this number came from but nobody did 
 i 've been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number
  and i could never find it it seems that nobody had actually ever counted the number of neurons in the human brain or in any other brain for that matter  
 so i came up with my own way to count cells in the brain  and it essentially consists of dissolving that brain into soup  
 it works like this you take a brain  or parts of that brain and you dissolve it in detergent which destroys the cell membranes but keeps the cell nuclei intact so you end up with
  suspension of free nuclei that looks like this like a clear soup this soup contains all the nuclei that once were a mouse brain 
 now the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup  you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid so that now by looking under the microscope 
  at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution you can count nuclei and therefore
  tell how many cells that brain had it 's simple it 's straightforward and it 's really fast so we 've used that method to count neurons in dozens of different species so far  and it turns out that all brains are not made the same way  
 take rodents and primates for instance 
 in larger rodent brains the average size of the neuron increases so the brain inflates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains neurons
 but primate brains gain neurons without the average neuron becoming any larger which is a very economical way to add neurons to your brain the result is that a primate brain will always have 
  more neurons than a rodent brain of the same size and the larger the brain the larger this difference will be well 
  sixteen billion of which are in the cerebral cortex and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of functions like
 awareness and logical and abstract reasoning  and that sixteen billion is the most neurons that any cortex has 
 i think this is the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities  
 but just as important is what
  billion neurons mean because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically we could calculate
 what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain so a rodent brain with eighty six billion neurons would weigh
 thirty six kilos 
 that 's not possible a brain that huge would be crushed by its own weight  and this impossible brain would go in the body of
  like us  so this brings us to a very important conclusion already which is that we are not rodents the human brain is not a large rat brain  
 compared to a rat we might seem special yes but that 's not a fair comparison to make given that we know that we are not rodents we are primates  
 so the correct comparison is to other
  and there if you do the math  you find that a generic primate with eighty six billion neurons would have a brain of about one point two kilos which seems just right  
 in a body of some sixty six kilos which in my case is exactly right  which brings us to a very unsurprising but still incredibly important conclusion i am a primate and all of you are
  and so was darwin  
 i love to think that darwin would have really appreciated this his brain  like ours was made in the image of other primate brains  
 so the human brain may be remarkable yes  but it is not special in its number of neurons it is just a large primate brain i think that 's a very humbling and sobering thought that should remind us of our place in nature 
 why does
  other people have figured out how much energy the human brain and that of other species costs and now that we knew how many neurons each brain was made of we could do the math  and it turns out that both human 
 and other brains cost about the same an average of six calories per billion neurons per day  so the total energetic cost of a brain is a simple linear function 
 of its number of neurons  and it turns out that the human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect
  so the reason why the human brain costs so much energy is simply because it has a huge number of neurons and because we are primates with many more neurons for a given body size than any other animal 
 the relative cost of our brain is large  
 but just because we 're primates not because we 're special 
 last question then how did we come by this remarkable number of neurons and in particular if great apes are larger than
  we are why don 't they have a larger brain than we do with more neurons  
 when we realized how much expensive it is to have a lot of neurons in the brain i figured 
 maybe there 's a simple reason they just can 't afford the energy for both a large body and a large number of neurons  so we did the math  
 we calculated on the one hand how much energy a primate gets per day from eating raw foods and on the other hand how much energy a body of a
  size costs and how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs and we looked for the combinations of body size and number of brain neurons that a primate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day and
 what we found is that because neurons are so expensive there is a tradeoff between body size and number of neurons so a primate that eats eight hours per day can afford at most
  then its body cannot be any bigger than twenty five kilos 
 to weigh any more than that it has to give up neurons so it 's either a large body or a large number of neurons when you eat like a primate you can 't afford both 
 one way out of this metabolic limitation would be to
 spend even more hours per day eating  but that gets dangerous  and past a certain point it 's just not possible  gorillas and orangutans
  for instance afford about thirty billion neurons by spending eight and a half hours per day eating and that seems to be about as much as they can do 
 nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate 
 what about us with our eighty six billion neurons and sixty to seventy kilos of body mass 
 we should have to spend over nine hours per day every
  single day feeding  which is just not feasible if we ate like a primate  we should not be here 
 how did we get here then 
 well if our brain costs just as much energy as it should and if we can 't spend every waking hour of the day
 feeding  then the only alternative
  is to somehow get more energy out of the same foods and
 remarkably that matches exactly what
 our ancestors are believed to have invented one and a half million years ago  when they invented cooking to cook is to use fire to
  foods outside of your body  
 cooked foods are softer so they 're easier to chew and to turn completely into mush in your mouth  so that allows them to be completely digested and absorbed in your
  gut which makes them yield much more energy in much less time so cooking frees time for us to do much more interesting things with our day and with our neurons than just thinking about food looking for food and gobbling down food all day long  
 so because of cooking what once was a major liability this large  dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons 
 could now become a major asset
  now that we could both afford the energy for a lot of neurons and the time to do interesting things with them  
 so i think this explains why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution all of the while remaining just a primate brain 
 with this large brain now affordable by cooking  we went rapidly from raw foods to
  all of those things that nowadays allow us to get all the energy we need for the whole day in a single sitting at your favorite fast food joint  
 so what once was a solution
 now became the problem  and ironically  we look for the solution
 in raw food  so what is the human advantage what is it that we have that no other animal has
 my answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex and i think that 's the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities and what is it that we
 do that no other animal does and which i believe was fundamental to allow us to
 reach that large  largest number of neurons in the cortex in two words we cook
  no other animal cooks its food  only humans do  and i think that 's how we got to become human
