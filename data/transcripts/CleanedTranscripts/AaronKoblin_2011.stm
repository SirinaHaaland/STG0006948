  data can actually make us more human 
 we 're collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we 're living our lives and it 's enabling us to tell some amazing stories  recently a wise media theorist tweeted the 19th century
 culture was defined by the novel the 20th century culture was defined by the cinema  and the culture of the 21st century will be defined by the interface 
 and i believe this is going to prove true 
 our lives are being driven by data and the presentation of that data is an opportunity for us to make some amazing interfaces that tell great stories so i 'm going to show you a few of the projects that i 've been working on over the last couple years that reflect on our lives and our systems  
 this is a project called flight patterns what you 're looking at is airplane
  traffic over north america for a 24 hour period 
 as you see everything starts to fade to black  and you see people going to sleep  
 followed by that you see on the west coast planes moving across the red eye flights to the east coast  
 and you 'll see everybody waking up on the east coast  
 followed by european flights coming in the upper right hand corner  everybody 's moving from the east coast to the west coast  you see san francisco and los angeles start to make their journeys down to hawaii in the lower
  i think it 's one thing to say there 's one hundred and forty thousand planes being monitored by the federal government at any one time and it 's another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows  
 this is a time lapse image of that exact same data but i 've color coded it by type so you can see the diversity of aircraft that are in the skies above us and
 i started making these and i put them into google maps and allow you to zoom in and see individual airports and the patterns that are occurring there  
 so here we can see the the white represents low altitudes and the blue are higher altitudes
  you can zoom in this is taking a look at atlanta  you can see this is a major shipping airport and there 's all kinds of activity there 
 you can also toggle between altitude for model and manufacturer see again the diversity  
 and you can scroll around and see some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have this is scrolling up the east coast  you can see some of the chaos that 's happening
 in new york with the air traffic controllers having to deal
 with all those major airports next to each other 
 so zooming back out real quick we see again the u s you get florida down in the right hand corner  moving across to the west coast you see san francisco and los angeles big low traffic zones across nevada and arizona  
 and that 's us down there in l a and long beach on the bottom 
 i started taking a look as well at different
  perimeters because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data this is looking at ascending versus descending flights  and you can see over time the ways the airports change  you see the holding patterns that start to develop in the bottom of the screen  
 and you can see  eventually the airport actually flips directions  
 so this is another project that i worked on with the sensible cities lab at mit  this is visualizing international
 how new york communicates with other international cities  and we set this up as a live globe in the museum of modern art in new york for the design the elastic mind exhibition  
 and it had a live feed with a 24 hour offset so you could see the changing relationship and some demographic info coming through at & t 's data
 and revealing itself  this is another project i worked on with sensible cities lab and 
 it 's visualizing sms messages being sent in the city of amsterdam
  so you 're seeing the daily ebb and flow of people sending sms messages from different parts of the city  until we approach new year 's eve where everybody says happy new year 
 so this is an interactive tool that you can move around and see different parts of the city  
 this is looking at another event this is called queen 's day  so again you get this daily ebb and flow of people sending sms messages from different parts of the city  
 and then you 're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city to celebrate the
  which happens right here  and then you can see people celebrating the next day  and you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases  
 so now on to something completely different some of you may recognize this this is baron wolfgang von kempelen 's mechanical chess playing machine  
 and it 's this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well except for one thing it 's not a robot at all there 's actually a legless man that sits in that box and controls this chess player 
 this was the inspiration for a web service
 by amazon called the mechanical turk named after this guy and it 's based on the
  that there are certain things that are easy for people but really difficult for computers 
 so they made this web service and said any programmer can write a piece of software and tap into the minds of thousands of people 
 the nerdy side of me thought wow this is amazing i can tap into thousands of people 's minds and the other nerdy side of me thought this is
 horrible this is completely bizarre what does this mean for the future of mankind where we
  all plugged into this borg i was probably being a little extreme but what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we 're working on and we 're just doing these little labors 
 so i created this drawing tool  i asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left and i said i 'll pay you two cents for your contribution 
 and i started collecting sheep  
 and i collected
 a lot a lot of different sheep  lots of sheep  i took the first ten thousand sheep that i collected and i put them on a website called
  buy collections of twenty sheep  you can 't pick individual sheep but you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity and juxtaposed against this grid you see actually by rolling over each individual one the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process i think
 there 's something really interesting to watching people as they
 go through this creative toil something we can all relate to this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing  i think it was really interesting to
  juxtapose this humanity versus this massive distributed grid  kind of amazing what some people did 
 so here 's a few statistics from the project  approximate collection rate of eleven sheep per hour which would make a working wage of sixty nine cents per hour 
 there were six hundred and sixty two rejected sheep that didn 't meet sheep like criteria and were thrown out of the flock 
 the amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to forty six minutes that gives you an idea of the different types of motivations
  and dedication  and there were seven thousand five hundred and ninety nine
 people that contributed to the project or were unique ip addresses so about how many people contributed  
 but only one of them out of the seven thousand five hundred and ninety nine said this 
 which i was pretty surprised by i expected people to
  i think it 's a pretty valid question and
 there 's a lot of reasons why i chose sheep  sheep were the first animal to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts the first to be selectively bred for production traits the first animal to be cloned  obviously we 
  think of sheep as followers  and there 's this reference to le petit prince where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep  he draws sheep after sheep  the narrator 's only appeased when he draws a box and he says it 's not about a scientific rendering of a sheep  it 's about your own interpretation and doing something different
  this is a clip from charlie chaplin 's modern times it 's showing charlie chaplin dealing with some of the major changes during the industrial revolution  
 so there were no longer shoe makers but now there are people slapping soles on people 's shoes and the whole idea of one 's relationship to their work changed a lot  so i thought this was an interesting clip to divide into sixteen pieces and feed into the mechanical turk with a drawing
  this basically allowed what you see on the left side is the original frame and on the right side you see that frame as interpreted by sixteen people who have no idea what it is they 're doing  
 and this was the inspiration for a project that i worked on with my friend takashi kawashima we decided to use the mechanical turk for exactly what it was meant for which is making money  
 so we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into ten thousand teeny pieces and we fed those into the mechanical turk 
 we asked people to draw what it was that they
  but here there was no sheep like criteria people if they drew a stick figure or a smiley face it actually made it into the bill  so what you see is actually a representation of how well people did what what it was they were asked to do  
 so we took these hundred dollar bills and we put them on a website called 
 where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions and you can also trade real hundred dollar bills for fake hundred dollar bills and make a donation to the hundred dollar laptop project  which is now known as one laptop per child  
 this is again showing all the different contributions you see some
  did beautiful stipple renderings like this one on top spent a long time making realistic versions 
 and other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces here on the right hand side in the middle you see this one guy writing $ zero point zero one 
  all i 'm getting paid for this so the last mechanical turk project i 'm going to talk to you about is called bicycle built for two thousand this is a collaboration
  with my friend daniel massey
 you may recognize these two guys this is max mathews and john kelly from bell labs in the ' 60s where they created the song daisy bell which was the world 's first singing computer  
 you may recognize it from two thousand and one a space odyssey when hal 's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song as a reference to when
 computers became human  so we resynthesized this
  this is what that sounded like we broke down all the individual notes in the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing 
 and we took all of those individual pieces and we fed them into another turk request  this is what it would look like if you went to the site you type in your code 
 but you first test your mic you 'd be fed a simple audio clip 
  into the mechanical turk with
  so james surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual we wanted to see how this applies to collaborative distributed music making where nobody has any idea what it is they 're working on 
 so if you go 
  bicyclebuiltfortwothousand com you can actually hear what all this sounds like together i 'm sorry for this
 the
  going to grad school i was also working at a place called the center for embedded network sensing and i was writing software to visualize laser scanners  so basically motion through 3d space
 and this was seen by a director in l a named james frost who said wait a minute you mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video 
 so we did exactly that we made a music video for one of my favorite bands radiohead  
 and i think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers but we also open sourced it and we made it released as a google code project where people could download a bunch of the
 data and some source code to build their own versions of it and people were making some amazing things this is actually two of my favorites the
 pin board thom yorke and a lego thom yorke a whole youtube channel of people submitting really interesting content 
 more recently somebody even  3d printed thom yorke 's head which is a little creepy but pretty cool  
 so with everybody making so much amazing stuff and actually understanding what it was they were working on i was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project where people were working together to build something  
 and i met a music video director named chris milk  and we started bouncing around ideas
  to make a collaborative music video project  but we knew we really needed the right person to kind of rally behind and build build something for 
 so we put the idea on the back burner for a few months and he ended up talking to rick rubin who was finishing up johnny cash 's final album called ain 't no grave 
 the lyrics to the leading track are ain 't no grave can hold my body down so we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for johnny cash
  teamed up with my good friend ricardo cabello also known as mr doob who 's a much better programmer than i am  and he made this amazing flash drawing tool as you know an animation is a series of images 
  so what we did was cross cut a bunch of archival footage of johnny cash and at eight frames a second  we allowed individuals to draw a single frame that would get woven into this dynamically
  time to play the entire thing for you but i want to show you two short clips one is the beginning of the music video and that 's going to be followed by a short clip of people who have already contributed to the project talking about it briefly
  what better way to pay tribute to the man than to
  for one of his songs collaborator i felt really sad when he died and i just thought it 'd be wonderful it 'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory
  through problems until my little wee battles that i was fighting within the picture all
  so if you go to the website
  what you 'll see is the video playing above 
 and below it are all the individual frames that people have been submitting to the project so this isn 't finished at all but it 's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate if you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails  
  you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail and where they were located  and if you find one that you 're interested in
  you can get the playback and personal contribution in
 addition to that it 's listed the artist 's name the location 
 how long they spent drawing it and you can pick a style  so this one was tagged abstract but there 's a bunch of different styles and you can sort the video a number of different ways you can say i want to see the pointillist version or the sketchy version or the realistic version  
 and then this is again the abstract version  which ends up getting a little bit crazy
  so the last project i want to talk to you about is another collaboration with chris milk and this is called the wilderness downtown it 's an online music video for the arcade fire chris and i were really amazed by
 the potential now with modern web browsers where you have html5 audio and video and the power of javascript to render amazingly fast and
 we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the web beyond the 
  window and try to make it play
  out and choreograph throughout the screen  
 but most importantly i think we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the johnny cash project where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time to contribute something for everyone 
 what if we had a very low commitment but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed  
 so the project starts off by asking you to enter the address of the home where you grew up and you type in the address it actually creates a music video specifically for you pulling in google maps and streetview images into the experience itself
 so this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address but i 'm going to give you a little preview of what you can expect
 the
  there 's one thing to take away from my talk today it 's that an interface can be a powerful narrative device  and as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data we have an opportunity and maybe even an obligation 
 to maintain the humanity and tell some amazing stories as we explore and collaborate together  thanks a lot
