  i 'm going to talk a little bit about where technology 's going  and
 often technology comes to us  we 're surprised by what it brings  but there 's actually a large aspect of technology that 's much more predictable
  that 's because technological systems of all sorts have leanings they have urgencies they have tendencies and those tendencies are derived from the very
 nature of the physics  chemistry of wires and switches and electrons  
 and they will make reoccurring patterns again and again and so those patterns produce these these tendencies these leanings you can almost
  think of it as sort of like gravity  imagine raindrops falling into a valley  the actual path of a raindrop as it goes down the valley is unpredictable  
 we cannot see where it 's going but the general direction is very inevitable  it 's downward
 and so these
  and urgencies in technological systems give us a sense of where things are going at the large
  form  so in a large sense i would say that
 telephones were inevitable  
 but the iphone was not the internet was inevitable  but twitter was not so
 we have many ongoing tendencies right now and
 i think one of the chief among them is this tendency to make things smarter and smarter i call
 also known as artificial intelligence or ai  and i think that 's going to be one of the most influential
 developments and trends and directions and drives in our society in the next twenty years
 so of course it 's already here  we already have ai and often it works in the background in the back offices of hospitals where it 's used to diagnose
 x rays better than a human doctor it 's in legal offices where it 's used to go through legal evidence better than a human paralawyer it
 's used to fly the plane that you came here with 
 human pilots only flew it seven to eight minutes the rest of the time the ai was driving and of course in netflix
  and amazon it 's in the background making those recommendations that 's what we have today  and we have an example of course in
 a more front facing aspect of it with the
 win of the alphago who beat the world 's greatest go champion  but
 it 's more than that if you play a video game you 're playing against an ai but recently google taught
  their ai to actually learn how to play video games again teaching video games was was already done but learning how to play a video game
 is another step  that 's artificial smartness
 what we 're doing is is taking this artificial smartness and we 're making it smarter and smarter 
 there are three
  aspects to this general trend that i think are underappreciated  i think we would understand ai a lot better if we understood these three things  i think these things also 
 would help us embrace ai because it 's only by embracing it that we actually can steer it 
  very poor understanding of what intelligence is 
 we tend to think of intelligence as a single dimension  that it 's kind of like a note that gets louder and louder  it starts like with 
  starts with maybe a simple low iq in a rat or mouse and maybe there 's more in a chimpanzee  
 and then maybe there 's more in a stupid person and then maybe an average person like myself and then maybe a genius and this
  intelligence is getting greater and greater that 's completely wrong that 's not what intelligence is not what human intelligence is anyway  it 's much more
 like a symphony of different notes and each of these notes is played on a different
 instrument of cognition there are many types of intelligences in our own minds  we have
 deductive reasoning we have emotional intelligence we have spatial intelligence we have maybe one hundred
  different types that are all grouped together  and they vary in different strengths with different people and of course  if we go to animals  they also have another 
  basket another symphony of different kinds of intelligences and sometimes those same instruments are the same that we have they can think in the same way  but they may have a different arrangement and maybe they 're higher in some cases than humans like long term memory in a squirrel is actually
  phenomenal so it can remember where it buried its nuts  but in other cases they may be lower when we go 
 to make machines we 're going to engineer them in the same way where we 'll make
 some of those types of smartness much greater than ours  and many of them won 't be anywhere near ours because they 're not needed  so
  we 're going to make them very very specific  so your calculator is smarter than you are
 in arithmetic already your gps is smarter than you are in spatial navigation  google
  we 're going to take again these kinds of different types of thinking and we 'll put them into like a car the reason why we want to put them in a car so the car drives is because it 's not driving like a human 
 it 's not thinking like us that 's the whole feature of it it 's not being distracted  it 's not worrying about whether it left the stove on or whether it should have majored in
  and we actually might even come to advertise these as 
 they 're without consciousness they 're not concerned about those things they 're not distracted  so
 in general what we 're trying to do is make as many different types of thinking as we can we
 're going to populate the space of all the different possible types or species of thinking and there
  may be some problems that are so difficult in business and science that our own type of human thinking may not be able to solve them alone we may need a  two step program which is to invent
 new kinds of thinking that we can work alongside of to solve these really large problems say like dark energy or
  what we 're doing is making alien intelligences you might even think of this as sort of 
 artificial aliens in some senses  and they 're going to help us think different because thinking different is the engine of creation and wealth and new new economy 
 the second aspect of this is is that we are going to use ai to basically make a second industrial revolution  
 the first industrial
  revolution was based on the fact that
 we invented something i would call artificial power
 previous to that during the agricultural revolution  everything that was made had to be made with human muscle or animal power 
 that was the only way to get anything done
 the great innovation during the industrial revolution was we harnessed
  fossil fuels to make
 this artificial power that we could
 use to do anything we wanted to do so today when you drive down the highway  
 you are with a flick of the switch commanding two hundred and fifty horses two hundred and fifty horsepower which we can use to build skyscrapers to build cities to 
  build roads to make factories that would churn out lines of chairs or or refrigerators way beyond our own power
  that artificial power
 can also be distributed on wires on a grid to every home factory  farmstead and anybody could buy
 that
 artificial power just by plugging something in so this was a source of innovation as well because a farmer could take a
 manual hand pump  and they could add this artificial power this electricity and he 'd have an electric pump
 and you multiply that by thousands or tens of thousands of times  and that formula was what brought us the industrial revolution all the things that we see all this progress that we now enjoy 
 has come from the fact that we 've done that we 're going to do the same thing now with ai we 're going to distribute that on a grid  and now you can take that electric pump  
  million times is going to be this second industrial revolution so now the car is going down the highway it 's two hundred and fifty horsepower but in addition it 's two hundred and fifty minds  that 
  's the auto driven car  it 's like a new commodity it 's a new utility the ai is going to flow across the grid the cloud in the same way electricity did so everything that we had electrified  we 're now going to
  the formula for the next ten thousand 
 is very very simple which is to take x and add ai  that is the formula that 's what we 're going to be doing and that is the
 way in which we 're going to make this second industrial revolution and by the way right now this minute you can log on to google and you can purchase ai
 for six cents one hundred hits that
  available right now so the third aspect of this
 is that when we take this ai and embody it we get robots  and robots are going to be bots they 're going to be doing many of the tasks that we have already done 
 a job is just a bunch of tasks  so they 're going to redefine our jobs because they 're going to do some of those
  but they 're also going to create whole new categories a whole new slew of tasks that we didn 't know we wanted to do before 
 they 're going to actually engender new kinds of jobs new kinds of tasks that we want done just as automation
 made up a whole bunch of new things that we didn 't know we needed before and now we can can 't live without them so they 're going to produce even more jobs than they take away 
 but it 's important that a lot of the tasks that
  that can be defined in terms of efficiency or productivity if you can specify a task either manual or
 conceptual that can be specified in terms of efficiency or productivity  that goes to the bots  productivity is for robots what we 're really good at is basically
  we 're really good at things that are inefficient  
 science is inherently inefficient  it runs on that fact that you have one failure after another it runs on the fact that you make tests and experiments that don 't work otherwise you 
  're not learning  it runs on the fact that there is not a lot of efficiency in it innovation by definition is inefficient because you make prototypes because you try stuff that fails that doesn 't
  art is not efficient  human relationships are not efficient  these are all the kinds of things we 're going to gravitate to because they 're not efficient  efficiency is for robots
   we 're also going to learn that we 're going to work with these ais because they think differently than us when deep blue beat the world 's best
  people thought it was the end of chess but actually it turns out that today  the best chess champion in the world is not an ai and it
 's not a human it 's the team of a human and an ai  the best medical diagnostician is not a
 doctor it 's not an ai it 's the team  we 're going to be working with these ais and i think you 'll be paid in the future by how well you work with these
  going to be something we work with rather than against we 're working with these rather than against them so the future where does that take us i think that
 twenty five years from now they 'll look back  and look at our understanding of ai and say you didn 't have ai in fact you didn 't even have the internet yet  compared to what we 're going to have twenty five years from now
  are no ai experts right now there 's a lot of money going to it there are billions of dollars being spent on it it 's
 a huge business  but
 there are no experts compared to what we 'll know twenty years from now
  so we are just at the beginning of the beginning we 're in the first hour of all this we 're in the first hour
  in the first hour of what 's coming the most popular ai product
 in twenty years from now  that everybody uses  has not been invented yet  
 that means that you 're not late  thank you
