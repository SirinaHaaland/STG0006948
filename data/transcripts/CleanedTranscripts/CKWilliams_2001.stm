  i thought i would read poems i have that relate to the subject of youth and age i was
 sort of astonished to find out how many i have actually the first one is dedicated to spencer
 and his grandmother who was shocked by his work my poem is
  called dirt 
 my grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap  
 half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar 
 all because of a word i said not even said really only repeated but
  i know now her life was hard she lost three children as babies then her husband died too leaving young sons and no money 
 she 'd stand me in the sink to pee because there was never room in the toilet but oh her soap might its bitter burning have been what made me a poet 
 the street she lived on was unpaved
  her flat two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen where she stalked and caught me  
 dare i admit that after she did it i never really loved her again she lived to a hundred even then 
 all along it was the sadness the squalor but i never until now loved her again
  when that was published in a magazine i got an irate letter from my uncle 
 you have maligned a great woman it took some
 diplomacy  this is called the dress it 's a longer poem 
 in those days those days
  which exist for me only as the most elusive memory now  
 when often the first sound you 'd hear in the morning would be a storm of birdsong then the soft clop of the hooves of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block 
 and the last sound at night as likely as not would be your father pulling up in his car having worked late again  always late and going
  heavily down to the cellar to the furnace to shake out the ashes and damp the draft before he came upstairs to fall into bed
 in those long ago days women my mother  my friends ' mothers our neighbors all the women i knew wore often much of the day what were called housedresses
  shapeless light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown and when you had to go look for a child hang wash on the line or run down 
  to the grocery store on the corner under a coat  the twisted hem of the nightgown always lank and yellowed dangling beneath 
  their hair in preparation for some great event a ball one would think that never came to pass 
 more than the way most women 's faces not only were never made up during the day but seemed scraped  bleached and with their plucked eyebrows scarily masklike 
 more than all that it was those dresses that made women so unknowable and forbidding
 adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access  and boys no conception 
 only later would i see the dresses also as a proclamation that 
 in your dim kitchen your laundry your bleak concrete yard what you revealed of yourself was a fabulation your real sensual nature
  veiled in those sexless vestments was utterly your dominion 
 in those days one hid much else as well grown men didn 't embrace one another  unless someone had died and not always then you shook hands or at a ball game thumped your friend 's back
  and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection 
 once out of childhood you 'd never again know the shock of your father 's whiskers on your cheek not until mores at last had evolved  and 
  you could hug another man  then hold on for a moment  then even kiss 
 how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you by then 
 we knew so little in those days as little as now i suppose about healing those hurts
  their best dresses with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices even in lipstick and mascara their hair aflow could only stand wringing 
  their hands begging for peace  while father and son like thugs like thieves like romans  simmered and hissed and hated  
  through the kiss and embrace  bleeding from brother to brother into the generations 
 in those days there was still countryside close to the city  farms  cornfields cows even not far from our building with its 
  blurred brick and long shadowy hallway you could find tracts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests 
 empty lot into the bushes like a creature of leaves you 'd lurk  crouched crawling  simplified savage alone 
 already there was wanting to be simpler wanting when they called you never to go back
  this is another longish one about the old and the young  it actually happened right at the time we met part of the poem takes place
 in space we shared and time we shared it 's called the neighbor
  her five horrid  deformed little dogs who incessantly yap on the roof under my window  
 her cats  god knows how many who must piss on her rugs her landing 's a sickening reek  
 her shadow once fumbling the chain on her door then the door slamming fearfully
  only the barking and the music jazz filtering as it does day and night into the hall  
 the time it was chris connor singing lush life 
 how it brought back my college sweetheart my first real love  who till i left her played the same record and head on my
  shoulder hand on my thigh  sang sweetly along of regrets and depletions she was too
  young for as i was too young later to believe in her pain it startled then bored then repelled me 
 my starting to fancy she 'd ended up in this fire trap in the village that my neighbor was her  my thinking we 'd meet  recognize one another  become friends that i 'd accomplish a penance  
 my seeing her
 it wasn 't her 
 at the mailbox gray yellow hair army pants under a nightgown her turning away  hiding her ravaged face in her hands muttering an inappropriate hi 
 sometimes there are frightening goings on in the stairwell a man shouting
  the dogs frantically snarling claws scrabbling  then her her voice hoarse  harsh hollow  almost only a tone  incoherent 
  a note  a squawk  bone on metal metal gone molten calling them back come back darlings  come back dear ones my sweet angels come back 
  on the sidewalk ragged coat hanging agape  passersby flowing around her her mouth torn suddenly open as though in a scream 
  silently though as though only in her brain or breast had it erupted  a cry so pure  practiced  detached it had no need of a voice or could no longer bear one
 these invisible links that allure  these transfigurations  even of anguish that hold us  the girl my old love 
  the last lost time i saw her when she came to find me at a party  her drunkenly stumbling falling sprawling skirt hiked eyes
  veined red swollen with tears her shame  her dishonor 
 my ignorant arrogant coarseness my secret pride  my turning away  
 still life on a rooftop dead trees in barrels a bench broken dogs excrement sky  what pathways through pain what junctures of
  what crossings and counterings too many lives in our lives already too many chances for sorrow too many
  pasts behold me the god of frenzied inexhaustible love says  rising in bloody splendor behold me 
 her making her way down the littered vestibule stairs one agonized step at a time my holding the door
 her crossing the fragmented tiles  faltering at the step to the street droning not looking at me can you help me 
 taking my arm  leaning lightly against me  
 her wavering step into the world her whispering
  wouldn 't it be nice i think  when the
  in the doctor 's waiting room bends over the magazine table and farts just a little and violently blushes 
 wouldn 't it be nice if intestinal gas came embodied in visible clouds so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop had only barely grazed my face before
  for this to have happened now is a nice coincidence because not an hour ago while we were on our walk my dog was startled by a backfire and jumped straight up like a horse bucking 
 and that brought back to me the stable i worked on weekends when i was twelve and a splendid piebald stallion who whenever he was mounted would buck just like
  though more hugely of course enormous gleaming  resplendent  and the woman her face abashedly buried in her elle now  reminded me 
  i 'd forgotten that not the least part of my awe consisted of the fact that with every jump he took the horse would powerfully fart  phwap  phwap  phwap  
  the steely glinting hooves the eruptions driven from the creature 's mighty innards 
 breath stopped  heart stopped  nostrils madly flared 
 i didn 't know if i wanted to break him  
  most of my poems actually are urban poems i happen to be reading a bunch that aren 't 
 thirst here was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter day and night on a bench in the
  station until finally one day she vanished 
 we regarded each other 
 scrutinized one another me shyly obliquely trying not to be furtive she boldly  unblinkingly even pugnaciously pugnaciously 
  wrathfully even when her bottle was empty 
  some repressed part of myself would go out of control and i 'd be forever entrapped in the shocking seethe of her stench 
 not excrement merely not merely surface and orifice going unwashed rediffusion of rum there was will in it and intention power and
  ethical rage and rebellion
 despair too though grief loss  
 sometimes i 'd think i should take her home with me  bathe her  comfort her dress her she wouldn 't have wanted me to i would think  
 instead i 'd step into my train how rich i would think is the lexicon of our 
 how enduring our bland fatal assurance that reflection
 is righteousness being accomplished  
 the dance of our glances  the clash pulling each other through our perceptual punctures  then holocaust holocaust host on host 
 of ill injured presences  squandered consumed  
  absolute faithful attendance  the dance of our glances
  a brand new poem  the title is this happened a student  a young woman
 in a fourth floor hallway of her lycee perched on the ledge of an open window chatting with friends between classes  
 a teacher passes and chides her be careful you might
  and the young woman  eighteen a girl really though she wouldn 't think that as brilliant as she is first in her class and beautiful too she 's often told  smiles back 
 and leans into the open window which wouldn 't even be open if it were winter if it were winter someone would have closed it
  still smiling  farther and farther though it takes less time than this really an instant and lets herself fall 
 herself fall  
 a casual impulse a fancy never thought of until now hardly thought of even now no more than impulse or fancy  the girl knows what she 's doing the girl
  means something the girl means to mean because it occurs to her in that instant that beautiful or not bright yes or no  she 's not who 
  she is  she 's not the person she is  and the reason she suddenly knows 
  is  it 's not her or not wholly her  it 's a self inhabited lived in by her 
 and seemingly even as she thinks it she knows what 's been missing grace  not premeditation but grace  a kind of being in the world spontaneously with grace
  weightfully upon me was the world  
 weightfully this self which graced the world yet never wholly itself  
 weightfully this self which weighed upon me the release from which is what i desire and what i achieve  
 and the girl remembers in this infinite instant already now so many times divided
  the sadness she felt once hardly knowing she felt it 
 to merely inhabit herself yes  the girl falls absurd to fall  even the earth with its compulsion to take unto itself all that 
  falls must know that falling is absurd yet the girl falling isn 't myself or she is myself but a self i took of my own volition unto
  read just one more i don 't usually say that i like to just end but i 'm afraid that ricky will come out here and shake his fist at me 
  says the advertisement for a soft core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand 
 but forget her breasts a lush fresh lipped blond skin glowing gold sprawls there resplendent  
 sixty nearly  yet these hardly tangible hardly better than harlots can still stir me
 maybe a coming of age in the american sensual darkness never seeing an unsmudged nipple an uncensored vagina has 
  left me forever infected with an unquenchable lust of the eye  always that erotic murmur i 'm hardly myself if i 'm not in a state of incipient desire  
  are worse twists your obsessions can take last year in israel  a young ultra orthodox rabbi guiding some teenage girls through the shrine of 
  the shoah forbade them to look in one room because there were images in it he said were licentious  
  too frightened to bother lined up in snow waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch  
 the girls to my horror  averted their gaze what carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them 
 even that though another confession once in a book
  an absolute angel with tormented tormenting eyes i kept finding myself at her page that she died in the camps made her
 i didn 't dare wonder why more present more precious 
 died in the camps 
 that too people or jews anyway kept from their children back then but it was like sex you didn 't have to
  be told  sex and death how close they can seem 
 so constantly conscious now of death moving towards me  sometimes i think i confound them  
 my wife 's loveliness almost consumes me  my passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds when we make love
  her holding me everywhere all around me i 'm there and not there my mind teems  jumbles of faces voices impressions 
 i live my life over as though i were drowning  
 then i am drowning 
 in despair at having to leave her  this everything all unbearable awful 
  to be able to die with no special contrition not having been slaughtered or enslaved and not having to know history 's next mad rage or regression 
 it might be a relief 
 no again no 
 i don 't mean that for a moment  what i mean is the world holds me so tightly the good and the bad my own follies and weakness that even this counterfeit venus with her sham
  heat and her bosom probably plumped with gel so moves me my breath catches  
 vamp  siren seductress how much more she reveals in her glare of ink than she knows 
 how she incarnates our desperate human need for regard
  our passion to live in beauty to be beauty to be cherished by glances if by no more 
 of something like love  
 or love
