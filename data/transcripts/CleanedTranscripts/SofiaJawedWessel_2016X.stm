  we 're going to share a lot of secrets today you and i and in doing so i hope that we can lift some of the shame many of us feel about sex 
 how many here have ever been
  for me the time i remember best is when that stranger was a student of mine he came up to me after class that night
 and his words confirmed what i already knew i am so sorry professor  if i had known it was you  i would never have said those things 
  a person to him until i was his professor  
 this concept called objectification 
 is the foundation of sexism  and we see it reinforced through every aspect of our lives  
 we see it in the government that refuses to
 punish men for raping women  we see it in advertisements how many of you have seen an advertisement that
 uses a woman 's breast to sell an entirely unrelated product  or
 movie after movie after movie that portrays women as only love interests 
 these examples might seem inconsequential and harmless but they 're insidious  slowly building into a culture that refuses to see women as people 
 we see this in the
  that sends home
 a  10 year old girl because her clothes were a distraction to boys trying to learn
  or the government that refuses to punish men for raping women
 over and over 
 or the woman who is killed because she asked a man to stop grinding on her on the dance floor  
 media plays a large role in perpetuating
 the objectification of women 
 let 's consider the classic romantic comedy we 're typically introduced to two kinds of women in these movies 
 two kinds of desirable women anyway
  the first is the sexy bombshell  this is the unbelievably gorgeous woman with the perfect body our leading man has no trouble identifying her and even less trouble having sex with her 
  second is our leading lady the beautiful but demure woman our leading man falls in love with
 despite not noticing her at first or not liking her if he did  
 the first is the slut  she is to be consumed and forgotten  she is much too available  
 the second is desirable but modest and therefore worthy of our leading man 's future babies  marriage material
  we 're actually told that women have two roles but these two roles have a difficult time existing within the same woman 
 on the rare occasion that i share with a new acquaintance that i study sex if they don 't end the conversation right then they 're usually pretty intrigued
  in studying the sexual behaviors of pregnant and postpartum couples at this point i get a different kind of response 
 oh huh do pregnant people even have sex have you thought about
 studying sexual desire
 or orgasms
  tell me what are the first words that come to mind when you picture a pregnant woman 
 i asked this question in a survey of over five hundred adults and most responded with belly or round and 
 cute this didn 't surprise me too much what else do we label as cute
  when we label an adult as cute though  we take away a lot of their intelligence their complexity  
 we reduce them to childlike qualities  
 i also asked heterosexual men to imagine a woman that they 're partnered with is pregnant  
 and then asked women to imagine that they are pregnant and then tell me the first words that come to mind when they imagine having sex
 most of the responses were negative
  from sexuality  we are removing 
 the constraints of sexual objectification they experience less sexism right 
 not exactly what happens instead is a different kind of objectification 
 in my efforts to explain this to others one conversation led to the venus of
  a paleolithic figurine scholars assumed was a goddess of love and beauty hence the name venus 
 this theory was later revised though when scholars noted the sculptor 's obvious focus
 on the figurine 's reproductive features large breasts considered ideal for nursing 
 a round possibly pregnant belly  the remnants of red dye alluding to menstruation or birth 
 they also assumed that she was meant to be held or placed
  lying down because her tiny feet don 't allow her to be freestanding  she also had no face
 for this reason it was assumed that she was a representation of fertility and not a
 a portrait of a person she was an object 
 in the history of her interpretation she went from object of ideal beauty and love to object of reproduction  
 i think this
  transition speaks more about the scholars who have interpreted her purpose than
 the actual purpose of the figurine herself  
 when a woman becomes pregnant  
 she leaves the realm realm of men 's sexual desire and slides into her reproductive and child rearing role 
 in doing so  she also becomes the property of the community
 considered very important but only because she 's pregnant right 
 i 've taken to calling this the willendorf effect and once again we see it reinforced in many aspects of her life 
 has anyone here ever been visibly pregnant yeah lots of you 
 right so how many of you ever had a stranger touch your belly during
  maybe without even asking your permission first or told what you can and cannot eat
 by somebody who is not your doctor your medical care provider  or asked private questions about your birth plan  
 and then told why those choices are all wrong yeah 
 me too or had a server refuse to bring bring you a glass of wine  this one might give you
 i know but stay with me  this is a huge secret it is actually safe to drink in moderation during pregnancy 
 many of us don 't know this because doctors don 't trust pregnant women with this secret 
 especially if she 's less educated or a woman of color what this tells us is
  when the government reminds women with every new anti choice bill that the contents of her uterus are not her own or when
 while it 's safe to have sex during pregnancy sometimes you never know  better safe than sorry right she 's denied basic
 privacy and bodily autonomy under the guise of be a good
  mother we don 't trust her to make her own decisions she 's cute  remember
 when we tell women that sexual pleasure
 excuse me when we tell women that sex isn 't worth the risk during pregnancy what we 're telling her is that her sexual pleasure doesn 't matter  
 so what we are telling her is that she
  in fact doesn 't matter even though the needs of her her fetus are not at odds with her own needs so
 medical providers  such as the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists have the opportunity to educate about
 the safety of sex during pregnancy  so what do the experts say  acog actually has no public official statement about
 the the safety of sex during pregnancy
  guidance from the mayo clinic is generally positive
 but presented with a caveat 
 although most women can safely have sex throughout pregnancy  sometimes it 's best to be cautious some women don 't want to have sex during pregnancy  and that 's ok  some women do want to have sex during pregnancy  and that 's ok too
  needs to stop is society telling women what they can and cannot do with their bodies 
 pregnant women are not
 faceless identity less vessels of reproduction who can 't stand on their own two feet 
 but the truth is the real secret is we tell all women that their sexual pleasure doesn 't matter  we refuse to even acknowledge that women
  who have sex with women or women who don 't want children even exist oh it 's just a phase she just needs the right man to come along 
 every time a woman has sex
 simply because it feels good it is revolutionary  she is revolutionary  she is pushing back against society 's insistence that she exist simply for men 's pleasure or for reproduction
  a woman who prioritizes her sexual needs is scary 
 because a woman who prioritizes her sexual needs prioritizes herself 
 that is a woman demanding that she be treated as an equal that is a woman who insists that you make
  at the table of power  and that is the most terrifying of all because we can 't make room for her without some of us giving up the extra space we hold 
 i have one last secret for you  i am the mother of two boys and we could use your help
  hear me say regularly that it 's important for men to recognize women as equals
 and they see their father modeling this we need what happens in the world to reinforce what happens in our home  
 this is not a men 's problem or a women 's problem  this is everyone 's problem and we all play a role in dismantling systems of inequality 
 for starters we have got to stop telling women what they can and cannot do with their bodies
 this includes not treating pregnant women like community property if you don 't know her don 't even ask to touch her belly 
 you wouldn 't anybody else don 't tell her what she can and cannot eat don 't ask her private details about her medical decisions  this also includes understanding that even if you are personally against abortion you can still
  fight for a woman 's right to choose when it comes to women 's equality the two need not oppose one another  
 if you 're somebody who has sex with women prioritize her pleasure if you don 't know how ask 
 if you have children 
 have conversations about sex as
  in the dictionary anymore they look it up on the internet
 and when you 're having those conversations about sex 
 don 't center them on reproduction only people have sex for many reasons some because they want a baby but most of us have sex because it feels good admit it 
 and regardless of whether you have children or not support comprehensive sex education that doesn 't shame our teenagers
 applause nothing positive comes from shaming teens for their sexual desires behaviors  
 other than positive std and pregnancy tests 
 every single day we are all given the opportunity to disrupt patterns of inequality
  think we can all agree that it 's worth the trouble to do so  thank you
