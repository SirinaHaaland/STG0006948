  when i was only three or four  i fell in love with poetry 
 with the rhythms and the music of language with the power of metaphor and of imagery 
 poetry being the essence of communication the discipline the distillation
 and all these years later the poems i 'll read today are from my just finished seventh book of poetry well 
 five years ago i was diagnosed with parkinson 's disease 
 though there 's no cure yet  advances in treatment are really impressive 
 but you can imagine that i was appalled to learn that women
 are largely left out of research trials
  despite  gender specific medical findings having demonstrated that we are not actually just small men 
 who happen to have different reproductive systems
 gender specific medicine is good for men too but you bring to a crisis the person you already are 
 including the yes momentum that you 've learned to invoke through passionate
  caring and through action both of which require but also create
 energy  so as an activist i began working with the parkinson 's disease foundation that
 to create a major initiative to put women on the parkinson 's disease
  and as a poet  i began working with this subject matter  finding it tragic  
 hilarious  sometimes even joyful i do not feel diminished by parkinson 's i feel
 distilled by it and i actually very much like the woman
 i 'm distilling into 
 no signs of struggle growing small requires enormity of will just sitting still in
  the doctor 's waiting room watching the future shuffle in and out 
 watching it stoop stare at you while you try not to look  
 rare is an exchange a smile of brief wry recognition you
 are the new kid on the block  everyone here was you once
  you are still learning that growing small requires a largeness of spirit you can 't fit into yet  
 acceptance of irritating help from those who love you 
 giving way and over but not up 
 you 've swallowed hard the contents of the drink me bottle and felt yourself shrink now familiar furniture looms  floors
  and doorknobs yield only when wrestled round with both hands it demands colossal patience all this growing small 
 your diminished sleep at night your handwriting your voice your height 
 you are more the incredible shrinking woman
 than the buddhist mystic serene making do with less less is not always
  yet in this emptying space space glimmers 
 becoming visible here is a place behind the eyes of those accustomed by what some
 would call diminishment 
 it is a place of merciless poetry 
 a gift of presence previously ignored drowned in the daily clutter 
 here every gesture needs intention is alive with consciousness
 nothing is automatic 
 you can spot it in the provocation of a button 
 an arm poking at a sleeve a balancing act at a night time curb while negotiating the dark  
 feats of such modest valor who would suspect them to be exercises in an intimate
  a metaphysics of being relentlessly aware 
 such understated power here 
 in these tottering dancers who exert stupendous effort on tasks most view as insignificant 
 such quiet beauty here in these
  there is immensity required in growing small so bent on such unbending grace
  reassuring religious people already a universal donor  kidneys corneas liver lungs tissue heart veins whatever 
 odd that the modest brain never imagined its unique value in research 
 maybe saving someone else from what it is they 're not quite sure i have 
 flattering that so fill in the forms  drill through the answers
  out a blithe spirit and slice me  dice me  spread me on your slides  
 find what i 'm trying to tell you 
 earn me  learn me  scan me  
 squint through your lens  uncover what i 'd hint at if i could 
 be my guest do your best harvest me  track the clues this was a good brain while alive this was a brain that paid
  its dues so slice me  dice me  smear me on your slides  stain me explain me  drain me like a cup  
 share me  hear me  i want to be used i want to be used i want to be used up
  lit from within
 is the sole secure way to traverse dark matter  
 some life forms certain mushrooms  snails jellyfish worms glow bioluminescent  and
  light from our most lucent selves our tragedy is we can 't see it we see by reflecting
 to show our true colors 
 external illumination can distort though when gravity bends light  huge galaxy clusters can act as
  background images of star systems to faint arcs
 a lensing effect like viewing distant street lamps through a glass of wine 
 a glass of wine or two now makes me weave as if acting the drunkard 's part as if besotted with unrequited love
 for the dynamic turner canvasses spied out by the
  i could lurch down a city street set without provoking every pedestrian walk on stare 
 stare as long as you need to if you think about it  walking even standing is illogical
 such tiny things feet 
 especially when one 's body is not al dente anymore
  and excess i 've always thought apollo beautiful but boring and a bit of a dumb blonde
 dionysians don 't do balance 
 balance in other words  has never been my strong point 
 but i digress more and more these days digression seems the most direct route through from where i 've lost or found myself out of place mind turn
  time 
 place your foot just so mind how you turn too swift a swivel can bring you down 
 take your time ushering the audience out saying goodbye to the actors 
 the ghost light is what they call the single bulb hanging above the
 bare stage in an empty theater 
 in the empty theater of such a night  waking to meet no external radiance 
 this is the final struggle left to win this the sole beacon to beckon the darkness in and let the rest begin 
 this the lens through which at last to see both self and other
 arrayed with the bright stain of original sin lit from within
 is the last one 
 this dark hour 
 late summer four a m 
 the rain slows to a stop  dripping still from the broad leaves of blue hostas unseen in the garden 's
 barefoot  careful on the slick slate slabs i need no light i know the way 
 stoop by the mint bed scoop a fistful of moist earth  
 then grope for a chair  spread a shawl and sit  breathing in the wet green
  this is the small still hour
 before the newspaper lands in the vestibule like a grenade the phone  shrills the computer screen blinks and glares awake 
 there is this hour  poem in my head soil in my hand unnamable fullness 
 this hour when
 blood of my blood bone of bone child grown to manhood now
 stranger  intimate  not distant but apart
 lies safe off dreaming melodies
 while love sleeps  safe  in his arms 
 to have come to this place  lived to this moment  immeasurable lightness 
 the density of black starts to blur
  tentative a cardinal 's coloratura  then the mourning dove 's elegy  
 sable glimmers toward grey  objects emerge trailing shadows night ages toward day 
 the city stirs  
 there will be other dawns  nights  gaudy noons 
  lose my way there will be stumbling falling cursing the dark  whatever comes  there was this hour
 when nothing mattered all was unbearably dear  
 and when i 'm done with daylights  should those who loved me grieve
 too long a while let them remember that i had this hour
 this dark
 and smile
