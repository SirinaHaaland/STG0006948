  i study ants  and that 's because i like to think about how organizations work 
 and in particular  how the simple parts of organizations
 interact to create the behavior of the whole organization
  so ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that and there are many others  the web is one there are many biological systems like that
 brains cells developing embryos 
 there are about ten thousand species of ants 
 they all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers
  and all ant colonies have in common that there 's no central control nobody tells anybody what to do 
 the queen just lays the eggs  
 there 's no management no ant directs the behavior of any other ant and i try to figure out how that works  
 and i 've been working for the past twenty years
  on a population of seed eating ants in southeastern arizona here 's my study site this is really a picture of ants and the
 rabbit just happens to be there and these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds this is the
 nest of the mature colony and there 's the nest entrance  and they forage maybe for about twenty meters away  gather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest and store them and every year i go there and make a map of my study site this is just a road  and it 's not very big
  hundred and fifty meters on one side four hundred on the other  and every colony has a name which is a number which is painted on a rock  
 and i go there every year and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before 
 and figure out which ones have died and put all the new ones on the map  and by doing this i know how old they all are and because of that i 've been able to study how their behavior changes
 as the colony gets older and larger  so i want to tell you about the life
  cycle of a colony
 ants never make more ants colonies make more colonies  and they do that by each year sending out the reproductives those are the ones with wings on a mating flight 
  so every year on the same day and it 's a mystery exactly how that happens
  and they mate and this shows
 a recently virgin queen here 's her wings and she 's in the process
 of mating with this male  
 and there 's another male on top waiting his turn often the queens mate more than once and after that the males all die that 's it for them
  the newly mated queens fly off somewhere drop their wings  
 dig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs  and they will live for fifteen or twenty years  
 continuing to lay eggs using the sperm from that original mating 
 so the queen goes down in there  she lays eggs she feeds the larvae so an ant starts as an egg  then it 's a larva  she feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves
 then as soon as the ants the first group of ants emerge they 're larvae then they 're pupae then they come out as adult ants  they go out they get the food they dig the nest and the queen never comes out again  
 so this is a one year old colony this happens to be five hundred and thirty six there 's the nest entrance there 's a pencil for scale  so this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer  
  's the nest entrance there 's a pencil for scale  they make a midden a pile of refuse
 mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat 
 this is a five year old colony this is the nest entrance  here 's a pencil for scale  this is about as big as they get about a meter across  
 and then this is how colony size and numbers of worker
  so this is about ten thousand worker ants changes as a function of colony age in years  
 so it starts out with zero ants just the founding queen  
 and it grows to a size of about ten or twelve thousand ants when the colony is five  
 and it stays that size until the queen dies and there 's nobody to make more ants when she 's about fifteen or twenty years old 
 and it 's when they reach this stable size  in numbers of ants that
 they start to reproduce that is to send more winged
 queens and males to that year 's mating flight  and i know how colony size changes as a function of colony age
 because
 i 've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants so
 that 's not the most fun part of this research  although it 's interesting
  question that i think about with these ants is what i call task allocation 
 that 's not just how is the colony organized but how does it change what it 's doing 
 how is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change so things happen to an ant colony 
  when it rains in the summer  it floods in the desert  there 's a lot of damage to the nest and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess 
 when extra food becomes available and this is what everybody knows about picnics then extra ants are allocated to collect the food 
 so with nobody telling anybody what to do how is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task and that 's the process that i call task allocation 
  and in harvester ants i divide the tasks of the ants i see just outside the nest into these four categories  where an ant is foraging when it 's out along the foraging trail  searching 
  for food or bringing food back  the patrollers that 's supposed to be a magnifying glass are an interesting group that go out early in the morning before the foragers are active  they somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go and by coming back
  just by making it back they tell the foragers that it 's safe to go out 
 then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest and i wanted to say that the nests look a lot like bill lishman 's house that is that there are chambers 
  inside they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil and it dries to a kind of an adobe like surface in it 
  inside the nest and then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles so you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand put it down turn around and go back in 
 and finally the midden workers
 put some kind of
 territorial chemical in the garbage so what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse on one day it 'll all be here and then the next day they 'll move it over there and then they 'll move it back 
  that 's what the midden workers do  
 and these four groups are just the ants outside the nest so that 's only about twenty five percent of the colony and they 're the oldest ants so an ant 
  starts out somewhere near the queen and when we dig up nests we find they 're about as deep as the colony is wide so about a meter deep
  where we often find the queen after eight hours of hacking away at the rock with pickaxes  i don 't think that chamber has evolved because of
 me and my backhoe and my crew of students with pickaxes but instead because when there 's flooding occasionally
 the colony has to go down deep so there 's this whole network of chambers the queen 's in there somewhere  she just lays
  there 's the larvae and they consume most of the food and this is true of most ants that the ants you see walking around
 don 't do much eating they bring it back and feed it to the larvae when the foragers come in with food  they just drop it into the upper chamber and other ants come
 up from below get the food bring it back husk the seeds and pile them up there are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest and
  it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing  so despite what it says in the bible about you know look to the ant thou sluggard in fact  
 you could think of those ants as reserves that is to say if something happened and i 've never seen anything like this happen but i 've only been looking for twenty years if something happened  they might all come out if they were needed 
  in fact mostly they 're just hanging around in there and i think it 's a very interesting question what is there about the way the colony is organized that might give
 some function to a reserve of ants who
 are doing nothing and they sort of
 stand as a as a buffer in between the ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside and if you mark ants
 that are working outside  and dig up a colony you never see them deep down so what 's happening is that the ants work
  inside the nest when they 're younger  they somehow get into this reserve and then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce and once they belong to the ants that work outside  they never go back down 
 now ants most ants including these don 't see very well they have eyes they can distinguish between light and dark  but they mostly work by
  so just to reinforce
 that what you might have thought about ant queens isn 't true
 you know even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do 
 there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest  
 so that 's one way that we know the queen isn 't directing the behavior of the colony
  so when i first set out to work on task allocation my first question was 
 what 's the relationship between the ants doing different tasks does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing does it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing 
 and i was working
 in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant was somehow dedicated to its task from birth and sort of performed
 independently of the others knowing its place on the assembly line and instead i wanted to ask how are the different task groups interdependent 
 so i did experiments where i changed one thing so for example  i created more work for the nest maintenance workers by putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance early in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active  
 this is what it looks like about twenty minutes later
  about forty minutes later and the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there 
 and what i wanted to know was ok here 's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks then we
 repeated all those experiments with the ants marked so here 's some blue nest maintenance workers  and lately we 've gotten more sophisticated
  we have this three color system and we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which we started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little japanese markers and
  they work really well  and so just to summarize the result well it turns out that yes the different tasks are interdependent so if i change the numbers performing one task 
 then i see fewer ants out foraging and this was true for all the pair wise combinations of tasks  
 and the second result  which was surprising to a lot of people was that ants actually switch tasks the same ant doesn 't do the same task over and over its whole life  so for example if i put out extra food
  everybody else the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food they become foragers the nest maintenance workers become foragers the patrollers
  become foragers 
 but not every transition is possible  and this shows how it works like i just said if there is more food to collect the patrollers the midden workers the nest maintenance workers will all change to forage 
 if there 's more patrolling to do so i created a disturbance  so extra patrollers were needed the nest maintenance workers will switch to
  but if more nest maintenance work is needed for example if i put out a bunch of toothpicks
 then nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance  they have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest  so foraging acts as
 a sink  and the ants inside the nest act as a source  
 and finally it looks like each ant is deciding moment to moment whether to be active or not so for example when there 's extra nest maintenance work to do it 's not that the foragers switch over i know
  they don 't do that but the foragers somehow decide not to come out and here was the most
 intriguing result the task allocation this process changes with colony age and it changes like this when i do these experiments with older colonies so ones that are five years or older 
 they 're much more consistent from one time to another and much more homeostatic the worse things get the more i hassle them  the more they act like undisturbed colonies whereas the young
  small colonies the two year old colonies of just two thousand ants are much more variable  and the
 amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year it
 could be this year or this year  so the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable are not any older than the ants in the younger colony it 's not due to the experience of older wiser ants  instead something about the organization must be
  changing as the colony gets older and the obvious thing that 's changing is its size so since i 've had this result  i 've spent a lot of time
 trying to figure out what kinds of decision rules very simple local probably olfactory chemical rules could an ant could be using 
  ant can assess the global situation
 that would have the outcome that i see these predictable dynamics  in who does what task  and it would change as the colony gets larger  
 and what i 've found out is that ants are using
 a network of antennal contact so anybody who 's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae  they smell with their antennae  when one ant touches another it 's smelling
  and it can tell for example whether the other ant is a nest mate because ants
 cover themselves and each other through grooming with a layer of grease which carries a colony specific odor  
 and what we 're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks  in deciding what to do  
 and so what the message is is not any
  message that they transmit from one ant to another  but the pattern the pattern itself is the message and i 'll tell you a little bit more about that 
 but first you might be wondering how is it that an ant can tell for example  
 i 'm a forager  i expect to meet another forager every so often  but if instead i start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers
  i 'm less likely to forage so it has to know the difference between
  a forager and a nest maintenance worker 
 and we 've learned that in this species and i suspect in others as well these hydrocarbons this layer of grease on the outside of ants is different 
  as ants perform different tasks  and we 've done experiments that show that that 's because the longer an ant stays outside the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface
  and they can use that  task specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons they can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow keep track of the rate at which they 're meeting ants of certain tasks  
 and we 've just recently demonstrated this
 by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate and it turns out that ants will respond
 to the right rate of contact with a glass bead with hydrocarbon
  extract on it as they would to contact with real ants  so i want now to show you
 a bit of film
 and this will start out first of all 
 showing you the nest entrance so the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance  they 've gone out to do different tasks
  the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines or influences each ant 's decision about whether to go out and which task to perform this is taken through a fiber optics microscope it 's down inside the nest
 in the beginning you see the ants just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope  but the idea is that the ants are in there 
 and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants
  past it a stream of contacts with other ants  and the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out and what it does when it comes back out
 you can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these each
  as it comes back in is contacting other ants  and the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on their next trip are contacting the ants coming in 
 so what 's interesting about this system is that it 's messy  it 's variable it 's noisy 
 and in particular  in two ways  the first is that the experience of the ant of each ant can 't be very predictable because the rate at which ants come back depends on all the little things that happen
  to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside  
 and the second thing is that an ant 's ability to assess this pattern must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting 
 so we do a lot of simulation and modeling and also experimental work to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise
 combine to in the
  aggregate produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies  again i don 't want to say that this kind of haphazard
 pattern of interactions produces
 a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork in fact if you watch ants at all you end up trying to help them because they never seem to be doing anything exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing
 it so it 's not really that
 out of these haphazard contacts
  perfection arises  but it works pretty well ants have been around for several hundred million years  they cover the earth except for antarctica  
 something that they 're doing is clearly successful enough
 that this pattern of haphazard contacts in the aggregate  produces something that allows
  ants to make a lot more ants and one of the things that we 're studying is how natural selection might be acting now to shape this
 use of interaction patterns this network of interaction patterns to
 perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies so the one
  that i want you to remember about this is that these patterns of interactions are something that you 'd expect to be closely connected to colony size  the simplest idea is that when an ant
 is in a small colony and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule like i expect to meet another forager every three seconds but in a small 
  colony  it 's likely to meet fewer foragers just because there are fewer other foragers there to meet
 so this is the kind of rule that as the colony develops and gets older and larger will produce different behavior in an old colony
 and a small young one
