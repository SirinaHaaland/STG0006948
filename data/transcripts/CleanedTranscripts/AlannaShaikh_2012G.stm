  my dad 
 my dad has alzheimer 's disease  
 he started showing the symptoms about twelve years ago  and he was officially diagnosed in two thousand and five 
 now he 's really pretty sick he needs help eating he needs help getting dressed
  dressed he doesn 't really know where he is or when it is 
 and it 's been really really hard 
 my dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life  and i 've spent the last decade watching him disappear 
 my dad 's not alone there 's about
 thirty five million people globally living with some kind of dementia  and by two thousand and thirty they 're expecting that to double
  to seventy million that 's a lot of people 
 dementia scares us the confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia  the big numbers of people who get it  
 they frighten us  and because of that fear 
 we tend to do one of two things 
 we go into denial it 's not me  it has nothing to do with me it 's never going to happen to me
  decide that we 're going to prevent dementia  and it will never happen to us because we 're going to do everything right and it won 't come and get us  
 i 'm looking for a third way  i 'm preparing to get alzheimer 's disease  
 prevention is good  and i 'm doing the things that you can do to prevent alzheimer 's  i 'm eating right  i 'm
  i 'm keeping my mind active that 's what the research says you should do but the research also shows that there 's nothing that will one hundred percent protect you 
 if the monster wants you the monster 's gonna get you 
 that 's what happened with my dad my dad was a bilingual college professor his hobbies were chess bridge and writing op eds 
 he got dementia anyway if the monster wants you the monster 's gonna get
 especially if you 're me ' cause alzheimer 's tends to run in families  
 so i 'm preparing to get alzheimer 's disease  
 based on what i 've learned from taking care of my father and researching what it 's like to live with dementia  i 'm focusing on three things in my preparation  
 i 'm changing what i do for fun 
  i 'm working to build my physical strength  and this is the hard one i 'm trying to become a better person  
 let 's start with the hobbies 
 when you get dementia  it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself you can 't sit and have long talks with your old friends because you don 't know who they are 
 it 's confusing to watch television and often very frightening  and reading is just about impossible 
 when you care for someone with dementia and you get training
  they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar
 with my dad  that turned out to be letting him fill out forms 
 he was a college professor at a state school he knows what paperwork looks like  
 he 'll sign his name on every line he 'll check all the
  'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers but it got me thinking what would my caregivers do with me 
 i 'm my father 's daughter  i read i write  i think about global health a lot 
 would they give me academic journals so i could scribble in the margins would they give me charts and graphs that i could color  
 so i 've been trying to learn to do things that are hands on i 've always liked to draw so i 'm doing it more even though i 'm really very bad at it
  i am learning some basic origami i can make a really great box 
 and i 'm teaching myself to knit which so far i can knit a blob but you
 know it doesn 't matter  if i 'm actually good at it what matters is that my hands know how to do it because the more things that are familiar
  the more things my hands know how to do the more things that i can be happy and busy doing when my brain 's not running the show anymore 
 they say that people who are engaged in activities are happier  easier for their caregivers to look after and
 it may even slow the progress of the disease  
 that all seems like win to me  i want to be as happy as i can for as long as i can 
 a lot of people don 't know that alzheimer 's actually has physical symptoms as well as cognitive symptoms
  lose your sense of balance  you get muscle tremors  
 and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile  they get scared to walk around  they get scared to move  
 so i 'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance  i 'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance so that when i start to lose it i
 'll still be able to be mobile  
  so that i have the muscle strength so that when i start to wither  i have more time that i can still move around  
 finally the third thing i 'm trying to become a better person 
 my dad was kind and loving before he had alzheimer 's  and he 's kind and loving now 
 i 've seen him lose his intellect his sense of humor  his language skills but i 've also seen this  he
  he loves my sons  he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers  
 and that love makes us want to be around him even now even when it 's so hard when you take away everything
 that he ever learned in this world his naked heart still shines 
 i was never as kind as my dad  and i was never as loving  
 and what i need now is to learn to be like that i need a heart so pure that if it 's stripped bare by dementia 
 it will survive
 i don 't want to get alzheimer 's disease  what i want is a cure in the next twenty years soon enough to protect me
  but if it comes for me  i 'm going to be ready  thank you
