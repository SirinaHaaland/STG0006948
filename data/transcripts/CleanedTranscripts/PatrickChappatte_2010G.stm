  know if you 've heard about it newspapers it 's a sort of
 you know what they say they say the print media is dying who says that well the media but
 this is no news right  you 've read about it
 already 
 ladies and gentlemen the world has gotten smaller
  i know it 's a cliche but look look how small 
 how tiny it has gotten and you know the reason why of course this is because of technology
 yeah 
 any computer designers in the room 
 yeah well
  are making my life miserable because
 track pads used to be round  a nice round shape that makes a good cartoon  but what are you going to do with a flat track pad  those square things  
 there 's nothing i can do as a cartoonist 
 well i know the world is flat now 
 that 's true and the internet has reached every corner of the world  the poorest the remotest places 
 every village in africa now has a cyber cafe
 don 't go asking for a frappuccino there 
 so we are bridging the digital divide the third world is connected  we are connected  
 and what happens next  well  you 've got mail
  yeah well the internet has empowered us it has empowered you it has empowered me
 and it has empowered some other guys as well 
 laughter you know these last two cartoons i did them live during a conference in hanoi
  were not used to that in in
 communist two point zero
 vietnam so i was cartooning live on a on a wide screen it was quite a sensation and then this guy came to me he was
 taking pictures of me and of my sketches and i thought this is great a vietnamese fan and as he came the second day
 on the third day i finally understood the guy was actually on duty  
 so by now there must be a hundred pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the files
 of the vietnamese police no but it
 's true the internet has changed the world it has rocked the music industry
  it has changed the way we consume music for those of you old enough to remember we used to have to go to the store to steal it 
 and it has changed the way your future employer
 will look at your application so be careful with that
 facebook account your momma told you be careful 
  it has liberated us from the office desk  this is your life  
 enjoy it 
 laughter in short technology the internet they have changed our
  like this man that a german magazine called the philosopher of the 21st century they are shaping the way we do things they are shaping the way
 we consume they are shaping our very desires
  has even changed our relationship to god 
 now i shouldn 't get into this religion and political cartoons as you may have heard  
 make a difficult couple ever since that day
 of two thousand and five when a bunch of cartoonists in denmark drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world
 demonstrations fatwa  they provoked violence  people died in the violence  this was so sickening  people died
 because of cartoons  i mean
 i had the feeling at the time that cartoons had been used
 by both sides actually  they were used first by a danish newspaper which wanted to make a point on islam
  cartoonist told me he was one of the twenty four who received the assignment to draw the prophet twelve of them refused did you know that 
 he told me nobody has to tell me what i should draw  this is not how it works 
 and then of course they were used by extremists and politicians on the other side they wanted to stir up controversy you know the story
  we know that cartoons can be used as weapons history tells us they 've been used
 by the nazis to attack the jews and here we are now 
 in the united nations half of the world is pushing to penalize the offense to religion
 they call it the defamation of religion while the other half of the world is fighting back in defense of freedom of speech  so
 the clash of civilizations is here
  cartoons are at the middle of it this got me thinking now you see me thinking
 at my kitchen table and
 since you 're in my kitchen please meet my wife 
 in two thousand and six a few months after  i went ivory coast
 western africa now  talk of a divided place the country was cut in two you had a rebellion in the north  the government in the south the capital abidjan
 and in the middle  the french army  this looks like a giant hamburger you don 't want to be
 the ham in the middle  
 i was there to report on that story
 in cartoons i 've been doing this for the last
 fifteen years it 's my side job if you want so you see the style is different this is
 more serious than maybe editorial cartooning  i went to places like
 gaza during the war in two thousand and nine  so this is really
 journalism in cartoons you 'll hear more and more about it this is the future of journalism i think  
 and of course i went to see the rebels in the north
  those were poor guys fighting for their rights there was
 an ethnic side to this conflict as very often in africa  and i went to see the dozo the dozo  they are the traditional hunters
 of west africa  people fear them they help the rebellion a lot  they are believed to have magical powers they can disappear
  i went to see a dozo chief he told me about his magical powers  he said i can chop your head off
 right away and bring you back to life i said well maybe we don 't have time for this
 right now another time so back in abidjan i was given a chance
 to lead a workshop with local cartoonists there and i thought yes
  context like this cartoons can really be used as weapons
 against the other side  i mean  the press in ivory coast was bitterly divided it was compared
 to the media in rwanda before the genocide
 so imagine  and what can a cartoonist do sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see and the guy has to feed his family right
  so
 the idea was pretty simple we brought together cartoonists from all sides
 in ivory coast we took them away from their newspaper for three days  and i asked them to
 do a project together  tackle the issues affecting their country in cartoons yes in cartoons  show
  it 's a great tool of communication for bad or for good 
 and cartoons can cross boundaries as you have seen and humor is a good way i think to address serious issues  
 and
 i 'm very proud of what they did i mean they didn 't agree with each other that was not the point  
 and i didn 't ask them to do nice cartoons  the first day they were even shouting at each other but they came up with a book  looking back
 at thirteen years
  of political crisis in ivory coast  
 so the idea was there and i 've been doing projects like this 
 in two thousand and nine in lebanon  this year in kenya back in january in lebanon it was not a book the idea was to
 have the same principal a divided country take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something
  we enrolled the newspaper editors  and we got them to publish
 eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page addressing the issue affecting lebanon like religion in
 politics and everyday life and it worked for three days  almost all the newspapers of beirut published all those cartoonists together
  you name it  so this was a great project and then in kenya what we did was addressing the issue of ethnicity which is a poison
 in a lot of places in africa  and we did video clips
 you can see them if you go to youtube
  for freedom of speech is easy here  but
 as you have seen in contexts of repression or division  again what can a cartoonist do he has to
 to keep his job
  well i believe that in any context anywhere 
 he always has the choice at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred and that 's the message
 i try to convey to them  i think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing  
 but we need to support these
  tech companies are the world 's largest editors they decide what is too offensive or too provocative for you to see 
 so really it 's not about the freedom of cartoonists  it 's about your freedoms 
 and
 for dictators all over the world  
 the good news is when
  cartoonists journalists and activists shut up
