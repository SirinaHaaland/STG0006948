  i was five years old
 i fell in love with airplanes now i 'm talking about the thirtys in
 the thirtys an airplane had two wings and a round motor and was always flown
  flown by a guy who looked like cary grant he
 had high leather boots jodhpurs an old leather jacket
 a wonderful helmet and those marvelous goggles
 and inevitably a white scarf to flow in the wind
 he 'd always walk
  up to his airplane in a kind of saunter devil may care saunter
 flick the cigarette away grab the girl waiting here give her a kiss
 and then mount his airplane maybe for the last time of course i always wondered what would happen if he 'd kissed the airplane first
 but this was real romance to me
 everything about flying
 in those years which was i have to stop and think for a moment
 was probably the most advanced technological thing going on at the time
 so as a
  youngster i tried to get close to this
 by drawing airplanes constantly drawing airplanes it 's the way i got a part of this romance
 and of course in a way when i say romance
 i mean in part the aesthetics of that whole situation i think the word is the holistic experience
 revolving around a product the product was that airplane but it built
 a romance even the parts of the airplane
 had french names the fuselage the empanage the nessal
  from a romance language so that it was something that just got into your spirit it did mine
 and i decided i had to get closer than just drawing
 fantasy airplanes i wanted to build airplanes so i built model airplanes
 and i found that in doing the model airplanes
 the appearance drawings were not enough you couldn 't transfer those
  those to the model itself
 if you wanted it to fly you had to learn the discipline of flying
 you had to learn about aeronautics
 you had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air and of course as a model in those years you couldn 't control it so it had to be self
 righting and stay
 up without crashing
 so i had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes
 and convert it to technical drawings
 the shape of the wing the shape of the fuselage and so on and build
 an airplane over these drawings that i knew followed some of the principles of flying
 and
  in so doing i could produce
 a model that would fly stay in the air
 and it had once it was in the air some of this romance that i was in love with
 well the act of drawing airplanes led me to
 when i had the opportunity to choose a course in school led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering
 and when i was sitting in classes
 in which no one asked me to draw an airplane to my surprise
 i had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing i 'd wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class
 one day a young man
  looked over my shoulder he said you draw very well
 you should be in the art department
 and i said why he said well for one thing there are more girls there
 so my romance was temporarily shifted
 and i went in to art because they appreciated drawing studied painting
 didn 't do very well at that went through design some architecture
 eventually hired myself out as a designer and for the following twenty five years
 living in italy living in america i doled out a piece of this romance
 to anybody who 'd pay for it this sense this aesthetic feeling for the experience revolving around
  around a designed object
 it exists any of you who rode the automobiles was it yesterday at the track
 you you know the romance revolving around around those high performance high performance cars
 well in twenty five years
 i was mostly putting out pieces of
  this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call
 doesn 't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can
 produce things of this nature so after twenty five years i began to feel as though i was running dry
 and i quit and i started up a very small operation went from forty people
  one in an effort to rediscover my innocence
 i wanted to get back
 where the romance was i couldn 't choose airplanes because they had gotten sort of unromantic
 at that point
 even though i 'd done a lot of airplane work on the interiors
 so i chose furniture
  and i chose chairs specifically
 because i knew something about them i 'd designed a lot of chairs over the years for tractors and trucks
 and submarines all kinds of things but not office chairs so i started doing that
 and i found that there were ways to duplicate the same approach
  approach that i used to use on the airplane only this time
 instead of the product being shaped by the wind it was shaped by the human body
 so the discipline was as in the airplane you learn a lot about how to deal with the air
 for a chair you have to learn a lot about how to deal with the body
 and what the body needs wants indicates it needs
 and that 's the way ultimately after some ups and downs
 i ended up designing the chair i 'm going to show you i should say one more thing when i was doing those
 model airplanes
 i did everything i conceived the kind of airplane
 i basically engineered it
 i built it and i flew it
 and that 's the way i work now
 when i started this chair it was not a preconceived notion design
 nowadays if you mean it
 you don 't start with styling sketches
  sketches
 i started with a lot of loose ideas roughly eight or nine years ago
 and
 the loose ideas had something to with what i knew happened with people in the office at
 work place people who worked and used task seating a
 great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long
 and
  felt the one thing they don 't need is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there
 so i took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible
 or as mechanistically possible so that they didn 't have to fuss with it so my idea was that
  instead of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls that you would sit on the chair
 and it would automatically balance your weight against the force required to recline
 now that
 may not mean a lot
 to some of you but you know most good chairs do recline because it 's beneficial to open up this joint between your legs and your upper body for better
 breathing and better flow
 so that if you sit down
 on my chair whether you 're five feet tall or six foot six it always
 deals with your weight
 and transfers the amount of force required to recline in a way that you don 't have to look
 for something to adjust
 i 'll tell you right up front this is a trade off
 there are drawbacks to this
 one is you can 't accommodate everybody
 there are some very light people some extremely heavy people maybe people with a lot of
 bulk up top they begin to fall off the end of your chart
 but the compromise i felt was in my favor because most people
 don 't adjust their chairs they will sit in them forever i had somebody
 on the bus out to the racetrack tell me about his sister calling him he said she had one of the new better chairs she said oh i love it
  come over and look at it
 he came over and looked at it he reached down he
 pulled a lever and the chair sank down she said oh it 's wonderful how did you do that and he showed her the lever well that 's typical
 of a lot of us working in chairs and why should you
 get a twenty page manual about how to run a chair
 i had one for a wristwatch once
 twenty pages anyway
 i felt that it was important that you didn 't have to make an adjustment in order to get this kind of
 action the other thing i felt was that armrests had never really been
 properly approached from the standpoint of how much
  of an aide they could be
 to your work life
 but i felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual arm rest in order to get it where you wanted
 so i spent a long time i said i worked on eight or nine years on it
 and each of these things went along sort of in parallel but incrementally were a problem of their own
 i worked a
  long time on figuring out how to move the arms over a much greater arc that is up and down
 and make them a lot easier so that you didn 't have to use a button
 and so after many trials many failures we came up with a very simple arrangement
 in which we could just move one arm or the other and they go up
  and stop where you want you can put them down essentially out of the way no arms at all or you can pull them up where you want them
 and this was another thing that i felt while not nearly as romantic as cary grant
 nevertheless begins to
 grab a little bit of aesthetic
 operation aesthetic performance into a product
 the next area
 that was of interest to me was the fact that reclining was a very important factor and the more you can recline
 in a way the better it is
 the more the angle between here and here opens up and nowadays with a screen in front of you you don 't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline so we keep it at more or less the same level
  but you transfer weight off your tailbones would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone
 you feel that bone under there just your own
 there is two of them one on either
  side
 all the weight of your upper torso your arms your head
 goes right down through your back your spine into those bones when you sit and that 's a lot of load
 just relieving your arms with armrests takes twenty percent of that
  if your spine is not held in a good position will help bend your spine the wrong way and so on
 so to unload that great weight
 if that indeed exists
 you can recline when you recline you take away a lot of that load off your bottom end and transfer it to your back at the same time as
  say you open up this joint and breathability is good but to do that
 if you have any
 amount of recline it gets to the point where you need a headrest
 because nearly always
 automatically hold your head in a vertical position see as i recline
  my head says more or less vertical and if you 're reclined a great deal
 you have to use muscle force
 to hold your head there so that 's where a headrest comes in now headrest is a challenge because you want it to
 adjust enough so that it will fit
 you know a tall guy and a short girl so here we are
 i 've got five inches of adjustment here in order to get the headrest in the right place but then i knew
 from experience and looking around
 in offices where there were chairs with headrests
 that nobody would ever bother to reach back and turn a knob
  in position
 and you need it in a different position when you 're upright then when you 're reclined
 so i knew that had to be solved and had to be automatic so if you watch this chair as i recline
 the headrest comes up
 to meet my neck
 ideally you want to put the head support in the cranial area right there
  that part of it took a long time to work out and there is a variety of other things the shape of the cushions the
 gel we put
 we stole the idea from bicycle seats and put gel in the cushions and in the armrests to absorb absorb
 point load distributes the loading so you don 't get hard spots you cant hit
  on bottom
 and i did want to demonstrate the fact that the chair can accommodate people
 while you 're sitting in it you can adjust it down for the five footer
 or you can adjust it
 for the six foot six guy
 all within the scope of a few simple adjustments
