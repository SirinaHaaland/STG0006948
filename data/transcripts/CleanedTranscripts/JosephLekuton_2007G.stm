  my name is joseph a member of parliament in kenya  picture a maasai village and one evening
  government soldiers come surround the village and ask each elder to bring one boy to school that 's how i went to school
 pretty much a government guy pointing a gun and told my father you have to make a choice
  very comfortably to this missionary school that was run by an american missionary the first thing the american missionary gave me
 was a candy i had never in my life ever tasted candy  so i said to myself with all these hundred other boys this is where i belong i
 stayed when everybody else was dropping out  my family moved we 're nomads 
  slept in the bush but you kept going  and i stayed  i don 't know why  but i did all of a sudden
 i passed the national examination found myself in a very beautiful high school in
 kenya  and i finished high school  and just walking i found a man who gave me a full scholarship to the united states 
 my mother still lived in a  cow dung hut  none of my brothers were going to school  and this man told me
 i got a scholarship to st lawrence university upstate new york finished that  and after that i went to harvard
 graduate school  
 finished that then i worked in dc a little bit i wrote a book for national geographic and taught  u s history  and every time i kept going back home 
 listening to their problems sick
  people with no water  all this stuff every time i go back to america  i kept thinking about them then one day an elder gave me a story that went like this 
 long time ago there was a big
 big war between tribes  this specific tribe was really
 afraid of this other luhya tribe every time they sent scouts  to make sure no one attacked them  so one day the scouts came running and told the villagers the enemies are coming  only half
  so people scrambled took their things and ready to go move out but there were two men one man was blind one man had no legs
 the leader of the chiefs said no sorry we can 't take you you 'll slow us down we have to flee our women and children  we have to run 
 and they were left behind  waiting to die  but these two people
 worked something out  the blind man said look i 'm a very strong man but i can 't see
  as far as the end of the world  but i can 't save myself from a cat or
 whatever animals 
 the blind man went down on his knees like this and told the man with no legs to go over his back and stood up the man on top can see  the blind man can walk
 these guys took off followed the footsteps of the villagers until
  this was told to me in a setup of elders and it 's a really poor area i represent northern kenya the most nomadic  remote areas you can even find 
 and that man told me so here you are you 've got a good education from america you have a good life in america what are you going to do for us  
 we want you to be our eyes we 'll give you the legs we 'll walk you you lead us
 the opportunity came i was always thinking about that what can i do to help my people every time you go to an area where for forty three years of independence we still don 't have basic health facilities a man has to be transported in a wheelbarrow thirty km for a hospital no clean drinking water  
 so i said i 'm going to dedicate myself
  ran in july election and won
 and i came for them  and that 's my goal right now i have in place for the last nine months 
 a plan
 that in five years every nomad will have clean drinking water we 're building dispensaries across that constituency
  i 'm asking my friends from america to help with with bringing nurses or doctors to help us out  i 'm trying to improve infrastructure  
 i 'm using the knowledge i received from the united states and from my community
 to move them forward i 'm trying to develop homegrown solutions
 to our issues because people from outside can come and help us but if we don 't help ourselves  there 's nothing to do my plan
  as i continue with introducing students to different fields some become doctors some lawyers we want to produce a comprehensive group of people 
 students who can come back and help us see a community grow that is in the middle of a huge economic
 recession as i continue to be a member of parliament
 and as i continue listening to all of you talking about botany health democracy new inventions  i 'm hoping that one day
 in my own little community which is twenty six thousand square km maybe five times
  island with no roads we 'll be able to become a model to help others develop  thank you very much
