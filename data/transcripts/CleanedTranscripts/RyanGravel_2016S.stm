  this picture
 is from my metro card when i spent a year abroad in paris in college in the mid ' 90s 
 my friend says i look like a french anarchist laughter
 but this is still what i see when i look in the mirror in the morning within a month of living in paris
  i 'd lost fifteen pounds and i was in the best shape of my life
 because i was eating fresh food and i was walking wherever i went  
 having grown up in suburban atlanta a region built largely by highways and automobiles and with a reputation as a poster child for sprawl 
 paris fundamentally changed the way i understood the construction of the world around me  and i got obsessed with the role of infrastructure
 that it 's not just the way to move people from point a to point b it 's not just the way to convey water or sewage or energy energy  
 but it 's the foundation for our economy it
 's the foundation for our social life and for our culture  and it really matters to the way that we live 
 when i came home i
 was instantly frustrated stuck in traffic as i crossed the top end of our perimeter highway 
 not only was i not moving a muscle  i had no social interaction with the hundreds of thousands of people that were hurtling past me like me with their eyes faced forward and their music blaring 
 i wondered if this was an inevitable outcome or could we do something about it 
 was it possible to transform this condition in atlanta into the kind of place that i wanted to live in 
 i went back to grad school
  in architecture and city planning  developed this interest in infrastructure and in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine came up with an idea for my thesis project  
 the adaptation of an obsolete loop of old railroad circling downtown as a new infrastructure for urban revitalization it was just an idea  
 i never thought we would actually build it  
 but i went to work at an architecture firm and eventually talked to
  coworkers about it and they loved the idea  and as we started talking to more people about it  more people wanted to hear about it 
 in the summer of two thousand and one 
 we connected with cathy woolard who was soon elected city council president  
 and we built a citywide vision around this idea  the atlanta beltline a 22 mile loop of transit and trails and transformation 
 i was doing two and three
  three meetings a week for two and a half years and so was cathy and her staff and a handful of volunteers together we built this amazing movement of people and ideas  
 it included community advocates who were used to fighting against things  but found the atlanta beltline as something that they could fight for 
 developers who saw the opportunity to take advantage of a lot of new growth in the city and dozens of nonprofit
  who saw their mission at least partly accomplished by the shared vision 
 now  usually these groups of people aren 't at the same table wanting the same outcome 
 but there we were and it was kind of weird
 but it was really really powerful the people of atlanta fell in love with a vision that was better than what they saw through their car windshields
  windshields  and the people of atlanta made it happen  and i guarantee you we would not be building it otherwise 
 from the beginning our coalition was diverse people of all stripes were part of our story 
 people on the lower end of the economic spectrum loved it too they were just afraid they weren 't going to be able to be there
 when it got built that they 'd be priced out  and we 've all heard that kind of story before right 
 but we promised that the atlanta beltline would be different  
 and people took ownership of the idea and they made it better than anything we ever imagined in the beginning  including significant subsidies for housing
 new parks art an arboretum
 a list that continues to grow  and we put in place the organizations and agencies that were required to make it happen  and importantly
  it is now we 're in the early stages of implementation and it 's working the first mainline section of trail was opened in two thousand and twelve  and it 's already generated over three billion dollars of private sector investment  
 but it 's not only changing the physical form of the city it 's changing the way we think about the city  and what our expectations are for living there
  about a month ago  i had to take my kids with me to the grocery store and they were complaining about it  because they didn 't want to get in the car they were
 if we have to go  can we at least ride our bikes and i said of course we can that 's what people in atlanta do we ride our bikes to the grocery
  they don 't know how ridiculous that is but i do  and i also understand that their expectations for atlanta
 are really powerful 
 this kind of transformation is exactly like sprawl in the last century  the movement where our investment in highways and automobiles fundamentally changed
  changed american life that wasn 't some grand conspiracy there were conspiracies within it of course
 but it was a cultural momentum  it was millions of people making millions of decisions over an extended period of time  that fundamentally changed not only the way that we build cities  but
 it changed our expectations for our lives 
 these changes were the foundations for urban sprawl we didn 't call it sprawl at that time we called it the future  and it was
  and we got all the highways and strip malls and cul de sacs we wanted
 it was a radical transformation  but it was built by a cultural momentum  
 so it 's important to not separate the physical construction of the places we live from other things that are happening at that time at that time 
 in the second half of the last century  
  science was curing disease and lifting us to the moon  
 and the sexual revolution was breaking down barriers and the civil rights movement began its march toward the fulfillment of our nation 's promise 
 television  entertainment food travel business everything was changing 
 and both the public and private sectors were colluding to give us the lives we wanted  
 the federal highway administration for example didn 't exist before there were highways think about it
 of course today it 's important to understand and acknowledge that those benefits accrued to some groups of people and not to others 
 it was not an equitable cultural momentum  
 but when we look today in wonder and disgust maybe at the metropolis sprawl before us  we wonder if we 're stuck 
 we stuck with the legacy of that inequity are we stuck with this dystopian traffic hellscape 
 are we stuck with rampant urban displacement with environmental degradation are we stuck with social isolation
 or political polarization are these the inevitable and permanent outcomes 
 or are they the result of our collective cultural decisions that we 've made for ourselves  
 and if they are can
  change them 
 what i have learned from our experience in atlanta is not an anomaly similar stories are playing out everywhere where people are reclaiming not only old railroads 
 but also degraded urban waterways and obsolete roadways reinventing all of the infrastructure in their lives 
  hong kong singapore toronto and paris cities big and small all over the world are reclaiming and reinventing this infrastructure for themselves including the mother of all catalyst infrastructure projects
  the los angeles river  
 the revitalization effort for which similarly started as a grassroots movement has developed into a cultural momentum  and is now in the early
  stages
 of being transformed into some kind of  life affirming infrastructure again 
 this one with trails and parks and fishing and boating and community revitalization  and of course  water quality and flood control 
 it 's already improving the lives of people it 's already changing the way the rest of us think about los angeles 
 this is more than just infrastructure
  building new lives for ourselves  
 it 's a movement that includes local food urban agriculture craft beer  the maker movement  tech and design all of these things early indicators of a really radical shift in the way we build cities we
 're taking places like this
 and transforming them into this 
 and soon this
  and this is all exciting and good we
 're changing the world for the better good for us  and it is awesome i mean
 but our history of sprawl and from what we can already see with these catalyst projects today we know and must remember that big changes like this don 't usually benefit everyone 
 the market forces unleashed by this cultural momentum
 often include the seemingly unstoppable and inevitable cycle of rising taxes  prices and rents this is urgent 
 if we care we have to stand up and speak out this should be a call to action because the answer can 't be to not improve communities 
 the answer can 't be to
  build parks and transit and grocery stores the answer can 't be to hold communities down just to keep them affordable 
 but we do have to follow through and address the financial realities that we 're facing 
 this is hard and it won 't happen on its own we can do it  and i 'm committed to this goal in atlanta to sticking up again
 for people who made it possible in the first place we can 't call it a success without them i certainly can 't because the people i made commitments to all those years
 weren 't abstract populations they 're my friends and neighbors they 're people that i love 
 so even though it started as my graduate thesis and i 'm working hard for sixteen years with thousands of people to help make this thing come to life 
 i know and believe that
 who the beltline is being built for is just as important as whether it 's built at all not just in atlanta  but locally and globally
  we have to understand
 this accountability to the people whose lives we are changing because this is us 
 we are the lives we 're talking about these places aren 't inevitable the places we live aren 't inevitable 
 and if we want something different we just need to speak up  
 we have to ensure that change comes on our terms and to do that we have to participate actively in the process of shaping change
 thank you
