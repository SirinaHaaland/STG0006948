  gang member who ran the streets  everyone knew who i was so i thought i was a pretty big
  i was protected  
 and even though my dad spent most of my life in and out of jail  i had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent she worked at the local high school 
  as a secretary in the dean 's office so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class for whatever reason who were waiting to be disciplined 
 kids like us we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school and sometimes we 're just not ready to focus  
 but that doesn 't mean that we can 't it just takes a little bit more like 
 i remember one day i found my dad convulsing foaming at the mouth od ing on the bathroom floor 
 really do you think that doing my homework that night was at the top of my priority list 
 not
  i really needed a support network a group of people who were going to help me make sure that i wasn 't going to be a victim of my own circumstance 
 that they were going to push me beyond what i even thought i could do 
 i needed teachers in the classroom every day who were going to say you can move beyond that 
 and unfortunately the local
  huge teacher turnover rate so my mom said you 're going on a bus an hour and a half away from where we live
 every day so for the next two years that 's what i did i took a school bus to the fancy side of town  
 and eventually i ended up at a school where there was a mixture there were some people who were really gang affiliated and then there
  of us really trying to make it to high school 
 well trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable you had to survive you just had to do things sometimes 
 so there were a lot of teachers who were like she 's never going to make it she has an issue with authority  she 's not going to go anywhere 
 some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause  
 but then they were very surprised
 when i graduated from high school i was accepted to pepperdine university  
 and i came back to the same school that i attended to be a special ed assistant  and then i told them i want to be a teacher 
 and boy they were like
  attended  
 and i really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me 
 and so every year i share my background with my kids because they need to know that everyone has a story  
 everyone has a struggle  and everyone needs help along the way  
 and i am going to be their help along the way  
 so as a rookie teacher
 i created
 opportunity  
 i had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before  
 i was like you need to go to a hospital the school nurse
 something he 's like no miss i 'm not going i need to be in class because i need to graduate 
 so he knew that i was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance
  but we were going to push forward and keep moving on and this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids
 and getting to know exactly what they 're going through getting to know their families
 i wanted that  but i couldn 't do it in a school with one thousand six
  and teachers turning over year after year after year how do you get to build those relationships 
 so we created a new school  
 and we created the san fernando institute for applied media  
 and we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding for support 
 but with that we were going to gain freedom freedom to hire the
  teachers that we knew were going to be effective 
 freedom to control the curriculum so that we 're not doing lesson one point two on page five  no  
 and freedom to control a budget 
 to spend money where it matters not how a district or a state says you have to do it 
 we wanted those freedoms  but now shifting
  an entire paradigm it hasn 't been an easy journey  nor is it even complete  
 but we had to do it our community deserved a new way of doing things 
 and as the very first pilot middle school in all of los angeles unified school district you better believe there was some opposition  
 and it was out of fear fear of
  well what if they get it wrong  yeah what if we get it wrong  but what if we get it right  
 and we did  so even though teachers were against it because we employ one year contracts
 you can 't teach  or you don 't want to teach  you don 't get to be at my school with
  so in our third year  
 how did we do it 
 well  we 're making school worth coming to every day we make our kids feel like they matter to us 
 we make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them  and they use all the technology that they 're used to laptops
  tablets you name it they have it animation software moviemaking software they have it all and because we connect it to what they 're doing
 for example they made public service announcements for the cancer society  these were played in the local trolley system 
 teaching elements of persuasion it doesn 't get any more real than that 
 our state test scores have gone up more than eighty points since we 've become our own school  but it 's taken all stakeholders
  working together teachers and principals on one year contracts  working
 over and above and beyond their contract hours without compensation  
 and it takes a school board member who is going to lobby for you and say know the district is trying to impose this but you have the freedom to do otherwise 
 and it takes an active parent center who is not only there
 a presence every day  but who is part of our governance making decisions for their kids our kids  
 because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live 
 they deserve a quality school in their neighborhood a school that they can be proud to say they attend and a school that the community can be proud
  of as well  and they need teachers to fight for them every day
 and empower them to move beyond their circumstances because it 's time that kids like me
 stop being the exception  and we become the norm
