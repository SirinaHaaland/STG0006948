  we humans have an
 extraordinary potential for goodness  but also an immense power to do harm  any tool
 can be used to build or to destroy
  that all depends on our motivation  therefore it is all the more important
 to foster an altruistic motivation rather than a selfish one 
 so now we indeed are facing many challenges in our times those could be
  our own mind
 can be our best friend
 or our worst enemy  
 there 's also societal challenges poverty in the midst of plenty  inequalities conflict injustice  
 and then there are the new challenges which we don 't expect 
 ten thousand years ago there were about five million human beings on earth  
 whatever they could do the earth 's resilience would soon heal
  human activities  
 after the industrial and technological revolutions that 's not the same anymore  
 we are now the major agent of impact on our earth we enter the anthropocene  the era of human beings 
 so in a way  if we were to say
  if this man was saying and i heard
 a former head of state  i won 't mention who 
 saying five years ago  we were at the edge of the precipice today we made a big step forward 
 so this edge
 is the same that has been defined by scientists as the planetary
  boundaries  and within those boundaries they can carry a number of factors  
 we can still prosper  humanity can still prosper for one hundred and fifty thousand years
 if we keep the same stability of climate as in the holocene for the last ten thousand years  but this depends
 on choosing
 a voluntary simplicity  growing qualitatively not
  quantitatively so in one thousand nine hundred as you can see we were well within the limits of safety  
 now  in one thousand nine hundred and fifty came the great acceleration  
 now hold your breath not too long to imagine what comes next now
 we have
  vastly overrun some of the planetary boundaries just to take biodiversity 
 at the current rate  by two thousand and fifty thirty percent of all species on earth will have disappeared 
 even if we keep their dna in some fridge that 's not going to be reversible  
 so here i am sitting in front of a
  glaciers are melting fast faster than the arctic  
 so what can we do in that situation  well  
 however complex politically  economically scientifically the question of the environment is it simply boils
  i heard the billionaire steve forbes on fox news saying exactly the same thing but seriously
  he was told about the rise of the ocean and he said i find it absurd to change my behavior today for something that will happen in a hundred years 
 so if you don 't care for future generations just go for it  
 so one of the main challenges of our times is to reconcile three time scales  
 the short term of the economy  the ups and downs of the stock
  the midterm of the quality of life what is the quality every moment of our life over ten years and twenty years and
 the long term of the environment when the environmentalists speak with economists it 's like a schizophrenic dialogue  completely incoherent they don 't speak the same language 
 now for the last ten years i went
  thinkers in the himalayas all over the place it seems to me  there 's only one concept
 that can reconcile those three time scales  it is simply having more consideration for others  
 if you have more consideration for others  you will have a caring economics where
 finance is at the service of society and not society
  at the service of finance  
 you will not play at the casino with the resources that people have entrusted you with 
 if you have more consideration for others  you will make sure that you remedy inequality  that you bring some kind of well being within society in education at the workplace otherwise 
 a nation that is the most powerful and the richest but everyone is miserable
 and if you have more consideration for others  you are not going to ransack that planet that we have
 and at the current rate we don 't have three planets to continue that way  
 so the question is  
 okay altruism  is the answer it 's not just a novel ideal  but can it be a real  pragmatic solution  
 and first of all does it exist  true altruism or are we
  so selfish  so some philosophers thought we were
 irredeemably selfish but are we really all just like rascals  that 's good news isn 't it 
 many philosophers like hobbes have said so but not everyone
  man a wolf for man but this guy doesn 't seem too bad he
 's one of my friends in tibet he 's very kind  
 so now 
 we love cooperation there 's no better joy than working together is there 
 and then not only humans 
 then of course
  there 's the struggle for life the survival of the fittest social darwinism
 but in evolution 
 cooperation though competition exists of course cooperation has to be much more creative
 to go to increased levels of complexity we are 
  super cooperators and we should even go further  so now  on top of
  a survey among ten factors including income everything the first one that people said that 's the main thing for my happiness is
 quality of social relationships
  not only in humans  and look at those great grandmothers so now  
 this idea that if we go deep within we are irredeemably selfish  this is armchair
  science  there is not a single sociological study psychological study that 's ever shown that rather the opposite 
 my friend daniel batson spent a whole life putting people in the lab in very complex situations and of course we are sometimes selfish and some people more than others  
  there 's a significant number of people who do behave altruistically no matter what
 if you see someone deeply wounded great suffering  
 you might just help out of empathic distress you can 't stand it so it 's better to help than to keep on looking at that person so we tested all that and in the end he said  
 clearly people can be altruistic so that 's
  and even further we should look at the banality of goodness  
 now look at here when we come out we aren 't going to say that 's so nice there was no fistfight while this mob was thinking about altruism 
  that 's expected isn 't it if there was a fistfight we would speak of that for months  so the banality of goodness is something that doesn 't attract your attention but it
  some psychologists said  
 when i tell them i run one hundred and forty humanitarian projects in the himalayas that give me so much joy they said oh i see you work for the warm glow that is not altruistic you just feel good 
 you think this guy when he jumped in front of the train
  feel so good when this is over 
 but that 's not the end of it  they say well but when you interviewed him he said 
 i had no choice  i had to jump of course he has no choice  automatic behavior it 's neither selfish nor altruistic 
 no choice  well of course this guy 's not going to think for half an hour should i give my
  people who had choice like pastor andr trocm and his wife and the whole village of le chambon sur lignon in france for the whole second world war 
 they saved three thousand five hundred jews  gave them shelter brought them to switzerland against all odds at the
  of their family  so altruism does exist so what is altruism it is the wish may others be happy and find the cause of happiness  now  empathy
 is the affective resonance or cognitive resonance that tells you this person is joyful this person suffers  but empathy alone
 is not sufficient  
 if you keep on being confronted with suffering  you might have empathic distress  burnout so you need the greater sphere of
 with tania singer at the max planck institute of leipzig we showed that the
 brain networks for empathy and loving kindness are different now that 's all well done so we got that from
 evolution from maternal care parental love  but we need to extend that it can be extended even to other
  if we want a more altruistic society we need two things individual change and societal change 
 so is individual change possible  two thousand years of contemplative study said yes  it is now fifteen years of collaboration with neuroscience and epigenetics said yes our brains change when you train in altruism  
 so
 i spent one hundred and twenty hours in an mri machine this is the first time i went after two and a half hours
 and then the result has been published in many scientific papers it shows without ambiguity that there is structural change and functional change in the brain when you train the altruistic love 
 just to give you an idea  this is the meditator at rest on the left
  in compassion meditation you see all the activity  and then the control group at rest nothing happened in meditation nothing happened  they have not been trained
  trained  
 so do you need fifty thousand hours of meditation no you don 't  
 four weeks twenty minutes a day of caring mindfulness meditation already brings
 a structural change in the brain compared to a control group that 's only twenty minutes a day for four weeks 
 even with preschoolers richard davidson did that in madison
  gratitude loving kindness cooperation 
 mindful breathing you would say oh they 're just preschoolers look after eight weeks the pro social behavior that 's the blue line  
 and then comes the ultimate
 scientific test the stickers test  before you determine for each child who is their best friend in the class
  their least favorite child  an unknown child  and the sick child and they have to give stickers away  
 so before the intervention they give most of it to their best friend 
 four five years old twenty minutes three times a week after the intervention  no more discrimination 
 the same amount of stickers to their best friend and the least favorite child 
  that 's something we should do in all the schools in the world 
  so now where do we go from there individual change is possible  
 now do we have to wait for an altruistic gene to be in the human race that will take fifty thousand years too much for the environment 
 fortunately
 as
 specialists have shown 
 change faster than genes that 's the good news look attitude towards war has dramatically changed over the years  
 so now individual change and cultural change mutually fashion each other and yes we can achieve a more altruistic society so where do we go from there 
  go back to the east now we treat one hundred thousand patients a year in our projects we have twenty five thousand kids in school  four percent overhead some people say well your stuff works in practice but does it work in theory 
 there 's always positive deviance 
 so i will also go back to my hermitage to find the inner resources to better serve others  
 but on the more global level  what can we do we need three things  enhancing cooperation
  cooperative learning in the school instead of competitive learning 
 unconditional cooperation within corporations there can be some competition between corporations but not within  
 we need sustainable harmony i love this term 
 not sustainable growth anymore sustainable harmony means now we will reduce inequality in the future we do more with
  less  and we continue to grow qualitatively not quantitatively  
 we need caring economics  the homo  economicus cannot deal with
 poverty in the midst of plenty  cannot deal with the problem of the common goods of the atmosphere of the oceans 
 we need a caring economics if you say economics should be compassionate
  bad  we need local commitment global responsibility  we need to extend altruism to the other one point six
