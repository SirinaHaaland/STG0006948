  right now is the most exciting time to see new indian art contemporary artists in india are having a conversation with the world like never before i thought it might be interesting even for the many
  here with us at ted local collectors to have an outside view of ten young indian artists i wish everyone at ted to know the
 first is bharti kher the central motif of bharti 's practice is the
 that untold millions of indian women apply to their foreheads every day in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage  
 but originally the significance of the bindi is to
 symbolize the third eye
  the spiritual world and the religious world bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche as she calls it by exploding it into something spectacular 
 she also creates life size fiberglass sculptures often of animals which she then completely covers in bindis 
 often with potent symbolism she says she first got started with ten packets
 what she could do with ten thousand 
 our next artist balasubramaniam really stands at the crossroads of sculpture painting and installation  working wonders with fiberglass 
 since bala himself will be speaking at ted i won 't spend too much time on him here today  except to say that he really succeeds at making the invisible
  chitra ganesh is known for her digital collages using indian comic books called amar chitra kathas as her primary source material 
 these comics are a fundamental way that children  especially in the diaspora  learn their religious and mythological folk tales 
 i for one was steeped in these 
  iconic images to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics embedded in these deeply influential comics 
 and she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well
 jitish kallat successfully practices across photography  sculpture  painting and installation as you can see  he 's heavily influenced by graffiti and street art  and his home city of mumbai is an
 he really captures that sense of density and energy which really characterizes modern urban bombay  
 he also creates phantasmagoric sculptures made of bones from cast resin 
 here he envisions the carcass of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot 
  actually has a studio right here in mysore  he 's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition  he creates these fine delicate images
 which he then repeats on a massive scale
  he uses scale to more and more spectacular effect  whether on the roof of a temple in singapore  
 or in his increasingly ambitious installation work here with one hundred and
  functioning sewing machines fabricating the flags of every member of the united nations
 mumbai based dhruvi acharya builds on her love of comic books and street art to comment on the roles and expectations of modern indian women 
 she too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas but in a very different way than chitra ganesh 
 in this particular work  she actually strips out the images
  he too is reinventing the miniature tradition  
 he creates these opulent tableaus inspired by hieronymus bosch  but also by the kashmiri textiles of his youth
  he actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work using porcupine quills
 to get this rich detailed effect  
 i 'm kind of cheating with this next artist since raqs media collective are really three artists working together 
 raqs are probably the foremost practitioners of multimedia art in india today  working across photography  video and installation  
 they frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization and their home of delhi is a frequent element in their work
  here  they invite the viewer to analyze a crime looking at evidence and clues embedded in five narratives on these five different screens in which the city itself may have been the culprit 
 this next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary indian art subodh gupta  he was first known for creating giant
 kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every indian 
 he celebrates these local and mundane objects globally  and on a grander and grander scale by incorporating them into ever more colossal sculptures
 and installations 
 and finally number
  last and certainly not least  ranjani shettar  who lives and works here in the state of karnataka creates ethereal sculptures and installations that really marry the organic to
 the industrial and brings like subodh the local global these are actually wires wrapped in muslin and steeped in vegetable dye
  and she arranges them so that the viewer actually has to navigate through the space and interact with the objects and light and shadow are a very important part of her work 
 she also explores themes of consumerism
  and the environment  such as in this work  where these basket like objects look organic and woven  and are woven  
 but with the strips of steel salvaged from cars that she found in a bangalore junkyard
