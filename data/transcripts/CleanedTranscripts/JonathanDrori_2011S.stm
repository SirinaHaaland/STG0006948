 how many species of flowering plants there are there are
 a quarter of a million at least those are the ones we know about a quarter of a million species of flowering plants 
 and flowers are a real bugger they 're really difficult for plants to produce
  enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources why would they go to that bother  and the answer of course like so many things in the world is sex 
 i know what 's on your mind when you 're looking at these pictures  
 and the reason that sexual reproduction is so important there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce you can take cuttings 
  they can sort of have sex with themselves they can pollinate themselves
  but they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches  
 evolution works that way  
 now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen some of you may have seen some of these pictures before as i say every home should have a scanning electron microscope to
 be able to see these and there is as many different kinds of pollen
 as there are
  and that 's actually rather useful for
 forensics and so on most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that
 use the wind to disseminate the pollen  and that 's a very inefficient process which is why it gets up our noses so much 
 because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it  hoping that your
 sex cells  your male sex cells which are held within the pollen  will somehow reach another flower just
  all the grasses which means all of the cereal crops and most of the trees
 have wind borne pollen  but most species actually use insects to do their bidding  and that 's more intelligent in a way  because
 the pollen they don 't need so much of it the insects and and other
 species can take the pollen  transfer it directly to
  it 's required so we 're aware obviously of the relationship between
 insects and plants there 's a symbiotic relationship there whether it 's flies or birds or bees  they 're getting something in return and that something in return is generally nectar  
 sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations
 the hummingbird hawk moth is beautiful in its adaptation the plant gets something
  plants have
 evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way there are markings on many plants that look like other insects 
 these are the anthers of a lily  cleverly done so that when
 the the unsuspecting insect lands on it the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with
  and there 's an orchid that
 might look to you as if it 's got jaws and in a way it has it forces the insect to crawl out getting covered in in pollen that it takes somewhere else orchids 
 there are twenty thousand at least species of orchids
 amazingly amazingly diverse and they get up to all sorts of tricks they have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding  this orchid
  known as darwin 's orchid  because it 's one that he he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it
 you can see that there 's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the
 from the orchid and basically what the insect has to do we 're in the middle of the flower it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down
 that nectar tube to get to the nectar
 and darwin said  looking at this flower i guess something has coevolved with this and sure enough 
 there 's the insect and i mean normally it kind of rolls it away but
 in its erect form that 's what it looks like now you can imagine that if
  a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce
 and it attracts lots of pollinators then just as in
 human sex people might start to deceive  they might say i 've got a bit of nectar do you want to come and get it 
 now this is a plant
  this is a plant here
 that insects in south africa just just love and they 've evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom  and this
 is the mimic so this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant and here is the long probosced fly
 that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic because the the mimic doesn 't give it any nectar it thought it would get some so not only has the fly not got the the nectar from the mimic plant it 's also if you look very closely just at
  head end you can see that it 's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant if only some botanist hadn 't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card 
 now deceit carries on through the the plant kingdom this flower
 with its black dots
  they might look like black dots to us but if i tell you to a male insect of the right species that looks like two females who are really really hot to trot
  when the insect gets there and lands on it  dousing itself in pollen of course that it 's going to take to another plant if you look at the  every home should have one scanning electron microscope picture  you can see that there are actually
 some patterning there which is three dimensional so it probably even feels good for the insect as well as looking good  
 and these electron microscope pictures here 's one of an orchid mimicking an insect
 you can see that
  different parts of the
 structure have different colors and different textures to our eye have very very different textures to what an insect might perceive and this one is
 evolved to mimic
 a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles and under the scanning
  the surface there really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at sometimes the whole plant
 mimics an insect even to us i mean i think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast  it 's
 a wonderful amazing thing this one 's
 clever it 's called obsidian
  i think of it as insidium sometimes to the right species of bee this looks like another very aggressive bee  and it goes and bonks it on the head
 lots and lots of times to try and drive it away and of course covers itself with pollen the other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that
 has a wonderful store of food for insects 
 and  this one doesn 't have anything for them  so it  it 's deceiving on two levels fabulous 
 here we see ylang ylang the component of many
  perfumes i actually smelt someone
 with some on earlier  and
 the flowers don 't really have to be that gaudy  they 're sending out a fantastic array of scent
 to any insect that 'll have it this one doesn 't smell so good  this is
 a flower that really really smells pretty nasty and is designed
  is also known as
 dead horse arum  i don 't know what a dead horse actually smells like but this one probably smells
 pretty much like it it 's really horrible  and blowflies just can 't help themselves they fly into
  this thing and they fly all the way down it  they lay their eggs in it  thinking it 's a nice bit of carrion
  and not realizing that there 's no food for the eggs that the eggs are going to die  but the plant meanwhile has
 benefited because the bristles release and the the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower
 fantastic here 's arum arum maculatum lords and ladies
  degrees above ambient temperature amazing
  and if you look down into it there 's this sort of dam past the spadix flies get attracted by the heat which is boiling off volatile chemicals 
 little midges and they get trapped underneath in this
 container  they drink this fabulous nectar and then
 they 're all a bit sticky at night they get covered in pollen  which showers down over them
  and then the bristles that we saw above  they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out covered in pollen
 fabulous thing  now if you think that 's fabulous this is one of my great favorites
  this is the philodendron selloum  for anyone here from brazil you 'll know about this plant  this is the most amazing thing that
 sort of phallic bit there is about
 a foot long  and it does something that no other
  plant that i know of does  and that is that when it flowers that 's the the spadix in the middle there for a period of about
 two days  
 it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals  
 so instead of having starch which is the food of plants it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it 's burning fat metabolizing
 about the rate of a small cat   and that 's twice the energy output weight for weight than a hummingbird
 absolutely astonishing this thing
 does something else which is unusual not only will it raise itself to one hundred and fifteen fahrenheit forty three or forty four degrees centigrade for two days  
 but it keeps constant temperature 
  there 's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature now why does it do this i hear you ask  now wouldn 't you know it there 's some beetles
 that just love to make love at that temperature  and they get inside and they get it all on 
 the plant showers them with pollen and off they go and pollinate and what a wonderful thing it is now
 most pollinators that we
  are insects but actually in the tropics many
 birds and butterflies
 pollinate  and many of the tropical flowers are red  and that 's because
 butterflies and birds see similarly to us we think and can see the color red very well  but if you look at the spectrum
  birds and and us we see red green and blue and see that spectrum insects see green blue and ultraviolet
  they see various shades of ultraviolet so there 's something that goes on off the end there and wouldn 't it be great if we could somehow see what that is i hear you ask well yes we can 
 so what is an insect seeing 
 last week i took these pictures of rock rose helianthemum in dorset these are
 little yellow flowers like we all see little yellow flowers all over the place  and this is what it looks like with visible light
  it looks like if you take out the red  most bees don 't perceive red  and then i
 put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very very long exposure
 with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light
 and this is what i got  and that 's a real fantastic bull 's eye  now we don 't know exactly what a bee sees
  than you know what i 'm seeing when i call this red  we can 't know what 's going on in
 let alone an insect 's another human being 's mind  but the contrast will look something like that
  so standing out a lot from the background here 's another little flower different range of ultraviolet
 frequencies different filters to match the pollinators
  and that 's the sort of thing that it would be seeing just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property
 no no flower was damaged in the process of this shot it was just
 attached to the tripod not killed
 then under ultraviolet light look at that and that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light so maybe
  the chemical in that would be useful finally there 's one of evening primrose that bjorn rorslett from norway sent me fantastic
 hidden pattern and i love the idea of something hidden  
 i think there 's something poetic here that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of
 venus actually the clouds of venus
  that 's the main use of that filter  
 venus of course is the god of love and fertility
  which is the flower story and just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding  
 they 've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other
 at times of
 birth
  and particularly at marriage  which when you think of it is the moment that encapsulates the the transfer of genetic material
 from one organism to another thank you very much
