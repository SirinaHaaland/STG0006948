  telling you or showing you
 the people who started [ jet propulsion lab ] 
 when they were a bunch of kids they were kind of very imaginative very adventurous as they were trying at caltech to mix chemicals and see which one blows up more 
 well i don 't recommend that you try to do that now  
 naturally they blew up a shack and caltech
 well then hey you go to the arroyo and really do all your tests in there so that 's what we call our first five employees during the tea break  you know in here
 as i said they were adventurous people as a matter of fact  one of them who
 was kind of  part of a cult which was not too far from here on orange grove and
 unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals and trying to figure out which ones were the best
 chemicals so that gives you a kind of flavor of the kind of people we have there we try to avoid blowing ourselves  up this one i thought i 'd show you guess which one is a jpl employee
 in the heart of this crowd 
 i tried to come like him this morning but as i walked out then it was too cold and i said i 'd better put my shirt back on but more importantly the reason i wanted to show this picture look where the other people are looking and look where he is looking
  wherever anybody else looks look somewhere else and go do something different you know 
 and doing that and that 's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing and i want to tell you a quote from ralph emerson that one of my colleagues  you know put on my wall in my office 
 and it says do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail
  that 's my recommendation to all of you look what everybody is doing what they are doing go do something completely different don 't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing because that doesn 't get you very far
 in our early days we used to work a lot on rockets  but we also used to have a lot of parties  you know as you can see one of our parties you know a few years ago but then
 a big difference happened about fifty years ago after sputnik was launched we launched the first american satellite and that 's the one you see on the left in there  and here we made one hundred
  eighty degrees change 
 we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house  and that was done over a period of a couple of years and now we are the leading organization  you know exploring space on 
 on all of your behalf  but even when we did that we had to remind ourselves  sometimes there are setbacks  so you see on the bottom that rocket was supposed to go
  somehow it ended going sideways  
 so that 's what we call the misguided missile but then also just to celebrate that we started an event at jpl for miss guided missile 
 so we used to have a celebration every year and select
 there used to be competition and parades and so on 
 it 's not very appropriate to do it now some people tell me to do it i think well that 's not really proper  you know these days so we do something a little bit more
  and that 's what you see in the last rose bowl you know when we entered one of the floats  that 's more on the play side and on the right side
  that 's the rover just before we finished its testing
 to take it to the cape to launch it these are the rovers up here that you have on mars now  so that kind of tells you about kind of the fun things  
 you know and the serious things that we try to do  but i said i 'm going to show you a short clip of one of our employees to kind
  beware of safety is an instrumental rock band it branches on more the experimental side there 's the improvisational side of jazz there
 as an instrument and be able to dig for more abstract sounds and things to play live mixing electronics and acoustics  the music 's half of me
 but the other half
 i landed probably the best gig of all i work for the jet propulsion lab i 'm building the next mars rover some of the most brilliant engineers i know are the
  from the play stuff to the serious stuff always people ask why do we explore why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them  well  the way i think about it is fairly
  somehow thirteen billion years ago there was a big bang and you 've heard a little bit about you know the origin of the universe but somehow what strikes everybody 's imagination or lots of people 's imagination somehow 
  from that original big bang we have this beautiful world that we live in today  you look outside you have all that beauty that you see all that life that you see around you and here we have intelligent people like you and i who are having a conversation here  all that started from that big bang
 so the question is how did that
 happen how did that evolve how did the universe form how did the galaxies form how did the planets form  why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved is that very common is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars  
 so we literally are all made out of stardust  we started from those
  are made of stardust so  next time you are really depressed look in the mirror and you can look and say hi i 'm looking at a star here you can skip the dust part 
 but literally we are all made of stardust so what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively write the book of how things have came about as they are today  
 and one of the first or the easiest  places we can go and explore that is to go towards mars  and the reason mars takes particular attention it 's not very far from us you know it 'll take us only six months to get there
  six to nine months at the right time of
 of the year  it 's a planet somewhat similar to earth  it 's a little bit smaller but the land mass on mars is about the same as the land mass on earth  you know if you don 't take the oceans into account it has polar 
  caps  it has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours  so it has weather  so it 's very similar to some extent and you can see some of the features
 is like the grand canyon on earth except a hell of a lot larger  so it 's about the size you know of the united states it has volcanoes on it  
 and that 's
 mount olympus on mars which is a kind of huge
 volcanic shield on that planet and if you look at the height of it and you compare it
  give you an idea of how large that mount olympus you know is relative to mount everest 
 so it basically dwarfs  you know mount everest here on earth so that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or or volcanic events which have happened on that planet  
 recently from one of our satellites this shows that it 's earth like we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening  
 so it is a dynamic planet  and activity is going on as we speak today
  rovers people wonder now what are they doing today so i thought i would show you a little bit what they are doing  
 this is one very large crater geologists love craters  because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground without really working at it and you can see what 's below the surface so this is called victoria crater which is about a few football fields
 in size and
  if you look at the top left you see a little teeny dark dot this picture was taken from an orbiting satellite 
 if i zoom on it you can see  that 's the rover on the surface  so that was taken from orbit we had the camera zoom on the surface  and we actually saw the rover on the surface and we actually used 
  the combination of the satellite images and the rover to actually conduct science because we can observe large areas and then you can get those rovers to move around
 is that rover is going down in that crater as i told you  geologists love craters  and the reason is many of you went to the grand canyon and you see in the wall of the grand canyon you see these layers 
 and what these layers that 's what the surface used to be a million years ago  ten million years ago one hundred million years ago and you get deposits on top
  so if you can read the layers it 's like reading your book  and you can learn the history of what happened in the past in that location  so what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall 
 of that crater  and the rover is going down now measuring  you know the properties and analyzing the rocks as it 's going down  you know that canyon  now  it 's kind of 
  a little bit of a challenge driving down a slope like this if you were there you wouldn 't do it yourself  but we really made sure we tested those rovers before we got them down
  that rover and made sure that it 's all working well  
 now when i came last time shortly after the landing i think it was like a hundred days after the landing i told you i was surprised that those rovers are lasting even a hundred days  
 well here we are four years later and they 're still working now you say charles you are really lying to us and so on but that 's not true we really believed they were going to
  last ninety days or one
 hundred days because they are solar powered 
 and mars is a dusty planet  so we expected the dust would start accumulating on the surface and after a while we wouldn 't have enough power you know to keep them warm 
 well i always say it 's important that you are smart but every once in a while it 's good to be lucky  
 and that 's what we found out it turned out that every once in a while there are dust devils which come by on mars as you are seeing here and when the
 dust devil comes over the rover it just cleans it up it is like a brand new
 car that you have  and that 's literally why they have lasted so long  and now we designed them reasonably well
   but that 's exactly why they are lasting that long and still providing
 all the science data  now the two rovers each one of them is kind of getting old  you know one of them one of the wheels is stuck is not working one of the front wheels so what we are doing we are driving it backwards
 and the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint you know it 's not working very
  well so it 's walking like this and we can move the arm you know that way but still they are producing a lot of scientific data  
 now during that whole period a number of people got excited you know  outside the science community
 about about these rovers so i thought i 'd show you a video just to give you a reflection about how these rovers are being viewed by people other than
 than the science community so let me go on the next short video
 this video is pretty accurate of
  let me continue on showing you a little bit about the beauty of that planet  as i said earlier it looked very much like earth so you see sand dunes  it looks like i could have told
  these are pictures taken from the sahara desert or somewhere and you 'd have believed me but these are pictures taken from mars  but one area which is particularly intriguing for us is the northern region you know 
 of mars close to the north pole because we see ice caps  and we see the ice caps shrinking and expanding
  so it 's very much like you have in northern canada  and we wanted to find out and we see all kinds of glacial features on it so we wanted to find out actually what is that ice made of 
 and could that have embedded in it some organic
  so we have a spacecraft which is heading towards mars called phoenix  and that spacecraft will land seventeen days seven hours
 and twenty seconds from now so you can adjust your watch  so it 's on may twenty five
 around just before five o 'clock our time here on the west coast actually we will be landing on another planet  and as you can see this is a picture
  the spacecraft put on mars but i thought that just in case you 're going to miss that show you know in seventeen days i 'll show you kind of a little bit of what 's going to happen video
 that 's what we call the seven minutes of
  actually heat them and look what gases will come from it so this was launched about nine months ago we
 'll be coming in at twelve thousand miles per hour and in seven minutes we have to stop and touch the surface very softly so we don 't break
  the first mission that 's going to try to land near the north pole of mars and it 's the first mission that 's actually going to try and reach out and touch water on the surface of another planet lynn craig where there tends
  to be water at least on earth there tends to be life and so it 's potentially a place where life could have existed on the planet
  surface of mars and our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aeroshell eb looks kind of like an ice cream cone 
 more or less bc and on the front of it is this heat shield this saucer looking thing that has about a half inch of essentially what 's cork on the front of it 
 which is our heat shield now this is really special cork and this cork is what 's going to protect us from the violent atmospheric entry that we 're about to experience rob grover 
 friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft
  the friction when it
 's flying through the atmosphere to our advantage to slow us down bc from this point we 're going to decelerate from twelve thousand five hundred miles an hour
 down to nine hundred miles an hour eb the outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the sun rg the
 temperature of the heat shield can reach two thousand six hundred degrees fahrenheit eb
 the inside doesn 't get very hot it probably gets about room temperature
 this window of opportunity
 within which we can deploy the parachute eb if
 you fire the ' chute too early the parachute itself could fail the fabric and the stitching could just pull apart and
 that would be bad bc 
 in the first fifteen seconds after we deploy the parachute we 'll decelerate from nine hundred miles an hour to a relatively slow two hundred and fifty miles
  we no longer need the heat shield to protect us from the force of atmospheric entry  so we jettison the heat shield exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of mars lc after
 the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect
 how far phoenix really is from the ground
 to where we want to be but that last one percent as it always seems to be is the tricky part eb now the spacecraft actually has to
 decide when it 's going to get rid of its parachute bc we separate from the lander going one hundred and twenty five miles an hour at roughly a kilometer above the surface of mars three thousand two hundred feet 
 that 's like taking two empire state buildings and stacking them on top of one another eb that 's when we
  it 's also trying to use all of its actuators to make sure that it 's in the right position to land eb and then it has to light up its engines  
 right itself and then
  earth and mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes
 for a signal from mars to get to earth 
 and edl itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes so by the time you even hear from the lander that edl has started it 'll already be over eb 
 we have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft
 so that it can land itself safely 
 bc edl is this immense technically challenging problem it 's about getting a spacecraft that 's hurtling through deep space and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out how to get it down to the surface of mars at zero miles an hour
 it 's this immensely exciting and challenging problem 
 hopefully it
  in here so it will be a very a very tense moment you know as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet  
 so now let me talk about the next things that we are doing  so we are in the process as we speak of actually designing the next rover that we are going to be sending to mars so i thought i would go a little bit and tell you kind of the steps
 we go through it 's very similar to what you do when you design your product  as you saw a little bit earlier  when we were doing the phoenix one we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing  so we have to study all
  kinds of different materials the shape that we want to do in general we don 't try to please the customer here what we want to do is to make to make sure we have an effective  you know an efficient
 kind of machine first we start by we want to have our employees to be as imaginative as they can  
 and we really love being close to the art center because we have as a matter of fact one of the alumni from the art center eric nyquist
  design or spacecraft design room just to get people to think wildly
 about things we have a bunch of legos so as i said  this is a playground for adults where they sit down and try to play with different shapes and different
 designs  then we get a little bit more serious so we have what we call our cad cams and all the engineers who are involved or scientists who are involved who know about thermal properties know about design know about atmospheric
  interaction  parachutes all of these things which they work in a team effort and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent so to see does that meet the requirement
 that we need on the right also we have to take into account the environment of the planet where we are going if you are going to jupiter you have a very high radiation you know 
 environment it 's about the same radiation environment close by jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor so just imagine you take your
  and throw it into a nuclear reactor and it still has to work so these are kind of some of the little challenges you know 
 that we have to face if we are doing entry we have to do tests of parachutes  you saw in the video a parachute breaking that would be a bad day you know if
 that happened so we have to test because we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds we are coming at
  high speeds and we are deploying them to slow us down so we have to do all kinds of tests to give you an idea of the size you know 
 of that parachute relative to the people standing there next step we go and actually build some kind of test models
 and actually test them
 you know in the lab at jpl in what we call our mars yard we kick them we hit them we drop them  just to make sure we understand how where would they break  and then we back
  you know from that point
 and then we actually do the actual building and and the flight  and this next rover that we 're flying is about the size of a car 
 that big shield that you see outside that 's a heat shield which is going to protect it  and that will be basically built over the next year and it will be launched june a year from now now in that case because it was a very big
  we couldn 't use airbags and i know many of you kind of last time afterwards said well that was a cool cool thing to have those airbags unfortunately this rover is like ten times the size of the you know
 mass wise of the other rover or three times the mass so we can 't use airbags so we have to come up with another ingenious idea of how do we land it  and we didn 't want to
 take it propulsively all the way to the surface because we didn 't want to contaminate the surface we wanted the rover to immediately land on its legs  so we came up with this ingenious idea which
  is used here on earth for helicopters actually the lander will come down to about one hundred feet and hover
 above that surface for one hundred feet and then we have a sky crane which will take that rover and land it down on the surface  hopefully it all will work  you know it will work that way  
 and that rover will be more kind of like a chemist what we are going to be doing with that rover as it drives around it 's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks so it will have
  arm which will take samples put them in an oven crush and analyze them  but also if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cliff we have a little laser system 
  which will actually zap the rock  evaporate some of it and actually analyze what 's coming from that rock so it 's a little bit like star wars you know  but it 's real it 's real stuff
  train that rover to actually in addition to do this to actually serve cocktails  you know also on mars  so that 's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of  
 you know fun things we are doing on mars i thought i 'd go to the lord of the rings now and show you some of the things we have there now the lord of the rings 
 has two things played through it  one it 's a very attractive
  just has the beauty of the rings and so on but for scientists also the rings have a special meaning because we believe they represent on a small scale  how the solar system actually formed
 some of the scientists believe that the way the solar system formed that the sun when it collapsed and actually created the sun 
 a lot of the dust around it created rings and then the particles in those rings accumulated together and they formed
  the idea is by watching saturn we 're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale so it 's like a test bed for it so let me show you a little bit on
 what that saturnian system looks like first i 'm going to fly you over the over the rings by the way all of this is real stuff  this is not animation or anything like this this is actually taken
 from the satellite that we have in orbit around saturn the cassini
 and you see the amount of detail that is in those rings which are the particles some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles so that 's why you have these gaps is because a small satellite you know is being formed in that location  
 now you think that those rings are very large objects yes they are very large in one dimension in the other dimension they are paper thin 
 very very thin what you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on saturn itself  and that 's one of the
 satellites which was actually formed on that one so think about it as 
 huge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles  
 which is rotating 
 and we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form each one looking very different and very odd and that keeps scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this and telling nasa we need more money so we can explain what these things look like or why they formed that way
  satellites which were particularly interesting one of them is called enceladus  it 's a satellite which was all made of ice  and we measured it from orbit made of ice but there was something bizarre 
  about it  if you look at these stripes in here  what we call tiger stripes when we flew over them all of a sudden we saw an increase in the temperature 
  back and guess what we saw geysers coming out so this is a yellowstone you know 
 of saturn we are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet which indicate that most likely there is an ocean  you know below the surface and somehow through some dynamic effect we 're having these geysers which are being you know 
 emitted from it and the
  reason i showed the little arrow there i think that should say thirty miles  
 we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft through the plume of that geyser so we can actually measure
  the material that it is made of that was [ unclear ] also you know  because we were worried about the risk of it but it worked pretty well  we flew at the top of it
 and we found that there is a fair amount of organic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice  and over the next few years as we keep orbiting
  to get closer and closer down to the surface and make more accurate measurements  
 now  another satellite also attracted a lot of attention and that 's titan  and the reason titan is particularly interesting  it 's a satellite bigger than our moon 
 and it has an atmosphere  and that atmosphere is very as dense as our own atmosphere so if you were on titan  you would feel the same pressure that you feel in here  
 except it 's a lot colder and
  that atmosphere is heavily made of methane  now methane gets people all excited because it 's organic material so immediately people start thinking could life have evolved
 in that location when you have a lot of organic
 material  so people believe now that titan is most likely what we call a pre biotic planet  because it 's so cold
  organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material and therefore life could have evolved on it  so it could be earth  frozen three billion years ago before life 
 actually started on it  so that 's getting a lot of interest and to show you some example of what we did in there we actually dropped a probe which was developed by our colleagues in europe  we dropped a probe as we were
  looked like the coast of california for me you see the rivers which are coming along the coast  and you see that white area which looks like catalina island and that looks like an ocean  
 and then with an instrument we have on board a radar instrument we found there are lakes like the great lakes in here so it looks very much like earth it looks like there are rivers on it there are oceans or lakes we know there are
  we think it 's raining also on it so it 's very much like the cycle on earth except
 because it 's so cold it could not be water you know
 because water would have frozen  
 what it turned out that all that we are seeing all this liquid [ is made of ] hydrocarbon and ethane and methane similar to what you put in your car so here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our earth  
 but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material  so if you were on mars
 sorry on titan you don 't have to worry about
  drive to the nearest lake stick your hose in it and you 've got your car filled up on the other hand if you light a match the whole planet will blow up 
 so in closing i said i want to close by a couple of pictures and just to kind of put us in perspective  this is a picture of saturn taken with a spacecraft 
 from behind saturn looking towards the sun the sun is behind saturn so we see what we call
  scattering so it highlights all the rings 
 and i 'm going to zoom there is a i 'm not sure you can see it very well but on the top left around ten o 'clock there is a little teeny dot  and that 's earth  
 you barely can see ourselves  so what i did i thought i 'd zoom on it  so as you zoom in you know
 you can see earth you know just in the middle here so we zoomed all the way on the art center
