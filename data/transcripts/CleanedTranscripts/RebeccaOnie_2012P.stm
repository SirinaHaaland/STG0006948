  so my freshman year of college i signed up for an internship in the housing unit at greater boston legal services  
 showed up the first day ready to make coffee and photocopies  but was paired with this
  deeply inspired attorney named jeff purcell who thrust me onto the front lines from the very first day  
 and over the course of nine months i had the chance to have dozens of conversations with low income families in boston
 who would come in presenting with housing issues but always had an underlying health issue  
 so i had a client who came in about to be evicted because he hasn 't paid his rent  but he hasn 't paid his rent of course because he 's paying for his
  hiv medication and just can 't afford both 
 we had moms who would come in daughter has asthma  wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning 
 and one of our litigation strategies was actually to send me into the home of these clients with these large glass bottles  
 and i would collect the cockroaches hot glue gun them to this poster board that we 'd bring to court for our cases  
 and we always won because the
  judges were just so grossed out far more effective i have to say than anything i later learned in law school  
 but over the course of these nine months i grew frustrated with feeling like we were intervening too far downstream in the lives of our clients that by the time they came to us  they were already in
  and at the end of my freshman year of college i read an article about the work that dr barry zuckerman was doing as chair of pediatrics at boston medical center  and his first hire was a legal services attorney to represent the patients  
 so i called barry and with his blessing in october 
 walked into the waiting room of the pediatrics clinic at boston medical center i
  never forget the tvs played this endless reel of cartoons 
 and the exhaustion of mothers who had taken two  three  sometimes four buses to bring their child to the doctor was just palpable  
 the doctors it seemed never really had enough time for all the patients try as they might and over the course of six months i would corner them in the hallway and ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question 
 if you had unlimited resources what 's the one thing you would give your patients
 and i heard the same story again and again a story we 've heard hundreds of times since then 
 they said every day we have patients that come into the clinic child has an ear infection i prescribe antibiotics  but the real issue is there 's no food at home  
 the real issue is that child is living with twelve other
  and i don 't even ask about those issues because there 's nothing i can do  
 i have thirteen minutes with each patient patients are piling up in the clinic waiting room  i have no idea where the nearest food pantry is  and i don 't even have any help 
 in that clinic even today there are two social workers for twenty four thousand pediatric patients  which is better than a lot of the clinics out there  
 so health leads was born of these conversations a simple model where doctors and nurses
  can prescribe nutritious food heat in the winter and other basic resources for their patients the same way they prescribe medication 
 patients then take their prescriptions to our desk in the clinic waiting room where we have a core of well trained college student advocates who work side by side 
  with these families to connect them out to the existing landscape of community resources  
  with a card table in the clinic waiting room totally lemonade stand style  
 but today we have a thousand college student advocates who are working to connect nearly nine thousand patients and their families with the resources that they need to be healthy  
 so eighteen months ago i got this email that changed my life and the email was from dr jack geiger who had written to congratulate me on health leads
  and to share as he said a bit of historical context in 
  geiger founded one of the first two community health centers in this country in a brutally poor area in the mississippi delta  
 and so many of his patients came in presenting with malnutrition that be began prescribing food for them
  and they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket which would fill them and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic  
 and when the office of economic opportunity in washington d c which was funding geiger 's clinic found out about this they were furious  
 and they sent this bureaucrat down to tell geiger that he was expected to use their dollars for medical care
 to which geiger famously and logically responded the last time i checked my textbooks the specific therapy for malnutrition was food
 so
 when i got this email from dr geiger i knew i was supposed to be proud to be part of this history  but the truth is i was devastated 
 here we are forty five years after geiger has prescribed food for his patients  and i have doctors telling me on
  years after geiger health leads has to reinvent the prescription for basic resources  
 so i have spent hours upon hours trying to make sense of this weird groundhog day  
 how is it that if for decades we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients and especially low income patients healthy that we didn 't use it 
 if we know what it takes to have a healthcare system
 rather than a sick care system  why don 't we just do it 
 these questions in my mind are not hard because the answers are complicated 
 they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves 
 my belief is that it 's almost too painful to articulate our aspirations for
  our healthcare system or even admit that we have any at all because if we did they would be so removed from our current reality  
 but that doesn 't change my belief that all of us
  deep inside  here in this room and across this country  share a similar set of desires 
 that if we are honest with ourselves and listen quietly
  that we all harbor one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare that it keep us healthy 
 this aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy is an enormously powerful one  and
 the way i think about this is that healthcare is like any other system it 's just a set of choices that people make 
 what if we decided to make a different set of choices
  what if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare that have drifted away from us and stand firm and say no these things are ours  
 they will be used for our purposes  they will be used to realize our aspiration 
 what if everything we needed to realize our aspiration for healthcare was right there in front of us just waiting to be claimed  
 so that 's where health leads
  we started with the prescription pad a very ordinary piece of paper and we asked not what do patients need to get healthy
 antibiotics an inhaler medication
 but what do patients need to be healthy to not get sick in the first place  and we chose to use the prescription for that purpose  
 so just a few miles from here at children 's national medical center when patients come into
  they 're asked a few questions  they 're asked are you running out of food at the end of the month do you have safe housing 
 and when the doctor begins the visit she knows height  weight is there food at home is the family living in a shelter  and that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices  but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient using health leads like any other 
 referral  the problem is once you get a taste of what it 's like to realize your aspiration for
  healthcare you want more  
 so we thought if we can get individual doctors to prescribe these basic resources for their patients  
 could we get an entire healthcare system to shift its presumption 
 and we gave it a shot  so now at harlem hospital center when patients come in with an elevated body mass index the electronic medical record automatically generates a prescription for health leads
  our volunteers can then work with them to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs in their communities 
 we 've created a presumption that if you 're a patient at that hospital with an elevated bmi  
 the four walls of the doctor 's office probably aren 't going to give you everything you need to be healthy you need more  
 so on the one hand this is just a basic recoding of the electronic medical record and on the other hand it 's a radical transformation
 of the electronic medical record from a static repository of diagnostic information to a health promotion tool 
 in the private sector when you squeeze that kind of additional value out of a fixed cost investment it 's called a billion dollar company  
 but in my world it 's called reduced obesity and
  it 's called healthcare
 a system where doctors can prescribe solutions to improve health not just manage disease  
 same thing in the clinic waiting room  so every day in this country three million patients pass through about one hundred and fifty thousand clinic waiting rooms in this country  
 and what do they do when they 're there  
 they sit 
 they watch the goldfish in the fish tank  they read extremely old copies of good housekeeping magazine  
  we all just sit there forever waiting how did we get here where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours to waiting 
 what if we had a waiting room where you don 't just sit when you 're sick but where you go to get healthy  
 if airports can become shopping malls
 and mcdonald 's can become playgrounds  surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room and that 's what health leads has tried to
  do to reclaim that real estate and that time and to use it as a gateway to connect patients to the resources they need to be healthy  
 so it 's a brutal winter in the northeast your kid has asthma your heat just got turned off and of course you 're in the waiting room of the er because the cold air triggered your child 's asthma  
 but what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously  the waiting room became the place where health leads turned your heat back on 
 and of course all
  of this requires a broader workforce but if we 're creative we already have that too we know that our doctors and nurses and even social workers
 aren 't enough that the ticking minutes of health care are too constraining health just takes more time it requires a
  army of community health
 workers and case managers and many others what if a small part of that next healthcare workforce were the eleven million college students in this country  
 unencumbered by clinical responsibilities  unwilling to take no for an answer from those bureaucracies that tend to crush patients 
 and with an unparalleled ability for information retrieval honed through years of using google 
 now lest you think it improbable that a college volunteer can make
  this kind of commitment  i have two words for you march madness  
 the average ncaa division i men 's basketball player dedicates thirty nine hours a week to his sport  
 now we may think that 's good or bad but in either case it 's real and health leads is based on the presumption that for too
  too long we have asked too little of our college students when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities 
 college sports teams say we 're going to take dozens of hours at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning and we 're going to measure your performance and your team 's performance and if you don 't measure up or you don 't show up we 're going to cut you off the team 
 but we 'll make huge investments in your training and development and we 'll give you an
  and people line up out the door just for the chance to be part of it so our feeling is if it 's good enough for the rugby team it 's good enough for health and poverty 
 health leads too recruits competitively  trains intensively  coaches professionally  demands significant time builds a cohesive team and measures results a kind of teach for america for
  now in the top ten cities in the u s with the largest number of medicaid patients  each of those has at least twenty thousand college students new york alone has half a million college students 
 and this isn 't just a sort of short term workforce to connect patients to basic resources 
 it 's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline who 've spent two three four years in the clinic waiting room
  talking to patients about their most basic health needs  and they leave with the conviction the ability and the efficacy to realize our most basic aspirations for health care 
 and the thing is there 's thousands of these folks already out there  
 so mia lozada is chief resident of internal medicine at ucsf medical center  but for three years as an undergraduate she was a health leads volunteer in the clinic waiting room at
  when my classmates write a prescription  they think their work is done 
 when i write a prescription i think can the family read the prescription 
 do they have transportation to the pharmacy do they have food to take with the prescription  do they have insurance to fill the prescription 
 those are the questions i learned at health leads not in medical school 
 now none of these solutions the prescription pad the electronic medical record the waiting room the army of college students are perfect
  perfect  but they are ours for the taking simple examples of the vast
  healthcare resources that if we reclaimed and redeployed could realize our most basic aspiration of healthcare 
 so i had been at legal services for about nine months when this idea of health leads started percolating in my mind  and i knew i had to tell jeff purcell my attorney
  that i needed to leave and i was so nervous because i thought
 he was going to be disappointed in me for abandoning our clients for some crazy idea  
 and i sat down with him and i said jeff i have this idea that we could mobilize college students to address patients ' most basic health needs 
 and i 'll be honest all i wanted was for him to not be angry at me  
 but he said this
 when you have a vision you have an obligation to realize that vision you must pursue that vision 
 and i have to say i was like whoa 
 that 's a lot of pressure i just wanted a blessing i didn 't want some kind of mandate  
 but the truth is i 've spent every waking minute nearly since then chasing that vision  
 i believe that
  we all have a vision for healthcare in this country  
 i believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare  it will not be by the diseases cured  but by the diseases prevented  
 it will not be by the excellence of our technologies or the sophistication of our specialists  but by how rarely we needed them 
 and most of all i believe that when we measure healthcare
  it will be not by what the system was but by what we chose it to be  thank you
