  years ago scientists at cern created the world wide web  
 since then the internet has transformed the way we communicate the way we do business and even the way we live
  the ideas that gave birth to google facebook  twitter  and so many others have now really transformed our lives  and this has brought us many real benefits such as a more connected society  
 however there are also some downsides to this  today  the average person has an astounding amount of personal information online  
 and we add to this online information
  every single time we post on facebook each time we search on google  and each time we send an email now 
 many of us probably think  well one email there 's nothing in there right  
 but if you consider a year 's worth of emails or maybe even a lifetime of email  collectively this tells a lot 
 it tells where we have been who we have met  and in many ways even what we 're
  the more scary part about this is our data now lasts forever  so your data can and will outlive you 
 what has happened is that we 've largely lost control over our data and also our privacy
  so this year as the web turns twenty five it 's very important for us to take a moment
 and think about the implications of this  we have to really think we
  but actually what we 've also lost is the idea of privacy itself 
 if you think about it  most of us here today probably remember what life was like before the internet  
 but today there 's a new generation that is being taught from a very young age to share everything online  
 and this is a generation that is not going to remember when data was private  
 so we keep going down this road  twenty years from now the word ' privacy ' is going to have a completely different meaning from what it means to you and
 so it 's time for us to take a moment and think is there anything we can do about this  and i believe there is 
 let 's take a look at one of the most widely used forms of communication in the world today email 
 before the invention of email  we largely communicated using letters  and the process was quite simple 
 you would first start by writing your message on a piece of paper then you would place it into a
  sealed envelope  and from there you would go ahead and send it after you put a stamp and address on it  
 unfortunately today when we actually send an email  we 're not sending a letter what you are sending in many ways is actually a postcard 
 and it 's a postcard in the sense that everybody that sees it from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient can
  the entire contents  so the solution to this has been known for some time and there 's many attempts to do it  
 the most basic solution is to use encryption and the idea is quite simple first you encrypt the connection between your computer and the email server 
 then you also encrypt the data as it sits on the server itself  
 but there 's a problem with this  and that is the email servers also hold the encryption keys  so now you have a really big lock with a key placed right next to it
  not only that  any government could lawfully ask for and get the key to your data and this is all without you being aware of it  
 so the way we fix this problem is actually
 relatively easy in principle you give everybody their own keys  and then you make sure the server doesn 't actually have the keys this seems like common sense
  so the question that comes up is why hasn 't this been done yet  
 well  if we really think about it  we see that the business model of the internet today really isn 't compatible with privacy 
 just take a look at some of the biggest names on the web  
 and you see that advertising plays a huge role in fact this year alone  advertising is one hundred and thirty seven billion dollars and to optimize the ads that are shown to us
  companies have to know everything about us  they need to know where we live 
 how old we are what we like what we don 't like 
 and anything else they can get their hands on and if you think about it  the best way to get this information is really just to invade our privacy  
 so these companies aren 't going to give us our privacy  if we want to have privacy online what we have to do is we 've got to go out and get it ourselves 
 for many years when it came to email  the only solution was something known as pgp
  was quite complicated and only accessible to the tech savvy 
 here 's a diagram that basically shows the process for encrypting and decrypting messages  
 so needless to say this is not a solution for everybody  and this actually is part of the problem because if you think about communication 
 by definition it involves having someone to communicate with
  so while pgp does a great job of what it 's designed to do 
 for the people out there who can 't understand how to use it  the option to communicate privately simply does not exist  and this is a problem that we need to solve  
 so if we want to have privacy online  the only way we can succeed is if we get the whole world on board  
 and this is only possible if we bring down the barrier to entry 
 i think this is actually the key challenge that lies in the tech community what
 we really have to do is work and make privacy more accessible  
 so last summer  when the edward snowden story came out several colleagues and i decided to see if we could make this happen 
 at that time we were working at the european organization for nuclear research at the world 's largest particle collider  which collides protons by the way 
 we were all scientists so we used our scientific creativity and came up with a very creative name for our
  many startups these days actually begin in people 's garages or people 's basements  
 we were a bit different we started out at the cern cafeteria  which actually is great because look you have all the food and water you could ever want  
 but even better than this is that every day between twelve 
 free of charge  the cern cafeteria comes with several thousand scientists and engineers  and these guys basically know the answers to everything
  so it was in this environment that we began working 
 what we actually want to do is we want to take your email and turn it into something that looks more like this  but more importantly we want to do it in a way that you can 't even tell that it 's happened  
 so to do this  we actually need a combination of technology and also design 
 so how do we go about doing
  it 's probably a good idea not to put the keys on the server  
 so what we do is we generate encryption keys on your computer 
 and we don 't generate a single key  but actually a pair of keys  so there 's an rsa private key and an rsa public key 
 and these keys are mathematically connected  so let 's have a look and see how this works when multiple people communicate  
 so here we have bob and alice who want to communicate privately
  key challenge is to take bob 's message and to get it to alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message  so what we have to do is we have to encrypt it before it even leaves bob 's computer 
 and one of the tricks is we encrypt it using the public key from alice 
 now this encrypted data is sent through the server to
  because the message was encrypted using alice 's public key  the only key that can now decrypt it is a private key that belongs to alice 
 and it turns out alice is the only person that actually has this key  so we 've now accomplished the objective  which is to get the message from bob to alice without the server being able to read what 's going on 
 actually what i 've shown here is a highly simplified picture  the reality is much more complex and it requires a lot of software that looks a bit like this
  this  and that 's actually the key design challenge how do we take all this complexity
  all this software and implement it in a way that the user cannot see it  
 i think with protonmail we have gotten pretty close to doing this so let 's see how it works in practice 
 here we 've got bob and alice again who
 want to communicate securely  they simply create accounts on protonmail which is quite simple and takes a few moments  and
 all the key encryption and generation is happening automatically in the background as bob is creating his account 
 once his account is created he just clicks compose and now he can write his email like he does today  
 so he fills in his information and then after that all he has to do is click send 
 and just like that
  without doing anything different from how he writes email today bob has just sent an encrypted message what we have here
 is really just the first step but it shows that with improving technology privacy doesn 't have to be difficult  it doesn 't have to be disruptive 
 if we change the goal from maximizing ad revenue to protecting data we can actually make it accessible 
 now i know a question on everybody 's minds is okay  protecting privacy
  this is a great goal  but can you actually do this without the tons of money that advertisements give you 
 and i think the answer is actually yes  because today  we 've reached a point where people around the world really understand how important privacy is and when you have that anything is possible 
 earlier this year protonmail actually had so many users that we ran out of resources and when this happened  our community of users got together
  together and donated half a million dollars  so this is just an example of what can happen when you bring the community together towards a common goal we can also leverage the world 
 right now we have a quarter of a million people that have signed up for protonmail and these people come from everywhere  
 and this really shows that privacy is not just an american or a european issue  it 's a global issue that impacts all of us  it 's something that we really have to pay attention to going forward
 so what do we have to do to solve this problem well 
 first of all we need to support a different business model for the internet one that does not rely entirely on advertisements for revenue and for growth  
 we actually need to build a new internet
 where our privacy and our ability to control our data is first and foremost  but even more importantly  we have to build an internet
  privacy is no longer just an option but is also the default  
 we have done the first step with protonmail but this is really just the first step in a very very long journey  
 the good news i can share with you guys today  the exciting news is that we 're not traveling alone  the movement to protect people 's privacy and freedom online is really gaining momentum 
 and today  there are dozens of projects from all around the
  world who are working together to improve our privacy these projects protect things from our chat to voice communications 
 also our file storage our online search our online browsing 
 and many other things  and these projects are not backed by billions of dollars in advertising but they 've found support really from the people from private individuals like you and i from all over the world
  this really matters because ultimately
 privacy depends on each and every one of us  
 and we have to protect it now because our online data is more than just a collection of ones and zeros it 's actually a lot more than that it 's our lives our personal stories 
 our friends our families and in many ways  also our hopes and our aspirations 
 because without this  we simply can 't have a free society  
 so now 's the time for us to collectively stand up and say  yes  we do want to live in a world with online privacy and yes  we can work together to turn this vision into a reality
