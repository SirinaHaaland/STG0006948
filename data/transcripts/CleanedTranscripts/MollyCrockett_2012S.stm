  i do experiments to test how different chemicals in the brain influence the choices we make i 'm here to tell you the secret to successful
  sandwich 
 that 's right according to scientists a cheese sandwich is the solution to all your tough decisions how do i know 
 i 'm the scientist who did the study 
 a few years ago my colleagues and i were interested in how a brain chemical called serotonin would influence people 's decisions
  in social situations specifically we wanted to know how serotonin would affect the way people react
 when they 're treated unfairly  so we did an experiment we manipulated people 's serotonin levels by giving them this really 
 artificial lemon flavored drink that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin in the brain this is the amino acid tryptophan 
  so what we found was when tryptophan was low people were more likely to take revenge when they 're treated unfairly 
 that 's the study we did and here are some of the headlines that came out afterwards
  thing myself when these came out because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate we gave people this horrible tasting drink
 that affected their tryptophan levels  but it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found in cheese and chocolate  
 and of course when science says cheese and chocolate help you
  that 's sure to grab people 's attention  so there you have it the evolution of a headline 
 when this happened a part of me thought well  what 's the big deal  so the media oversimplified a few things but in the end 
 it 's just a news story  
 and i think a lot of scientists have this attitude  
 but the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time  and it affects not just the stories you read in the news
 but also the products you see on the shelves when the headlines rolled  what happened was the marketers came calling 
 would i be willing to provide a scientific endorsement of a mood boosting bottled water 
 or would i go on television to demonstrate in front of a live audience that comfort foods really do make you feel better 
 i think these folks meant well but
 had i taken them up on
  offers i would have been going beyond the science and good scientists are careful not to do this 
 but nevertheless neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing here 's one example neuro drinks 
 a line of products  including nuero bliss here  which according to its label helps reduce stress enhances
  provides focused concentration  and promotes a positive outlook i have to say this sounds awesome 
 laughter i could totally have used this ten minutes ago
  so when this came up in my local shop naturally i was curious about some of the research backing these claims 
 so i went to the company 's website looking to find some controlled trials
  but i didn 't find any  trial or no trial these claims are front and center on their label right next to a picture of a brain  
 and it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties 
 a couple of researchers asked a few hundred people to read a scientific article for half the people the article included a brain
  and for the other half it was the same article but it didn 't have a brain image
 at the end you see where this is going people were asked whether they agreed with the conclusions of the article  
 so this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image  
 and this is how much they agree with the same article that did include a brain image  
 so the take home message here is do you want to sell it 
 put a brain on it 
 let me pause here and take a moment to say that neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades  and we 're constantly discovering amazing things about the brain
  like just a couple of weeks ago neuroscientists at mit figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain 
 really cool stuff
 but the promise of neuroscience has led to some really high expectations
 and some overblown unproven claims  so what i 'm going to do is show you how to spot
 a couple of classic moves  dead giveaways really for what 's variously been called
  's thoughts and emotions here 's a study
 published by a team of researchers as an op ed in the new york times  the headline you love your iphone  literally 
 it quickly became the most emailed article on the site 
 so how 'd they figure this out they put sixteen people inside a brain scanner and showed them videos of ringing iphones
 the brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain called the insula  a region they say is linked to feelings of love and compassion  
 so they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula this meant the subjects loved their iphones  
 now there 's just one problem with this line of reasoning  and that 's that the insula does a lot sure
  it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion  but it 's also involved in tons of other processes like memory  language attention  
 even anger  disgust and pain  
 so based on the same logic  i could equally conclude you hate your iphone  
 the point here is when you see activation in the insula you can 't just pick and choose
 your favorite explanation from off this list  
 and it 's a really long list  my colleagues tal yarkoni and russ poldrack have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published 
 so chances are really really good that your insula is going off right now
  but i won 't kid myself to think this means you love me
  so speaking of love and the brain 
 there 's a researcher  known to some as dr love who claims that scientists have found
 the glue that holds society together the source of love and prosperity this time it 's not a cheese sandwich 
  it 's a hormone called oxytocin you 've probably heard of it
 so dr love bases his argument on studies showing that when you boost people 's oxytocin this increases their trust 
 empathy and cooperation  
 so he 's calling oxytocin the moral molecule now these studies are scientifically valid  and they 've been replicated  but they 're not the
  other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin increases envy it increases gloating 
 oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group
 at the expense of other groups and in some cases oxytocin can even decrease cooperation  
 so based on these studies  i could say oxytocin is an immoral
  all over the headlines we see it in supermarkets on book covers what about the clinic 
 spect imaging is a  brain scanning technology that uses a radioactive tracer to track blood flow in the brain 
 for the bargain price of a few thousand dollars there are clinics
 in the u s that will give you one of these spect scans
 and use the image to help diagnose your problems these scans the clinics say can help prevent alzheimer 's disease  
 solve weight and addiction issues  overcome marital conflicts and
 treat of course a variety of mental illnesses ranging from depression to anxiety to
 this sounds great a lot of people agree some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions of dollars a year in business 
 there 's just one problem
  the broad consensus in neuroscience is that we can 't yet diagnose mental illness from a single brain scan  
 but these clinics have treated tens of thousands of patients to date  many of them children
  and spect imaging involves a radioactive injection so exposing people to radiation potentially harmful  
 i am more excited than most people as a neuroscientist about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness
 and even maybe to make us better
  and if one day we can say that cheese and chocolate help us make better decisions  count me in 
 but we 're not there yet 
 we haven 't found a buy button inside the brain 
 we can 't tell whether someone is lying or in love just by looking at their brain scans 
 and we can 't turn sinners into saints with hormones  
 maybe someday we will but until then we have to be
  careful that we don 't let overblown claims detract resources and attention away from the real science that 's playing a much longer game  
 so here 's where you come in if someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it don 't just take them at their word  
 ask the tough questions  ask to see the evidence ask for the part of the story that 's not being told
  the answers shouldn 't be simple because the brain isn 't simple  but that 's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway
