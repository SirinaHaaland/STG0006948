  it 's been reported that wikileaks your baby has 
 in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world 's media combined can that possibly be true
  it 's a worry isn 't it  that the rest of the world 's media is doing such a bad job that a little
 group of activists is able to release more of that type of information
 than the rest of the world press combined  
 ca how does it work how do people release the documents and how do you secure their privacy ja
 so these are
 as far as we can tell classical whistleblowers  and we have a number of ways for them to get
  to us  so we use this state of the art encryption to bounce stuff around the internet to hide trails  pass it through legal jurisdictions like sweden
 and belgium to enact those legal protections
  we get information in the mail  the regular postal mail
 encrypted
  or not vet it like a regular news organization format it which is sometimes something that 's quite hard to do when you 're talking about
 giant databases of information
 release it to the public and then
 defend ourselves ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks ca 
 so you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate  but you you actually
 almost never know who the identity of the source is
  do we ever know  and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible
 leaked a few years ago if we can have this document up  so this was a story in kenya a few years ago can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ja 
 so this is the kroll report this was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the kenyan government
 after its election in two thousand and four prior to two thousand and four kenya was ruled by daniel arap moi for about eighteen years he was
  dictator of kenya  and when kibaki got into power through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in kenya
 they commissioned this report spent about two
 million pounds on this and an associated report and then the government sat on it
 and used it for political leverage on moi who was the richest man still is the richest man in kenya  it 's the holy
  grail of kenyan journalism so i went there in two thousand and seven and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election
 the national election  december twenty eight 
 when we released that report we did so three days after the new president kibaki
  had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out daniel arap moi  so this report then
 became a dead albatross around
 president kibaki 's neck ca and
 i mean to cut a long story short word of the report leaked into kenya not from the official media but indirectly and in
  so this became front page of the guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of kenya in tanzanian and
 south african press  and so it came in from the outside and that 
 after a couple of days made the kenyan press feel safe to talk about it and it ran for twenty nights straight on kenyan tv shifted the vote
 by ten percent according to a kenyan intelligence report
  going to just show a short clip from this
 baghdad airstrike video  the video itself is longer but here 's a short clip this is this is intense material i should warn
  on the people who worked on it was
 severe  we ended up sending two people to baghdad to further research that story  so this is just the first
 of three attacks that occurred
 in that scene ca so i mean eleven people died in that attack right including two reuters employees ja yeah two reuters employees two
  i guess people can see the gross disparity in force you have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street and then an apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing
  cannon shells on everyone looking for any excuse to do so
 and killing people rescuing the wounded  and there was two journalists involved that clearly weren 't insurgents because that 's their full time job ca 
 i mean there 's been this u s intelligence analyst  bradley manning arrested  and
 it 's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you along with two hundred and eighty thousand classified
  i mean  did he ja we have denied receiving those cables  he has been charged about five days ago  with
 obtaining one hundred and fifty thousand cables and releasing fifty now we had released 
 early in the year a cable from
 the reykjavik u s embassy  but this is not necessarily connected
  mean i was a known visitor of that embassy ca i mean  if you did receive thousands of u s embassy diplomatic cables ja we would have released them
 declassified cables  that 's the sort of material that 's there ca 
 so let 's talk a little more broadly about this i mean in general  what 's your philosophy why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ja 
 well there 's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world what sort of information can achieve
 reform  and there 's a lot of information so information that organizations are spending
 economic effort into concealing  that 's a really good signal that when the information gets out there 's a hope of it doing some good
 because the organizations that know it best that know it from the inside out are spending work to conceal it
  and that 's what we 've found in practice and that 's what
 the history of journalism is ca but
 are there risks with that  either to the individuals
  concerned or indeed to
 society at large where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ja 
 not that we have seen with anything we have released i mean we have a harm immunization policy we have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal
 personally identifying information in it but
 there are legitimate
  your records with your doctor that 's a legitimate secret
 but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well motivated ca 
 so they are well motivated and what would you say to for example the you know the parent of someone whose
 son is is out serving the u s military and he says you know what you 've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out it shows a u s soldier laughing at people dying
  the impression has given the impression to millions of people around the world that u s soldiers are inhuman people actually they 're not my son isn 't how dare you what would you say to that ja yeah 
 we do get a lot of that but remember  the people in baghdad the people in iraq the people in afghanistan
 they don 't need to see the video they see it every day  so it 's not going to change their opinion it 's not going to change their perception that 's what they see every day
  it will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all  and that 's our hope ca 
 so you found a way to shine light into
 what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government light is good
  any irony in the fact that in order for you to shine that light you have to yourself create secrecy around your sources ja not really i mean
 we don 't have any wikileaks dissidents yet we
 don 't have sources who are dissidents on other sources  should they come forward that would be a tricky situation for us but
 we 're presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled
  to continue our mission not to screw it up ca
 i 'd actually be interested just based on what we 've heard so far i 'm curious as to the opinion in the ted audience 
 you know there might be a couple of views of wikileaks and of julian  you know  
 hero people 's hero bringing
  it 's a soft crowd  julian a soft crowd we have to try better let 's show them another example now here 's something that
 you haven 't yet leaked but i think i think for ted you are i mean it
 's an intriguing story that 's just happened right
 what is this
  this is
 a sample of what we do sort of every day  so late last year in november last year there was a series of well blowouts in albania
  like the well blowout in the gulf of mexico but not quite as big  and
 we got a report
 a sort of engineering analysis into what happened saying that in fact security guards from
 some rival various competing oil firms had in fact  parked trucks there and blown them up and 
  part of the albanian government was in this etc etc 
 and the engineering report had nothing on the top of it so it was an extremely difficult document for us we couldn 't verify it because we didn 't know who wrote it
 and knew what it was about so we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up
  under that basis we put it out and said look we 're skeptical about this thing we don 't know  but what can we do  the material looks good it feels right but we just can 't verify it 
 and
 we then got a letter just this week
 from the company who wrote it  wanting to track down the source
  to track down the source and we were like oh tell us more what document is it precisely you 're talking about
 can you show that you had legal authority over that document is it really yours so they sent us
 this screen shot
 with the author in the microsoft word
  that 's happened quite a lot though this is like one of our methods of identifying of verifying what a material is is to try and get these guys to write letters ca yeah have you had
 information from inside bp ja yeah we have a lot but i
  we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort so our publication rate
 over the past few months has been sort of minimized while
 we 're re engineering our back systems for the
 phenomenal public interest that we have 
 that 's a problem  i mean  like any sort of growing startup organization  we are sort of overwhelmed by
 our growth and that means we 're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures
 of a very high caliber but don 't have enough people to actually
 process and vet this information ca so that 's the key bottleneck basically journalistic volunteers
 and or the funding of journalistic salaries ja yep yeah and trusted people i mean we 're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly
 because of the sort of material we we deal with so we have to restructure in order to
  have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff and then
 lower security cases ca 
 so help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this and i think i read that as as a kid you went to thirty seven different schools  can that be right ja well
 my
 parents were in the movie business
  and you were also i mean you were also a hacker at
  was a very young journalist activist at an early age i wrote a magazine was prosecuted for it when i was a teenager
  so you have to be careful with hacker i mean there 's like
 there 's a method
 that can be deployed for various things unfortunately at the moment  it 's mostly deployed by the russian mafia in order to steal your
  grandmother 's bank accounts  so this phrase is not not as nice as it used to be ca yeah well i certainly don 't think you 're stealing anyone 's
 grandmother 's bank account  but what about your core values  can you give us
 a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped
 determine them
  generous men do not create victims they nurture victims  and that 's something from my father and something from other
 capable generous men that have been in my life ca capable generous men do not create victims they nurture victims ja yeah  
  so i 'm not actually so big on the nurture but
 some way there is another way of nurturing victims which is to police perpetrators
 of crime and so that is something that has been in my character for a long time ca so just tell us 
  you basically published something there ran into trouble with a bank
 then the news service there was injuncted from running the story instead they publicized your side 
 that made you very high profile in iceland what happened next ja yeah this
 is a great case you know iceland went through this financial
  the hardest hit of any country in the world its banking sector was ten times the gdp of the rest of the economy  anyway so we release this report in in july
 last year  and the national tv station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air like out of a movie injunction landed on the news desk and the news reader was like this has never happened before what do we do well
 we just show the website instead for all that time as
  and we became very famous in iceland went to iceland and spoke about this issue  and there was a feeling in the community
 that
 that should never happen again and as a result  working with icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts we put together
 a new sort of package of legislation for iceland
 to sort of become an an offshore haven for the free press with the strongest journalistic
  protections in the world with a new
 nobel prize for freedom of speech iceland 's a nordic country so like norway it 's able to tap into the system  and just a
 month ago this was passed by the icelandic parliament unanimously
  when you think of the future then do you think it 's more likely to be big brother exerting more control more secrecy or us
 watching big brother or it 's just all to be played for either way ja i
 'm not sure which way it 's going to go  i mean there 's enormous pressures to harmonize
 freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world
 within the e u between china and the united states  which way is it going to go it 's hard to see 
 that 's why it 's a very interesting time to be in because with just a little bit of effort we can shift it
 one way or the other ca well it looks like i 'm reflecting the audience 's opinion to say julian  be careful and all
