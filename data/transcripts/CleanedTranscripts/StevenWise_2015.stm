  i 'd
 like to have you look at this pencil 
 it 's a thing it 's a legal thing  and so are books you might have or the cars you own 
 they 're all legal things  the great apes that you 'll see behind me  they too are
  things  now  i can do that to a legal thing i can do whatever i want to my book or my car 
 these great apes you 'll see the photographs are taken by a man named james
 mollison who wrote a book called james & other apes and he tells in his book how
  every single one them almost every one of them is an orphan who saw his mother and father die before his eyes  
 they 're legal things  
 so for centuries there 's been a great legal wall that separates legal things from legal persons  
 on one hand legal things are invisible to judges  they don 't count in law  they don 't have any legal rights  they don 't have the capacity for legal
  they are the slaves on the other side of that legal wall are the legal persons legal persons are very visible to judges  
 they count in law 
 they may have many rights  they have the capacity for an infinite number of rights  and they 're the masters 
 right now  all nonhuman animals are legal things  all human beings are legal persons
  being human and being a legal person has never been and is not today synonymous with
 a legal person  humans and legal persons are not synonymous on the one side there have been
 many human beings over the centuries who have been legal things  slaves were legal things  women children were
  great deal of civil rights struggle over the last centuries has been to punch a hole through that wall and begin to feed
 these human things through the wall and have them become legal persons  but alas that hole has closed up 
 now on the other side are legal persons  but they 've never only been limited to human
  there are for example there are many legal persons who are not even alive in the united states we 're aware of the fact that corporations are legal persons  
  india a court held that a hindu idol was a legal person that a mosque was a legal person 
 in two thousand the indian supreme court held that the holy books of the sikh religion was a legal person  
 and in two thousand and twelve just
  there was a treaty between the indigenous peoples of new zealand and the crown in which it was agreed that a river was a legal person who owned its own riverbed  
 now  i read peter singer 's book in one thousand 
 nine hundred and eighty when i had a full head of lush brown hair 
 and indeed i was moved by it because i had become a lawyer because i wanted to speak for the voiceless defend the defenseless and i 'd never realized how voiceless and defenseless the trillions
  of nonhuman animals are 
 and i began to work as an animal protection lawyer 
 and by one thousand nine hundred and eighty five 
 i realized that i was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients 
 all the animals whose interests i was trying to to defend were legal things
  they were invisible it was not going to work so i decided
 that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had to also be moved through a hole that we could open up again in that wall and begin feeding the appropriate nonhuman animals through that hole onto the other side of being legal
 legal persons  now at that time there was very little
 known about or spoken about about truly
  animal rights about the idea of having legal personhood or legal rights for a
 nonhuman animal and i knew it was going to take a long time  
 and so in one thousand nine hundred and eighty five i figured that it would it would take about thirty years before we 'd be able to even begin a strategic litigation long term campaign in order to to be able to punch another hole
 through through that wall it turned out that i was
 pessimistic that
  what we had to do in order to
 to begin was not only to
 write law review articles and
 teach classes write books but we had to then begin to get down to the nuts and bolts of how you litigate that kind of case  so one of the first things we needed to do was figure out what a cause of action was a legal cause of action and
 a legal cause of action is a vehicle that lawyers use to
 their arguments 
 in front of courts it turns out
 there 's a very interesting case that had occurred almost two hundred and fifty years ago in london called somerset vs stewart  whereby a black slave had used the legal system and had moved 
  from a legal thing to a legal person i was so interested in it that i eventually wrote wrote an entire book about it 
 west africa he survived the middle passage  and he was sold to a scottish businessman named charles stewart in virginia  
 now twenty years later stewart brought james somerset to london  and after he got there james decided he was going to escape  
 and so
 one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized because he wanted to get a set of godparents because to
  slave they knew that one of the major responsibilities of godfathers was to help you escape  
 and so in the fall of one thousand seven hundred and seventy one 
 james somerset had a confrontation with charles stewart  we don 't know exactly what happened but then james
 dropped out of sight an enraged charles stewart then hired slave catchers to canvass the city of london find him bring him not back to charles stewart
  but to a ship the ann and mary that was floating in
 london harbour and he was chained to the deck  
 and the ship was to set sail for jamaica where james was to be sold in the slave markets and be doomed to the three to five years of life that a slave had harvesting sugar cane in
 jamaica  well now james
  godparents swung into action 
 they approached the most powerful judge lord mansfield who was chief judge of the court of king 's bench  and they demanded that he issue a common law writ of habeus corpus on behalf of james somerset 
 now the common law is the kind of law that english speaking judges can make when they 're not cabined in by statutes or constitutions  
 and a writ of habeus corpus is called the great writ capital
  capital w and it 's meant to protect any of us who are detained against our will 
 a writ of habeus corpus is issued the detainer is required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily bodily
 liberty  well lord mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because if james somerset was a legal thing he was not
  a writ of habeus corpus only if he could be a legal person 
 so lord mansfield decided that he would assume  
 without deciding that james somerset was indeed a legal person  and he issued the writ of habeus corpus and james 's body was brought in by the captain of the ship 
 there were a series of hearings over the next six months on june twenty two one thousand seven hundred and seventy two lord mansfield said that slavery was so odious
  and he used the word odious that the common law would not support it and he ordered james free at that moment james somerset underwent a legal 
 the free man who walked out of the courtroom looked exactly like the slave who had walked in but as far as the law was concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common the
 next thing we did is that the nonhuman rights project which i founded then began to look at what kind of values and principles do we want to
  and principles did they imbibe with their mother 's milk were they taught in law school do they use every day do they believe with all their hearts and we chose liberty and equality  
 now liberty right is the kind of right to which you 're entitled because of how you 're put together  
 and
 a fundamental
 a fundamental liberty right protects a fundamental
  they are so powerful that in a common law country if you go to a hospital and you refuse  life saving medical treatment 
 a judge will not order it forced upon you because they will respect your 
   self determination and your autonomy 
 now an equality right is the kind of right to which you 're entitled because you resemble someone else in a relevant way and
 there 's the rub relevant way so if you if you are that then because they have the right you 're like them you 're entitled
 to the right now  courts and legislatures draw lines all the time some are included some are excluded  but
 you have to at the bare minimum you must
  that line has to be a reasonable means to a legitimate end
 the nonhuman rights project argues that drawing a line in order to enslave an autonomous and  self determining being like you 're seeing behind me 
 that that 's a violation of equality  
 we then searched through eighty jurisdictions it took us seven years to find the jurisdiction where we wanted to begin filing our first suit we chose the state of new york  
 then we decided upon who our plaintiffs are going to be we decided upon chimpanzees not just
  jane goodall was on our board of directors 
 but because they jane and others have studied chimpanzees intensively for decades  we know the extraordinary cognitive capabilities that they have and they also resemble the kind that human beings have  
 and so we chose
 chimpanzees and we began to then canvass the world to find the experts in chimpanzee cognition we found them in japan
  sweden germany scotland england and the united states  
 and amongst them  they wrote one hundred pages of affidavits in which they set out more than forty ways in which their complex cognitive
 capability either individually or together  all added up to autonomy and  self determination now  these included for example
  that they were conscious  but they 're also conscious that they 're conscious they know they have a mind they know that others have minds  
 they know they 're individuals  and that they can live they understand that they lived yesterday and they will live tomorrow  they engage in mental time travel they remember what happened yesterday they can anticipate tomorrow  
 which is why it 's so terrible to imprison a chimpanzee  especially alone it 's the thing that we do to our worst criminals and we do that to chimpanzees without even thinking about it 
  have some kind of moral capacity when they play economic games with human beings they 'll spontaneously make fair offers even when they 're not required to do so 
 they are numerate they understand numbers  they can do some simple math  
 they can engage in language or to stay out of the language wars they 're involved in intentional and referential
 communication in which they pay attention to the attitudes of those with whom they are speaking they have culture
 they have a material culture a social culture they have a symbolic culture  scientists in the in the ta forests in
 the ivory coast found chimpanzees who were using these rocks to smash open the incredibly hard
 hulls of nuts it takes a long time to learn how to do that and they excavated the area and they found that this material culture this way of doing it these rocks had passed
  down for at least four thousand three hundred years through two hundred and twenty five chimpanzee generations 
 so now we needed to find our chimpanzee our chimpanzee  
 first we found two of them in the state of new york  both of them would die before we could even get our suits filed then we found tommy  
 tommy is a chimpanzee you see him behind me  tommy was a chimpanzee we found
  that cage  we found him in a small room that was filled with cages
 in a larger warehouse structure on a used trailer lot in central new york  
 we found kiko who is partially deaf  
 kiko was in the back of a cement storefront in western massachusetts  and we found hercules and leo  they 're two young male chimpanzees who are being used for biomedical anatomical research at stony brook  we found them
 and so on the last week of december two thousand and thirteen the
 nonhuman rights project filed three suits all across the state of new york using the same common law writ of habeus corpus argument
 that had been used with james somerset and we demanded that the judges issue these common law writs of habeus corpus we wanted the chimpanzees
  and we wanted them brought to save the chimps a tremendous chimpanzee sanctuary in south florida which involves an artificial artificial lake 
 with twelve or thirteen islands there are two or three acres where two dozen chimpanzees live on each of them  and these chimpanzees would then live the life of a chimpanzee with other
  our lord mansfield  we shall  we shall this is a long term strategic
 litigation campaign  we shall and to quote
 winston churchill the way we view our cases is that they 're not the end  
 they 're not even the beginning of the end  but they are perhaps the end of the beginning
