  for the past decade  i 've been studying non state armed groups 
 armed organizations like terrorists insurgents or militias  
 i document what these groups do when they 're not shooting  my goal is to better understand these violent actors and to study ways to encourage
  transition from violent engagement to nonviolent confrontation i work in the field in the policy world and in the library 
 understanding non state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict because war has changed it used to be a contest between states 
 no longer it is now a conflict
  for example of the two hundred and sixteen peace agreements signed between one thousand nine hundred and seventy five and two thousand and eleven 
 one hundred and ninety six of them were between a state and a non state actor 
 so we need to understand these groups we need to either engage them or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful 
 so how do we do that 
 we need to know what makes these organizations tick we know a lot about
  how they fight why they fight  but no one looks at what they 're doing when they 're not fighting  yet  armed struggle and unarmed politics are related it is all part of the same organization 
 we cannot understand these groups  let alone defeat them if we don 't have the full picture  
  take the lebanese hezbollah  known for its violent confrontation against israel  but since its creation in the early 
 hezbollah has also set up a political party a social service network and a military apparatus  similarly the palestinian hamas  known for its suicide 
  attacks against israel also runs the gaza strip since two thousand and seven so these groups do way more than just shoot
  they set up complex communication machines radio stations tv channels  internet websites and social media strategies and up here you have the isis magazine  printed in english and published to recruit  
 armed groups also invest in complex 
 looting but setting up profitable businesses for example construction companies
  these activities are keys they allow these groups to increase their strength increase their funds to better recruit and to build their brand  
 armed groups also do something else  they build stronger bonds with the population
 by investing in social services they build schools they run hospitals  
 they set up  vocational training programs or micro loan programs hezbollah offers all of these
  armed groups also seek to win the population over by offering something that the state is not providing safety and security 
 the initial rise of the taliban in war torn afghanistan 
 or even the beginning of the ascent of isis can be understood also by looking at these groups  ' efforts to provide security  now unfortunately in these
  the provision of security came at an unbearably high price for the population
 but in general providing social services fills a gap a governance gap left by the government and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power 
 for example the two thousand and six electoral victory of the palestinian hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the group 's social work 
 now this is a really complex picture  yet in the west when we look at armed groups we only
  think of the violent side  but that 's not enough to understand these groups ' strength strategy or  long term vision 
 these groups are hybrid  they rise because they fill a gap left by the government  and they emerge to be both armed and political engage in violent struggle and provide governance 
 and the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated the less we can think of them as
  the opposite of a state 
 now what do you call a group like hezbollah  they run part of a territory they administer all their functions  they pick up the garbage they run the sewage system is this a state is it a rebel group 
 or maybe something else something different and new  and what about isis the lines are blurred 
  and the more states are weak like in the middle east today the more non state actors step in and fill that gap this matters for governments because to counter these groups they will have to invest more in non military tools 
 filling that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach 
 this also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding if we better understand armed groups we will better know what
  incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to nonviolence  
 so in this new contest between states and non states military power can win some battles but it will not give us peace nor stability to achieve these objectives 
 what we need is a long term investment in filling that security gap in filling that governance gap that allowed these groups to thrive in the first place  thank you
