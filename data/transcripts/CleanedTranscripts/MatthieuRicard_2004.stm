  i guess it is a result of globalization that you can find  coca cola tins on top of everest and a buddhist monk in monterey 
 and so i just came two days ago from the himalayas
  to your kind invitation so i would like to invite you also  for a while to the himalayas themselves and
 to show the place where
 meditators  like me who began with being a molecular biologist in pasteur institute  and found their way to the mountains
  so these are a few images i was lucky to to take and be there there
 's mount kailash in eastern tibet wonderful
 setting  this is from marlboro country this is a
 turquoise lake 
 a meditator this is the hottest day of the year somewhere
 in eastern tibet on
  august one and the night before  we camped and my tibetan friends said
 happiness is not at all interesting i just wrote an essay on happiness and there was a controversy and
 someone wrote an article saying don 't impose on us the dirty work of happiness 
 we don 't care about being happy we need to live with passion  we like the ups and downs of life  we like our suffering because it 's so good when it ceases for a while
 this is what i see from the balcony of my hermitage in the himalayas 
 it 's about two meters by three and you are all welcome any time 
 now let 's come to happiness
 or well being and first of all you know despite what the french intellectuals say  it seems that no one wakes up
  in the morning thinking may i suffer the whole day 
 which means that somehow  consciously or not directly or
 indirectly in the short or the long term  whatever we do  whatever we hope whatever we dream
 somehow is related to a
  as pascal said  even the one who hangs himself somehow is looking for cessation of suffering he
 finds no other way  
 but then if you look in the literature  east and west  you can find incredible diversity
 of definition of happiness some people
  only believed in remembering the past imagining the future never the present 
 some people say happiness is right now it 's the quality of the freshness of the present moment
 and that led henri bergson the french philosopher to say all the great thinkers of humanity have left happiness in the vague
 so that each of them could define their own terms
  that would be fine if it was just a secondary
 preoccupation in life  but now if it is something that is going to determine
 the quality of every instant of our life then we better know what it is have some clearer idea  
 and probably  the fact that we don 't know that is why so often  although we seek happiness it seems we turn
  although we want to avoid suffering it seems we are running somewhat towards it 
 and that can also come from some kind of confusions one of the most common ones is
 happiness and pleasure but if you look at the
 characteristics of those two pleasure is contingent upon time  upon its object  
 upon the place  it is something that
 changes of nature
  beautiful chocolate cake first serving is delicious second one not so much then we feel disgust 
 that 's the nature of things  we get tired
  i used to be a fan of bach i used to play it on the guitar you know i can hear it two three five times if i had to hear it
  very cold you come near a fire it 's so wonderful after some moments you just go a little back and then it starts burning it sort of uses itself
 as you experience it  
 and also again it can also it 's something that you it is not something that is radiating outside
  you can feel intense pleasure and some others around you can be suffering a lot 
 now  
 what then will be happiness and happiness of course is such a vague word  so let 's say well being 
 and so i think the best definition according to the buddhist view is that well being is not just a mere
  a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment 
 a state
 that actually
 pervades and underlies
 all emotional states and all the joys and sorrows that can come one 's way 
 for you that might be surprising can we have this kind of well being while being sad in a way
  not because we are speaking of a different level 
 look at the waves coming near the shore 
 when you are at the bottom of the wave  you hit the bottom 
 you hit the solid rock when you are surfing on the top you are all elated  so you go from elation to depression there 's no depth  
 now if you look at the
  the high sea there might be beautiful  calm ocean like a mirror there might be storms  but the depth
 of the ocean is still there unchanged  
 so now how is that it can only be a state of being not just a fleeting emotion sensation  even joy
 that can be the spring of happiness  but there 's also wicked joy
  you can rejoice in someone 's suffering  
 so how do we proceed in our quest for happiness  
 very often  we look outside  we think that if we could gather
 this and that all the conditions something that we say everything to be happy
 to have everything to be happy that very sentence already reveals the doom
  of happiness  to have everything if we miss something  it collapses  
 and also when things go wrong we try to fix the outside so much  but
 our control of the outer world is limited
  translates the outer condition into happiness and suffering  and isn 't that stronger  we know by experience that we can be
 what we call a little paradise and yet be completely unhappy within 
 the dalai lama was once in portugal  and there was a lot of construction going
  so one evening he said look you are doing all these things but
 isn 't it nice also to build something within and he said [ without ] that even if you get a high tech flat on the 100th floor of a 
 and comfortable building  if you are deeply unhappy within all you are going to look for is a window from which to jump 
 so now at the opposite  we know a lot of people who in very difficult circumstances
 manage to keep
 serenity inner strength  inner freedom  confidence  
 so now  if the inner conditions are stronger of course  the outer conditions do influence 
 and it 's wonderful to live longer  healthier to have access to information education to be able to travel to have freedom
  this is not enough those are just auxiliary  help
 conditions  
 the experience that translates everything is within the mind  
 so then when we ask oneself how to nurture the condition for happiness  
 the inner conditions  and which are those which will undermine
  needs to have some experience  
 we have to know from ourselves there are certain states of mind that are conducive to this flourishing  
 to this well being what the greeks called eudaimonia flourishing  
 there are some which are adverse
 to this well being and so if we look from our own experience anger
 strong grasping 
 they don 't leave us in such a good state after we have experienced it  and also they are detrimental to others ' happiness  
 so we may consider
 that the more those are invading our mind and  like a chain reaction the more we feel miserable we feel tormented at the opposite
  within that an act of selfless generosity if from the distance  without anyone knowing anything about it we could save
 a child 's life  make someone happy  we don 't need the recognition  we don 't need any gratitude just the mere fact of doing that
 fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature  and we would like to be like that all the time
  so is that possible to change our way of being  to transform one 's mind aren 't those
 negative emotions or destructive emotions  inherent to the nature of mind 
 is change possible in our emotions in our traits in our moods 
 for that we have to ask what is the nature of mind  and if we look from the
  point of view
 there is a primary quality of consciousness that 's just the mere fact to be cognitive 
 to be aware 
 consciousness is like a mirror that allows all images to rise on it 
 you can have ugly faces beautiful faces in the mirror the mirror allows that but the mirror is not tainted is not modified is not altered by those images
  likewise behind every single thought there is
 the bare consciousness pure awareness  this is the nature  it cannot be
 tainted intrinsically with hatred or jealousy because then if it was always there like like a dye that would permeate the whole cloth
 then it would be found all the time somewhere we know we 're not always angry
 always jealous always generous 
 so because the basic fabric of consciousness is this pure cognitive quality that differentiates it from a stone 
 there is a possibility for change because all emotions are fleeting that is the ground for mind training 
 mind training is based on the idea
 that two opposite mental factors cannot happen at the same time you could go from love
  to hate  but you cannot at the same time toward the same object  the same person want to harm and want to do good 
 you cannot in the same gesture  shake hand and give a blow  
 so there are natural antidotes to
 a kind of sense of inner freedom
 as opposite to intense grasping and obsession  
 benevolence loving kindness against hatred but 
 of course  each emotion then would need a particular antidote 
 another way is to try to find a general antidote to all emotions  
 and that 's by looking at the very nature
 usually  when we feel annoyed  hatred or
 upset with someone or obsessed with something the mind goes again and again to that object  each time it goes to the object it reinforces that obsession or that
 look at anger itself it looks very menacing like a
 billowing monsoon cloud or thunderstorm
 we think we could sit on the cloud but if you go there it 's just mist  
 likewise if you look at the thought of anger  it will vanish like frost under the morning sun
  do this again and again  the propensity the tendencies for anger to arise again will be less and less each time you dissolve it 
 and at the end  although it may rise it will just cross the mind like a bird crossing the sky without leaving any track 
 so this is the principal of mind training  
 now  
 it takes time because it took time for all those faults in our mind
  up so it will take time to unfold them as well  but that 's the only way to go mind transformation that is the very meaning of meditation  
 it means familiarization with a new way of being new way of perceiving things  which is more in adequation with reality with interdependence with the
 continuous transformation which our being and our consciousness is so the interface with cognitive science since we need to come to that it was i suppose the subject of
 we have to deal in such a short time
 with brain plasticity the brain was thought to be more or less fixed all the nominal connections in numbers and quantities
  were thought until the last twenty years to be more or less fixed when we reached
 adult age  now recently it has been found that it can change a lot
  who has done ten thousand hours of violin practice some area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain
 changes a lot  increasing reinforcement of the synaptic connections  
 so can we do that with human qualities with loving kindness with patience with openness so that 's what those
  great meditators have been doing some of them
 who came to the labs like in madison wisconsin or
 in berkeley did twenty to forty thousand hours of meditation  
 they do like three years ' retreat where they do meditate twelve hours a day  and then the rest of their life they will do three or four hours a day  they are real olympic champions of mind training 
  this is the place where the  meditators you can see it 's kind of inspiring  now  here with two hundred and  fifty six electrodes 
 so what did they find of course  
 same thing the scientific embargo if it 's ever submitted to nature hopefully it will
  it deals with the state of compassion  unconditional compassion  we asked meditators who have been doing that for years and years and years  to put their mind
 in a state where there 's nothing but loving kindness total availability to sentient being 
 of course during the training we do that with objects  we think of people suffering of people we love but at some point it can be a state which is all pervading  
 here is the preliminary result which i can show because it 's already been shown
  the bell curve shows
 one hundred and fifty controls 
 and what is being looked at is the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe 
 in very short people who have more activity in the right side
 of the prefrontal cortex are more depressed withdrawn  they don 't describe a lot of positive affect it
 's the opposite on the
 left side more tendency to altruism  to happiness  to express  and curiosity and so forth  
 so there 's a basic line for people and also  it can be changed if you see a comic movie you go off to the left side if you are happy about something you 'll go more to the left side if you have a bout of depression you 'll go to the right side
  full standard deviation
 of a meditator who meditated on compassion it 's something that is totally out of the bell curve 
 so i 've no time to go into all the different scientific results  hopefully they will come but they found that this is after three and a half hours in
  shown in other labs for instance paul ekman 's labs in in berkeley
 some meditators are able also to control their emotional response more than it could be thought like
 the startle experiments for example if you sit a guy on a chair with all this apparatus measuring your physiology and there 's kind of a bomb that goes off it 's
  response that in twenty years they never saw anyone who who would not jump 
 some meditators  without trying to stop it but simply by being completely open  
 thinking that that bang is just going to be a small event like a shooting star  
 they are able not to move at all 
 so the whole point of that is not sort of to make like a circus
 thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump or whatever
  more to say that mind training matters that this is not just
 a luxury  this is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul  this is something that 's going to
 determine the quality of every instant of our lives we are ready to spend fifteen years achieving education
  all kinds of things to remain beautiful  yet  we spend surprisingly little time
 taking care of what matters most the way our mind functions which again is the ultimate
 thing that determines the quality of our experience  now  compassion is supposed
  we try to do in different places just this one example is worth a lot of work 
 this lady with bone tb left alone in a tent was going to die with her only daughter 
 one year later how she is 
 different schools and clinics we 've been doing in tibet
  and just i leave you with the beauty of those looks that tells more about happiness than i could
 ever say and jumping monks of tibet
