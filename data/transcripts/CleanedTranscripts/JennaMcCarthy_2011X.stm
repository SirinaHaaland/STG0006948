  make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together 
 and not to have sex with anyone else
  else 
 ever he buys a ring she buys a dress 
 they go shopping for all sorts of things she takes him to arthur murray for ballroom dancing lessons 
 and the big day comes and they 'll stand before god and family and some guy her dad once did business with and they 'll vow that nothing
 not abject poverty not life threatening illness not complete
 and utter misery will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion 
 these optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through
 hot flashes and midlife crises and a cumulative
 50 pound weight gain until that
 when one of them
 is finally able to rest in peace you
 know because they can 't hear the snoring anymore 
 and then they 'll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each other 's faces and do the macarena and we 'll be there  showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze and throwing
 birdseed at them every single time 
 even though we know  statistically  half of them will be divorced within a decade 
 of course the other half won 't right  they 'll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating 
 which way the toilet paper
  should come off of the roll and
 some of them will even still be enjoying each other 's company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore  
 and researchers want to know why  i mean look it doesn 't take a 
  study to figure out what makes a marriage not
  too much time on facebook having sex with other people but you can have the exact opposite of all of those things respect 
 excitement 
 a broken internet connection
 monogamy and the thing still can go to hell in a handbasket  so  what 's
  what do the folks who make it all the way to side by side burial plots have in common what are they doing right  what can we learn from them 
 and if you 're still happily sleeping solo  why should you stop what you 're doing and make it your life 's work to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest
  researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out 
 they stalk blissful couples and study their every move and mannerism  and they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends  
 and it turns out the success stories share a few similarities beyond that they don 't have sex with other people 
 for instance in the happiest marriages
  wife is thinner and better looking than the husband obvious right it 's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because women
 we care a great deal about being thin and good looking whereas men mostly care about sex 
 ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are
  the beauty of this research though is that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy we just have to be thinner than our partners
 so instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising  we just need to wait for them to get fat 
 maybe bake a few pies this is good information to have and it 's not that complicated 
 research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives
  for example the happy wife instead of pointing out her husband 's growing gut or suggesting he go for a run she might say 
 wow honey  thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner 
 these are couples who can find good in any situation yeah  it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire 
 but it 's kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars
  and it 's a good thing you 've got all that body fat to keep us warm 
 one of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do housework  the more attractive his wife will find him  
 because we needed a study to tell us this 
 laughter but here 's what 's going on here  the more attractive she finds him the more sex they have the more sex they have the nicer he is to her the
  nicer he is to her  the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed and ultimately they live happily ever after 
 in other words  men you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department 
 here 's an interesting one one study found that people who smile in childhood photographs
 are less likely to get a divorce this is an actual study
  and let me clarify  the researchers were not looking at documented self reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals the data were based entirely on whether people looked happy in these early pictures 
 now  i don 't know how old all of you are but when i was a kid your parents took
  they didn 't take three hundred shots of you in that rapid fire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest smiliest one for the christmas card 
 no they dressed you up they lined you up and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday
  i have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and
 i 'm glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce 
 so what else can you do to safeguard your marriage do not win an oscar for best actress 
 i 'm serious  bettie davis joan crawford  halle berry hilary swank sandra bullock
  reese witherspoon all of them single soon after taking home that statue they actually call it the oscar curse it is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided  
 and it 's not just successfully starring in films that 's dangerous it turns out merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet 
 laughter apparently
  bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us but it obviously hasn 't and it probably never will makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison 
 and theoretically  i suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash 
 we are more likely to walk out of that theater feeling like we 've got it pretty good 
  i can 't tell you anymore about that one because i stopped reading it at the headline  but here 's a scary one divorce is contagious that
 's right when you have a close couple friend split up it increases your chances of getting a divorce by 
  percent now  i have to say i don 't get this one at all my husband and i have watched quite a few friends
 divide their assets
 and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and viagra and eharmony and
 i 'm thinking they 've done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could  so now you may be wondering why does anyone
  the us federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someone 's spouse 
 a list that includes visitation rights in jail but hopefully you 'll never need that one
 but beyond the profound federal perks married people make more money we
 're healthier  physically and emotionally we produce happier more stable and more successful kids
 we have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends believe it or not 
 we even live longer  which is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place 
 laughter now if you 're not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return  i can 't tell you how to find
  of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness who prefers horror movies and doesn 't have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce 
 but i can only encourage you to try because the benefits as i 've pointed out 
 are significant the
 bottom line is whether you 're in it or you 're searching for it i believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing
  so i hope you 'll use the information i 've given you today to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors 
 for instance in my marriage  i 'd say i 'm doing ok 
 one the one hand  i have a husband who 's annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome  so i 'm obviously going to need fatten him up  
 and like i said we have those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up  so we have to keep an eye
  on that and we do like a cocktail or two on the other hand 
 i have the fake happy picture thing  
 and also my husband does a lot around the house and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives so i 've got all those things going for me 
  i plan to work extra hard to not win an oscar anytime soon and for the good of your relationships i would encourage you to do the same i 'll
 see you at the bar
