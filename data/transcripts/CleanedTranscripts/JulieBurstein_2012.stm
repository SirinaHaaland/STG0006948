  my office i keep
 a small clay pot that i made in college it 's raku which is a kind of pottery
 that began in japan centuries ago as a way of making bowls for the japanese tea ceremony
 this one is more than four hundred years old  
 each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay and it was the imperfections that people cherished 
 everyday pots like this
 cup take eight to ten hours
  i just took this out of the kiln last week and the kiln itself takes another
 day or two to cool down but raku is really fast you do it outside and you take
 the kiln up to temperature in fifteen minutes it goes to one thousand five hundred degrees  
 and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside you can see that faint sheen you turn the kiln off and you reach in with these long metal tongs you grab the pot and in japan this
 red hot pot would be immediately immersed
 in a
 solution of green tea and you can imagine what that steam would smell like 
 but here in the united states we ramp up the drama a little bit and we drop our pots into sawdust which catches on fire and you take a garbage pail  and you put it on
  and smoke starts pouring out  i would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke
  i love raku because it allows me to play with the elements i can shape a pot out of clay
 and choose a glaze but then i have to let it go to the fire and the smoke and what 's wonderful is the surprises that happen like this crackle pattern because it 's really stressful on these pots they go from
  hundred degrees
 to room temperature in the space of just a minute  
 raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity 
 i find in so many things that tension between what i can control
 and what i have to let go happens all the time  
 whether i 'm creating a new radio show or just at home negotiating with my teenage sons 
 when i sat down to write a book about creativity 
 i realized that the steps were reversed i had to let go at the very beginning 
 and i had to immerse myself
 in the stories of hundreds of artists and writers and musicians and filmmakers
  and as i listened to these stories  i realized that
 creativity grows out of everyday experiences more often than you might think  including
 letting go it
 was supposed to break but that 's okay 
 that 's part of the letting go is sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn 't because creativity also grows from the broken places
  best way to learn about anything
 is through stories  and so i want to tell you a story about work and play
 and about four aspects of life that we need to embrace
 in order for our own creativity to flourish  the first embrace is something that we think
  this is very easy but it 's actually getting harder and that 's
 paying attention to the world around us so many artists
 speak about needing to be open to embrace experience and that 's hard to do when you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket
 that
 takes all of your focus the filmmaker mira nair speaks about growing up in a small town in india
  its name is bhubaneswar and here 's a picture of one of the temples in her town mira nair in this little town there were like two thousand temples we played cricket all the time we kind of grew up in the rubble  
 the major thing that inspired me that led me on this path that made me a filmmaker eventually was traveling folk
  that would come through the town and i would go off and see these
 great battles of good and evil by two people in a school field with no props but with a lot of you
 know passion and hashish as well  and it was amazing you know the folk tales of mahabharata and ramayana the two holy books the epics that everything comes out of in india  they say  after seeing that jatra the folk theater
  isn 't that a wonderful story  you can see the sort of break in the everyday there they are in the school fields but it 's good and evil and passion and hashish 
 and mira nair was a young girl with thousands of other people watching this performance  but she was ready she was ready to open up to what it sparked in her  
 and it led her as she said down this path to become an
 award winning filmmaker so being open for that experience that might change you is the first thing we need to embrace 
 artists also speak about how
 some of their most powerful work comes out of the parts of life that are most difficult  
 the novelist richard ford speaks about
 a childhood challenge that
  continues to be something he wrestles with today  he 's severely dyslexic richard ford i was
 slow to learn to read went all the way through school
 not really reading more than the minimum and still to this day can 't read silently much faster than i can read aloud
  but there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for me because when i finally did reconcile myself to how slow
  i was going to have to do it then i think i came very slowly
 into an appreciation of all of those qualities of language and of sentences that are not just the cognitive aspects of language  the syncopations the sounds of words what words look like 
 where paragraphs break where lines break i mean i wasn 't so badly dyslexic that i was disabled from reading  i just had to do it really slowly  and as i did
  lingering on those sentences as i had to linger i fell heir to language 's other qualities which i think has helped me write sentences jb 
 it 's so powerful richard ford who 's won the pulitzer prize says that dyslexia helped him write sentences
  he had to embrace this challenge and i use that word intentionally he didn 't have to overcome dyslexia
 he had to learn from it  he had to learn to hear the music in language 
 artists also speak about how pushing up against the limits of what they can do sometimes pushing into what they can 't do 
 helps them focus on finding their own voice
  the sculptor richard serra
 talks about how as a young artist he thought he was a painter  
 and he lived in florence after graduate school while he was there he traveled to madrid where he went to the prado to see this picture
 by the spanish painter diego velzquez it 's from one thousand six hundred and fifty six and it 's
  and it 's the picture of a little princess and her 
 and if you look over that little blonde princess 's shoulder you 'll see a mirror  
 and reflected in it are her parents the king and queen of spain who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture 
 as he often did velzquez put himself in this painting too  he 's
  i was to the point where i was using a stopwatch and painting squares out of
 randomness and i wasn 't getting anywhere so i went back and dumped all my paintings in the arno and i thought i 'm going to just start playing around
 richard serra says that so nonchalantly you might have missed it 
 he went and saw this painting by a guy who 'd been dead for three hundred years and realized 
 i can 't do that and so richard serra went back to his studio in florence picked up all of his work up to that point and threw it in a river
  richard serra let go of painting at that moment but he didn 't let go of art  he moved to new york city and he put together a list of verbs
 more than a hundred of them  
 and as he said he just started playing around he did these things to all kinds of material he would take a huge sheet of lead and roll it up and unroll it
  he would do the same thing to rubber  
 and when he got to the direction to lift he created this which is in the museum of modern art  
 richard serra had to let go of painting
 in order to embark on this playful exploration
 that led him to the work that he 's known for today  huge curves of steel that require our time and motion
 to experience
  sculpture richard serra is able to do what he couldn 't do in painting he makes us the subject of his art  
 so experience and challenge
 and limitations are all things we need to embrace for creativity to flourish there 's a fourth embrace  
 and it 's the hardest it 's the embrace of loss
  the oldest and most constant of human experiences 
 in order to create we have to stand in that space between what we see in the world and what we hope for 
 looking squarely at rejection at heartbreak at war at death 
 that 's a tough space to stand in the
 educator parker palmer calls it the tragic
 gap tragic not because it 's sad but because it 's inevitable 
 and my friend dick nodel likes to say you can hold that tension like a violin string
 and make something beautiful 
 that tension resonates in the work of the photographer joel meyerowitz 
 who at the beginning of his career was known for his street photography for capturing a moment
 on the street
  and also for his
 beautiful photographs of landscapes of tuscany of cape cod of light 
 joel is a new yorker and his studio for many years was in chelsea 
 with a straight view downtown to the world trade center  
 and he photographed those buildings in every sort of light  
 you know where this story
  goes 
 on nine eleven joel wasn 't in new york he was out of town but he raced back to the city  and raced down to the site of the destruction 
  i stood outside the chain link fence on chambers and greenwich and all i could see was the smoke and a little bit of rubble
  and i raised my camera to take a peek just to see if there was something to see and some cop 
 a lady cop  hit me on my shoulder  and said hey no pictures and it was such a blow
 that it woke me up in the way that
 it was meant to be i guess  
 and when i asked her why no pictures she said it 's a crime scene no photographs allowed and i asked her what would happen if i was a member of the press 
 and she told me
  and back a block was the press corps tied up
 in a little penned in area  and i said well when do they go in and she said probably never 
 and as i walked away from that i had this crystallization  probably from the blow because it was an insult in a way i thought
  find a way to get in because i don 't want to see this history disappear jb 
 he did he pulled in every favor he could and got a pass into the world trade center site where he photographed for nine months almost every day  
 looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when i went home to my family at night my office was just a few blocks away
  away  
 but some of these photographs are beautiful  and we wondered was it difficult for joel meyerowitz to make such beauty
 out of such devastation jm well you know ugly i mean  powerful and tragic and horrific and everything but
 it was also
  and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather  
 i mean there were afternoons i was down there  and the light goes pink and there 's a mist in the air and you 're standing in the rubble  
 and i found myself recognizing both
 the inherent beauty of nature and the fact that nature as time is erasing
 this wound 
 time is unstoppable  and it transforms the event it gets further and further away from the day and light and seasons temper it in some way  and it 's
  i 'm really a realist the reality is there 's the woolworth building
 in a veil of smoke
 from the from the site  but it 's now like a scrim across a
 a theater  and it 's turning pink you know
 and down below there are hoses spraying and the lights have come on for the evening and the water is turning acid green because the
 sodium lamps are on  and i 'm thinking
  is i 'm there it looks like that you have to take a picture jb you
 have to take a picture that sense of urgency of the need to get to work is so powerful in joel 's story 
 when i saw joel meyerowitz recently i told him how much i admired his passionate obstinacy his determination to push through all the bureaucratic red tape
 to get to work
 and he laughed and he said i 'm stubborn  but i think what 's more important
 is my passionate optimism 
 the first time i told these stories a man in the audience raised his hand and said all these artists talk about their work not their art  
 which has got me thinking about my work and where the creativity is there  and i 'm not an artist
  right we all wrestle with experience and challenge  limits and loss 
 creativity is essential to all of us  whether we 're scientists or teachers
