  to tell you about one of the world 's largest problems and how it can be solved  i 'd like to start
 with a little experiment  could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact
  lenses or you 've had laser refractive surgery 
 now  unfortunately  there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly  
 but it looks like i 'm guessing that it 'll be about sixty percent of the room because that 's roughly the fraction
 of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction
 the world health organization
 estimates well they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses
 the lowest estimate is one hundred and fifty million people they also
 have an estimate of around a billion  but in fact  i would argue that we 've just done an experiment here and now  which shows us that the global need for corrective
  eyewear
 is around half of any population  
 and the problem of poor vision 
 is actually not just a health problem it 's also an educational problem  
 and it 's an economic problem  and it 's a quality of life
  not very expensive they 're quite plentiful the problem is there aren 't enough eye care professionals
 in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world 
 there are just way too few eye care professionals so this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about ten thousand people and that
  's the ratio in the  u k 
 this is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub saharan africa in fact there are some countries in sub saharan africa where there 's one optometrist for
 eight million of the population 
 how do you do this  how do you solve this problem  i came up with a solution to this problem  and i came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this
 and the idea is you make eye glasses and you adjust them yourself
 and that solves the problem  what i want to do is to show you
 that one can make a pair of glasses i shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses  i shall pop this in my pocket
  i 'm short sighted i look at the signs at the end i can hardly see them so
 okay  i can now see that man running out there 
 and i can see that guy running out there  i 've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription
  next step in my process so i 've now made eye glasses to my prescription  
  i 've made the glasses to my prescription  and 
 i 've just
 and
  only pair in the world in fact  this technology 's been evolving i started working on it in 
 and it 's been evolving very slowly there are about thirty thousand in use
  and they 're in fifteen countries they 're spread around the world  
 and i have a vision which i 'll share with you i have a global vision for vision and that vision is to
 try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year two thousand and twenty 
 to do that this is an early example of the technology the technology is being further developed
  the cost has to be brought down this pair in fact these currently cost about nineteen dollars  but the cost has to be brought right down it has to be brought down because we 're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day  
 how do you solve this problem you start to get into detail and on this slide i 'm
 basically explaining all the problems you have how do you distribute how do you work out how to fit the thing how do you have people realizing that they have
  a vision problem  how do you deal with the industry  and the answer to that is research  
 what we 've done is to set up the center for vision in the developing world here in the university  if you want to know more just come have a look at our website
