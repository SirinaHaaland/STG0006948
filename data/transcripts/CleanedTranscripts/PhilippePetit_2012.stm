  this sound 
 this smell 
 this sight
 all remind me of the campfires of my childhood
  anyone
 could become a storyteller in front of the dancing flames  
 there was this wondrous ending when people and fire fell asleep almost in unison  
 it was dreaming time  
 now my story has a lot to do with dreaming although i 'm known to make my dreams come true
  last year i created a one man show for an hour and a half
 i shared with the audience a lifetime of creativity  how i pursue perfection how i cheat the impossible 
 and then ted challenged me philippe can you shrink this lifetime to eighteen minutes
  but here i am one solution was to rehearse a machine gun delivery in which every syllable every second will have its importance and hope to god the audience will be able to follow me 
  the best way for me to start is to pay my respects to the gods of creativity so please join me for a minute of silence
  i cheated it was a mere twenty seconds but hey we 're on ted time 
 when i was six years old 
  fell in love with magic 
 for christmas i got a magic box and a very old book on card manipulation  
 somehow i was more interested in pure manipulation than in all the silly little tricks in the box  so i looked in the book for the most difficult move 
 and it was this  
 now i 'm not supposed to share that with you but i have to show you the card is hidden in the back of
 hand  now that manipulation
 was broken down into seven moves described over seven pages one
  than my hands 
 two months later  six years old 
 i 'm able to do one two three four five six seven  and i go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him well what do you think 
 six years old  the magician looked at me and said this is a disaster
 you cannot do that in two seconds and have a minuscule part of the card showing
 for the move to be professional  it has to be less than one second and
 it has to be perfect two years later one zoop 
 and i 'm not cheating it 's in the back it 's perfect
  is the motto of all my actions as i 'm
 studying
 magic 
 juggling is mentioned repeatedly as a great way to acquire dexterity and coordination  
 now i had long admired how fast and fluidly jugglers make objects fly  so that 's it
  fourteen i 'm becoming a juggler  
 i befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe  and he agrees to sell me three clubs 
 but in america you have to explain what are clubs nothing to do with golf
  they are those
 beautiful oblong objects but quite difficult to make they have to be precisely lathed  oh when i was buying the clubs
 somehow the young juggler was hiding from the others  well i didn 't think much of it at the time  
 anyway here i was progressing with my new clubs but i could not understand 
 i was pretty fast  but i was not fluid at all 
 the clubs were escaping me at each throw and i was trying constantly to bring them back to me  until one day
 i practiced in front of francis
  brunn the world 's greatest juggler  and he was frowning  and he finally asked can i see those so i proudly showed him my clubs he
 said philippe you have been had  these are rejects they are completely out of alignment  they are impossible to juggle
  how i kept at it against all odds  
 so i went to the circus to see more magicians more jugglers  and i saw oh no no no i didn 't see it was more interesting  i heard  
 i heard about those amazing men and women who walk on thin air
  walkers now i have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood so that 's it i 'm sixteen
  becoming a wire walker i found two trees
 but not any kind of trees  trees with character and then a very long rope and i put the rope around and 
  around and around till i had no more rope now i have all of those ropes parallel like this
  i get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers and i gather them together in some kind of ropey
 path  
 so i just created the widest tightrope in the world what did i need i needed the widest shoes in the world  
 so i found some enormous ridiculous  giant ski boots and then wobbly wobbly i get on the ropes 
 well within a few days i 'm able
  to do one crossing  so i cut one rope off and the next day one rope off and a few days later  i was practicing on a single tightrope  
 now you can imagine at that time
 i had to switch the ridiculous boots for some slippers  
 so that is how in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try this is how not to learn wire walking
  is a tool essential in my life 
 in the meantime  i am being thrown out of five different schools because instead of listening to the teachers i am my own teacher 
 progressing in my new art and
 becoming a street juggler on the high wire within
  i 'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus except i am not satisfied 
 i was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection  
 but nobody wanted to hire me  so i started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission 
 the sydney harbor bridge
  the world trade center  and i developed a certitude a faith
 that convinced me that i will get safely to the other side if not i will never do that first step  well nonetheless 
 on the top of the world trade center
 my first step was
  all of a sudden the density of the air is no longer the same  
 manhattan no longer spreads its infinity  
 the murmur of the city dissolves into a squall whose chilling power i no longer feel 
 i lift the balancing pole i approach the edge  i step over the beam  i put my left foot
  on the cable  the weight of my body raised on my right leg anchored to the flank of the building  
 shall i ever so slightly shift my weight to the left my right leg will be unburdened my right foot will freely meet the wire 
 on one side a mass of a mountain a life i know 
 on the other the universe of the clouds so full of unknown we think it 's empty 
  feet  the path to the north tower sixty yards of wire rope  it 's a straight line  which sags  
 which sways  which vibrates  which rolls on itself which is ice  
 which is three tons tight ready to explode  ready to swallow me
  assails me the wild longing to flee  
 but it is too late the wire is ready decisively
 my other foot sets itself onto the cable
  doubt in my dictionary  
 so after the walk people ask me how can you top that well
 i didn 't have that problem i was not interested in collecting the gigantic in breaking records in fact  
 i put my
 world trade center crossing at the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks or some completely different
  type of performance let 's see such as my street juggling for example  so each time
 i draw my circle of chalk on the pavement and enter
 as the improvising comic silent character i created forty five years ago i am as happy as when i am in the clouds
  this here 
 this is not the street  so i cannot street juggle here you understand so you don 't want me to street juggle here right you know that right you don 't want me to juggle right
  okay
 this
 this
  okay
  each time i street juggle i use improvisation
 now improvisation is empowering because it welcomes
  since what 's impossible is always unknown  it allows me
 to believe i can cheat the impossible  
 now i have done the impossible not once but many times so what should i share oh i know israel some years ago
 i was invited to open the israel
  and i chose to put my wire between the arab quarters and the jewish quarter of jerusalem over the ben hinnom valley  
 and i thought it would be incredible if in the middle of the wire i stopped and like a magician i produce a dove and send her in the sky as a living symbol of peace 
 well now
 i must say
  little bit hard to find a dove in israel but i got one  and
 in my hotel room each time i practiced
 making it appear and and throwing her in the air she would graze the wall and end up on the bed  
 so i said now it 's okay  the room is too small i mean a bird needs space to fly it will go perfectly on the day of the walk  
 now comes the day of the walk  
 eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley
  comes to wish me the best but he seemed
 nervous  there was tension in my wire  but i also could feel tension on the ground because
 all those people were made up of people who  for the most part  considered each other enemies  so i start the walk
 everything is fine  i stop in the middle  i make the dove appear people applaud in delight
  delight and then in the most magnificent gesture i send the bird of peace into the azure 
 but the bird instead of flying away goes flop  flop flop and lands on my head 
 and people scream  so i grab the dove and for the second time
 i send her in the air  but the dove who obviously
  't go to flying school goes flop flop flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole
 you laugh you laugh but hey  i sit down immediately it 's a reflex of wire walkers  now in the meantime the audience  they go crazy  they must think this guy with this dove he must have spent years working with him what
  so i take a bow i salute with my hand and at the end i bang my hand against the pole to dislodge the bird now the dove who  now you know obviously cannot fly
 does for the third time a little flop flop flop and ends up on the wire behind me and the entire valley goes crazy  
 now but hold on i 'm not finished so now i 'm like fifty yards from my arrival and i 'm exhausted so my steps are slow  and something happened
 somebody somewhere a group of people starts clapping in rhythm with my steps and within seconds the entire valley is applauding in unison with each of my steps but not an applause of delight like before 
 an applause encouragement for a moment the entire crowd
  forgotten their differences they had become one pushing me to triumph
 i want you just for a second to experience this amazing human symphony so let 's say i am here and the chair is my arrival
  so after the walk  
 teddy and i become friends  and he tells me he has on his desk a picture of me in the middle of the wire with a dove on my head he didn 't know the true story  
 and whenever he 's daunted by an impossible situation to solve in
 this hard to manage city  instead of giving up he looks at the picture and he says if philippe can do that i can do this and he goes back to work
  inspiration  
 by inspiring ourselves
 we inspire others  i will never forget this music and i hope now neither will you
  take this music with you home  and start gluing feathers to your arms and take off and fly  and look at the world
 from a different perspective  
 and when you see mountains remember mountains can be moved
