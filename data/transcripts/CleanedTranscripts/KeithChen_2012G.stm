  the global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that 's actually one of the oldest questions in economics dating back to at least before adam smith and
 that is why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions can display
  different savings behavior now many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question and as a field we 've made a tremendous amount of
 headway and we understand a lot about this 
 what i 'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new findings that i 've been working on
 about the link between the structure of the language you speak
 and how
 you find yourself
 with the propensity to save  
 let me tell you a little bit about savings rates a little bit about language and then i 'll draw that connection
  let 's start by thinking about the member countries of the oecd or the organization of economic cooperation and development 
 oecd countries 
 by and large you should think about these as the richest most industrialized countries in the world  
 and by joining the oecd they were affirming a common commitment to democracy  open markets and free trade  
 despite all of these similarities we see huge differences in savings behavior so all the way over on the left of this graph what you see is many oecd countries saving over a quarter 
  of their gdp every year  and some oecd countries saving over a third of their gdp per year  
 all the way on the other side is greece  
 and what you can see is that over the last twenty five years greece has barely managed to save more than ten percent of their gdp it should be noted of course that
 the united states and the u k are the next in line  now that we see these huge differences in savings rates how is it
 possible that language might have something to do with these differences  let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ linguists and cognitive scientists have been have been exploring this question for for many years now  
 and then i 'll draw the connection between these two behaviors 
 many of you have probably already noticed that i 'm chinese 
 i grew up in the midwest of the united states and something i realized quite early on was that the chinese language forced me to speak about and in fact 
  fundamentally than that ever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways now how might that be let me give you an example  suppose i were
 i were talking with you and i was introducing you to my uncle
  you understood exactly what i just said in english if we were speaking mandarin chinese with each other though i wouldn 't have that luxury  i wouldn 't have been
  able to convey so little information what my language would have forced me to do instead of just telling you this is my uncle is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information 
 my language would force me to tell you whether or not this was an uncle on my mother 's side or my father 's side whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth and if this man was my father 's brother whether he was older than or younger than my father 
 all of this information is obligatory
  chinese doesn 't let me ignore it and in fact if i want to speak correctly chinese forces me to constantly think about it  
 now 
 that fascinated me endlessly as a child  but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time 
 so for example  if i 'm speaking in english i have to speak grammatically differently if i 'm talking about
  it is raining now or future rain it will rain tomorrow notice that english requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events  why  because i have to consider 
  that and i have to modify what i 'm saying to say it will rain or it 's going to rain it 's simply not permissible in english to say it rain tomorrow 
  you would say in chinese 
 a chinese speaker can basically say something that sounds very strange to an english speaker 's ears 
 they can say yesterday it rain now it rain tomorrow it rain 
 in some deep sense chinese doesn 't divide up the time spectrum in the same way that english forces us to constantly do
 in order to speak correctly 
 is this difference in languages only between very very distantly related languages like english and chinese actually no so many of you know in this room that
  english is a germanic language 
 what you may not have realized is that english is actually an outlier  it is the only germanic language that requires this for example  most other germanic language speakers 
 feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow by saying morgen regnet es quite literally to an english ear it rain tomorrow
  as a behavioral economist to an intriguing hypothesis  could how you speak about time could how your language forces you to think about time  affect your propensity to behave across time 
 you speak english a futured language and what that means is that every time you discuss the future or any kind of a future event grammatically you 're forced to cleave that from the present and treat it as if it 's something viscerally different 
 now suppose that that visceral difference
  makes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak 
 if that 's true and it makes the future feel like something more distant and more different from the present that 's going to make it harder to save  
 if on the other hand you speak a futureless language the present and the future you speak about them identically  if that subtly nudges you to feel about
  that 's going to make it easier to save  
 now this is a fanciful theory i 'm a professor i get paid to have fanciful theories
 but how would you actually go about testing such a theory  well  what i did with that was to access the linguistics literature  and interestingly enough there are pockets 
  of futureless language speakers situated all over the world this is a pocket of futureless language speakers in northern europe  
  pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world turn out to be by and large some of the world 's best savers 
 just to give you a hint of that let 's look back at that oecd graph that we were talking about 
 what you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the oecd that speak
 futured languages 
 what is the average difference here five percentage points of your gdp saved per year  over twenty five years that has huge long run effects on the wealth of your nation  
 now while these findings are suggestive countries can be different in so many different ways that it 's very very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences 
 what i 'm going to show you though is something that i 've been engaging in for a year  which is trying to gather
  all of the largest datasets that we have access to as economists and i 'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences  hoping to get this relationship to break
  and just in summary  no matter how far i push this i can 't get it to break  let me show you how far you can do that 
 one way to imagine that is i gather large datasets from around the world so for example  there is the survey of health [ aging ] and retirement in europe 
 from this dataset you actually learn that retired european families are extremely
  patient with survey takers 
 so imagine that you 're a retired household in belgium and someone comes to your front door excuse me 
 would you mind if i peruse your stock portfolio 
 do you happen to know how much your house is worth do you mind telling me 
 would you happen to have a hallway that 's more than ten meters long if you do would you mind if i timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway 
 would you mind
  squeezing as hard as you can in your dominant hand this device so i can measure your grip strength how about blowing into this tube so i can measure your lung capacity 
 the survey takes over a day 
 laughter combine that with a demographic and health survey collected by usaid in developing countries in africa
  that survey actually can go so far as to directly measure the hiv status of families living in for example rural nigeria  
 combine that with a world value survey which measures the political opinions and fortunately for me the savings behaviors of
 millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world  
 take all of that data  combine it and this map is what you get what you find is nine countries around the world that have significant native populations which speak both
  futureless and futured languages  and what i 'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that i can measure
  and then i 'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these
 levels what are the characteristics we can control for well i 'm going to match families on country of birth and residence the demographics
  what sex their age their income level within their own country their educational achievement a lot about their family structure 
 it turns out there are six different ways to be married in europe  
 and most granularly i break them down by religion where there are seventy two categories of religions in the world so an extreme level of granularity 
 there are one point four billion different ways that a family can find itself
 effectively everything i 'm going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families it 's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment of finding two families both of whom live in brussels
 who are identical on every single one of these dimensions  but one of whom speaks flemish and one of whom speaks french or two families that live in a rural district in nigeria  one of whom speaks hausa and one of whom speaks igbo
  even after all of this granular level of control 
 do futureless language speakers seem to save more yes futureless language speakers even after this level of control are thirty percent more likely to report having saved in any given year  
  does this have cumulative effects yes by the time they retire futureless language speakers  holding constant their income are going to retire with twenty five percent more in savings can we push this data even further
  yes  
 because i just told you we actually collect a lot of health data as economists now how how can we think about health behaviors to think about savings  well 
 think about smoking for example  smoking is in some deep sense negative savings  if savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure smoking is just the
  current pleasure in exchange for future pain 
 what we should expect then is the opposite effect and that 's exactly what we find futureless language speakers are twenty to twenty four percent less likely to be smoking at any given point 
  in time compared to identical families  and they 're going to be thirteen to seventeen percent less likely to be obese by the time they retire  and they 're going to report being twenty one percent more likely to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter 
 to find
 a savings behavior for which this strong effect isn 't present 
 my linguistics and economics colleagues at yale and i are just starting to do this work and really explore and understand the ways that these that these subtle nudges 
 cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak
  once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making we want to be able to
 provide people tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers
 and more conscious investors in their own future thank you very much
