  one year ago  i rented a car in jerusalem to go find a man i 'd never met but who had changed my life
  i didn 't have a phone number to call to say i was coming  
 i didn 't have an exact address  but i knew his name abed 
 i knew that he lived in a town of fifteen thousand kfar kara  and i knew that twenty one years before just outside this holy city 
 he broke my neck  
 and so on an overcast morning in january i headed north
 off in a silver chevy to find a man and some peace the road
  dropped and i exited jerusalem 
 i then rounded the very bend where his blue truck  heavy with four tons of floor tiles had borne down with great speed onto the back left corner of the minibus where i sat 
 i was then nineteen years old i 'd grown five inches and done some twenty thousand pushups
  and the night before the crash i delighted in my new body  
 playing basketball with friends into the wee hours of a may morning  
 i palmed the ball in my large right hand  and when that hand reached the rim  i felt invincible  
 i was off in the bus to get the pizza i 'd won on the court  
 i didn 't see abed coming from my seat i was looking up at a stone town on a
  bright in the noontime sun when from behind there was a great bang as loud and violent as a bomb 
 my head snapped back over my red seat my eardrum blew my shoes flew off  
 i flew too my head bobbing on broken bones  and when i landed  i was a quadriplegic 
 over the coming months i learned to breathe on my own then to sit and to stand and to
  but my body was now divided vertically  i was a hemiplegic  
 and back home in new york  i used a wheelchair for four years all through college  
 college ended and i returned to jerusalem for a year 
 there i rose from my chair for good  i leaned on my cane and i looked back finding all from my fellow passengers in the bus
 to photographs of the crash  and when i saw this photograph
 i didn 't see a bloody and unmoving body 
 i saw the healthy bulk of a left deltoid  and i mourned that it was lost mourned all i had not yet done 
 but was now impossible
  it was then i read the testimony that abed gave the morning after the crash
 of driving down the right lane of a highway toward jerusalem 
 reading his words i welled with anger  
 it was the first time i 'd felt anger toward this man and it came from magical thinking 
 on this xeroxed piece of paper the crash had not yet happened 
 abed could still turn his wheel left
 so that i would see him whoosh by out my window
  and i would remain whole be careful abed look out slow down but abed did not slow 
 and on that xeroxed piece of paper my neck again broke and again  i was left without anger  
 i decided to find abed and when i finally
  he responded to my hebrew hello which such nonchalance  it seemed he 'd been awaiting my phone call and maybe he had 
 i didn 't mention to abed his prior driving record
  violations by the age of 
 the last his not shifting his truck into a low gear on that may day and i didn 't mention my prior record the quadriplegia and the catheters the insecurity and
  the loss
 and when abed went on about how hurt he was in the crash  i didn 't say that i knew from the police report that he 'd escaped serious injury  
 i said i wanted to meet 
 abed said that i should call back in a few weeks  and when i did and a recording told me that his number was disconnected  i let abed
 and the crash go 
  many years passed  
 i walked with my cane and my ankle brace and a backpack on trips in six continents  i pitched overhand
 in a weekly softball game that i started in central park and home in new york  i became a journalist and an author  typing hundreds of thousands of words with one finger 
 a friend pointed out to me that all of my big stories mirrored my own  each centering on a life that had changed in an instant
 owing if not to a crash then to an inheritance a swing of the bat a click of the shutter an arrest  each of us had a before and an after 
 i 'd been working through my lot after all 
 still abed was far from my mind when last year i returned to israel to write of the crash and the book
  was nearly complete when i recognized that i still wanted to meet abed 
 and finally i understood why to hear this man say two words 
 i 'm sorry 
 people apologize for less  
 and so i got a cop to confirm that abed still lived somewhere in his same town  
 and i was now driving to it with a potted yellow rose in the back seat  when suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering
 but what to get the man who broke your fucking neck 
 i pulled into the town of abu ghosh and bought a brick of turkish delight  pistachios glued in rosewater  
 better 
 back on highway one i envisioned what awaited  abed would hug me  abed would spit at me
  abed would say i 'm sorry 
 i then began to wonder as i had many times before how my life would have been different had this man not injured me  had my genes been fed a different helping of experience 
 who was i 
 was i who i had been before the crash  before this road divided my life like the
 spine of an open book 
 was i what had been done to me  were all of us the results of things done to us done for us 
 the infidelity of a parent or spouse  money inherited 
 were we instead our bodies  their inborn endowments and deficits  
 it seemed that we could be nothing more than genes and experience  but how to tease out the one from the other 
 as yeats put that same universal question o body swayed to music  o brightening glance
 how can we know the dancer from the dance i
 'd been driving for an hour
 when i looked in my rearview mirror and saw my own brightening glance  
 the light my eyes had carried for as long as they had been blue the predispositions and impulses that had propelled me as a toddler to try and slip over a boat into a chicago lake that had propelled me as a teen to jump into wild cape cod
  bay after a hurricane  but i also saw in my reflection that had abed not injured me i would now in all likelihood be a doctor
 and a husband
 and a father  
 i would be less mindful of time and of death and oh i would not be disabled would not suffer the thousand slings and arrows of my fortune  
 the frequent furl of five fingers the chips in my teeth come from
  biting at all the many things a solitary hand cannot open the dancer and the dance were hopelessly entwined  
 it was approaching eleven when i exited right toward afula  and passed a large quarry and was soon in kfar kara  
 i felt a pang of nerves  
 but chopin was on the radio  seven beautiful mazurkas and i pulled into a lot by a gas
  station to listen and to calm 
 i 'd been told that in an arab town one need only mention the name of a local and it will be recognized 
 and i was mentioning abed and myself noting deliberately that i was here in peace to the people in this town  
 when i met mohamed outside a post office at noon 
  he listened to me  you know it was most often when speaking to people that i wondered where i ended and my disability began 
 for many people told me what they told no one else many cried 
 and one day after a woman i met on the street did the same and i later asked her why 
 she told me that best she could tell her tears had had something to do with my being happy and strong  
 but vulnerable
  i listened to her words i suppose they were true  i was me  
 but i was now me despite a limp  and that i suppose was what now made me me  
 anyway  mohamed told me what perhaps he would not have told another stranger  he led me to a house of cream stucco then drove off 
 and as i sat contemplating what to say a woman approached in a black shawl and black robe  i stepped from my car and said
  identified myself  and she told me that her husband abed would be home from work in four hours 
 her hebrew was not good and she later confessed that she thought that i had come to install the internet 
 i drove off and returned at four thirty  thankful to the minaret up the road that helped me find my way back 
 and as i approached the front door abed saw
  me  my jeans and flannel and cane and i saw abed an average looking man of average size  
 he wore black and white  slippers over socks pilling sweatpants a piebald sweater a striped ski cap pulled down to his forehead 
 he 'd been expecting me mohamed had phoned  and so at once we shook hands and smiled  and i gave him my gift
  he told me i was a guest in his home and we sat beside one another on a fabric couch  
 it was then that abed resumed at once the tale of woe he had begun over the phone sixteen years before 
 he 'd just had surgery on his eyes he said he had problems with his side and his legs too and oh  he 'd lost his teeth in the crash
  did i wish to see him remove them  
 abed then rose and turned on the tv so that i wouldn 't be alone when he left the room and returned with polaroids of the crash
 and his old driver 's license 
 i was handsome he said  
 we looked down at his laminated mug  abed had been less handsome than substantial 
 with thick black hair and a full face and a wide neck  it was this youth who on may sixteen
  two necks including mine and bruised one brain and taken one life
 twenty one years later he was now thinner than his wife his skin slack on his face and looking at abed looking at his young self i remembered looking at that photograph of my young self after the crash  and recognized his longing 
 the crash changed
 both of our lives i said  
 abed then showed me a picture of his mashed truck  and said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver in the left lane who did not let him pass 
 i did not want to recap the crash with abed  i 'd hoped for something simpler to exchange a turkish dessert for two words and be on my way  
 and so i didn 't point out that in his own testimony the morning after the crash
  abed did not even mention the bus driver no  i was quiet  i was quiet because i had not come for truth i had come for remorse 
 and so i now went looking for remorse and threw truth under the bus 
 i understand i said that the crash was not your fault  but does it make you sad that others suffered 
 abed spoke three quick words yes  i suffered 
 abed then told me why
 he 'd lived an unholy life before the crash  and so god had ordained the crash  but now he said he was religious  and god was pleased  
 it was then that god intervened  news on the tv of a car wreck that hours before had killed three people up north 
 we looked up at the wreckage
  agreed 
 i had the thought that there on route eight hundred and four there were perpetrators and victims dyads bound by a crash  some as had abed would forget the date some as had i would remember  
 the report finished and abed spoke it is a pity he said that the police in this country
  before the crash
 well he said i once went sixty in a forty and so
  violations
 driving through a red light driving at excessive speed driving on the wrong side of a barrier  and finally riding his brakes down that hill reduced to one 
 and it was then i understood that no matter how stark the reality the human being fits it into a narrative that is palatable the goat
  becomes the hero the perpetrator becomes the victim  it was then i understood that abed would never apologize 
 abed and i sat with our coffee  
 we 'd spent ninety minutes together  and he was now known to me  
 he was not a particularly bad man or a particularly good man  he was a limited man
  who 'd found it within himself to be kind to me  
 with a nod to jewish custom he told me that i should live to be one hundred and twenty years old  
 but it was hard for me to relate to one who had so completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing to one whose life was so unexamined
 that he said he thought two people had died in the crash
  there was much i wished to say to abed  
 i wished to tell him that were he to acknowledge my disability it would be okay 
 for people are wrong to marvel at those like me who smile as we limp  
 people don 't know that they have lived through worse 
 that problems of the heart hit with a force greater than a runaway truck that problems of the mind are greater still
  injurious than a hundred broken necks
 i wished to tell him that what makes most of us who we are most of all is not our minds and not our bodies and not what happens to us  
 but how we respond to what happens to us this wrote the psychiatrist viktor frankl is the last of the human freedoms to choose one 's attitude in any given set of circumstances
  to tell him that not only paralyzers and paralyzees must evolve  reconcile to reality  but we all must
 the aging and the anxious and the divorced and the balding
 and the bankrupt and everyone  
 i wished to tell him that one does not have to say that a bad thing is good that a crash is from god and so a crash is good a broken neck is
  good one can say that a bad thing sucks  but that this natural world still has many glories  
 i wished to tell him that in the end our mandate is clear 
 we have to rise above bad fortune 
 we have to be in the good and enjoy the good  study and work and adventure and friendship oh friendship
 and community
 and love  but most of all i wished to tell him what herman melville wrote that 
 truly to enjoy bodily warmth  some small part of you must be cold 
 for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast
  you are mindful of what you do not have you may be truly mindful of what you do have 
 and if the gods are kind you may truly enjoy what you have 
 that is the one singular gift you may receive if you suffer in any existential way you know death  and so may wake each morning pulsing with ready life 
 some part of you is cold  and so another part may truly enjoy what it is to be warm 
 or even to be cold
  when one morning years after the crash i stepped onto stone and the underside of my left foot felt the flash of cold  nerves at last awake  
 it was exhilarating a gust of snow  
 but i didn 't say these things to abed  i told him only that he had killed one man
  i told him the name of that man and then i said
