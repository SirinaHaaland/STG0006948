  let me talk about india
 through the evolution of ideas now i believe this is an interesting way of looking at it because in every society  especially an open democratic society  it 's only when ideas 
  take root that things change slowly ideas lead to ideology lead to policies that
  lead to actions in one thousand nine hundred and thirty this country went through a great depression  which led to all the ideas of the state and social security and all the other things that happened in roosevelt 's time in
  the 1980s we had the reagan revolution which lead to deregulation  and today  after the global economic crisis there was a whole new set of rules about how the state should intervene
  so ideas change states  and i looked at india and said really there are four kinds of ideas which really make an impact on india  the first to my mind is what 
  i call as the ideas that have arrived these ideas have brought together something which has made india happen the way it is today  the second set of ideas i call ideas in progress those are ideas which have been accepted but not
  the third set of ideas are what i call as ideas that we argue about those are ideas where we have a fight an ideological battle about how to do things  and the fourth thing 
 which i believe is most important is the ideas that we need to anticipate because when you are a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having you can actually anticipate what that did and do things
  very differently 
 now in india 's case i believe there are six ideas which are responsible for where it has come today  the first is really the notion of people 
 we thought of people as a burden 
 we thought of people as a liability 
 today we talk of people as an asset we talk of people as human capital  and i believe this change in the mindset of looking at
  a burden to human capital has been one of the fundamental changes in the indian mindset  
 and this change in thinking of human capital is linked to the fact that india is going through a demographic dividend  
 as healthcare improves as infant mortality goes down  fertility rates start dropping  and india is experiencing that india is going to have a lot of young people 
 with a demographic dividend for the next thirty years what is unique about this demographic dividend is
  that india will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend in other words  it will be the only young country in an aging world  and this is very important at the same 
  time if you peel away the demographic dividend in india there are actually two demographic curves  one is in the south and in the west of india which is already going to be
  because in that part of the country the fertility rate is almost equal to that of a west european country 
 then there is the whole northern india which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend  
 but a demographic dividend is only as good as the investment in your human capital 
 only if the people have education  they have good health  they have infrastructure they have roads to go to work  they have lights to study at night only in those cases can you really get the benefit
 of a demographic dividend in other words if you don 't really invest in the human capital  the same demographic dividend can be a demographic disaster  therefore india is at a critical 
  point where either it can leverage its demographic dividend or it can lead to a demographic disaster  
  when india got independence entrepreneurs were seen as a bad lot as people who would exploit  but today  after sixty years because of the rise of entrepreneurship entrepreneurs have become 
  role models  and they are contributing hugely to the society  this change has contributed to the vitality and
  english language was seen as a language of the imperialists  but today with globalization with outsourcing  english has become a language of aspiration  this has made it something 
  that everybody wants to learn  and the fact that we have english is now becoming a huge strategic asset  
  which sells eight million mobile phones a month of which ninety percent of those mobile phones are prepaid phones because people don 't have credit history forty percent of those prepaid phones
 are recharged at less than twenty cents at each recharge that is the scale at which technology has liberated and made it accessible and therefore technology has gone from being seen as something
  forbidding and intimidating to something that is empowering  twenty years back when there was a report on bank computerization 
  they didn 't name the report as a report on computers they call them as ledger posting machines they
 didn 't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers  and when they wanted to have more advanced more powerful computers they called them advanced ledger posting machines 
  long way from those days where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment  and really has changed the way indians think of technology  
 and then i think the other point is that indians today are far more comfortable with globalization again  after having lived for more than two hundred years under the east india company and
  and under imperial rule indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization believing it was a form of imperialism  but today as indian companies go abroad as indians come 
  and work all over the world  indians have gained a lot more confidence and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in and the fact that the demographics are in our favor because 
  we are the only young country in an aging world  makes globalization all the more attractive to indians and finally india has had the deepening of its democracy
 when democracy came to india sixty years back it was an elite concept it was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy because they wanted to bring in the idea of
 universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth  but today democracy has become a bottom up process where everybody has realized the benefits of having a voice the benefits of being in an open society  and therefore democracy has become embedded
 i believe these six factors
 the rise of the notion of population as human capital  the rise of indian entrepreneurs the rise of english as a language of aspiration 
 technology as something empowering globalization as a positive factor  and the deepening of democracy has contributed to why india is today growing at rates it has never seen
  but having said that  then we come to what i call as ideas in progress those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society  but you are not able to implement those things  
 and really there are four things here one is the question of education 
 for some reason whatever reason lack of money lack of priorities because of religion having an older culture
 primary education was never given the focus it required  but now i believe it 's reached a point where it has become very important  unfortunately the government schools don 't function
  so children are going to private schools today  even in the slums of india more than fifty percent of urban kids are going into private schools  so there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work 
  but having said that there is an enormous desire among everybody including the poor to educate their children so i believe primary education is an idea which is arrived but not yet implemented
  for a long time infrastructure was not a priority those of you who have been to india have seen that it 's certainly not like china  but today i believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed 
  upon and which people want to implement it is reflected in the political statements twenty years back the political slogan was
  and that is a change in the mindset where infrastructure is now accepted  so i do believe this is an idea which has arrived but simply not implemented  
 the third thing is again cities it 's
 because gandhi believed in villages and because the british ruled from the cities  therefore nehru thought of new delhi as an an un indian city for a long time we have neglected our cities  and that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see
  but today finally  after economic reforms and economic growth i think the notion that cities are engines of economic growth cities are engines of creativity 
  cities are engines of innovation have finally been accepted  and i think now you 're seeing the move towards improving our cities  again an idea which is arrived but not yet implemented
  the final thing is the notion of india as a single market
 because when you didn 't think of india as a market you didn 't really bother about a single market because it didn 't really matter  and therefore you had a situation where every state had its own market for products every 
  province had its own market for agriculture increasingly now the policies of taxation and infrastructure and all that are moving towards creating india as a single market  
  so there is a form of internal globalization which is happening which is as important as external
  globalization these four factors i believe the ones of primary education infrastructure urbanization and single market in my view are ideas in india which have been accepted but not implemented 
 then we have what i believe are the ideas in conflict  
 the ideas that we argue about these are the arguments we have which cause gridlock what are those ideas one is i think
  are ideological issues because of the historical indian background in the caste system and because of the fact that there have been many people who have been left out in the cold a lot of the politics 
 is about how to make sure that we 'll address that and it leads to reservations and other techniques  it 's also related to the way that we subsidize our people and all the left and right arguments that we have a lot of the indian problems are related to the ideology
 of caste and other things  this policy is causing gridlock  this is one of the factors which needs to be resolved  the second one is the labor policies that we have 
 which make it so difficult for entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies that ninety three percent of indian labor is in the unorganized sector 
  they have no benefits they don 't have social security they don 't have pension they don 't have healthcare none of those things 
 this needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people into the formal workforce you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised  therefore we need to create 
 a new set of labor laws  which are are not as onerous as they are today at the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector
  and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for the third thing is our higher education 
 indian higher education is completely regulated it 's very difficult to start a private university  it 's very difficult for a foreign university to come to india as a result of that 
 our higher education is simply not keeping pace with india 's demands  that is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address 
  happening in the west and elsewhere  and look at what needs to be done  the first thing is we 're very fortunate that technology is at a point where it is much more advanced than when other countries had 
  the development so we can use technology for governance we can use technology for direct benefits we can use technology for transparency  and many other things  
  higher state of
 diabetes the higher state of obesity  so there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases with
 a set of rich country diseases therefore we 're to rethink the whole way we look at health  we really need to put in place a strategy so that we don 't go to the other extreme of health  
 similarly today in the west you 're seeing the problem of entitlement the cost of social security the cost of medicare the cost of
  medicaid  therefore when you are a young country  again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system so that you don 't create entitlement problems as you grow old  
 and then again india does not have the luxury of making its environment dirty  because it has to marry environment and development  just to give an idea the world has
  at something like
 twenty gigatons per year on a population of nine billion our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year india is already at two tons per year  but if india grows 
 at something like eight percent   income per year per person will go to sixteen times by two thousand and fifty so we 're saying income growing at sixteen times and no growth in carbon therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look
  the way we look at energy the way we create whole new paradigms of development  now
 why does this matter to you why does what 's happening ten thousand miles away matter to all of you number one 
 this matters because this represents
 more than a billion people a billion people one 6th of the world population it matters because this is a
  important to prove that growth and democracy are not incompatible that you can have a democracy that you can have an open society  and you can have growth  it 's important because if you solve these problems  you can solve the problems of poverty in the world  
 it 's important because you need it to solve the world 's environment problems
