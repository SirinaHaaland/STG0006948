  be talking about secrets obviously the best way to divulge a secret is to tell someone to not say anything about it 
 secrets i 'm using powerpoint this year just because
  i 'm into the ted thing and when you use these things you don 't have to go like that you just press
  that 's not my slides but it 's okay laughter
 as you can see these are all maps  and maps are important devices for transferring information especially if you have human cognitive ability 
 we can see that all formulas are really maps now as humans we make maps of places that we seldom even go
 which seems a little wasteful of time this of course is a map of the moon
 there 're some very delightful names tranquilacalitis [ unclear ] my favorite is frigoris what are
 these people thinking frigoris what the frigoris you doing names are important 
 frigoris this is the moon people could live there one day i 'll meet you at frigoris
  again with various names and this is all done by the way by the international astronomical union  this is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects  
 this is from their actual book these are some of the names that they have chosen ladies and gentlemen i
 'll go through a little of them 
  now i think the whole concept of a mermaid doesn 't really blend into the swamp feel oh look
 mermaid come out of swamp oh boy it 's time for bolotnitsa laughter
 djabran fluctus  if that don 't flow off the tongue what does i
 mean kids are studying this stuff and they 've got the word
  wrong one dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life it fluctus
 up mama
 hikuleo fluctus that 's a little more flowing hikuleo sounds like a kind of a leonardo dicaprio
 seventeen syllable thing  and that 's the tonga
  one of my favorites is the itoki fluctus  who is the nicaraguan goddess of insects stars and planets now if you 're a goddess of stars and planets wouldn 't you relegate insects to somebody else no
 no really i 'm so busy with the stars  would you mind taking the insects  thank you darling  oh take the spiders too i know they 're not insects but i don 't care 
 monkeys chimps just get rid of the hairy creatures 
  going to be going to mars one day and when we do it 's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names so you 'll be on mars and you 're at
 hellespointica depressio which has got to be a really up place yeah i
 'm at the depressio and i want to get over to amazonis so i plug it into the mars map
 and click the button and there 's my directions i go
  that 's a cool name i will say that so i hold back a little of my venom for these astronomical misnomers 
 and then of course arnon to thoth and of course there will be advertisements this is from their rule book the international astronomical union
  astronomique internationale for those of you who don 't speak french i thought i 'd translate for you from the rulebook nomenclature is a tool the first consideration make it clear simple 
  and unambiguous  and i think that djabran fluctus  that fits that mode 
 that 's simple the goddess of goats very simple djabran
  i 'm going back to the swamp mermaid can you call me in a little while 
 also from the actual document i highlighted a part i thought may be of interest anyone can suggest changing a name  so  i look to you fellow member
  change this stuff up fast  so  these are actual names of people that work there i
 did some more investigation 
 these are more people working for this group and as you can see they don 't use their first names 
 these are people naming planets and they won 't use their first names something is askew here is it because his name is really jupiter
  but it 's investigative material no doubt  there are some mapping people who do use their names witness please eugene shoemaker  
 who diligently from a young boy decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies  must have been a very interesting day in the shoemaker house 
  we have names for places where people don 't exist that seems a little silly to me
 there are no jovians  getting back to my premise i used stamps by the way because you don 't have to pay anybody for the rights
  einstein niels bohr de fermat 's last theorem and i 'm not sure whether that 's james coburn or richard harris it
 's definitely one of the two i 'm not
 really clear which one but obviously the point is that numbers are maps  and within numbers is there an underlying secret to the universe that is the premise of this particular presentation  
 by the way that 's a natural picture of saturn no adjustments i mean that
 so beautiful that i will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet  and the
 day saturday named after it wonderfully  
 so  formulas relate number to form that 's euler his formula was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory which is kind of cool not that funny  but it is cool
  how did he figure that out he 's got no body no man just a head floating high here comes euler 
 laughter and that 's
 an icosahedron which is one of the five sacred solids very important shapes you see the icosahedron again the dodecahedron it 's dual 
  there is a dodecahedron which i had to do in my room last night the five sacred solids  as you can see there which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads laughter
 blue cheese ranch oil and vinegar thousand islands and house  i suggest the house
  the reality now here is something important what 's important about this is these shapes are duals of each other  and you can see how
 the icosahedron withdraws into
  the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other  so the whole concept of branes in the universe if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron this is a very good map of what could possibly be  
 and that is of course  what we are here to talk about what a coincidence
 in france jean pierre luminet
 said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron based on information that they got from this probe 
 this would be a normal wave pattern but what they 're seeing way out there in the far reaches
  of the microwave background is this kind of odd undulation it doesn 't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be so you can kind of get an idea 
  from this extrapolating that back under this huge picture so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like and judging from this it looks a little like a cheeseburger
  cheeseburger and for me that 's a win win everybody goes i 'm happy better
 really hurry up 
 i just threw this in because
 as important as all of our intellectual abilities are without heart and without love it 's just it 's all meaningless  
 and that to me is really beautiful 
 except for that creepy guy in the background
 getting back to the point of my particular presentation  kepler one of my great heroes 
 who realized that these five solids which i spoke of earlier were related somehow to the planets but he couldn 't prove it it freaked him out  but it did lead to newton 
 discovering gravity so maps of things leading to organized understandings of
  universe in which we emerge now this is isaac from a vietnamese stamp 
 i am not suggesting at all that my vietnamese brothers and sisters could maybe use a little art class here and there but 
 that 's not a good picture 
 not a good picture now my friends in the island of nevis are a little better look at that that 's isaac newton that guy is rockin
 what a handsome cat  once again nicaragua let me down 
 and copernicus looks like johnny carson which is really weird i don 't
 get that at all once again these guys rock it out isaac is kickin ' ass man he looks like a rock star  this is freaky
  this is sierra leone  they got little babies in there floating in there man 
 i don 't really need to comment on this but i didn 't know that isaac newton was in the moody blues did you when did
 this happen it
 's a different kind of course  and they 've got five apples i mean these guys are extrapolating in realms that are not necessarily valid although
 five is a good number of course
 my friend kepler  as you can see they call him juan 
  not juan it wasn 't carlos chaplain it 's wrong 
 ren descartes of course once again these grenada people this is like way too sick for anybody 's imagination  
 he 's all murky there is little kids leaning on his leg
  little ghosts flying around we gotta clean this stuff up fast ladies and gentlemen 
 this is of course the cartesian coordinates once again that 's sierra leone  
 this is again indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form maps of the universe because that 's why we 're here really i think to figure stuff out and to love each other
  took descartes and just flipped him around now monaco is problematic for me and i 'll show you why here is a map all they have is a casino on it 
 and why franklin delano roosevelt is on their map i don 't even want to hazard a guess but i 'd say he 'd been to hellespointica depressio recently 
 this is the flag of monaco ladies and gentlemen the flag of
  bode 's law wasn 't even his law it was a guy named
  the reason i just bring this up because it is a law that doesn 't really work  that 's jude law and some of his films recently didn 't work 
 just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted  and i wonder if the photographer said okay jude could you touch your tooth that 's good 
 just a tip if you 're being photographed for press pictures don 't touch your teeth 
 prime numbers  gauss one of my favorites golden section i 've been obsessed with this thing since before i was born
  that scares a lot of you but that was my purpose entirely  there we can see fibonacci numbers related to the golden section because fibonacci and golden section relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter as i refer to it  
 if fibonacci had been on paxil 
 that would be the fibonacci series
  alright where is this going that 's a good question here is the premise that i began twenty seven years ago 
 if numbers can express the laws of this incredible universe that we live i reason through some sort of reverse engineering we could extrapolate from them some basic structural element of this universe  
 and that 's what i
 i started working on this  and i tried to build
 a particle accelerator 
 and that didn 't work out well so then i thought a calculator is a metaphor i can just divide numbers that 's like atom smashing  that 's what i did that 's how i found moleeds moleeds are what i believe the thing that will allow string
 theory to be proved they are
 the nodes on the string patterns and relationships 
 that was the first chart i came up with  you can see even if you don 't go for the numbers 
 the beauty of the symmetry the numbers from one to thirty six divided into six groups symmetry pairs every top
 adds up to thirty seven bottom all 
  so many intricate relationships that i 'm not going to go there now because you would say
  go back to the fluctus part 
 circle of fifths  acoustic harmony 
 geometric symmetry i knew those two were related once again the cartesian kind of cross over so i said if i 'm going to put a circle see what kind of patterns i get boom  the red system look at that you can 't just
  going to put some triangles in a circle and they 're going to be symmetrical and they 're all going to add up and it 's going to be oh yeah i figured that out this is beyond anything anybody could just make up there is the orange system 
 and you 'll see over here these are multiples of the number twenty seven and they recapitulate that shape even though that 's a circle of nine and that 's a circle
  that 's the green system  
 it all folds in half on the green system right between eighteen and nineteen the blue system  the violet it 's all there 
 look at that i mean you cannot make that stuff
  this last year i have found these subsequent systems which
 allow for the mathematic possibilities of the calabi yau manifolds in a way that doesn 't necessitate these little hidden dimensions which works
  but it just doesn 't seem god like to me it just seems like
 it 's not sexy and elegant it 's hidden  i don 't want hidden  i want to see it 
 i found other pairs all have symmetry even though  unlike the master one their symmetry is split unbelievable  
 this is like crazy am
 i the only one that sees this you know
 i didn 't just draw this in a day by the way you know try making some charts like this
 you gotta be accurate there 's measurement involved increments these are maps by the way not stamps but one day 
 okay i 'm getting to the punch golden ratio  
 it 's crazy  and look at this  built within it is the golden ratio  i start looking at that and look at them again they start looking like planets  i go to
  i look at the orbits of the planets  i find eighteen examples of it in our solar system  i never told anybody this is the first thing this could be history 
 kepler was right 
 eighteen and nineteen the middle of the moleeds zero point six one eight
