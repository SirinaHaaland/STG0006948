  like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a
 still photographer for national geographic magazine 
 i guess i became an underwater photographer and a photojournalist because i fell in love with the sea as a child  and i wanted
  tell stories about all the amazing things i was seeing underwater 
 incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors  
 and after even thirty years of doing this after thirty years of exploring the ocean i never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that i have while i 'm at sea 
 but more and more frequently these days i 'm seeing terrible things underwater as
  things that i don 't think most people realize  
 and i 've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues to tell a more complete story i want people to see what 's happening underwater both the horror and the magic  
 the first story that i did for national geographic where i recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage was a story i proposed on harp seals
 the story i wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down
  from the canadian arctic to the gulf of st lawrence in canada to engage in courtship mating and to have their pups and all of this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide  
 and because i 'm an underwater photographer i wanted to do this story from both above and below to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups making its very first
  but as i got more involved in the story i realized that there were two big environmental issues i couldn 't ignore 
 the first was that these animals continue to be hunted 
 killed with hakapiks at about eight fifteen days old it actually is the largest marine mammal slaughter on the planet with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year  
 but as disturbing as that is i think the bigger problem for harp seals is the loss of sea ice due to global warming this is an aerial picture that i made that shows the gulf of
  during harp seal season and even though we see a lot of ice in this picture there 's a lot of water as well which wasn 't there historically and the ice that is there is quite thin 
 the problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms  they only need twelve days from the moment they 're born until they 're on their own but if they don 't get twelve days they can fall into the ocean
  this is a photo that i made showing one of these pups that 's only about five or seven days old still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly that has fallen in because of the thin ice and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase 
 this problem has continued to grow each year since i was there i read that last year the pup mortality rate was one hundred percent in parts of the gulf of st lawrence so clearly this species has a lot of problems 
  going forward  this ended up becoming a cover story at national geographic and it received quite a bit of attention
 and with that i saw the potential to begin doing other stories about ocean problems  so i proposed a story on the global fish crisis in part because i had personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last thirty years but also because i read a scientific paper
 that stated that ninety percent of the big fish in the ocean have disappeared in the last fifty or sixty years  these are the
  the billfish and the sharks
 when i read that i was blown away by those numbers i thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet  but it really wasn 't so i wanted to do a story that was a very different kind of
  underwater story i wanted it to be more like war photography where i was making harder hitting pictures that showed
  people go into a restaurant and somebody orders a steak and we all know where steak comes from and somebody orders
 a chicken and we know what a chicken is but
 when they 're eating bluefin sushi do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they 're consuming these are the lions and tigers of the sea 
 in reality these animals have no terrestrial counterpart they 're unique in the world these are animals that can practically swim from the equator to the poles and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a
 if we weren 't so efficient at catching them because they grow their entire life would have 30 year old bluefin out there that weigh a ton  
 but the truth is we 're way too efficient at catching them  and their stocks have collapsed worldwide  this is the daily auction at the tsukiji fish market that i photographed a couple years ago and
 every single day these tuna  bluefin like this are stacked up like cordwood
  just warehouse after warehouse as i wandered around and made these pictures it sort of occurred to me that the ocean 's not a grocery store you know we can 't keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result  
 i also with the story wanted to show readers how fish are caught some of the methods that are used to catch fish like a bottom trawler which is one of the most common methods in the world this was a small net 
  that was being used in mexico to catch shrimp but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world you have a a large net in the middle with two steel doors on either end
  and as this assembly is towed through the water the doors meet resistance with the ocean and it opens the mouth of the net and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom and this just drags 
  over the bottom in this case to catch shrimp  but as you can imagine it 's catching everything else in its path as well  and it 's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom things like sponges and corals
  critical habitat for other animals 
 this photograph i made of the fisherman holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour 
 so he had a handful of shrimp maybe seven or eight shrimp and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch these are animals that died in the process  but have no commercial value  
 so this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner maybe seven or eight shrimp
 and ten pounds of other animals that had to die in the process  and to make that point even more
  i swam under the shrimp boat and made this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash and photographed this cascade of death you know animals like guitarfish bat rays  flounder  pufferfish that only an hour before 
 were on the bottom of the ocean alive but now being thrown back as trash
 i also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because currently on planet earth we 're killing over one hundred million sharks
 every single year  but before i went out to photograph this component i sort of wrestled with
  notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers you know i think there 's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark 
 but this one morning i jumped in and found this thresher that had just recently died in the gill net  and with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible it struck me as sort of a crucifixion if you will 
  this ended up being the lead picture in the global fishery story in national geographic and i hope that it helped readers to take notice
  of this problem of one hundred million sharks  
 and because i love sharks i 'm somewhat obsessed with sharks i wanted to do another more celebratory story about sharks as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation so i went to the bahamas because 
 there 're very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days but the bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy  largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago  
  show several species that we hadn 't shown much in the magazine
 and worked in a number of locations one of the locations was this place called tiger beach in the northern bahamas where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water this is a low altitude photograph that i made showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind 
 but the one thing i definitely didn 't want to do with this coverage was to
 continue to portray sharks as something like monsters i didn 't want
  them to be overly threatening or scary  and with this photograph of a beautiful
  i guess female tiger shark i sort of think i got to that goal where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose and my strobe created a shadow on her face and i think it 's a gentler picture a little less threatening a little more respectful of the species
  i also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead an animal that really hadn 't been photographed much until maybe about seven or ten years ago it 's a very solitary creature but this is an animal 
  that 's considered data deficient by science in both florida and in the bahamas you know we know almost nothing about them we don 't know where they migrate to or from where they mate where they have their pups
  and yet hammerhead populations in the atlantic have declined about eighty percent in the last twenty to thirty years you know we 're losing them faster than we can possibly find them
  the oceanic whitetip shark an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species if you pay attention to such lists but it 's an animal that 's about ninety eight percent in decline throughout most 
  of its range because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water  and because we weren 't working on the bottom i brought along
  biologist is a little smarter than the photographer i guess  
 and lastly with this story i also wanted to focus on baby sharks shark nurseries  
 and i went to the island of bimini in the bahamas to work with lemon shark pups  this is a photo of a lemon shark pup and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives in these protective mangroves
  it 's not what you typically might think of as a shark picture but you know 
 here we see a shark that 's maybe ten or eleven inches long swimming in about a foot of water but this is crucial habitat and it 's where they spend the first two three years of their lives until they 're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef after i left bimini i actually learned that
 this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort and other recent stories have
  flagship species if you will that are at risk
 in the ocean as a way of talking about other threats one such story i did documented the leatherback sea turtle this is the largest
 and oldest of all turtle species here we see a female crawling out of the ocean under moonlight on the island of trinidad 
 these are animals whose lineage dates back about one hundred million years  and there was a time in their lifespan where they were coming out of the water to nest and saw tyrannosaurus rex
  by and today they crawl out and see condominiums  
 but despite this amazing longevity they 're now considered critically endangered in the pacific where i made this photograph their stocks have declined about ninety percent in the last fifteen years  
 this is a photograph that shows a hatchling about to taste saltwater for the very first time beginning this long and perilous journey only one in a thousand leatherback hatchlings will reach
  maturity but that 's due to natural predators like vultures that pick them off on a beach or predatory fish that are waiting offshore nature has learned to compensate with that and
 females have multiple clutches of eggs to overcome those odds but what they can 't deal with is anthropogenic stresses human things like this picture that shows a leatherback caught at night in a gill net i actually jumped in and photographed this 
 and with the fisherman 's permission
  the turtle out and it was able to swim free but you know thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate and the species ' future is in great danger 
 another charismatic megafauna species that i worked with is the story i did on the right whale  and essentially the story is this with right whales that about a million years ago there was one species of right 
  whale on the planet  but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated the species sort of separated and today
  we have essentially two distinct stocks we have the southern right whale that we see here
 and the north atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and calf off the coast of florida now
 both species were hunted to the brink of extinction by the early whalers  but the southern right whales have rebounded a lot better because they 're located in places farther away from human activity 
 the north atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet today because they are urban whales
  live along the east coast of north america united states and canada and they have to deal with all these urban ills this photo shows
 an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of florida you can see the coal burning plant in the background they have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean and maybe even affecting their reproduction 
 they also get entangled in fishing
  this is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale and those white markings are not natural markings these are entanglement scars seventy two percent of the population has such scars  but most 
  don 't shed the gear things like lobster traps and crab pots they hold on to them and it eventually kills them 
 against these animals and keeping their numbers very low 
 and to draw a contrast with that beleaguered north atlantic population i went to a new pristine population of southern right whales that had only been discovered about ten years ago in the sub antarctic of new zealand a place called the auckland islands i went down there in the winter time 
 and these are animals that had never seen humans before  
 and i was one of the first people they
  i got in the water with them and i was amazed at how curious they were this photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about seventy feet and one of these amazingly beautiful 
 whales like a city bus just swimming up you know  they were in perfect condition very fat and healthy robust no entanglement scars  the way they 're supposed to look you know
 i read that the pilgrims when they landed at plymouth rock in massachusetts in one thousand six hundred and
  wrote that you could walk across cape cod bay on the backs of right whales  and we can 't go back and and see that today but maybe we can preserve what we have left  and i wanted to close this program with a
 story of hope a story i did on marine reserves as sort of a solution to the problem of overfishing the global fish crisis story i settled on working in the country of new zealand because 
 new zealand was rather progressive and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean and i really wanted this story to be about three things i wanted it to be about abundance 
  resilience and one of the first places i worked was
 a reserve called goat island in leigh
 of new zealand what the scientists there told me was that when protected this first marine reserve in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five they hoped and expected that certain things might happen 
 for example they hoped that certain species of fish like the new zealand snapper would return because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction and they did come back what they couldn 't predict was that other things
  would happen for example 
 these fish predate on sea urchins 
 and when the fish were all gone all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins 
 but when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population low and behold 
 kelp forests emerged in shallow water  and that 's because the urchins eat kelp so when the fish control the urchin population the ocean was restored to
  its natural equilibrium you know this is probably how the ocean looked here one or two hundred years ago but nobody was around to tell us 
 i worked in other parts of new zealand as well in beautiful fragile protected areas like in fiordland where this sea pen colony was found little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color
 in the northern part of new zealand  i dove in the
 blue water where the water 's a little warmer and photographed animals like this giant sting ray swimming through an underwater canyon 
 every part of the ecosystem in this place seems very healthy from tiny little animals like a nudibrank crawling over encrusting sponge
 or a leatherjacket that is a very important animal in this ecosystem because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold  
 and i wanted to finish with this photograph a picture i made
 on a very stormy day in new zealand when i just laid on the bottom amidst a school
 fish swirling around me  and i was in a place that had only been protected about twenty years ago  and i talked to divers that had been diving there for many years and they said that the marine life was better here today 
 than it was in the 1960s and that 's because it 's been protected that it has come back
