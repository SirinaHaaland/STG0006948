  how can i speak in ten minutes about the bonds of women over three generations 
 about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a  four year old girl
 huddled with her young sister her mother and her grandmother
  for five days and nights in a small boat in the china sea more than thirty years ago 
 bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go
 that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today  this is not a finished story it is a
  puzzle still being put together
 let me tell you about some of the pieces  
 imagine the first piece  a man burning his life 's work  
 he is a poet  a playwright  a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope
 of his country 's unity and freedom  imagine him as the communists enter saigon
 confronting
  the fact that his life had been a complete waste  words for so long his friends now mocked him 
 he retreated into silence  he died broken by history 
 he is my grandfather  i never knew him in real life 
 but our lives are much more than our memories 
 my grandmother never let me forget his life my duty was not to allow it to have been in vain
  my lesson was to learn that yes history tried to crush us  but we endured 
 the next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn
 slipping silently out to sea  my mother mai was eighteen when her father died
 already in an arranged marriage  already with two small girls for her life had distilled itself into one
  task the escape of her family and a new life in australia it was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed 
 so after a four year saga that defies fiction a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel 
 all the adults knew the risks the greatest fear was of pirates rape and death
  like most adults on the boat  my mother carried a small bottle of poison 
 if we were captured first my sister and i  then she and my grandmother would drink  
 my first memories are from the boat
 the steady beat of the engine  the bow dipping into each wave  the vast and empty horizon 
 i don 't remember the pirates who came
  times but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat  or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours  
 but i do remember the lights on the oil rig off the malaysian coast
 and the young man who collapsed and died  the journey 's end too much for him  and the first apple i tasted given to me by the men on
  apple has ever tasted the same 
 after three months in a refugee camp  we landed in melbourne  
 and the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together  
 we settled in footscray a working class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants  unlike the settled
 suburbs whose existence i was oblivious of there was no sense of entitlement in footscray  
 the smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world  and the snippets of halting english were exchanged between people who had one thing in common 
 they were starting again  
 my mother worked on farms  then on a car assembly line working six days double shifts
  time to study english and gain it qualifications we were poor 
 all the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in english and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what missed out 
 which was usually new clothes 
 they were always secondhand two pairs of stockings for school each to hide the holes in the other  
 a school uniform down
  to the ankles because it had to last for six years  
 and there were rare but searing chants of slit eye and the occasional graffiti asian go home 
 go home to where something stiffened inside me there was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying
  i will bypass you 
 my mother my sister and i
 slept in the same bed  
 my mother was exhausted each night  but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house  
 my mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat  
 and my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so i could wake her 
 she opened a computer store
  studied to be a beautician and opened another business 
 and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition 
 angry and inflexible and troubled children caught between two worlds  
 grants and sponsors were sought  centers were established 
 i lived in parallel worlds 
  in one i was the classic asian student  relentless in the demands that i made on myself 
 in the other i was enmeshed in lives that were precarious  tragically scarred by violence  drug abuse and isolation  
 but so many over the years were helped and for that work when i was a final year law student  
 i was chosen as the young australian of the year and i was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another 
 and their edges didn 't fit
  footscray resident was now tan le refugee and social activist  invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes
 whose existence she could never have imagined  i didn 't know the protocols  i didn 't know how to use the cutlery  
 i didn 't know how to talk about wine  i didn 't know how to talk about anything  
 i wanted to retreat to the
  routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb
 a grandmother a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost twenty years telling one another the story of their day
 and falling asleep  the three of us still in the same bed  
 i told my mother i couldn 't do it she reminded me that i was now the same age
  she had been
 when we boarded the boat no had never been an option 
 just do it she said and don 't be what you 're not 
 so i spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and disenfranchised  and the more candidly i spoke the more
 i was asked to speak 
 i met people from all walks of life so many of them doing the thing they loved living on the frontiers of possibility  
 and even though i finished my degree i realized i could not settle into a career in law there had to be another piece of the jigsaw 
 and i realized at the same time that it is ok to be an outsider  a recent arrival new on the scene
 and not just ok
 but something to be thankful for perhaps a gift from the boat  
 because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons 
 can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province  
 i have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that  yes the world does fall apart  but not in the way that you fear possibilities
 that would not have been allowed were
  outrageously encouraged there was an energy there an implacable optimism  a strange mixture of humility and daring 
 so i followed my hunches i gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label it can 't be done was an irresistible challenge 
 for a year we were penniless at the end of each day i made a huge pot of soup which we all shared
  worked well into each night  most of our ideas were crazy  but a few were brilliant and we broke through  
 i made the decision to move to the us after only one trip my hunches again 
 three months later i had relocated  and the adventure has continued 
  let me tell you about my grandmother she grew up at a time when confucianism was the social norm
 and the local mandarin was the person who mattered life hadn 't changed for centuries 
 her father died soon after she was born her mother raised her alone 
 at seventeen she became the second wife of a mandarin
 whose mother beat her with no support from her
  husband she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case 
 and a far greater sensation when she won 
 it can 't be done was shown to be wrong  
 i was taking a shower in a hotel room in sydney the moment she died
  six hundred miles away in melbourne  
 i looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side i knew she had come to say goodbye  
 my mother phoned minutes later  
 a few days later  we went to a buddhist temple in footscray and sat around her casket  
 we told her stories and assured her that we were still with her 
  midnight  the monk came and told us he had to close the casket  
 my mother asked us to feel her hand  she asked the monk why is it that her hand is so warm
 and the rest of her is so cold because you have been holding it since this morning he said you have
  not let it go 
 if there is a sinew in our family it runs through the women  
 given who we were and how life had shaped us we can now see that the men that might have come into our lives would have thwarted us  
 defeat would have come too easily 
 now i would like to have my own children and i wonder about the boat 
 who could ever wish it on their own yet i am afraid of
  privilege of ease of entitlement 
 can i give them a bow in their lives dipping bravely into each wave  
 the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine  the vast horizon that guarantees nothing  
 i don 't know  but if i could give
  and still see them safely through  i would
