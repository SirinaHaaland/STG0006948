  when i was in morocco in casablanca not so long ago  i met a young unmarried mother called faiza 
 faiza showed me photos of her infant son
 and she told me the story of his conception pregnancy
  and delivery 
 it was a remarkable tale  but faiza saved the best for last 
 you know i am a virgin she told me i have two medical certificates to prove it 
 this is the modern middle east where two millennia after the coming of christ virgin births are still a fact of life
  faiza 's story is just one of hundreds i 've heard over the years traveling across the arab region talking to people about sex  
 now i know this might sound like a dream job or possibly a highly dubious occupation 
 but for me it 's something else altogether i 'm half egyptian and i 'm muslim but i grew up in canada far from my arab roots
  like so many who straddle east and west i 've been drawn over the years to try to better understand my origins 
 that i chose to look at sex comes from my background in hiv  aids as a writer and a researcher and an activist 
 sex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic in the middle east and north
  which is one of only two regions in the world where hiv aids is still on the rise  
 now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens with which to study any society  
 because what happens in our intimate lives is reflected by forces on a bigger stage  
 in politics and economics in religion and tradition in gender and
  as i found if you really want to know a people you start by looking inside their bedrooms 
 now to be sure the arab world is vast and varied  
 but running across it are three red lines these are topics you are not supposed to challenge in word or deed 
 the first of these is politics  but the arab spring has changed all that in uprisings which have blossomed across the region since two thousand and eleven
 now while those in power  old and new continue to cling to business as usual millions are still pushing back 
 and pushing forward to what they hope will be a better life  
 that second red line is religion 
 but now religion and politics are connected with the rise of such groups as the muslim brotherhood and some people at least
  are starting to ask questions about the role of islam in public and private life you know
 as for that third red line that off limits subject what do you think it might be
  across the arab region  the only accepted context for sex is marriage
 approved by your parents  sanctioned by religion and registered by the state 
 marriage is your ticket to adulthood if you don 't tie the knot you can 't move out of your parents ' place 
 and you 're not supposed to be having sex and you 're definitely not supposed to be having children 
  's a social citadel it 's an impregnable fortress which resists
 any assault any alternative  
 and around the fortress is this vast field of taboo against premarital sex against
 condoms against abortion against homosexuality  you name it faiza was living proof of this
  her virginity statement was not a piece of wishful thinking 
 although the major religions of the region extoll premarital chastity chastity  in a patriarchy boys will be boys 
 men have sex before marriage and people more or less turn a blind eye 
 not so for women who are expected to be virgins on their wedding night that is to
  turn up with your hymen intact  
 this is not a question of individual concern this is a matter of family honor and in particular men 's honor  
 and so women and their relatives will go to great lengths to preserve this tiny piece of anatomy
 from female genital mutilation
  only she became pregnant all the same  
 but faiza didn 't actually realize this because there 's so little sexuality education in schools  and so little communication in the family 
 when her condition became hard to hide faiza 's mother helped her flee her father and brothers
 this is because honor killings are a real threat for untold numbers of women in the arab region  
 and so when faiza eventually fetched up at a hospital in casablanca the man who offered to help her 
 instead tried to rape her  
  where my research is focused  i have seen plenty of trouble in and out of the citadel  
 there are legions of young men who can 't afford to get married because marriage has become a very expensive proposition 
 they are expected to bear the burden of costs in married life  but they can 't find jobs
  this is one of the major drivers of the recent uprisings and it is one of the reasons for the rising age of marriage in much of the arab region  
 there are career women who want to get married but can 't find a husband because they defy gender expectations 
 or as one young female doctor in tunisia put it to me the women they are becoming more and more open  but the man
  he is still at the prehistoric stage 
 and then there are men and women who cross the heterosexual line who have sex with their own sex or who have a different gender identity 
 they are on the receiving end of laws which punish their activities even their appearance 
 and they face a daily struggle with social stigma with family despair
  and with religious fire and brimstone 
 now it 's not as if it 's all rosy in the marital bed either 
 couples who are looking for greater happiness greater sexual happiness in their married lives  but are at a loss of how to achieve it especially wives who are afraid 
  of being seen as bad women if they show some spark in the bedroom  
  whose marriages are actually a veil for prostitution they have been sold by their families 
 often to wealthy arab tourists this is just one face of a booming sex trade across the arab region  
 now raise your hand if any of this is sounding familiar to you from your part of the world 
 yeah it 's not as if the arab
  we don 't yet have an arab kinsey report to tell us exactly what 's happening inside bedrooms across the arab region  
 it 's pretty clear that something is not right  
 double standards for men and women sex as a source of shame 
 family control limiting individual choices  
 and a vast gulf between appearance and reality what people are doing
  doing and what they 're willing to admit to and a general reluctance to move beyond private whispers
 to a serious and sustained public discussion 
 as one doctor in cairo summed it up for me here sex is the opposite of sport  football  everybody talks about it but
  i want to give you a piece of advice which if you follow it will make you happy in life  
 when your husband reaches out to you when he seizes a part of your body
 sigh deeply and look at him lustily  when he penetrates you with his penis try to talk 
 and move yourself in harmony with him  
 hot stuff  and it might sound that these handy hints come from the joy of sex or youporn but in fact they come from 
  arabic book called the encyclopedia of pleasure
  sex from
 aphrodisiacs to zoophilia and everything in between  
 the encyclopedia is just one in a long line of arabic erotica much of it written by religious scholars  
 going right back to the prophet muhammad there is a rich tradition in islam of talking frankly
  about sex not just its problems  but also its pleasures and not just for men  but also for women 
 a thousand years ago we used to have whole dictionaries of sex in arabic  
 words to cover every conceivable sexual feature  position and preference a body of language that was rich enough to make up the body of the woman you see on this page
  history is largely unknown in the arab region  even by educated people who often feel more comfortable talking about sex in a foreign language than they do in their own tongue
  today 's sexual landscape looks a lot like europe and america on the brink of the sexual revolution  
 but while the west has opened on sex what we found is that arab societies appear to
  have been moving in the opposite direction  
 in egypt and many of its neighbors this closing down is part of a wider closing in political social and cultural thought  
 and it is the product of a complex historical process one which has gained ground with the rise of islamic conservatism
  is what conservatives around the world say to any challenge to the sexual status quo 
 in the arab region they brand these attempts as a western conspiracy to undermine traditional arab and islamic values  
 but what 's really at stake here is one of their most powerful tools of
  but history shows us that even as recently as our fathers ' and grandfathers ' day 
 there have been times of greater pragmatism and tolerance and a willingness to consider other interpretations 
 be it abortion or masturbation or even the incendiary topic
  not black and white as conservatives would have us believe 
 in these as in so many other matters  islam offers us at least fifty shades of gray 
 laughter over my travels i 've met men and women across the arab region who 've been exploring that spectrum
  who are trying to help couples find
  greater happiness in their marriages  
 innovators who are managing to get sexuality education into schools  
 small groups of men and women  lesbian gay transgendered transsexual who are reaching out to their peers with online initiatives and real world support 
 women and increasingly men who are starting to speak out and push back against sexual violence on the streets and in the home
  home 
 groups that are trying to help sex workers protect themselves against hiv and other occupational hazards 
 and ngos that are helping unwed mothers like faiza find a place in society  and critically  stay with their kids  
 now these efforts are small they 're often underfunded and they face formidable opposition
 but i am optimistic that in the long run  times are changing  and they and their ideas will gain ground 
 social change doesn 't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation
  beating or indeed baring of breasts  but rather through negotiation
  what we 're talking here is not about a sexual revolution  
 but a sexual evolution 
 learning from other parts of the world adapting to local conditions  
 forging our own path not following one blazed by another 
 that path  i hope will one day lead us to the right to control our own bodies 
 and to access the information and services we need to lead satisfying and safe sexual
  lives 
 the right to express our ideas freely to marry whom we choose to choose our own partners to be sexually active or not to decide whether to have children and when 
 all this without violence or force or discrimination  
 now we are very far from this across the arab region  and so much needs to
  change law  education media the economy the list goes on and on 
 and it is the work of a generation at least  
 but it begins with a journey that i myself have made asking hard questions of received wisdoms in sexual life  
 and it is a journey which has only served to strengthen my faith and my
  appreciation of local histories and cultures
 by showing me possibilities
 where i once only saw absolutes  
 now given the turmoil in many countries in the arab region talking about sex  challenging the taboos seeking alternatives
 might sound like something of a luxury  but at this critical moment in history if we do not
 anchor freedom and justice  dignity and equality  privacy and autonomy in our personal lives in our sexual lives 
 we will find it very hard to achieve in public life  
 the political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows  and that is true for us
  no matter where we live and love  thank you
