  how many choices you make in a typical day 
 do you know how many choices you make in typical week  i recently did a survey with over two thousand americans
  and the average number of choices that the typical american reports making is about seventy in a typical day 
 there was also recently a a study done with ceos in which they followed ceos around for a whole week  
 and these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these ceos engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks 
 and they found that the average ceo
 engaged in about one hundred and thirty nine tasks in a week
  task was made up of many many many sub choices of course fifty percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less 
 only about twelve percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time 
 think about your own choices  do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category how well do you think you 're doing
  at managing those choices  
 today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have which is the choice overload problem i
 want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions  
 now as i talk about this problem
 i 'm going to have some questions for you and i 'm going to want to know your answers
  when i ask you a question  since i 'm blind only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories 
 otherwise when i ask you a question and if your answer is yes i 'd like you to clap your hands  
 so for my first question for you today are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem 
 thank you so when i was a graduate student at stanford
  university  i used to go to this very very upscale grocery store at least at that time it was truly upscale it was a store called draeger 's 
 now this store  it was almost like going to an amusement park  they had two hundred and fifty different kinds of mustards and vinegars and
 over five hundred different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water
  i used to love going to this store  but
 on one occasion i asked myself  well how come you never buy anything here 's their olive oil aisle
 they had over seventy five different kinds of olive oil including those that were in a locked case that came from  thousand year old olive trees  
 so i one day decided to pay a visit to the manager and i asked
  is this model of offering people all this choice really working 
 and he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday with cameras ready usually  we decided to do a little experiment  
 and we picked jam for our experiment here 's their jam aisle they had three hundred and forty eight different kinds of jam  we set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store 
  we there put out six different flavors of jam or twenty four different flavors of jam  
 first in which case were people more likely to
 stop sample some jam more people stopped when there were twenty four about sixty percent than when there were six about forty percent  
 the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam now we see the opposite effect 
 of the people who stopped when there were twenty four only three percent of them actually bought a jar of
  jam of the people who stopped when there were six  
 well now we saw that thirty percent of them actually bought a jar of jam  
 now if you do the math people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered twenty four now
 choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us at least it 's good for our waistlines but it turns out that this choice overload problem
  affects us even in very consequential decisions we choose not to choose even when it goes against our best  self interests 
 so now for the topic of today financial savings now i 
  going to describe to you a study i did with gur huberman emir kamenica wei jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions
 of nearly a million americans
 from about six hundred and fifty plans
 all in the u s 
 and what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan the four hundred and one plan  
 does that affect people 's likelihood to save more for tomorrow  
 and what we found was that indeed there was a correlation  so in these plans we had about six hundred and
  plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to fifty nine different fund offerings  
 and what we found was that the more funds offered indeed there was less participation rate so if you look at the extremes those plans that offered you 
 two funds participation rates were around in the  mid 70s still not as high as we want it to be 
 participation rates have now dropped to about the 60th percentile  now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate
 when there are more choices present  even then it has negative consequences  
 so for those people who did choose to participate  the more choices available
  the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds  
 the more choices available the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts  now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions
  that any of us would recommend for people when you 're considering their future financial well being 
  delay choosing procrastinate even when it goes against their best self interest they 're more likely to make worse choices worse financial choices medical choices  
 they 're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied even when they do objectively better 
 the main reason for this is because  we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises mustards vinegars jams but we can 't actually do the math of comparing
  and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display  so what i want to propose to you today are four simple techniques
 techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues
 that you can easily apply in your businesses the first  cut
  you 've heard it said before  but it 's never been more true than today that less is more 
 people are always upset when i say cut 
 they 're always worried they 're going to lose shelf space  but in fact what we 're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut get rid of those extraneous redundant options  well there 's an increase in sales 
 there 's a lowering of costs there is an improvement of the choosing experience 
 when proctor & gamble went from twenty six different kinds of head
  shoulders to fifteen they saw an increase in sales by ten percent when the golden cat corporation got rid of their ten  worst selling cat litter products  they saw an increase in profits by eighty seven percent
 a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs 
 you know the average grocery store today offers you forty five thousand products the typical walmart today offers you one hundred thousand products  but the ninth
  ninth largest retailer the ninth biggest retailer in the world today is aldi and it offers you only one thousand four hundred products one kind of canned tomato sauce  
 now in the financial savings world i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that david laibson was heavily involved in designing which was the program that they have
  at harvard 
 every single harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a lifecycle fund 
 for those people who actually want to choose  
 they 're given twenty funds  not three hundred or more funds you know often people say i don 't know how to cut  
 they 're all important choices and the first thing i do is i ask
  tell me how these choices are different from one another and if your employees can 't tell them apart  neither can your consumers 
 now before we started our session this afternoon i had a chat with gary and gary said that he would be willing
 to offer people in this audience an
 free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world here
  to read it and now i 'll give you a few seconds to read it and then i want you to clap your hands if you 're ready to take gary up on his offer 
 okay anybody who 's ready to take him up on his offer is that all 
 all right let me show you some more about this 
 you guys knew there was a trick didn 't you
 now who 's ready to go on this trip 
 laughter i think i might have actually heard more hands  
 all right  now
 in fact you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around but i would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real
  the second time around  because the pictures made it
 feel more real to you 
 which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem which is concretization 
 that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice 
 and that the consequences need to be felt
  vivid sort of way in a very concrete way  
 why do people spend an average of fifteen to thirty percent more when they use an atm card or a credit card as opposed to cash  because it doesn 't feel like real money 
 and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more so a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero we
 we did a study with people at ing employees that are all working at ing
 and now these people were all in a session where they 're doing enrollment for their four hundred and one plan  
 and during that session we kept the session exactly the way it used to be but we added one little thing 
 the one little thing we added
 was we asked people to just think about all the positive
  things that would happen in your life if you saved more 
 by doing that simple thing 
 there was an increase in enrollment by twenty percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent 
 the third technique  categorization
  we can handle more categories than we can handle choices  so for example 
 here 's a study we did in a magazine aisle it
 turns out that in wegmans grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor 
 the magazine aisles range anywhere from three hundred and thirty one different kinds of magazines all the way up to six hundred and sixty four 
 but you know what 
 if i show you six hundred magazines and i divide them up into ten categories versus i show you four hundred
  magazines and divide them up into twenty categories 
 you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if i gave you the four hundred than if i gave you the six hundred 
 because the categories tell me how to tell them apart  
 here are two different jewelry displays one is called jazz and
  if you think the display on the left is swing and the display on the right is jazz clap your hands okay there 's
 some if you think the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing clap your hands okay
 a bit more   now it turns out you 're right the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing but you know what this
  the categories need to say something to the chooser  not the 
 and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds who are they actually supposed to be informing 
 my fourth technique  condition for complexity it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can we 've just got to take it a little easier
 have to gradually increase the complexity i 'm going to show you one example of what i 'm talking about let 's take a very very complicated decision buying a car  
 here 's a german car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car you 've got to make sixty different decisions completely make up your car  now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision  
 car colors exterior car
  colors i 've got fifty six choices  engines  gearshift four choices  
 so now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear  so half of the customers are going to go from high choice fifty six car colors to low choice four gearshifts  the other half of the customers are going to go from low choice
  car colors high choice 
 what am i going to look at 
 how engaged you are if you keep hitting the default button per decision that means you 're getting overwhelmed that means i 'm losing you 
 what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice they 're hitting that default button over and over and over again we 're losing them 
 they go from low choice to high choice  they 're hanging in there it 's the same information
 it 's the same number of choices the only thing that i have done is i have varied the order in which that information is presented if i start you off easy  i learn how to choose even though
 choosing gearshift doesn 't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor it still prepares me for how to choose it also gets me excited about this big product that i 'm putting together so i 'm more willing
  to be motivated to be engaged 
 so let me recap i have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload
 cut
 get rid of the extraneous alternatives  concretize make it real 
 categorize we can handle more categories less choices  condition for complexity 
 all of these techniques that i 'm
  describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices better for you you can use them on yourself better for the people that you are serving  because 
  i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing
