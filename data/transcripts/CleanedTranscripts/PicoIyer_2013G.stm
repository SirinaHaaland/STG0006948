  you come from
 it 's such a simple question but these days of course simple questions bring ever more complicated answers
 people are always asking me where i come from
 and they 're expecting me to say india
 and they 're absolutely right insofar
  as one hundred percent of my blood and ancestry does come from india except i 've never lived one day of my life there
 i can 't speak even one word of its more than twenty two thousand dialects so i don 't think i 've really earned the right to call myself an indian
 and if where do you come from means where were you born and raised and educated then i 'm entirely of that
  funny little country known as england except i left england as soon as i completed my undergraduate education and all the time i was growing up i was the only kid in all 
  my classes who didn 't begin to look like the classic english heroes represented in our textbooks
 where do you see your doctor and your dentist
 then i 'm very much of the united states and i have been for forty eight years now since i was a really small child except for many of those years i 've had to carry around 
  this funny little pink card with green lines running through my face identifying me as a permanent alien i do actually feel more alien the longer i live there laughter
 if where do you come from means which place goes deepest inside you and where do you try
  to spend most of your time then i 'm japanese because i 've been living as much as i can for the last twenty five years in japan
 except all of those years i 've been there on a tourist visa and i 'm fairly sure not many japanese would want to consider me one of them
 and i say all this just to stress how very old fashioned and straightforward my background is because when i
  go to hong kong or sydney or vancouver
 most of the kids i meet are much more international and multi cultured than i am
 and they have one home associated with their parents but another associated with their partners a third connected maybe with the place where they happen to be a fourth connected with the place they dream of being and many more besides
 and their whole life will be spent
 taking pieces of many different places and putting them together into a stained glass whole
 home for them is really a work in progress it 's like a project on which they 're constantly adding upgrades and improvements and corrections
 and for more and more of us home has really less to do with a piece of soil than you could say with a piece of soul
  if somebody suddenly asks me where 's your home i think about my sweetheart or my closest friends or the songs that travel with me wherever i happen to be
 and i 'd always felt this way but it really came home to me as it were
 some years ago when i was climbing up the stairs in my parents house in california
 and i looked through the living room windows and i saw that we were encircled
 by seventy foot flames one of those wildfires that regularly tear through the hills of california and many other such places
 and three hours later that fire had reduced my home and every last thing in it except for me to ash
 and when i woke up the next morning i was sleeping on a friend 's floor the only thing i had in the world was a toothbrush i
  just bought from an all night supermarket of course if anybody asked me then where is your home i literally couldn 't point to any physical construction
 my home would have to be whatever i carried around inside me
 and in so many ways i think this is a terrific liberation
 because when my grandparents were born they pretty much had their sense of home their sense of community even
  their sense of enmity assigned to them at birth and didn 't have much chance of stepping outside of that
 and nowadays at least some of us can choose our sense of home create our sense of community
 fashion our sense of self and in so doing maybe step a little beyond some of the black and white divisions of our grandparents age no coincidence that the president of the strongest nation on
  is half kenyan partly raised in indonesia has a chinese canadian brother in law
 the number of people living in countries not their own now comes to two hundred and twenty million
 and that 's an almost unimaginable number but it means that if you took the whole population of canada and the whole population of australia
 and then the whole population of australia again
 and the whole population of canada again and doubled that number you would still have fewer people than belong to this great floating tribe
 and the number of us who live outside the old nation state categories is increasing so quickly
 by sixty four million just in the last twelve years that soon there will be more of us than there are americans already we represent the fifth largest nation
 on earth
 and in fact in canada 's largest city toronto
 the average resident today is what used to be called a foreigner somebody born in a very different country
 and i 've always felt that the beauty of being surrounded by the foreign is that it slaps you awake you can 't take anything for granted
  travel for me is a little bit like being in love because suddenly all your senses are at the setting marked on suddenly you 're alert to the secret patterns of the world
 the real voyage of discovery as marcel proust famously said
 consists not in seeing new sights but in looking with new eyes
 and of course once you have new eyes even the old sights even your home become something different
 many of the people living in countries
  not their own are refugees who never wanted to leave home and ache to go back home
 but for the fortunate among us i think the age of movement brings exhilarating new possibilities certainly when i 'm traveling especially to the major cities of the world
 the typical person i meet today will be let 's say a half korean half german young woman living in paris
 and
 as soon as she meets a half thai half canadian young guy from edinburgh
 she recognizes him as kin she realizes that she probably has much more in common with him than with anybody entirely of korea or entirely of germany so they become friends they fall in love they move to new york
  or edinburgh
 and the little girl who arises out of their union will of course be not korean or german or french or thai or scotch or canadian or even american but a wonderful and constantly evolving mix of all those places
 and potentially
 everything about the way that young woman dreams about the world writes about the world thinks about the world could be something different because it
  comes out of this almost unprecedented blend of cultures where you come from now is much less important than where you 're going
 more and more of us are rooted in the future or the present tense as much as in the past
 and home we know is not just the place where you happen to be born
 it 's the place where you become yourself
 and yet
  yet
 there is one great problem with movement and that is that it 's really hard to get your bearings when you 're in midair
 some years ago i noticed that i had accumulated one million miles on united airlines alone
 you all know that crazy system six days in hell you get the seventh
  i began to think that really movement was only as good as the sense of stillness that you could bring to it to put it into perspective
 and eight months after my house burned down i ran into a friend who taught at a local high school and he said i 've got the perfect place for you
 really i said i 'm always a bit skeptical when people say things like that no honestly he went on it it 's only three hours away by
  car and it 's not very expensive and it 's probably not like anywhere you 've stayed before hmm i was beginning to get slightly intrigued what is it
 well here my friend hemmed and hawed well actually it 's a catholic hermitage
 this was the wrong answer i had spent fifteen years in anglican schools so i had had enough hymnals and crosses to last me a lifetime
  several lifetimes actually
 but my friend assured me that he wasn 't catholic nor were most of his students but he took his classes there every spring
 and as he had it even the most restless distractible testosterone addled fifteen year old californian boy
 only had to spend three days in silence and something in him cooled down
 and cleared out
 he found himself
 and i thought anything that works for a fifteen year old boy ought to work for me so i got in my car and i drove three hours north along the coast
 and the roads grew emptier and narrower and then i turned onto an even narrower path barely paved that snaked for two miles up to the top of a mountain
 and when i got out of my
  car
 the air was pulsing
 the whole place was absolutely silent but the silence wasn 't an absence of noise
 it was really a presence of a kind of energy or quickening
 and at my feet was the great still blue plate of the pacific ocean
 all around me were eight hundred acres of wild dry brush and i went down to the room in which i
  to be sleeping small but eminently comfortable it had a bed and a rocking chair and a long desk and even longer picture windows
 looking out on a small private walled garden
 and then one thousand two hundred feet of golden pampas grass running down to the sea
 and i sat down and i began to write and write and write even though i 'd gone there really to get away
  from my desk and by the time i got up four hours had passed night had fallen
 and i went out under this great overturned saltshaker of stars
 and i could see the tail lights of cars disappearing around the headlands twelve miles to the south and it really seemed like my concerns of the previous day vanishing
  and the next day when i woke up in the absence of telephones and tvs and laptops
 the days seemed to stretch for a thousand hours it was really all the freedom i know when i 'm traveling but it also profoundly felt
 like coming home
 and i 'm not a religious person so i didn 't go to the services i didn 't consult the monks for guidance i just took walks
 along the monastery road and sent postcards to loved ones i looked at the clouds and i did what is hardest of all for me to do usually
 which is nothing at all
 and i started to go back to this place and i noticed that i was doing my most important work there invisibly
 just by sitting still
 and certainly coming to my most critical decisions
  the way i never could when i was racing from the last email to the next appointment
 and i began to think that something in me had really been crying out for stillness but of course i couldn 't hear it because i was running around so much i was like some crazy guy who puts on a blindfold and then complains that he can 't see a thing
 and i thought back to that wonderful phrase i had learned as a boy from seneca in which he says
 that man is poor not who has little but who hankers after more
 and of course i 'm not suggesting that anybody here go into a monastery that 's not the point
 but i do think it 's only by stopping movement that you can see where to go
 and it 's only by stepping out of your life and the world that you can see what you most
  deeply care about and find a home
 and i 've noticed so many people now take conscious measures to sit quietly for thirty minutes every morning just collecting themselves in one corner of the room without their devices 
 or go running every evening or leave their cell phones behind when they go to have a long conversation with a friend
 and it allows us to do so much that our grandparents could never have dreamed of doing
 but movement ultimately only has a meaning if you have a home to go back to
 and home in the end is of course not just the place where you sleep it 's the place where you stand thank you
