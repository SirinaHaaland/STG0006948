  the world is filled with incredible objects and rich cultural heritage  
 and when we get access to them  we are blown away  we fall in love but
  most of the time the world 's population is living without real access to arts and culture  
 what might the connections be when we start exploring our heritage the beautiful locations and the art in this world 
 before we get started in this presentation i just want to
 take care of a few housekeeping points first i am no expert in art or culture  i fell into this by mistake  but i 'm loving it
 all of what i 'm going to show you belongs to the amazing museums  archives and foundations that we partner with none of this belongs to google  
 and finally  
 what you see behind me is available right now on your mobile phones on your laptops  this is our current platform where you can explore thousands of museums and objects at your fingertips in extremely
 high definition detail the diversity of the content is what 's amazing if we just had european paintings if we just had modern art  i think it gets a bit boring for example  this month we launched the black history 
  curated exhibitions  which talk about arts and culture in that community
  one of my favorite
 exhibitions which actually is the idea of my talk is i didn 't expect to become a fan of japanese dolls  
 but i am  thanks to this exhibition that has really taught me  about the craftsmanship behind the soul
  very exciting take my word for it so moving on swiftly
 one quick thing i wanted to showcase in this platform which you can share with your kids and your friends right now 
 is you can travel to all these amazing institutions virtually as well one of our recent ideas was with the guggenheim museum in new york where
 you can get a taste of what it might feel like to actually be there
  you can go to the ground floor and obviously most of you i assume have been there and you can see the architectural masterpiece that it is but imagine this accessibility for a kid in bombay who 's studying architecture
 who hasn 't had a chance to go to the guggenheim as yet  you can obviously look at objects in the guggenheim museum  you can obviously get into them and so on and so forth there 's a lot of information here  
 but this is not
 the purpose of my talk today this exists right now what we now
  have are the building blocks to a very exciting future when it comes to arts and culture and accessibility to arts and culture  
 so i am joined today onstage by my good friend and artist in residence at our office in paris cyril diagne who is the professor of interactive design at ecal university in lausanne switzerland
 what cyril and our team of engineers have been doing is trying to find these connections and visualize a few of these
 so i 'm going to go quite quick now  this object you see behind me oh just clarification always seeing the real thing is better in case people think i 'm trying to replicate the real thing so moving on 
 this object you see behind me is the venus of berekhat ram it 's one of the oldest objects in the world found in the golan heights around two hundred and thirty three thousand years ago
  and currently residing at the israel museum in jerusalem  it is also one of the oldest objects on our platform  
 so let 's zoom we start from this one object
 what if we zoomed out and actually tried to experience our own cultural big bang  what might that look like  
 this is what we deal with on a daily basis at the cultural institute over six
  million cultural artifacts curated and given to us by institutions to actually make these connections you can travel through time you can understand more about our society 
 through these you can look at it from the perspective of our planet and try to see how it might look without borders if we just organized art and culture  we can also then plot it by time  which obviously 
  decade and the contributions in that decade and in those years for art history and cultures we would love to spend hours showing you each and every decade 
 but we don 't have the time right now  so you can go on your phone and actually do it yourself applause
 if you don 't mind
  can hold your applause till later i don 't want to run out of time because i want to show you a lot of cool stuff 
 just very quickly 
 you can move on from here to another very interesting idea beyond the pretty picture  beyond the nice visualization what is the purpose how is this useful this next idea comes from
 discussions with curators that we 've been having at museums who by the way i 've fallen in love with because they dedicate their whole life to try to tell these stories one of the curators told me
  what would it be like if you could create a virtual curator 's table where all these six million objects are displayed in a way for us to look at the connections between them
 you can spend a lot of time trust me looking at different objects and understanding where they come from it 's a crazy matrix experience just
  on this platform thanks to the diversity of the institutions we have we have over two hundred and eleven
 amazing artworks by this artist now organized
 in one beautiful view  and as it resolves  and as cyril goes deeper you can see all the
  you can see still life  but i just wanted to highlight one very quick example which is very timely 
 the bedroom this is an artwork where three copies exist one at the van gogh museum in amsterdam one at the orsay in paris and one at the art institute of chicago 
 which actually currently is hosting a reunion of all three artworks physically  i think only for the second time ever  but it is united digitally and virtually for anybody to look at
  you won 't get pushed in the line in the crowd  
 so let 's take you and let 's travel through the bedroom very quickly  so you can experience what we are doing for every single object we want the image to speak 
 as much as it can on a digital platform  and all you need is an internet connection and a computer
  you have to give cyril a little bit of and this is available for every object modern art contemporary art renaissance you name it even sculpture 
 sometimes you don 't know what can attract you
 to an artwork or to a museum or to
  so for me personally it was quite a challenge because when i decided to make this my full time job at google my mother was not very supportive  i love my mother  but she thought i was wasting my life with this museum stuff
 and for her a museum is what you do when you go on vacation and you tick mark and it 's over right and
 it took around four and a half years for me to convince my lovely indian mother that actually this is worthwhile and the way i did it was i realized one day that she
  gold so i started showing her all objects that have the material gold in them and the first thing my mom asks me is how can we buy these 
 and obviously
  my salary is not that high so i was like we can 't actually do that mom but you can explore them virtually and so now my mom
 every time i meet her she asks me
  more gold any more silver in your project can you show me and that 's the idea i 'm trying to illustrate  it does not matter how you get in as long as you get in once you get in you 're
 hooked moving on from here very quickly there
 is
 kind of a playful idea actually to illustrate the point of access and i 'm going to go quite quickly on this one we
  all know that seeing the artwork
 in person is amazing but we also know that most of us can 't do it and the ones that can afford to do it it 's complicated so cyril can we load up our
 art trip
 what do we call it we don 't have a good name for this but
 essentially  we have around one thousand amazing institutions sixty eight countries but let 's start with rembrandt
 we might have time for only one example  but thanks to the diversity we 've got around five hundred
  amazing rembrandt object artworks from forty six institutions and seventeen countries let 's say that on your next vacation you want to go see every single one of them that is your 
  itinerary  you will probably travel fifty three thousand kilometers visit around  i think forty six institutions and just fyi  you might release ten tons
  moving on swiftly from here is something a little bit more technical and more interesting
 all that we 've shown you so far uses metadata to make the connections 
 but obviously we have something cool nowadays that everyone likes to talk about which is machine learning so what we thought is let 's strip out all the
  let 's look at what machine learning can do based purely on visual recognition of this entire collection  what we ended up with is this very interesting 
  map these clusters that have no reference point information  but has just used visuals to cluster things together each cluster 
  is an art to us by itself of discovery  but one of the clusters we want to show you very quickly is this amazing cluster of portraits
 that we found from museums around the world if you could zoom in a little bit more cyril
  just to show you you can just travel through portraits  and essentially you can do nature you can do horses and clusters galore   
 when we saw all these portraits we were like hey 
 can we do something fun for kids or can we do something playful to get people interested in portraits because i haven 't really seen
  young kids really excited to go to a portrait gallery  i wanted to try to figure something out so we created something called the portrait matcher  it 's quite 
  i 'm just going to let cyril show his beautiful face and essentially what 's happening is with the movement of his head we are matching different portraits
 around the world
  i don 't know about you but i 've shown it to my nephew and sister and the reaction is just phenomenal all they ask me is when can we go see this 
 and by the
  for our last quick experiment we call all of these experiments our last quick experiment comes back to machine learning
 but what if we could ask the machine to also name these clusters  what if it could automatically tag them using no actual metadata  so what we have is this kind of
 explorer  where we have managed to match i think around four thousand labels  and we haven 't really
 done anything special here just fed the collection  and we found interesting categories we can
  start with horses a very straightforward
 category you would expect to see that the machine has put images of horses right and it has but you also notice right over there that it has a very abstract image 
 that it has still managed to recognize and cluster as horses we also have an amazing head in terms of of a horse and each one
  the tags as to why it got categorized in this so let 's move to another one which i found very funny and interesting because i don 't understand how this category came up it 's called lady in waiting 
 if cyril you do it very quickly  you will see that we have these amazing
 images of ladies i guess in waiting or posing i don 't really understand it  but i 've been trying to ask my museum contacts you know what is this what 's going on here and it 's fascinating
  coming back to gold very quickly
  i wanted to search for gold and see how the machine tagged all the gold  but actually it doesn 't tag it as gold  we are living in popular times it tags it as 
 i 'm being hard on cyril because i 'm moving too fast  essentially here you have all the bling bling of the world 's museums
 organized for you and finally to end this
  talk and these experiments  what i hope you feel after this talk is happiness and emotion and what would we see when we see happiness
  if we actually look at all the objects that have been tagged under happiness you would expect
 happiness i guess but there was one that came up
 that was very fascinating
  by douglas coupland our friend and artist in residence as well  called i miss my pre internet brain i don 't know why the machine feels like it misses its pre internet brain and it 's been tagged 
  here  but it 's a very interesting thought i sometimes do miss my pre internet brain but not when it comes to exploring arts and culture online so take out your phones take out your computers go visit
  and just a quick call out to all the amazing archivists historians curators who are sitting in museums  preserving all this culture and the least we can do is get our daily dose of art and culture for ourselves and our kids thank you
