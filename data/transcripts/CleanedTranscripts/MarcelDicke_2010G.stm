  'm going to show you again something about our diets and
 i would like to know what the audience is and so who of you ever ate insects 
 that 's quite a lot
  but still you 're not representing the overall population of the earth laughter
 because there 's eighty percent out there that really eats insects  but this is quite good 
 why not eat insects well
 first what are insects insects are animals that walk around on six legs  and here you see just a
  there 's six million species of insects on this planet 
 six million species there 's a few hundreds of mammals six million species of insects  
 in fact  if we count all the individual organisms we would come at much larger numbers  in fact  
 of all animals on earth of all animal species eighty percent walks on six legs  but if we would count all the
  and we take an average weight of them it would amount to something like two hundred to two thousand kilograms for each of you and me on earth 
 that means that in terms of biomass insects are more abundant than we are and
 we 're not on a planet of men but we 're on a planet of insects  
 insects are not only there in nature but they also are involved in our economy  usually without us
  was an estimation a conservative estimation a couple of years ago
 that the u s economy benefited by fifty seven billion dollars per year  it 's a number very large
 a contribution to the economy of the united states for free  and so i looked up what the economy
 was paying for the war in iraq in the same year  it was eighty
  well we know that that was
 not a cheap war so insects  just for free  contribute to the economy of the united states with about the same order of magnitude 
 just for free without everyone knowing and not only in the states but in any country in any economy what do they do they remove dung  
 they pollinate our crops a third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants they
 control pests  and they 're food for animals they 're at the start of food chains 
 small animals eat insects  even larger animals eat insects  but the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals still larger animals  
 and at the end of the food chain we are eating them as well 
 there 's quite a lot of people that are eating insects and here you see me in a small provincial town in china
  lijiang about two million inhabitants if you go out for dinner 
 like in a fish restaurant where you can select which fish you want to eat you can select which insects you would like to eat  
 and they prepare it in a wonderful way  and here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars  locusts  bee pupae delicacies 
  you can eat something new everyday 
 there 's more than one thousand species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe 
 that 's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that that we 're eating like
 a cow or a pig or a sheep more than one thousand species
 an enormous variety  and now you may think okay  in this provincial town in
  china they 're doing that but not us well we 've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally but
 i can tell you that every one of you is eating insects  without any exception 
 you 're eating at least five hundred grams per year  what are you eating tomato soup  
 peanut butter chocolate  noodles
 any processed food that you 're eating contains insects  because insects are here all around us
  when they 're out there in nature
 they 're also in our crops some fruits get some insect damage  those are the fruits if they 're tomato that go to the tomato soup  
 if they don 't have any damage  they go to the grocery and that 's your view of a tomato  
 but there 's tomatoes that end up in a soup  and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency
  can be all kinds of things in there no problem  
 in fact  why would we put these balls in the soup  there 's meat in there anyway 
 in fact all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of 
 so anything is a good protein source already now you may say
  so we 're eating five hundred grams just by accident we 're even doing this on purpose in a lot of food items that we have
 i have only two items here on the slide
 pink cookies or surimi sticks or if you like campari a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a
  or is being sold as crab meat is white fish that 's being dyed
 with cochineal cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti it 's being produced
 in large amounts one hundred and fifty to one hundred and eighty metric tons per year
 in the canary islands in peru and it 's big business one gram of cochineal costs about thirty euros
 one gram of gold is thirty euros  
 so it 's
 a very precious thing that we 're using to dye our foods  now
 the situation in the world is going to change
 for you and me for everyone on this earth the human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially where at the moment we have something between six and seven
  billion people it will grow to about nine billion in two thousand and fifty 
 that means that we have a lot more mouths to feed and this is something that worries more and more people there was an fao conference last october
 that was completely devoted to this how are we going to feed this world and if you look at the figures up
  it says that we have a third more mouths to feed  but we need an agricultural production increase of seventy percent and that 's especially because this world population
 is increasing  and it 's increasing not only in numbers  but we 're also getting wealthier 
 and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more
 and also starts to eat more meat  and meat in fact is something that
 costs a lot of our agricultural production our diet consists
 ] some part of animal proteins and at the moment  most of us here get it
 from livestock from fish from game  and we eat quite a lot of it in the developed world
 it 's on average eighty kilograms per person per year  which goes up to one hundred and twenty in the united states
  and a bit lower in some other countries  but on average eighty kilograms per person per year 
 in the developing world it 's much lower it 's twenty five kilograms per person per year  but it 's increasing enormously 
 in china in the last twenty years it increased from twenty to fifty 
 and it 's still increasing  so if a third of the world population
 is going to increase
  to eighty on average and a third of the world population is living in china and in india we 're having an enormous demand on meat and
 of course  we are not there to say that 's only for us it 's not for them  they have the same share that we have now
 to start with i should say that we are eating way too much meat
 in the western world  we could do with much much less and i know i 've been a vegetarian
  for a long time  and you can easily do without anything you 'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway  but then
 there 's a lot of problems that come with meat production
 and we 're being faced with that more and more often the first problem that we 're facing is human health pigs are quite like us they 're even models in
  and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human 
 that means that pigs also share diseases with us and a pig a pig disease a pig virus  and a human virus can both proliferate  and because of their kind of reproduction 
 they can combine and produce a new virus this has happened in the netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever
  from us that this doesn 't happen  so that 's one point for insects 
 and there 's the conversion factor you
 take ten kilograms of feed  you can get one kilogram of beef  but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat  so if you would be
 an entrepreneur what would you do with ten kilograms of input  you can get either one or nine
 kg of output  so far we 're taking the one or up to five kilograms of output  we 're not taking the bonus yet we 're not taking
 the nine kilograms of output yet  so that 's two points for insects 
 and there 's the environment  if we take ten kilograms of food 
 and it results in one kilogram of beef the other nine kilograms
 are waste and a lot of that is manure if you produce insects you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce 
 so less waste  furthermore per kilogram of manure you have much much less ammonia
 and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure  so you have less waste
  waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung  so that 's three points for insects now
 there 's a big if of course  and it is if insects produce meat
 that is of good quality well there have been all kinds of analyses and in
  terms of protein or fat or vitamins it 's very good  in fact it 's comparable
 to anything we eat as meat at the moment  and even in terms of calories it is very good  one kilogram of grasshoppers
 has the same amount of calories as ten hot dogs or six big macs  
 so that 's four points for insects 
 i can go on and i could make many more points for insects
 but time doesn 't allow this so the question is why not eat insects  i gave you at least four arguments in favor we 'll have to 
 even if you don 't like it you 'll have to get used to this
 because at the moment  seventy percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock 
 that 's not only the land where the livestock is walking
 and feeding  but it 's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported we can increase it a bit at the expense of
  rainforests  
 but there 's a limitation very soon and if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by seventy percent we 're not going to make it that way  
 we could much better change from meat  from beef to insects  
 and then eighty percent of the world already eats insects  so we are just a minority
 in a country like the
 the usa the netherlands anywhere on the left hand side you see a market in laos where they have abundantly
 present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night on the right hand side you see a grasshopper  so
 people there are eating them not because they 're hungry  but because they think it 's a delicacy it 's just very good food
  you can vary enormously  it has many benefits in fact we have delicacy that 's very much like this grasshopper  
 shrimps a delicacy
 being sold at a high price  who wouldn 't like to eat a shrimp there are a few people who don 't like shrimp  but shrimp  or crabs or crayfish 
  of the land  
 and it would make very good into our diet
  so why are we not eating insects yet well that 's just a matter of mindset  
 we 're not used to it  and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us that 's why we 're changing the perception of insects and i 'm working very hard with my colleague  arnold van huis 
 in telling people what insects are 
 what magnificent things they are
  what magnificent jobs they do in nature and in fact without insects we would not be here in this room 
 because if the insects die out  we will soon die soon die out as well 
 if we die out the insects will continue very happily 
 so we have to get used to the idea of eating insects and some might think well they 're not yet
  there are entrepreneurs in the netherlands that produce them and one of them is here in the audience marian peeters who 's in the picture i predict that later this year you 'll get them in the supermarkets
 not visible but as animal protein in the food 
 and maybe by two thousand and twenty you 'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you 're going to eat  and they 're
 being made in the most wonderful ways a dutch chocolate maker
  a lot of design to it 
 well in the netherlands
 we have an innovative minister of agriculture  and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry 
 and when she got all the ministers of agriculture of the e u over to the hague recently 
 she went to a high class restaurant  and they ate insects all together  
 it 's not something that is a hobby of mine it 's really taken off the ground  so why not eat
  you should try it yourself a couple of years ago we had one thousand seven hundred and fifty people all together in a square in wageningen town  
 and they ate insects at the same moment  and this was still big big news i think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects  because it 's just a normal way of doing 
 so you can try it yourself
 today  and i would say  enjoy  and i 'm going to
  to bruno some first tries  and he can have the first bite
