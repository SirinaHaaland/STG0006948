  i and my colleagues art aron and lucy brown and others have put thirty seven people who are madly in love into a functional mri brain scanner  
 seventeen who were happily in love  fifteen who had just been dumped  and we 're just starting our third experiment  studying people who report that they 're still in love
  after ten to twenty five years of marriage so this is the short story of that research
 in the jungles of guatemala in tikal stands a temple  
 it was built by the grandest sun king of the grandest city state of the grandest civilization of the americas the mayas 
  he stood over six feet tall  he lived into his 80s and he was buried beneath this monument in seven 
 and mayan inscriptions proclaim that he was deeply in love with his wife so he built a temple in her honor  facing his 
 and every spring and autumn exactly at the equinox the sun rises behind his temple and perfectly
 bathes
 her temple
 with his shadow  and as the sun sets behind her temple in the afternoon it perfectly bathes his temple with her shadow  
 after one thousand three hundred years these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb 
 around the world people love  they sing for love  they dance for love  they compose poems and stories about love  they tell
  myths and legends about love  they pine for love  they live for love  they kill for love  and they die for love  
 as walt whitman once said o i would stake all for you 
 anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in one hundred and seventy societies they 've never found a society that did not have it
 but love isn 't always a happy experience in one study of college
  students they asked a lot of questions about love  but the two that stood out to me the most
 were have you ever been rejected by somebody who you really loved 
 and the second question was have you ever dumped somebody who really loved you 
 and almost ninety five percent of both men and women said yes to both 
 almost nobody gets out of love alive
  i start telling you about the brain  i want to read for you what i think is the most powerful love poem on earth there 's other love poems that are of course just as good 
 but i don 't think this one can be surpassed  
 it was told by an anonymous  kwakiutl indian of southern alaska to a missionary in 
 here it is  i 've never had the opportunity to say it before
  fire runs through my body with the pain of loving you  
 pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you  
 pain like a boil about to burst with my love for you  consumed by fire with my love for you 
 i remember what you said to me  i am thinking of your love for me  i
 i am torn by your love for me pain and more pain
 where are you going with my love  i am told you will go from here  i am told you will leave me here 
 my body is numb with grief remember what i said my love  goodbye my love goodbye 
 emily dickinson once wrote parting is all we need to know of hell 
 how many people have suffered
 in all the millions of years of human evolution
 how many people around the world are dancing with elation at this very minute 
 romantic love is one of the most powerful sensations on earth  so several years ago i decided to look into the brain
 and study this madness our first study of people who were happily in love has been widely
  so i 'm only going to say very little about it  
 we found activity in a tiny little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area  we found activity in some cells called the a10 cells cells that 
  actually make dopamine a natural stimulant and spray it to many brain regions indeed this part the vta is part of the brain 's reward system it 's way below your cognitive thinking process it 's below
  part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain associated with wanting with motivation with focus and with craving  in fact  the same brain region where we found activity becomes active also when you feel the rush of cocaine 
 but romantic love is much more than a cocaine high at least you come down from cocaine 
 romantic love is an obsession it possesses you you lose your sense of self you can 't stop thinking about another human being
 somebody is camping in your head as an eighth century japanese poet said my longing had no time when it ceases 
 wild is love  and the obsession can get worse when you 've been rejected 
 so right now lucy brown and i the neuroscientists on our project are looking at the data of the people who were put into the machine after they had just been
  dumped it was very difficult actually putting these people in the machine because they were in such bad shape 
 so anyway we found activity in three brain regions we found activity
 in the brain region in exactly the same brain region associated with intense romantic love  what a bad deal  
 you know when you 've been dumped the one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being and then go
  on with your life but no you just love them harder  as the poet
 terence the roman poet once said he said the less my hope the hotter my love 
 and indeed  we now know why two thousand years later we can explain this in the brain that brain system the reward system for wanting for motivation for craving for focus becomes more active when you
  can 't get what you want in this case life 's greatest prize an appropriate mating partner  
 we found activity in other brain regions also in a brain region associated with
 calculating gains and losses you 're lying there you 're looking at the picture and you 're in this machine  and you 're calculating what went wrong
  what have i lost as a matter of fact  lucy and i have a little joke about this  it comes from a david mamet
 play  and there 's two con artists in the play and the woman is conning the man and the man looks at the woman and says 
 oh you 're a bad pony i 'm not going to bet on you 
 and indeed it 's this part of the brain  the core of the nucleus accumbens that is becoming active as you 're measuring your gains and losses  it 's also the brain region that
  active when you 're willing to take enormous risks for huge gains and huge losses  
 last but not least we found activity in a brain region associated with deep attachment to another individual  
 no wonder
 people suffer around the world and we have so many crimes of passion
  when you 've been rejected in love  
 not only are you engulfed with feelings of romantic love  but you 're feeling deep attachment to this individual  moreover this brain circuit for reward is working 
  and you 're feeling intense energy intense focus intense motivation and the willingness to risk it all to win life 's greatest prize 
  come to think that romantic love is a drive a basic mating drive not the sex drive the sex drive gets you looking for a whole range of partners romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy
  on just one at a time conserve your mating energy and start the mating process with this single individual  
  what sums it it up best is something that is said by plato
 over two thousand years ago he said the god of love lives in a state of need  
 it is a need  
 it is an urge  it is a homeostatic imbalance like hunger and thirst it 's almost impossible to stamp out 
 i 've also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction a perfectly wonderful addiction when it 's going well and a perfectly horrible addiction when it 's going poorly
  and indeed it has all of the characteristics of addiction  you focus on the person  you obsessively think about them you crave them you distort reality your willingness to take enormous 
  risks to win this person and it 's got the three main characteristics of addiction tolerance you need to see them more and more and more
  i 've got a girlfriend who 's just getting over a
 terrible love affair it 's been about eight months she 's beginning to feel better and she was driving along in her car the other day and suddenly she heard a song on the car radio
 that reminded her of this man not only did the instant craving come back but she had to pull over from the side of the road and cry 
 so one thing i would like the medical community and the legal community and even the college community
  to see if they can understand that indeed  romantic love is one of the most addictive substances on earth  i would also like to tell the world that animals love  
 there 's not an animal on this planet that will copulate with anything that comes along  too old  too young  too scruffy  too stupid and they won 't do it 
 unless you 're stuck in a laboratory cage
 and you know if you
 spend your entire life in a little box you 're not going to be as picky about who you have sex with but
 i 've looked in a hundred species 
 and everywhere in the wild  animals have favorites as a matter of fact ethologists know this there are over eight words for what they call animal favoritism 
 selective proceptivity
 mate choice female choice sexual choice  and indeed there are now three
 academic articles in which they 've looked at this attraction which may only last for a second
  but it 's a definite attraction
 and either this same brain region this reward system  or the chemicals of that reward system are involved  in fact  i think animal attraction can be instant you can see 
  an elephant instantly go for another elephant and i think that this is really the origin of what you and i call love at first sight 
  spoiled it for me and
 i just simply say hardly 
 you can know every single ingredient in a piece of chocolate cake and then when you sit down and eat that cake  
 you can still feel that joy  and certainly i make all the same mistakes that everybody else does too  but it 's really
 deepened my understanding
  matter of fact in new york  i often
 catch myself looking in baby carriages and feeling a little sorry for the for the tot and
 in fact sometimes i feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate  when i think of
 how intense this brain system is our newest experiment has been hatched
  art aron putting people who are reporting that they are still in love in a long term relationship into the functional mri we 've put five people in so far  
 and indeed we found exactly the same thing they 're not lying
  the brain areas associated with intense romantic love still become active twenty five years
  there are still many questions to be answered and
 asked about romantic love the question that i 'm working on right this minute and i 'm only going to say it for a second and then end
 is why do you fall in love with one person rather than another
 i never would have even thought to think of this but match com the internet dating site came to me three years ago and asked me that question 
 and i said i don 't know i know what happens in
  when you do become in love  but i don 't know why you fall in love with one person rather than another  
 and so i 've spent the last three years on this 
 and there are many reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another that psychologists can tell you and we tend to fall in love with somebody from the same socioeconomic background the same general level of intelligence 
 of good looks the same religious values your childhood certainly plays a role but nobody knows how 
  and that 's about it that 's all they know no they 've never found the way two personalities fit together to make a good relationship 
 so it began to occur to me that maybe your biology pulls you towards some people rather than another  and i have concocted a questionnaire to 
  see to what degree you express dopamine  serotonin estrogen and testosterone i think we 've evolved four very broad personality types associated with the ratios of these four
  chemicals in the brain and on this dating site that i have created called chemistry com i ask you first
 a series of questions to see to what degree you express these chemicals and i 'm watching who chooses who to love  and
 three point seven million people have taken the questionnaire in america about six hundred thousand people have taken it in
  putting the data together now and at some point
 there will always be magic to love  but
 i think i will come closer to understanding why it is you can walk into a room and everybody is from your background your same general level of intelligence 
  good looks and you don 't feel pulled towards all of them i think there 's biology to that
  i think we 're going to end up in the next few years to understand all kinds of brain mechanisms that pull us to one person rather than another  
 so i will close with this
  these are my older people 
 faulkner said the past is not dead it 's not even past 
 indeed we carry a lot of luggage from our yesteryear in the human brain 
 and so there 's one
  thing that makes me
 pursue my
 understanding of human nature and this reminds me of it 
 these are two women women tend to get intimacy differently than men do women get intimacy from face to face talking we swivel towards each other
 we do what we call the anchoring gaze and we talk this is intimacy to women i think it comes from millions of years of holding that baby in front of your face cajoling it reprimanding it  educating it with words
 men tend to get intimacy from side by side doing  as soon as one guy looks up
 the other guy will look away i think it comes from millions of years 
  sitting behind the bush looking straight ahead  trying to hit that buffalo on the head with a rock  i think for millions of years men faced their enemies they sat
  my final statement is love is in us  it 's deeply embedded in the brain  our challenge is to understand each other thank you
