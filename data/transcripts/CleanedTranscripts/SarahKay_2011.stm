  if i should have a daughter 
 instead of mom she 's going to call me point b 
 because that way she knows that no matter what happens at least she can always find her way
  and i 'm going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say oh i know that like the back of my hand 
 and she 's going to learn that this life will hit you hard in the face  wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach  but getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air 
  that cannot be fixed by band aids or poetry so the first time she realizes that wonder woman isn 't coming i 'll make sure she knows she doesn 't have to wear the cape all by herself because no matter 
  how wide you stretch your fingers your hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal  believe me i 've tried 
  just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him 
 or else find the boy who lit the fire in the first place to see if you can change him  but i know she will anyway so instead i 'll
 always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boots nearby because there is no heartbreak that chocolate can 't fix  
 okay there 's a few that chocolate can 't fix but that 's what the rain boots are for
  rain will wash away everything if you let it i want her to look at the world through the underside of a glass bottom boat to look through a microscope at the galaxies that exist on the pinpoint of a human mind because
 that 's the way my mom taught me  that there 'll be days like this there 'll be days like this my momma said
  when you open your hands to catch
 and wind up with only blisters and bruises when you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you want to save are the ones standing on your cape 
 when your boots will fill with rain and you 'll be up to your knees in disappointment and those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you  because there 's nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline no matter how many times it 's sent
  will put the wind in win some  
 lose some you will put the star in starting over and over and no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny 
  place called life and yes on a scale from one to over trusting i am
 is a worrier and your poppa is a warrior and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more remember that good things come in threes and
 so do bad things 
 always apologize when you 've done something wrong but don 't you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining your voice is small  but don 't
  ever stop singing  and when they finally hand you heartache  when they slip war and hatred under your door and offer you handouts on 
  street corners of cynicism and defeat you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother
  i want you to take a moment and i want you to think of three things that you know to be true  they can be about whatever you want
 technology entertainment design your family what you had for breakfast the only rule is don 't think too hard
 okay  
 so here are three things i know to be true  
 i know that  jean luc godard was right when he said that a good story has a beginning a middle and an end although not necessarily in that order 
 i know that i 'm incredibly nervous and excited to be up here  which is greatly inhibiting my ability to keep it cool
  and
 i know that
 i have been waiting all week to tell this joke 
 laughter why was the scarecrow invited to ted  
 because he was out standing in his field i 'm sorry 
 okay so these are three things i know to be true  but there are plenty of things i have trouble understanding
  so i write poems to figure things out 
 sometimes the only way i know how to work through something is by writing a poem
 sometimes i get to the end of the poem look back and go oh that 's what this is all about and sometimes i get to the end of the poem
 and haven 't solved anything but at least i have a new poem out of it spoken word poetry is the
  i tell people it involves creating poetry that doesn 't just want to sit on paper that something about it demands it be heard out loud or witnessed in person
  when i was a freshman in high school i was a
 live wire of nervous hormones  and i was underdeveloped and 
 and despite my fear of ever being looked at for too long i was fascinated by the idea of spoken word poetry i felt that my two secret loves poetry
  and theater had come together had a baby 
 a baby i needed to get to know  so i decided to give it a try my first spoken word poem  packed with all the wisdom of a 
 was about the injustice of being seen as unfeminine the poem was very indignant  
  mainly exaggerated but the only spoken word poetry that i had seen up until that point was mainly indignant so i thought that that 's what was expected of me  
 the first time that i performed  the audience of teenagers hooted and hollered their sympathy and when i came off the stage i was shaking  
 i felt this tap on my shoulder  and i turned around to see this giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd she was maybe eight feet tall and looked like she could beat me up with one hand but instead she just nodded at me and said
  felt that thanks 
 and lightning struck
 i was hooked  
 i discovered this bar on manhattan 's lower east side that hosted a weekly poetry open mic and my bewildered but supportive parents took me to soak in every ounce of spoken word that i could i was the youngest by
 at least a decade but somehow the poets at the bowery poetry club didn 't seem bothered by the
 14 year old wandering about in fact they welcomed me 
 and it was here listening to these poets share their stories that i learned that spoken word poetry didn 't have to be indignant it could be fun or
 painful or serious or silly the bowery poetry club became my classroom
 and my home and the poets who performed encouraged me to share my stories as well never mind the fact that i was fourteen they told me write about being fourteen
 so i did and stood amazed every week when these brilliant grown up poets laughed with me and groaned their sympathy and clapped and told me hey  i really felt that too 
 now i can divide my spoken word journey into three steps step one was the moment i said i can i can do
  and that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie step two was the moment i said i will i will continue  i love spoken word i will keep coming back week after week and step three
  began when i realized i didn 't have to write indignant poems if that 's not what i was there were things that were specific to me and the more that i focused on those things 
  experience you 've collected up to now to help you dive into the things you don 't know  i use poetry to help me work through what i don 't understand but i show up to each new poem
 with a backpack full of everywhere else that i 've been
  when i got to university  i met a fellow poet who shared my belief in the magic of spoken word poetry 
  phil kaye and i coincidentally also share the same last name 
 when i was in high school i had created project v o i c e as a way to encourage my friends to do spoken word with me  but phil and i decided to reinvent project v o i c e this time changing the mission to using spoken word poetry as a way to entertain  
 educate and inspire we stayed full time students but in between we traveled performing and teaching
  india to a public high school just up the street from campus  and we saw over and over the way that spoken word poetry cracks open locks 
 but it turns out sometimes poetry can be really scary 
 turns out sometimes you have to trick teenagers into writing poetry  so i came up with lists
  can write lists and the first list that i assign is ten things i know to be true 
 and here 's what happens  you would discover it too if we all started sharing our lists out loud 
 at a certain point you would realize that someone has the exact same thing or one thing very similar to something on your list and then someone else has
 something the complete opposite of yours 
  someone has something you 've never even heard of before fourth someone has something you thought you knew everything about 
 but they 're introducing a new angle of looking at it and i tell people that this is where great stories start from these four intersections of what you 're passionate about and what others might be invested in 
 and most people respond really well to this exercise  
 but one of my students  a freshman named charlotte was not
  charlotte was very good at writing lists but she refused to write any poems miss she 'd say i 'm just not interesting i don 't have anything interesting to say 
 so i assigned her list after list and one day i assigned the list ten things i should have learned by now 
 number three on charlotte 's list was i should have learned not to crush on guys three times my age 
 i asked her what that meant  and she said miss  it 's kind of a long story and i said charlotte it sounds pretty interesting to me
  her first poem a love poem unlike any i had ever heard before  and the poem began 
 anderson cooper is a gorgeous man 
 did you see him on sixty minutes racing michael phelps in a pool nothing but swim trunks on diving in the water determined to beat this swimming champion after
  i know that the number one rule to being cool is to seem unfazed 
 to never admit that anything scares you or impresses you or excites you  somebody once told me it 's like walking through life
  you protect yourself from all the unexpected miseries or hurt that might show up but
 i try to walk through life like this  and yes that means catching all of those miseries and hurt but it also means that when beautiful amazing things just
 fall out of the sky  i 'm ready to catch them  i use spoken word to help my students rediscover wonder to fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed and and
  actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them so that they can reinterpret and create something from it it
 's not that i think that spoken word poetry is the ideal art form
  i 'm always trying to find the best way to tell each story i write musicals i make short films alongside my poems but
 i teach spoken word poetry because it 's accessible 
 not everyone can read music or owns a camera  but everyone can communicate in some way and everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from
  from plus spoken word poetry allows for immediate connection it 's not uncommon to feel like you 're alone or that nobody understands you but spoken word teaches that if you have the ability 
  to express yourself and the courage to present those stories and opinions you could be rewarded with a room full of your peers or your community who will listen
  and maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie who will connect with what you 've shared  and that is an amazing realization to have especially when you 're fourteen  
 plus now with youtube that connection 's not even limited to the room we 're in i 'm so lucky that there 's this archive of performances that i can share with my students it allows for even 
  more opportunities for them to find a poet or a poem that they connect to
  once you 've figured this out it is tempting to keep writing the same poem or keep telling the same story over and over once you 've figured out that it will gain you applause it 's not enough to just teach that you can express yourself you have to
 grow and explore and take risks and challenge yourself and that
 is step three infusing the work you 're doing with the specific things that make you you  even while those things are always
  because step three never ends  
 but you don 't get to start on step three until you take step one first i can i travel a lot while i 'm teaching  and i don 't always get to watch all of my students reach their step 
  three but i was very lucky with charlotte that i got to watch her journey unfold the way it did i watched her realize that by putting the things that she knows to be true into the work she 's doing she can create poems that only charlotte
  can write about eyeballs and elevators and dora the explorer  and i 'm trying to tell stories only i can tell
 like this story  i spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to tell this story and i wondered if the best way was going to be a powerpoint a short film and
 where exactly was the beginning the middle or the end  i wondered whether i 'd get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out 
 or not and i always thought that my beginning was at the bowery poetry club but it 's possible that it was much earlier in preparing for ted i
  discovered this diary page in an old journal i think december 54th was probably supposed to be 24th 
 it 's clear that when i was a child i definitely walked through life like this i think that we all did  i would like to help others rediscover that wonder to want to engage 
  with it to want to learn to want to share what they 've learned what they 've figured out to be true and what they 're still figuring out so
  when they bombed hiroshima  the explosion formed a 
 so every living animal human or plant that received direct contact with the rays from that sun was instantly turned to ash and what was left of the city 
 soon followed the long lasting damage of nuclear radiation caused an entire city and its population to turn
  powder  
 when i was born my mom says i looked around the whole hospital room with a stare that said this i 've done this before 
 she says i have old eyes when my grandpa genji died  i was only five years old but i took my mom by the hand and told her don 't worry he 'll come back as a baby 
 and yet for someone who 's apparently
 done this already i still haven 't figured anything out yet my knees still buckle every time i get on a stage my  self confidence can be measured out in teaspoons mixed into my poetry and it still always tastes funny in my mouth  
 but in hiroshima some people were wiped clean away  leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page so no matter that i have inhibitions to fill all my pockets i keep trying 
  hoping that one day i 'll write a poem i can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit as the only proof i existed 
 my parents named me sarah  which is a biblical name  in the original story god told sarah she could do something impossible and
 she laughed  because the first sarah she didn 't know what to do with impossible and me  
 well neither do i  but i see the impossible every day impossible is trying to connect in this world trying to hold onto others while things
  are blowing up around you knowing that while you 're speaking they aren 't just waiting for their turn to talk they hear you they feel exactly what you feel at the same time that you feel it it 's what i strive for 
 every time i open my mouth that impossible connection there 's this piece of wall in hiroshima that was completely burnt black by the radiation but on the front step a person who was sitting there blocked the rays from hitting the stone the only thing left now
  is a permanent shadow of positive light after the a bomb specialists said it would take seventy five years for the 
  soil of hiroshima city to ever grow anything again but that spring there were new buds popping up from the earth  when i meet you in that moment i 'm no longer a part of your future 
 i start quickly becoming part of your past but in that instant i get to share your present and you you get to share mine
  that is the greatest present of all so if you tell me i can do the impossible i
 'll probably laugh at you  i don 't know if i can change the world yet because i don 't know that much about it and i don 't know that much about reincarnation either but if you make me laugh hard enough 
 sometimes i forget what century i 'm in this isn 't my first time here this isn 't my last time here these aren 't the last words i 'll share but just in case i 'm trying my
  hardest to get it right this time around thank you
