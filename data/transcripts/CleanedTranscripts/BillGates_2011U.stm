  this is about state budgets this is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning  but i want to tell you i think it 's an important topic
 that we need to care about 
 state budgets are big big money
  i 'll show you the numbers and they get very little scrutiny  the understanding is very low  many of the people involved
 have special interests or short term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are 
 and these budgets
 are the key for our future they 're the key for our kids most
  education funding
 whether it 's k through twelve or the great universities or community colleges most of the money for those things
 is coming out of these state budgets  but we have a problem 
 here 's the overall picture  u s economy is big fourteen point seven trillion  
  so this is combining the federal level  which is the largest the state level and the local level and it 's really in this combined way that you get an overall sense of what 's going on because 
  there 's a lot of complex things like medicaid and research money that flow across those boundaries
  now this leaves
 ten percent
 deficit sort of a mind blowing number 
 and some of that in fact is due to the fact that we 've had an economic recession  receipts go down some spending programs go up  but most
  not because of that most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends 
 and that creates a a huge challenge in fact this is the forecast picture there are various things in here i could say
 we might raise more revenue or medical innovation will make the spending even higher it is an increasingly difficult picture
  even assuming the economy does quite well probably better than
 it will do this is is what you see at this overall level  now
 how did we get here how could you have a problem like this
 after all at least on paper there 's this notion that these state budgets are balanced  only one state
 says they don 't have to balance the budget  but what this means actually is that there 's a pretense there 's no real
  real  true balancing going on and in a sense the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much
 that people don 't see things that are actually pretty straight forward challenges when jerry brown was elected 
 this was the challenge that was put to him that is through various
  billion missing out of the seventy six billion in proposed spending  now he 's put together some thoughts about half of that
 he 'll cut another half  perhaps in a very complex set of steps taxes will be approved  
 but even so as you go out into those future years various pension costs health costs go up enough
 and the revenue does not go up enough so you get a big squeeze 
 what were those things that allowed us to hide this well some really nice little tricks  and these were somewhat noticed the paper said it 's not really balanced it 's got holes  
 it perpetuates deficit spending it
  really when you get down to it the guys at enron never would have done this this is so blatant so extreme 
 is anyone paying attention
 to some of the things these guys do 
 they borrow money they 're not supposed to but they figure out a way they make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out they sell off the assets 
 they defer the payments
 they sell off the revenues from tobacco  and california 's not unique in fact there 's about five states that are worse and only really four states
 that don 't face this big challenge so it 's systemic across the entire country 
 it really comes from the fact that certain long term obligations health care where innovation makes it more expensive
 early retirement and pension where the age structure gets worse for you and just
  generosity that these  mis accounting things allow to develop over time 
 that you 've got a problem 
 this is the retiree health care benefits three million set aside sixty two billion dollar liability much worse than the car companies  and everybody looked at that and knew that that was headed toward a huge problem  
 the forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from twenty six percent of the budget
 forty two percent  well what 's going to give well in order to accommodate that you would have to cut education spending in half  
 it really is this young versus the old to some degree  if you don 't change that revenue picture if you don 't solve what you 're doing in health care you 're going to be deinvesting
  the great university of california university system the great
 things that have gone on won 't happen  
 so far it 's meant layoffs increased class sizes  within the education community there 's this discussion of should it just be the young teachers who get laid off or the less good teachers 
  who get laid off and there 's a discussion if you 're going to going to increase class sizes  where do you do that how much effect does that have
  you get into that people get confused and think well maybe you think that 's okay in fact  no education spending should not be cut  
 there 's ways if it 's temporary to minimize the impact
 but it 's a problem  it 's also really a problem for where we need to go technology has a role to play well we need money to experiment with that to get those those tools in there
 there 's the idea of paying teachers for
  measuring them giving them feedback taking videos in the classroom 
 that 's something i think is very very important well you have to allocate dollars for that system and for that incentive pay 
 in a situation where you have growth you put the new money into this or even if you 're flat you might shift money into it but with the type of cuts we 're talking about it will be far far harder to get these incentives for excellence
  to move over
 to use technology in the new way so what 's going on  where 's the brain trust
 that 's in error here  well there really is no brain trust 
 laughter it 's sort of the voters it 's sort of us showing up just look at this spending california will spend over one hundred billion
  analysis both inside google and microsoft and outside with analysts and people of various opinions should they have spent on that no they wasted their money on this what about this thing 
 it really is quite phenomenal
  everybody has an opinion there 's great feedback and the numbers are used to make decisions if you go over the education spending and the health care spending particularly these
  trends you don 't have that type of involvement on a number that 's more important in terms of equity 
 in terms of learning so what do we need to do 
 we need better tools we can get some things out on the internet i 'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture we need lots more 
 there 's a few good books one about school spending and where the money comes from how that
 changed over time and the challenge
 we need better accounting we need to take the fact that the current employees the future liabilities they create that should come out of the current budget 
 we need to understand why they 've done the pension accounting the way they have it should be more like private accounting it 's the gold standard  
 and finally we need to really reward politicians whenever they say there 's these
 oh you 're the messenger with bad news we just shot you 
 in fact there are some like these erskine bowles alan simpson and others who have gone through and given proposals
 for this overall federal
  problem  but in fact their work was sort of pushed off in fact the week afterwards 
 some tax cuts were done that that made the situation even worse
  their assumptions  so we need these pieces  now i think this is a solvable problem
  it 's a great country with lots of people but we have to draw
 those people in because this is about education and just look at what happened with the tuitions with the university of california and project
  that 's the kind of thing the investment in the young
 that makes us great allows us to contribute it allows us to do the art  the biotechnology the software and all those those magic things 
 and so
 the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they 're critical for our kids and our future
