  i 'm going to share with you my passion for science  i 'm not talking about science that takes baby steps  
 i 'm talking about science that takes enormous leaps  i 'm talking
  i 'm talking revolutionary science that turns the world on its head in a moment  i 'm going to talk about two ideas that might do this 
 i say might because with revolutionary ideas most are flat wrong and even those that are right seldom have the impact that we want them to have 
 to explain why i picked two ideas in particular i 'm going to start with a mystery
  compulsively thorough doctor who ran two maternity clinics they were identical except for one thing  
 women were dying of high fevers soon after giving birth three times more often
 at one of the clinics than at the other trying to figure out what the difference was that caused this semmelweis looked at everything he could sanitation
  the puzzle went unsolved until he happened to autopsy a doctor who died of an infected scalpel cut 
 the doctor 's symptoms were identical to those of the mothers who were dying how was that possible how could a male doctor get the same thing as new mothers
 semmelweis reconstructed everything the doctor had done right before he got sick
  gotten in his wound that killed him with growing excitement
 looked for any connection he could between dead bodies in the morgue and dead mothers in his delivery room  and he
 found it it turned out that at the hospital with the high death rate but not the others
  were contaminating the doctors ' hands and killing his mothers  so he ordered the doctors to sterilize their hands and the deaths stopped
 had discovered infectious disease  but the doctors of the day thought he was crazy  because they knew  and had for hundreds of years
 that odorous vapors called miasmas
 caused disease not these hypothetical particles that you couldn 't see it took twenty years
 for frenchman louis pasteur to prove that semmelweis was right 
 pasteur was an agricultural chemist who tried to figure out why milk and beer spoiled so often  he found that bacteria
  were the culprits 
 he also found that bacteria could kill people in exactly the same way that semmelweis 's patients were dying  
 we now look at what i want to talk about tonight in two ideas  
 we saw it with semmelweis that he was a revolutionary 
 he did it for two reasons one he opened our eyes to a completely new world  we 'd known since the
  1680s about bacteria we just didn 't know that bacteria killed people and he also demolished
 fond ideas that people kept close to their heart miasmas didn 't kill people bacteria killed people 
 so this brings me to the two ideas i want to talk about tonight  one has opened our eyes to a completely new universe  and the other
  let 's get started with dr eric betzig he 's a physicist who has opened our eyes to an entirely new world
 by violating the laws of physics
 betzig is a true rebel  
 he quit a job at prestigious bell laboratory inventing new microscopes for biology because he thought scientists were taking his brilliant inventions
 and doing lousy work with them 
  he never lost his passion for figuring out how to get microscopes to see finer and finer details than had ever been seen before or ever could be seen 
 this is crucial if we 're ever going to understand
 how cells work and how cancer works  and how something
 the size of a head of a pin can do all these amazing things like make proteins and move charges
  around
 and all of those things 
 there 's just one problem  
 there 's this thing called the law of physics  
 and part of the law of physics is the thing called the diffraction limit the diffraction limit is kind of like when you go to a doctor 's office you can only see so far down no matter how good glasses you have 
 this was a
  but one of betzig 's friends figured out how to take a tiny molecule that was smaller than the best microscope could see and get it to light up and fluoresce aha betzig
 said i think maybe the laws of physics are not so unbreakable after all 
 so
 he lashed together a microscope
 in his friend 's living room  he had no laboratory this revolutionary instrument got different protein molecules to light up in different colors
  and with a computer he was able to turn very very fuzzy
 blurs into very sharp dots and produce images of unprecedented and startling clarity  
 for this work  last year  
 eric betzig won the nobel prize 
 why because now we can see
 with unprecedented detail things that we never had seen before
  doctors can
 get a better handle on things like cancer 
 but do you think betzig was satisfied there 
 no  he wanted movies the
 problem was that even the genius microscopes that he invented were just too slow  so what did he do  he came up with a 
  idea
  so the way that works is if you take two very very fine patterns and you move them across each other you will see a gross pattern
 that a microscope can see
 that otherwise you would not be able to see so he applied this technique to taking a really blurry image of a cell and moving lots of structured light patterns across it until this cell became crystal clear  
 and here is the
  full of strange things zipping around doing things that we don 't know what they 're doing 
 but when we figure it out we 'll have a better handle
 on life itself for example those green globs that you see those things are called  clathrins 
 they 're molecules that protect other molecules as they move through a cell unfortunately viruses sometimes hijack those
 to infect cells also you see those little squiggly wormlike things moving around those are
  actin molecules unfortunately viruses also climb down those things to get into the cell nucleus to replicate themselves and make you sick 
 now that we can look at movies of what 's actually going on deep inside a cell  we have a much better chance of curing viral diseases
 like aids  so when you look at a movie like this it 's very
  has opened our eyes to a completely new world  but he hasn 't shattered any
 cherished beliefs that leads us to dr aubrey de grey at cambridge 
 de grey definitely has scientists squirming with an interesting idea we can be immortal we can beat aging  
 now most scientists think he 's a crackpot
  one student knows that aging is an inevitable consequence of living for example  when we eat 
 we take in food and we metabolize it and that throws off what we call free radicals you might have heard of those also known as oxygen ions 
 those bind to our dna cause it to mutate and cause us to get old and lose our hair 
 it 's just like no it 's exactly like oxygen binding to iron and making it rust so you age because
  rust out
 oh  and scientists also know there is something called immortality 
 in cancer cells  so if you stop aging all of you
 are going to turn into giant walking malignant tumors these are cherished beliefs  but could de grey be on to something 
 i think he deserves a closer look first of all  i have
  really hard time seeing him as a crackpot  yeah  he started off life as a computer scientist not a biologist  but he earned a phd in biology from cambridge  
 and he has published some very significant work on mitochondrial dna and a bunch of other stuff secondly he started an antiaging foundation
 that has identified seven different causes of
  to me that seem very plausible  
 and he is hot in pursuit of fixes for every single one of them 
 for example  one of the reasons we age is that our mitochondrial dna mutates and we get kind of old and our cells lose energy  
 he believes and he 's made a convincing case that using viruses we can do gene therapy fix that dna
 and rejuvenate our cells 
 one more thing  we have an existent proof that extreme
  longevity is possible  bristlecone pine trees live five thousand years and some lobsters
 don 't age at all 
 now this doesn 't mean that de grey is going to revolutionize our lifespans i mean after all we 're not trees and most of us are not
  but i 've got to believe that there are
 darwins and einsteins out there and i
 'll tell you why  consider this there are seven times more people alive today than during
 darwin 's time 
 there are four times as many people alive today as einstein when you consider that the proportion of scientists in the population has skyrocketed there are now seven million scientists i 've got to believe  and i do believe that there 's one of them out there
 who is working right now in obscurity to rock our lives and i don 't know about you but i can 't wait to be rocked  thank you
