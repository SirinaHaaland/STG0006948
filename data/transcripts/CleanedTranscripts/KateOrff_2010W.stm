  i am passionate about the american landscape and how the physical form of the land from the great central valley of california to the bedrock of manhattan has really shaped our history and our character
  but one thing is clear in the last one hundred years alone our country and this is a a sprawl map of america
 our country has systematically flattened and homogenized the landscape to the point where we 've forgotten
 our relationship with the plants and animals that live alongside us and the dirt beneath our feet and so how i see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re imagine these connections
  and physically rebuild them 
 this graph represents what we 're dealing with now in the built environment  
 and it 's really a conflux of urban population rising biodiversity plummeting and also of course  sea levels rising 
  and climate changing so when i also think about design i think about trying to
  arrow here indicating you are here 
 i 'm trying to sort of blend and meld these two very divergent fields of urbanism and ecology and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way  
 so
 the era of big infrastructure is over i mean these sort of
  new approaches  similarly the idea of architecture as this sort of object in the field  devoid of context is really not the excuse me
  it 's fairly blatant
 is is really
 not the approach that we need to take  so we need new stories new heroes
 and and new tools so now i want to introduce you to my new hero
  climate change war  and that is the eastern oyster 
 so albeit a very small creature and very modest this creature is incredible because it can agglomerate into these mega reef structures 
 it can grow you can grow it and did i mention it 's quite tasty  
 so the oyster was
  urban design project that i did about the new york harbor called 
  the core idea of oyster tecture is to harness the biological power
 of mussels  eelgrass and oysters species that live in the harbor and at the same time harness the power of people who live in the community
 towards making change now here 's a map of my city new york city showing inundation in red and what 's circled
  the site that i 'm going to talk about the gowanus canal
 and governors island if you look here at this map  showing everything in blue is out in the water 
 and everything in yellow is upland but you can see even just intuit from this map that the harbor has dredged and flattened 
 and went from a rich three dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years 
 another set of
  views of actually the gowanus canal itself now the gowanus is particularly smelly i will admit it there are problems of sewage overflow and contamination but i would also argue that almost every city has this exact
 condition  and it 's a condition that we 're all facing and here 's a map of that condition showing the contaminants in
  we really had a lot to deal with 
 when we started this project one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there  and you can see from this map there 's this incredible 
  geographical signature of a series of islands that were out in the harbor and a matrix of salt marshes and
  natural wave attenuation for the upland settlement we also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the gowanus canal itself  
 so our concept is really this back to the future concept harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern and the idea has two core stages one is to develop a new artificial ecology a reef out in the harbor
  that would then protect new settlement patterns inland and the gowanus because if you have cleaner water and slower water you can imagine a new way of living with that water
 so the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way i think 
 here we are back to our hero the oyster  and again it 's this incredibly exciting animal  it accepts algae and detritus in one end and through this
 beautiful glamorous set of stomach organs out the other end comes cleaner water
  and one oyster can filter up to fifty gallons of water a day 
 oyster reefs also covered about a quarter of our harbor and were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days  
 they were key in our culture and our economy  
 basically new york was built on the backs of oystermen 
 and our streets were literally built over oyster shells this image is an image of an oyster cart
  which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today so again  we got the short end of the deal there 
 finally oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures they really become nature 's wave attenuators  
 and they become the bedrock of
  any harbor ecosystem  many many species depend on them  
 so we were inspired by the oyster but i was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster 
 it can move from a fertilized egg to a spat which is when they 're floating through the water and when they 're ready to attach onto another oyster 
 to an adult male oyster or female oyster in a number of weeks 
 we reinterpreted this life cycle on the scale of our sight
 and
 took the gowanus as a giant oyster nursery
  where oysters would be grown up in the gowanus then paraded down in their spat stage and seeded out on the bayridge reef  and so the core idea here was to hit the reset button
 and regenerate an ecology over time that was regenerative and cleaning and productive how does the reef work well  it 's very very
  core concept here is that climate change isn 't something that the answers won 't land down from the moon
 and with a $ twenty billion price tag we should simply start and get to work with what we have now and what 's in front of us 
 so this image is simply showing it 's a field of marine piles
 interconnected with this woven fuzzy rope 
 what is fuzzy rope you ask  it 's just that it 's this very inexpensive thing available practically at your hardware
  store  and it 's very cheap so we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project 
 so in the studio  rather than drawing we began to learn how to knit the concept was to really knit this rope together and develop this new soft infrastructure for the oysters to grow on
  you can see in the diagram how it grows over time from an infrastructural space into a new public urban space  
 and that grows over time dynamically with the threat of climate change 
 it also creates this incredibly interesting i think new amphibious public space where you can imagine working  
 you can imagine recreating in a new way  in the end what we realized we were making was a new
 watery century an amphibious park if you will so get your tevas on  
 so you can imagine scuba diving here this is an image of high school students scuba divers that we worked with on our team so
 you can imagine a sort of new manner of living with a new relationship with the water and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs in
  another new vocabulary word for the brave new world this is the word flupsy it 's short for floating upwelling system and this glorious readily available device
 is basically a floating raft with an oyster nursery below  so the water is churned through this raft you can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially force feed them so rather than having
 ten oysters you have ten thousand oysters and then those spat are
  then seeded here 's the gowanus future with the oyster rafts on the shorelines
 the flupsification of the gowanus new word  and also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges  
 and finally  how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down
 to the reef i get asked two
  questions about this project one is why isn 't it happening now and the second one is when can we eat the oysters and the answer is not yet they 're working  
 but we imagine with our calculations that by two thousand and fifty you might be able to sink your teeth into a gowanus oyster 
 to conclude this is just one cross section of one piece of
  my dream is my hope is that when you all go back to your own cities that we can start to work together and collaborate on remaking and reforming
 a new urban landscape towards a more sustainable a more livable and a more delicious future
