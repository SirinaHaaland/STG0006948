  great to be back at ted why don 't i just start by firing
  hang out with the flying club
  okay
  okay
  this message from a nigerian prince he needs help
 getting ten million dollars i
 like to pay attention to these because that 's how we originally funded the company and it
 's gone pretty well though in all seriousness this position that you just saw me in
  that 's one of the reasons behind this project project glass  because
 we ultimately questioned whether this is
 the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life how you want to connect to information
  should it be by just walking around looking down but
 that was the vision behind glass  and that 's why we 've created this form factor
  okay  and
 i don 't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot  but i want to tell you a little bit more about
 the motivation behind what led to it in addition to
 potentially socially isolating yourself when you 're out and about looking
  your phone it 's kind of 
 is this what you 're meant to do with your body 
 you 're standing around there and you 're just rubbing this featureless piece of glass you 're just kind of moving around 
 so when we developed glass we thought really about can we make something that frees your hands you saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there 
 they were all wearing glass and that 's how we got that
  and also you want something that frees your eyes that 's why we put the display up high out of your line of sight  so it wouldn 't be where you 're looking
 and it wouldn 't be where you 're making eye contact with people and also we wanted to free up the ears  so
 the sound actually
 goes through  conducts straight to the bones in your
  little bit freaky at first but
 you get used to it and ironically  if you want to hear it better you actually just cover your ear  which is kind of surprising but
 that 's how it works my vision when we started google
 fifteen years ago was that eventually you wouldn 't have to have a search query at all  you 'd just have information come to you as you needed
  and this is now fifteen years later sort of the first
 form factor that i think can deliver that vision when you 're out and about on the street talking to people and so forth 
 this project has lasted now been just over two years we 've learned an amazing amount 
 it 's been really important to make it comfortable so our first
 prototypes we built were huge it was like cell phones strapped to your head it was very heavy
  uncomfortable we had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job and then she almost ran away
 screaming  but we 've come a long way  
 and the other really unexpected surprise was the camera our original prototypes didn 't have cameras at all
  but it 's been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with
 my family my kids i just never would have dug out
  out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment  and lastly i 've realized in experimenting with this device that
 i also kind of have a nervous tic 
 the cell phone is yeah  you have to look down on it and all that but it 's also kind of a nervous habit like
 if i smoked i 'd probably just smoke instead i would just light up a cigarette it would look cooler
 but in this case you know i whip this out and i sit there and look as if i have something very important to do or attend to 
 but it really opened my eyes to how much of my life
  i spent
 just secluding away be it email or social posts or whatnot  even though it wasn 't really there 's nothing really that important or that pressing
  and with this i know i will get certain messages if i really need them but i don 't have to be checking them all the time yeah
 i 've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video  
 thank you all very much
