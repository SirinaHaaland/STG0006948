  steve told us about the
 future of little technology i 'm going to show you some of the past of big technology this was a project to build a 
  it was deeply classified i 'm going to show you some stuff that not only has not been declassified but has now been reclassified  
 laughter if all goes well next year i 'll be back and i 'll have a lot more to show you and if all doesn 't go well i 'll be in jail like wen ho lee
 so 
 this ship was basically the size of the marriott hotel a little taller and a little bigger
  and one of the people who worked on it at the beginning was my father freeman there in the middle that 's me and my sister esther who 's a frequent tedster 
 i
 didn 't like nuclear bomb propelled
  was a great idea but i started building kayaks so we had a few kayaks just so you know that i am not
 dr strangelove  but all the time i was out there doing these strange kayak voyages in odd
 beautiful parts of this planet i always thought in the back of my mind about project orion and
 how my father and his friends were going to build these big ships they were actually going to go ted
  who led the project was going to take his children  my father was not going to take his children that was one of the reasons we
 sort of had a falling out for a few years the project
 began in ' fifty seven at general atomics there that 's right on the coast at la jolla  look at that central building right in the middle of the picture  that 's the
 130 foot diameter library that is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship so put that library at the bottom of that ship that 's how big the thing was going to
  be it would take two or three thousand bombs  
 the people who worked on it were a lot of the los alamos people who had done the hydrogen bomb work it was the first project funded by arpa that 's the contract where arpa gave the first million dollars to get this thing 
  started spaceship project officially begun  job waiting for you  dyson that 's july  ' fifty eight two days later
  the space traveler 's manifesto explaining why just like we heard yesterday why we need to go into space trips to satellites of the outer planets august twenty 
 these are the statistics of what would be the good places to go and stop 
 some of the sizes of the ships  ranging all the way up to ship mass of eight million tons so that was the outer extreme here was version two 
 two thousand bombs
  yield bombs about the size of small volkswagens  
 it would take eight hundred to get into orbit here we see a 10 000 ton ship will deliver one thousand three hundred tons to saturn and back essentially a five year trip  possible departure dates october one thousand nine hundred and sixty to february 
 trajectories going to mars all this was done by hand with slide rules
  the little orion ship and what it would take to do what orion does with chemicals you have a ship the size of the empire state building nasa had no interest they tried to kill the project the people who supported it were the air force which meant that it was all secret and that 's why when you get something declassified that 's what it looks like
 military weapon versions that carried hydrogen bombs that could destroy half the planet there 's another version there that sends retaliatory strikes at the soviet union  this
  the really secret stuff how to get directed energy explosions so you 're sending the energy of a nuclear explosion not like just a stick of dynamite but you 're directing it at the ship and this is still 
  a very active subject  it 's quite dangerous but i believe it 's better to have dangerous things in the open than think you 're going to keep them secret this is what happened at six hundred microseconds the air force
 these are stills from
 film footage that was saved by someone who was supposed to destroy it but didn 't and kept it in their basement for the last forty years so these are three pound charges of c4 that 's about ten times what the guy had in his shoes 
 this is ed day putting so each of these coffee cans has three pounds of c4 in it they
 building a system that ejects these
 at quarter second intervals that 's my dad in the sport coat there holding the briefcase 
 so they had a lot of fun doing this  but no children were allowed my dad could tell me he was building a spaceship and going to go to saturn but he could not say anything more about it so all my life i have wanted to find this stuff out and spent the last four years
 tracking these old guys down these are stills from the video jeff bezos kindly yesterday said he 'll put this video up on the amazon site some little clip of it
  thanks to him  they got quite serious about the engineering of this the size of that mass  for us is really large
 technology in a way we 're never going to go back to if you saw the one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine this is what it would feel like in the passenger compartment that 's acceleration profile and
  looking at
  yield for an effective thrust of ten million newtons well here we have a little problem the radiation doses at the crew station seven hundred rads per shot 
 fission yields during development  they were hoping to get clean bombs they didn 't eyeburn this is what happens to the people in in miami who are looking up 
 personnel compartment noise that 's not too bad it 's very low frequencies
  support a feasibility study for a small version that could be launched with saturn vs in sections and pieced together so this is what nasa did getting
  version that would go to mars  they liked it because the guys could kind of live there
  so what 's upside down is right side up when you go to artificial gravity mode the scientists were still going to go along they would take seven astronauts
 and seven scientists this is a 20 man version for going to jupiter  
 bunks storm cellars exercise room you know it was going to be a nice  long trip  the air force version  here we have a military version 
  not been declassified just that people managed to sneak home and after you know on their deathbed basically gave me that the
 sort of artist conceptions these are basically powerpoint presentations given to the air force forty years ago  look at the the little guys there
 outside the vehicle  and one part of nasa was interested in it but the headquarters in nasa they killed the project
  at the end we can see the thing followed its sort of design path right up to 
  and then all those paths came to a halt  results  none  this project is hereby terminated so that 's the end 
 all i can say in closing is we heard yesterday that one of the ten bad things that could happen to us
 is an asteroid with our name on it
  and one of the bad things that could happen to nasa is if that asteroid shows up with our name on it nine months out and everybody says well 
 what are we going to do and orion is really one of the only if not the only off the shelf technologies that could do something 
 laughter so i 'm going to tell you the good news and the bad news the good news is that nasa has a small secret
  division that is looking at this trying to keep
 knowledge of orion preserved in the event of such a misfortune maybe keep a few little bombs of plutonium on the side  that 's the good news  the bad news is when i got in contact with these people to try and get some documents from them 
 they went crazy because i had all this stuff that they don 't have and nasa
 purchased one thousand seven hundred and fifty nine pages of this stuff from me so that 's the state we 're at
