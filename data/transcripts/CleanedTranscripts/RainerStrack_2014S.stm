  two thousand and fourteen is a very special year for me twenty years as a consultant twenty years of marriage  and i 'm turning fifty in one month 
 that means i was born in one thousand 
  in a small town in germany 
 it was a gray november day  and i was overdue  the hospital 's maternity ward was really stressed out because a lot of babies were born on this gray november day  
 as a matter of fact one thousand nine hundred and sixty four was the year with the highest birth rate ever in germany more than one point three million last year we just hit over six hundred thousand so half of my number 
 what you can see here
 is the german age pyramid and there the small black point at the top that 's me 
 in red you can see the potential working age population  
 so people over fifteen and under 
 and i 'm actually only interested in this red area  now  let 's do a simple simulation
 of how this age structure will develop over the next couple of years as you can see the peak is moving to the right  
 and i with many other baby boomers will retire in two thousand and thirty 
 by the way i don 't need any forecasts of birth rates for predicting this red area  the red area so the potential working age population in two thousand and thirty
 is already set in stone today  
 except for much higher migration rates and if you compare this red area in two thousand and thirty
 with the red area in two thousand and fourteen it is much much smaller  so before i show you the rest of the world what does this
  so what we know from this picture is
 that the labor supply  so people who provide labor will go down in germany and will go down significantly  
 now  what about labor demand  that 's where it gets tricky  
 as you might know the consultant 's favorite answer to any question is it depends so i would say it depends
  we didn 't want to forecast the future  highly speculative we did something else  
 we looked at the gdp and productivity growth of germany over the last twenty years  and calculated the following scenario  
 if germany wants to continue this gdp and productivity growth 
 we could directly calculate how many people germany would need to support this growth  
 and this is the green line labor demand  
 so germany will run into a
  major talent shortage very quickly 
 eight million people are missing which is more than twenty percent of our current workforce so big numbers  really big numbers  and we calculated several scenarios  and the picture always looked like this 
 now  to close the gap  germany has to significantly
 increase migration get many more women in the workforce increase
  retirement age by the way we just lowered it this year
 and all these measures at once 
 if germany fails here 
 germany will stagnate  we won 't grow anymore why because the workers are not there who can generate this growth  
 and companies will look for talents somewhere
  we simulated labor supply and and labor demand for the largest fifteen economies in the world 
 representing more than seventy percent of world gdp and the overall picture looks like this by two thousand and twenty  
 blue indicates a labor surplus 
 red indicates a labor shortfall  and gray are those
 countries which are borderline  
 so by two thousand and twenty we still see a labor surplus in some countries like italy france the u s 
 but this picture will change dramatically by two thousand and thirty  
 by two thousand and thirty  we will face a global workforce crisis in most of our largest economies including three out of the four bric countries 
  will be hit as well as brazil
 and russia  now  to tell the truth 
 in reality  
 the situation will be even more challenging 
 what you can see here are average numbers we de averaged them and broke them down into different skill levels  and what we found
  so on top of an overall labor shortage we will face a big skill mismatch in the future  and this means huge challenges in terms of education 
 qualification upskilling for governments and companies  
 now
  the next thing we looked into was robots automation technology will technology change this picture and boost productivity 
 now the short answer would be that our numbers already include a significant growth in productivity driven by technology 
 a long answer
 would go like this let 's take germany
  the germans have a certain reputation in the world when it comes to productivity 
 in the ' 90s i worked in our boston office for almost two years  
 and when i left an old senior partner told me literally send me more of these germans they work like machines
  replace a lot of jobs  regular jobs  not only in the production industry but even office workers are in jeopardy and might be replaced
 by robots artificial intelligence big data
  so the key question is not
 if technology replaces some of these jobs  but when how fast  and to what extent  
 or in other words  will technology help us to solve this global workforce crisis
  yes and no this is a more sophisticated version of it
  let 's take
 the automotive industry as an example  
 because there more than forty percent of industrial robots are already working and automation has already taken place in
 nine hundred and eighty  less than ten percent of the production cost of a car was caused by electronic parts 
 today this number is more than thirty percent
 and it will grow to more than fifty
  percent by two thousand and thirty  and these new electronic parts
 and applications require new skills and have created a lot of new jobs like the cognitive systems engineer
 who optimizes the interaction between driver and electronic system in one thousand nine hundred
  no one had the slightest clue that such a job would ever exist 
 as a matter of fact  
 the overall number of people involved in the production of a car has only changed slightly in the last decades in spite of robots and automation  
 so what does this mean  yes technology will replace a lot of jobs  but we will also see a lot of new jobs
 and new skills on the horizon and that means
  technology will worsen our overall skill mismatch  
 and this kind of de averaging reveals the crucial challenge for governments and businesses  
 so
 people high skilled people  talents will be the big thing in the next decade
  if they are the scarce resource  we have to understand them much better
 are they actually willing to work abroad  what are their job preferences 
 to find out this year we conducted a
 global survey among more than two hundred thousand job seekers from one hundred and eighty nine countries migration
 is certainly one key measure to close a gap at least in the short term
 asked about mobility more than sixty percent
 of these two hundred thousand job seekers are willing to work abroad for me a surprisingly high number 
 if you look at the employees aged twenty one to thirty this number is even higher  
 if you split this number up by country
  the world is mobile  but only partly  the least mobile countries are russia germany
 and the u s 
 now where would these people like to move number seven is australia where twenty eight percent could imagine moving then france
  of these two hundred thousand people so what are they looking for 
 out of a list of twenty six topics salary is only number eight 
 the top four topics are all around culture number four  having a great relationship with the boss 
 three
  relationship with colleagues and the top priority worldwide
 is being
 appreciated for your work 
 so do i get a thank you 
 not only once a year with the annual bonus payment  but every day  
 and now  our global workforce crisis becomes very personal people
  are looking for recognition aren 't we all looking for recognition in our jobs  
 now  let me connect the dots  
 we will face a global workforce crisis which consists of an overall labor shortage plus a huge skill mismatch  plus a big
 cultural challenge and this global workforce crisis is approaching very
  fast  right now we are just at the turning point  so what can we what can governments what can companies do 
 every company  but also every country  needs a people strategy and to act on it immediately  
 and such a people strategy consists of four parts number one a plan for how to forecast supply and demand
 for different jobs and different skills workforce planning will become more important than financial planning 
 two a plan for how to attract great people  generation y  women but also retirees 
 three a plan for how to educate and
  there 's a huge upskilling challenge ahead of us 
 and four for how to retain the best people  or in other words how to realize an appreciation
 and relationship culture  
 however one crucial underlying factor is to change our attitudes 
  not head counts  not machines  not even the germans  thank you
