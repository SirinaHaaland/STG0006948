  buzz aldrin climbed out of apollo eleven 's lunar module and descended onto the sea of tranquility  armstrong and aldrin were
  alone  but their presence on the moon 's gray surface was the culmination of a convulsive  collective effort 
 the apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the history of the united states to get to the moon nasa spent around one hundred and eighty billion dollars in today 's money or four percent of the federal budget 
 apollo employed around four hundred thousand people
  and demanded the collaboration of twenty thousand companies universities and government agencies  
 people died including the crew of apollo one  
 but
 before the apollo program ended twenty four men flew to the moon  twelve walked on its surface of whom aldrin  following the death of armstrong last year is now the most senior 
 so
  they go they didn 't bring much back  eight hundred and forty one pounds of old rocks and something all 
 later emphasized
 a new sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home why did they go the cynical answer is they went because president 
  kennedy wanted to show the soviets that his nation had the better rockets 
 kennedy 's own words at rice university 
 provide a better clue 
 why some say 
 why choose this as our goal and they may well ask  why climb the highest mountain  
 why thirty five years ago  fly the atlantic  why does rice play texas  we choose to go to the moon
  we choose to go to the moon 
 we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things 
 not because they are easy  but because they are hard jason pontin 
 to contemporaries apollo wasn 't only a victory of west over east in the cold war at the time the strongest
  emotion was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology 
 they went because it was a big thing to do 
 landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs the first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis in the
  years of the century polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated 
 technology itself seemed to possess what alvin toffler in one thousand nine hundred and seventy called accelerative thrust 
 for most of human history we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail
  nine hundred and seventy no human beings have been back to the moon  no one has traveled faster than the crew of apollo ten 
 and blithe optimism about technology 's powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve such 
  as going to mars  creating clean energy curing cancer or feeding the world have come to
  seem
 intractably hard  
 i remember watching the liftoff of apollo seventeen i was five years old and my mother told me not to stare at the fiery exhaust of a saturn v rocket 
 i vaguely knew this was to be the last of the moon missions  but i was
 absolutely certain there would be mars colonies in my lifetime
 so something happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology has become a
 commonplace you hear it all the time  we 've heard it over the last two days here at ted 
 it feels as if technologists have diverted us and enriched themselves with trivial toys with things like iphones and apps and social media
  or algorithms that speed automated trading 
 there 's nothing wrong with most of these things they 've expanded and enriched our lives  but they they don 't solve humanity 's big problems 
 what happened so there is a parochial explanation in silicon valley  which
  admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it financed intel microsoft apple and genentech  
 silicon valley says the markets are to blame in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs silicon valley says that venture investing shifted 
  away from funding transformational ideas and towards funding incremental problems or even fake problems  
  mostly explains what 's wrong with silicon valley 
 even when venture capitalists were at their most risk happy they preferred small investments tiny investments that offered an exit within ten years
 v c s have always struggled to invest profitably in technologies such as energy whose capital requirements are huge and whose development is long and lengthy and
  funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that possess no immediate commercial value 
 no the reasons we can 't solve big problems are more complicated and more profound 
 sometimes we choose not to solve big problems we could go to mars if we want  nasa even has the
  outline of a plan  
 but going to mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal and that will never happen 
 we won 't go to mars because everyone thinks there are more important things
 to do here on earth  
 sometimes we can 't solve big problems because our political systems fail 
 today less than two percent of the world 's energy consumption derives from advanced renewable sources such as solar wind and biofuels
  than two percent and the reason is purely economic  coal and natural gas are cheaper
 than solar and wind and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels 
 we want alternative energy sources that can compete on price  none exist now technologists  business leaders and economists all basically 
  agree on what national policies and international treaties would spur
  the development of alternative energy mostly a significant increase in energy research and development and some kind of price on carbon  
 but there 's no hope in the present political climate that we will see u s energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus  
  problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so 
 famines were long understood to be caused by failures in food supply  
 but thirty years of research have taught us that famines are political crises that catastrophically affect food distribution 
 technology can improve things like crop yields or systems for storing and transporting food 
 but there will be famines so long
  as there are bad governments  
 finally big problems sometimes elude solution because we don 't really understand the problem  
 president nixon declared war on cancer in one thousand nine hundred and seventy one 
 but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy  and it is only in the last ten years that
  effective viable therapies have come to seem real hard problems are hard 
 it 's not true that we can 't solve big problems through technology  we can 
 we must but these four elements must all be present 
 political leaders and the public must care to solve a
  must support its solution it must really be a technological problem  and we must understand it 
 the apollo mission which has become a kind of metaphor for technology 's capacity to solve big problems  met these criteria  
 but it is an irreproducible model for the future it is not one thousand nine hundred and
  there is no galvanizing contest like the cold war no politician like john kennedy who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous and 
  no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring the solar system 
 alone with our day and the solutions of the future will be harder won  
 god knows we don 't lack for the challenges  thank you very much
