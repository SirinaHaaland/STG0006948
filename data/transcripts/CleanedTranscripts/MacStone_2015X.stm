  the great privilege of traveling to some incredible places photographing these
 distant landscapes and remote cultures all over the world  
 i love my job  but people think it 's this string of epiphanies and sunrises and rainbows
  reality it looks more something like this laughter
 this is my office 
 we can 't afford the fanciest places to stay at night so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors 
 as long as we can stay dry that 's a bonus we also can 't afford the fanciest restaurants  so we tend to eat whatever 's on the local menu  
  going to eat a large rodent called a cuy 
 but what makes our experiences perhaps a little bit different and a little more unique than that of the average person is that
 we have this gnawing thing in the back of our mind that even in our darkest moments  and those times of despair we think hey there might be an image to be made here
  there might be a story to be told 
 and why is storytelling important
 well it helps us to connect with our cultural and our natural heritage and in the southeast there 's an alarming disconnect between the public and the natural areas that allow us to be here in the first place
 we 're visual creatures  so we use what we see to teach us what we know 
 now the majority of us aren 't going to willingly go way down to a swamp
  can we still expect those same people to then advocate on behalf of their protection 
 we can 't 
 so my job then is to use photography as a communication tool to help bridge the gap between the science and the aesthetics to get people talking to get them thinking  and to hopefully ultimately get them
  i started doing this fifteen years ago right here in gainesville right here in my backyard  and i fell in love with adventure and discovery going to explore all these different places that were just minutes from my front doorstep there are a lot of beautiful places to find  
 despite all these years that have passed  i still see the world through the eyes of a child and i try to incorporate that sense of wonderment and that sense of
 curiosity into my photography as often as
  can 
 and we 're pretty lucky because here in the south we 're still blessed with a relatively blank canvas that we can fill with the most fanciful adventures and 
 incredible experiences it 's just a matter of how far our imagination will take us 
  but i don 't just see a tree i look at this and i see opportunity i see an entire weekend  
 because when i was a kid these were the types of images that got me off the sofa and dared me to explore dared me to go find the woods and put my head underwater and see what we have 
 and folks i 've been photographing all over the world
 and i promise you what we have here in the south what we have in the
 sunshine state rivals anything else that i 've seen but yet our tourism industry is busy promoting all the wrong things  
 before most kids are twelve they 'll have been to disney world more times than they 've been in a canoe or camping under a starry sky  
 and i have nothing against disney or mickey i used to go there too 
 but they 're missing out on those fundamental connections that create a real sense of pride and ownership for the place that they call home  
  compounded by the issue that the landscapes that define our natural heritage and fuel our aquifer for our drinking water have been deemed as scary and dangerous and spooky
 when our ancestors first came here they warned stay out of these areas they 're haunted  
 they 're full of evil spirits and ghosts i don 't know where they came up with that idea
  but it 's actually led to a very real
  disconnect a very real negative mentality that has kept the public disinterested silent  and ultimately our environment at risk
 we 're a state that 's surrounded and defined by water and yet for centuries swamps and wetlands have been regarded as these obstacles to overcome  
 and so we 've treated them as these second class ecosystems  because they have very little monetary
  value and of course they 're known to harbor alligators and snakes which i 'll admit  these aren 't the most cuddly of ambassadors 
 so it became assumed then that the only good swamp was a drained swamp and
 in fact draining a swamp to make way for agriculture and development was considered the very essence of conservation
  because the more we come to learn about these sodden landscapes the more secrets we 're starting to unlock about interspecies relationships and the connectivity of habitats  watersheds and flyways
  take this bird for example 
 this is the prothonotary warbler i love this bird because it 's a swamp bird through and through a swamp bird  they nest and they mate and they breed in these old growth swamps in these flooded forests
  and so after the spring after they raise their young they then fly thousand of miles over the gulf of mexico into central and south america 
 and then after the winter the spring rolls around and and they come back they fly thousands of miles over the gulf of mexico and where do they go where do they land 
 right back in the same tree 
 that 's nuts this is a bird the size of a tennis ball
  ball i mean that 's crazy  i used a gps to get here today  and this is my hometown laughter
 it 's crazy
 so what happens then when this bird flies over the gulf of mexico into central america for the winter and then the spring rolls around and it flies back  and it comes back to this 
  golf course 
 this is a narrative that 's all too commonly unraveling here in this state  and this is a natural process that 's occurred for thousands of years and we 're just now learning about it  
 so you can imagine all else we have to learn about these landscapes if we just preserve them first now despite all this rich life that abounds in these swamps  
 they still have a bad name
  many people feel uncomfortable with the idea of wading into florida 's blackwater  i can understand
 that but what i loved about growing up in the sunshine state is that for so many of us we live with this
 latent but very palpable fear that when we put our toes into the water  there might be something much more ancient
 and much more adapted than we are knowing that you 're not top dog is
  how often in this modern and urban and digital age do you actually get the chance to feel vulnerable
  or consider that the world may not have been made for just us  
 so for the last decade i began seeking out these areas where the concrete yields to forest and the pines turn to cypress  and i viewed all these mosquitoes and 
  reptiles all these discomforts as affirmations that i 'd found true wilderness
 and i embrace them wholly 
 now as a conservation photographer obsessed with blackwater it 's only fitting that i 'd eventually end up in the most famous swamp of all the everglades
 growing up here in north central florida it always had these enchanted names places like
  hopefully reintroduce the everglades in a new light in a more inspired light but
 i knew this would be a tall order because here you have an area that 's roughly a third the size the state of florida it 's huge  and when i say everglades most people are like oh yeah the national park but the everglades is not just a park  it 's an 
  starting with the kissimmee chain of lakes in the north  
 and then as the rains would fall in the summer these downpours would flow into lake okeechobee and lake okeechobee would fill up and it would overflow its banks and spill southward ever slowly 
 with the topography and get into the river of grass the sawgrass prairies before meting into the cypress slews until going further south into the mangrove swamps and then finally finally reaching florida bay  
  and fifty  square mile estuary  
 so sure the national park is the southern end of this system  
 but all the things that make it unique are these inputs that come in the fresh water that starts one hundred miles north  
 so no manner of these political or invisible boundaries protect the park from
 polluted water or insufficient
  and unfortunately that 's precisely what we 've done 
 over the last sixty years  we have drained we have dammed we have dredged the everglades to where now only one third of the water that used to reach the bay now reaches the bay today 
 so this story is not all sunshine and rainbows unfortunately for better or for worse  the story of the everglades is is
  intrinsically tied to the peaks and the valleys of mankind 's relationship with the natural world but i 'll show you these beautiful pictures because it gets you on board  
 and while i have your attention i can tell you the real story it 's that we 're taking this
 and we 're trading it for this 
 at an alarming rate
  and what 's lost on so many people is the sheer scale of which we 're discussing  
 because the everglades is not just responsible for the drinking water for seven million floridians
 today it also provides the agricultural fields for the year round tomatoes and oranges for over three hundred million americans  
 and it 's that same seasonal pulse of water in the summer that built
 the river of grass six thousand years ago  ironically today it 's also responsible for the
 over half a million acres of the endless river of sugarcane
  the same fields that are responsible for dumping exceedingly high levels of fertilizers into the watershed  forever changing the system  
 but in order for you to not just understand how this system works but to also get personally connected to it i decided to break the story down into several different narratives  and i wanted that story to start in lake okeechobee
  the beating heart of the everglade system  and to do that i picked an ambassador an iconic species this is the everglade snail kite
 it 's a great bird and they used to nest in the thousands thousands in the northern everglades  and then they 've gone down to about four hundred nesting pairs today  and why is that 
 well it 's because they eat one source of food an apple snail about the size of a  ping pong ball an aquatic
  so as we started damming up
 the everglades as we started diking lake okeechobee and draining the wetlands we lost the habitat for the snail and thus the population of the kites declined 
 and so i wanted a photo that would not only communicate this relationship between wetland snail and bird  but i also wanted a photo that would communicate how how incredible this relationship was
  and how very important it is that they 've come to depend on each other this healthy wetland and this bird and to do that i brainstormed this idea i started sketching out these
 these plans to make a photo  and i sent it to the wildlife biologist down in okeechobee this is an endangered bird so it takes special permission to do so i built this submerged platform that would hold snails just right under the water  
 and i spent months planning this crazy
  and i took this platform down to lake okeechobee and i spent over a week in the water wading 
  shifts from dawn until dusk to get one image that i thought might communicate this and here 's
 the day that it finally worked [ video after setting up the platform i look off and i see a kite coming over the
  but what the idea was is that for someone who 's never seen this bird and has no reason to care about it these
  these new perspectives will help shed a little new light on just one species that makes this watershed so incredible so valuable  so important 
 now i know i
 can 't come here to gainesville and talk to you about animals in the everglades without talking about gators i
 love gators i grew up loving gators 
 my parents always said i had an unhealthy relationship with gators  but what i like about them is they 're like the freshwater equivalent of sharks  they 're feared they 're hated and they are tragically
  misunderstood  
 because these are a unique species they 're not just apex predators in the everglades  they are the very architects of the everglades  because as the water drops down in the winter 
  during the dry season they start excavating these holes called gator holes and they do this because as the water drops down they 'll be able to stay wet and they 'll be able
  and now this isn 't just affecting them other animals also depend on this relationship so they become a keystone species as well  
 so how do you make an apex predator an ancient reptile at once look like it dominates the system but at the same time look vulnerable well
 you wade into a pit of about one hundred and twenty of them then you hope that you 've made the
  but i understand i know i 'm not going to rally you guys i 'm not going to rally the troops to save the everglades for the gators 
 it won 't happen because they 're so ubiquitous we see them now they 're one of the great conservation success stories of the us 
 but there is one species in the everglades that no matter who you are you can 't help but love too 
 and that 's the roseate
  these birds are great but they 've had a really tough time in the everglades  because they started out with thousands of nesting pairs in florida bay  and at the turn of the 20th century they got down to two
 two nesting pairs  and why that 's because women thought they looked better on their hats then they did flying in the sky 
 then we banned the plume trade and their numbers started
  and as their numbers started rebounding  scientists began to pay attention they started studying these birds  and what they found out is that these birds ' behavior is intrinsically tied to the
  annual draw down cycle of water in the everglades the thing that defines the everglades watershed 
 so these birds became the very icon of the everglades an indicator species of the overall health of the system  
 and just as their numbers were rebounding in the mid 20th century shooting up
 to nine hundred one thousand one thousand one hundred one thousand two hundred just as that started happening we started draining the southern everglades and we stopped
  that water from moving south  
 and it had drastic consequences  
 and just as those numbers started reaching their peak  unfortunately today  the real spoonbill story the real photo of what it looks like is more something like this 
 and we 're down to less than seventy nesting pairs in florida bay today  because we 've disrupted the system so much  so all these different
  organizations are shouting they 're screaming the everglades is fragile it 's fragile it is not it is resilient  
 because despite all we 've taken despite all we 've done and we 've drained and we 've dammed and we 've dredged it  pieces of it are still here waiting to be put back together  
 and this is what i 've loved about south florida that in one place you have this unstoppable force of mankind meeting the immovable object of tropical nature  
 and it 's at this new frontier that we are forced with a new appraisal
  is wilderness worth what is the value of biodiversity or our drinking water  
 and fortunately  after decades of debate we 're finally starting to act on those questions we 're slowly undertaking these projects to bring more freshwater back to the bay  
 but it 's up to us as citizens as residents as stewards to hold our elected officials to their promises 
 what can you do to
  help it 's so easy just get outside get out there  take your friends out take your kids out take your family out 
 hire a fishing guide show the state that protecting wilderness not only makes ecological sense but economic sense as well  
 it 's a lot of fun just do it put your feet in the water  the swamp will change you i promise
 over the years we 've been so
  generous with these other landscapes around the country 
 cloaking them with this american pride 
 places that we now consider to define us  grand canyon yosemite yellowstone 
 and we use these parks and these natural areas as beacons and as cultural compasses  
 and sadly the everglades is very commonly
 commonly left out of that conversation  
 but i believe it 's every bit as iconic and emblematic of who we are as a country as any of these other wildernesses  
 it 's just a different kind of wild  
 but i 'm encouraged  because maybe we 're finally starting to come around 
 because what was once deemed this swampy wasteland today is a world heritage site  
 it 's a wetland of international importance
  and we 've come a long way in the last sixty years 
 and as the world 's largest and most ambitious wetland restoration project the international spotlight is on us in the sunshine state  
 because if we can heal this system it 's going to become an icon for wetland restoration all over the world
  but it 's up to us to decide which legacy we want to attach our flag to
 they say that the everglades is our greatest test
  if we pass it  we get to keep the planet i
 love that quote  because it 's a challenge  it 's a prod can we do it  will we do it  we have to we must  
 but the everglades is not just a test it 's also a gift  and ultimately our responsibility
