  it 's my first since bridge and tunnel which i did on broadway and this 
 i thank you i 've excerpted it just for you so here we go
  right class let 's be absolutely certain all electronic devices are switched off before we begin  
 so class  hopefully
 you 'll recognize what you just heard me say as the very good  the cellular phone announcement right this was also known as a mobile
  people of that era would have had
 an external electronic device right something like this 
 and they all would have carried one of these around with them and amongst their biggest fears was the sheer mortification that one of these might ring at some inopportune moment right 
 so a bit of trivia about that era for you 
 so the format of today 's class is i will be presenting multiple
  bert modules today from that period in history right so starting circa 
 and remember this was the very first year of the bert program 
 so we 've got quite a few of these to get through  bear in mind i will be living into various different bodies different ages
  also what were then called races or ethnic groups as you 'll remember from unit one
  and and along the gender continuum i will be living into males as well it was quite binary at that time laughter
 also don 't forget we are reading the book module for next week 's focus on gender now i know some of you have requested the book in pill form  
 i know people still believe ingesting it is better for retention but since we are trying to
  experience what our forebears did right  let 's please just consider doing the actual ocular reading  okay  
 and also 
 how many people have your emotional shunts engaged  right  please toggle them off  okay   i know
 it 's challenging
 i want you to be able to feel the entire natural emo range all right it is essential to this part of the syllabus  yes macy  
 all right  i understand  if you 're unwilling to
 all right well we can discuss that after class all right we will discuss your concerns just relax  nobody 's died and gone to composting
  early modules
 in these people 's full identities were protected and this allowed them to speak more freely on our topic which for many of them was taboo 
  i said i 'm ready when you are i 'm freezing it
 's like a meat locker in here in this recording studio  i should have brought a shmata 
 all this fancy technology but they can 't afford heat what is he saying  i can 't hear you i can 't hear you through the
  oh the cold is for the machines  the new technology  okay  yes  now remind me again you 're recording not only my voice but my feelings
  people will be able to feel my experience and my memory  okay  
 no right i 'm ready i just thought you were going to give me a test to see how my memory 's doing i was going to tell you you 're too late it 's already bad news
  what do i think of prostitution are you soliciting me young man
 i 've heard of may december romances but what are you about twenty years old  
 eighteen  eighteen years  i think i
 have candies in my purse older than eighteen years
  just in my day they called it prostitution not sex work oh because it includes pornography also  okay   no well
  i guess when i was a girl we didn 't really have a name for that either  we would have said
 dirty magazines i suppose or dirty movies  well it 's not like what you have with the internet
  might be helped by using some of the pills men can take
 but
 he wasn 't interested in those  so i thought 
 what about maybe watching an adult movie on the internet  just for inspiration you understand   well at the
  neither of us were very good on the computer
 so usually if we needed help with the internet  we would just call our children or our grandchildren
 but obviously in this case that wasn 't an option  
 so i thought i 'll have a look myself  just to see
 how difficult could it be you search for certain key words and you look
 oh wow is right young man you can 't imagine
  what i saw
 well  first of all i was just trying to find  you know
  couples normal couples making love   
 but this  
 so many people together at one time you couldn 't tell which part belonged to which body  
 how they even got the cameras to capture some of this i couldn 't tell you
 but
 the one thing they didn
  capture was making love   there was lots of making
 of something   but they took the love part right out of it you know the fun  it was
 all very extreme you know like you would say with the extreme sports
  never get back again
 it only showed up on the credit card as entertainment services so my husband was never the wiser 
 and after all of that 
  you could say it turned out he didn 't need the extra inspiration after all right  so next subject
 is a young woman
 next subject class is a young woman called bella a university student interviewed in two thousand and sixteen during what was called an intro to feminist porn class
 as part of her major in sex work at a college in the bay area
 yeah i just want to like get a recording of like you guys recording me like a meta recording or whatever
  it 's just like this whole experience is just like really amazing and i 'd like to capture that for like  instagram and my tumblr so
 like hi guys it 's me bella 
  as you can see from these whatever like electrodes the formation of like 
 in my hippocampus or whatever  they will later be able to reconstitute these as like my own
  actual memory  like actual experiences so other people can like actually feel what i 'm feeling right now
  okay 
 okay so like hello bert person of the future who is experiencing me  
 this is what it feels like to be like
  that you are experiencing through me is the like  residual effect of the jell o shots which i had last night
 at the bi weekly feminist pole dancing party which i cohost on wednesdays  it 's called don 't get all
  we should also focus on your questions also 
  so for your record  i am like a sex work studies major but minoring in social media with a
  of course like i consider myself to be like  obviously like a feminist i was named for bella abzug who was like 
 a famous  like feminist from history  
 and 
 like also i feel that it is like important to like represent women who are like
  the terms that we use are like so important because like  we call it sex work because it helps people understand that like  
  insurance providers like we think of these workers as like sex care providers  
 yeah but like  i don 't think of myself like  providing direct sex care services per se as like being a requirement for me to be like an
  i support other women 's right to choose it voluntarily like  if they enjoy it
 yeah  but like i see myself going forward as more likely like protecting sex workers ' like legal freedoms and rights yeah 
 so like basically i 'm planning on becoming a lawyer 
 right class
  with a particularly noteworthy relationship to this issue but first will be a west indian woman
 escort who was recorded at a sex workers ' rights rally and parade
 she was interviewed whilst marching in full carnival
  you want me to start talking now yeah i told you you can put those wires anywhere you want to as long as it don 't get in the way 
 yeah no
 but tell me again what the name of bert bert  yeah i was telling you you know 
 i think i have in all my time i have had at least one client with that name so this won 't be the first time i had bert all over me
 'm sorry  but you got to get into the spirit of it if you 're going to interview me all right 
 you can say it no justice  no piece  no justice  no piece  but you see the sign you get it
 no justice  no piece of us you understand  right so that 's the part where i was telling you is that when i
  came to this country i worked every job i could find i was a nanny  i was a home care attendant for all these different old people  and then i said child if i have to touch another white man 's backside i might as well get paid a lot more money for it than this you
 pshh you know how hard it is being a domestic worker some of these men they 're heavy you have to pick them up and flip them over
  i let them pick me up and flip me over  you understand well you have to have a sense of humor about it 
  but see listen  you find me somebody who don 't hate some part of their job 
 i mean there 's a lot of things about this job that i hate but the money is not one of them and i will tell you as long as this is the best possibility for me to make real money i am going to be 
  if that 's what they want to call me
 not even from jamaica  that 's how they market me  my family is from trinidad and the virgin islands
  they don 't know what i do but you know what my children  they know that their school fees are paid  they have their books and their computer  and this way  i know that they have a chance so i 'm not going to
  tell you that what i do it 's easy i 'm not going to tell you that i feel what 's that you said liberated  but i 'm going to tell you that i feel paid right
 applause thanks that 's lovely and just the cup of tea love and just a splash of the whiskey it 's perfect  that 's grand just a drop more a splash perfect
  the unique part of it for me right  is that i ended up in both 
 first in the convent  and then in the prostitution after that 's right laughter
 so one woman at the university here in dublin she wrote about me she said  maureen fitzroy is the living embodiment of the whore virgin
  doesn 't it sound like something you need to go into hospital  well i 've got this terrible dichotomy doesn 't it 
 right well  for me though it was as a girl  it started with me dad  i mean half the time when he spoke to us it was just a sort of tell us we were all useless rotten idiots and we had no morals that type of thing
 and i certainly didn 't do myself any favors  by the time i was sixteen
  i had started messing about with this older fella and he wanted it to be our little secret  and i did as i was told didn 't i and
 when that got back to me dad he had me sent straightaway to the convent
 well no that older fella he would still come to find me in the convent  
 yeah  he 'd leave me notes tucked into the holes in the brick at the back of the charity shop so we could meet
  his wife and i believed him  until i got pregnant i did peter  and
 i left him a note about it in our special place there and i never did hear from him again no 
 i gave it up for adoption so it could have a decent life
 and then they wouldn 't let me back into the convent  no my one sister virginia gave me a
  the coach to dublin and that 's how i ended up here  well  surprise surprise i fell in love with another fella much older than me and
 i always say i was just so happy because he didn 't drink   i married the bastard  
 well he didn 't drink but he did have just the wee heroin problem
  that 's right and before i knew it  he was the one who turned me on to the prostitution  my own husband he had me supporting the both of us i was eighteen  
 well  it wasn 't pretty woman i can tell you that
 that julia roberts if she 'd ever had to
 sleep with a man to put a few pounds in her pocket i don 't think she 'd ever
  my opinion of the legalization i 'd say i 'm against it i just i don 't care what these young girls say  you know living like
  told me
 and if you legalize it then you 're really telling these girls go on and get lost for a living and a lot of them they 'll do as they 're told all right 
 so four perspectives from four quite 
 four quite different voices there right one woman saying sex itself is natural but the sex industry seems to mechanize or industrialize it
  then the second woman considered sex work to be empowering 
 liberating and feminist though she herself notably did not seem keen to do it 
 the third woman who actually was a so called sex worker
 did not agree that it was liberating but she wanted the right to the economic empowerment and then we hear the fourth woman saying not only prostitution itself but proscribed roles for women
  in general prevented her from ever finding who she was  right so another fact most people did not know was the average age of an  at risk girl being introduced 
 to the sex industry was twelve or thirteen also consider that the age when all girls in that society first became exposed to sexualized images of women was quite a bit earlier
  was a doll called barbie right i initially thought she was an educational tool for anorexia prevention but
 actually
 she was considered by many to be a wholesome symbol of femininity and often young girls began what was called dieting
  remember this this was restricting food intake on purpose
 by the age of six and defining
  themselves based on attractiveness by around that same time right  yes
  right bradley  okay  excellent point so there was a lucrative market in that society in convincing all people they had to look a certain way to even have a sex life right 
 but girls especially were expected to be 
  avoiding being perceived as sluts for being sexual right so there 's that shame piece we 've heard about  yes  
 valerie  right  okay  very good   of course men were having sex as well but you 'll remember from the reading what were male sluts called 
 very good they were called men
 so not easy living in a world like that right  though it was not all bad news
  either  most women in the early 2000s considered themselves empowered 
 and men generally felt they were also evolved in this area and in fact most people would have been aware of issues like human trafficking for example but they would have seen that as quite separate 
 from more recreational adult entertainment and so we 'll just very briefly class we don 't have a lot of time we 'll just very briefly hear from a man on our topic at this
  stage so this next subject was interviewed on the night of his bachelor party 
 dude can you all right can you just keep it down i 'm trying to talk to bert right now oh your name 's not bert bert 's the name of
  i 'm wearing toms right now  yeah  toms like
 the shoes  like  you buy a pair and then a kid in africa gets clean water yeah  totally but what was the question again  
  of course i believe in women 's rights i 'm marrying a woman 
 no but i mean like just because i 'm in a strip club parking lot doesn 't mean that i 'm like a sexist or whatever  my fiancee 
  is totally amazing she 's totally a strong girl  woman smart woman like the whole
  and he thought this would be hilarious but this is not something  yeah  we all went to b school together wharton 
 yeah  so dude can you guys all right but it 's my bachelor party  and i can spend it in the parking lot with anderson cooper if i want to
  first of all stripping but then like all the other things you 're talking about prostitution and all that stuff that 's like not the same thing at all you know like 
 you keep calling it the sex industry or whatever but it 's like  
 if the girl wants to be an exotic dancer and she 's eighteen like that 's her right 
  i hear what you 're saying but i just feel like people they just want to make it seem like all dudes are just like predators that we would just automatically go to a prostitute or whatever  
 even like when i pledged  you know like
 when i rushed my fraternity  my brothers who i 'm close to those guys they 're all like me we
 're just normal people but like there 's this myth that you must be that guy who is kind of an asshole and like all bros before hos or whatever  and actually like bros before hos it doesn 't mean like what
  it sounds like
 like it 's actually just like a joking way of saying that you care about your brothers and you put them first 
 yeah but 
 you can 't blame the media either i mean like  if you go watch hangover two and you think that 's an instruction manual for your life like i don 't know what to tell you you
 know you don 't watch bourne identity and go
  if you 're a little kid or whatever of course it 's different but
 yeah  all right  i remember one thing like that i was at this kid 's house one time playing gta uh 
 grand theft auto dude are you from canada 
  with grand theft auto
 you 're this kid like you 're this guy walking around or whatever  and you can basically like the more cops you kill the more points you get and stuff like that but also  
 you can find prostitutes and obviously you can do sexual stuff with them but you can like  kill them and take your money back 
 yeah  this kid i remember he ran over a couple of them a few times with his car and he got all these points
  i think 
  it felt pretty terrible actually  
 no  i don 't think i said anything i just finished playing and went home 
 all right class so then there were men who had more than just a passing relationship to this issue 
 laughter the next subject described himself as a reformed and remorseful pimp turned
  motivational speaker life coach and therapist but if you want to know more about him you 'll have to come to the entire play 
 thank you so much you beautiful ted
