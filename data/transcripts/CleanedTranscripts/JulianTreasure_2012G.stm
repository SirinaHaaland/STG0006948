  it 's time to start designing for our ears 
 architects and designers tend to focus exclusively on these they use these to design with and they design for them which is why we end up sitting
  shouting from a foot away to try and be heard by our dinner companion or why we get on airplanes which cost two hundred million pounds with
 somebody talking through an old fashioned telephone handset on
 a cheap stereo system making us jump out of our skins we
 're designing environments that make us crazy and it 's not just our quality of life which suffers it 's our health
  our social behavior and our productivity as well 
 how does this work well two ways first of all ambience i have a whole tedtalk about this 
 sound affects us physiologically psychologically cognitively and behaviorally all the time the sound around us is affecting us even though we 're not conscious of it there
 's a second way though as well  that 's interference communication requires sending and receiving 
 and i have another whole tedtalk about the importance of conscious
 listening but i can send as well as i like and you can be brilliant conscious listeners  if the space i 'm sending it in
 is not effective that communication can 't happen 
 spaces tend to include noise and acoustics a room like this has acoustics this one very good acoustics many rooms are not so good let me give you some examples from a couple of areas which i think we all care about health and education
 when i was visiting my terminally ill father in a hospital i was asking myself how does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this  
 hospital sound is getting worse all the time noise levels in hospitals have doubled in the last few years 
 and it affects not just the patients but also the people working there i think we would like for dispensing errors to be zero wouldn 't we 
 and yet as noise levels go
 so do the errors in dispensing made by the staff in hospitals most of all though it affects the patients and that could be
 you it could be me  sleep is absolutely crucial
 for recovery it 's when we regenerate when we rebuild ourselves and with threatening noise like this going on your body even if you are
 able to sleep your body is telling you i 'm under threat  this is dangerous and the quality of sleep is degraded
  and so is our recovery  there are just huge benefits to come from designing for the ears in our health care  this is an area i intend to take on this year 
 education  
 when i see a classroom that looks like this can you imagine how this sounds  i am forced to ask myself a question
  definitely do have ears but i think sometimes they don 't use them when they 're designing buildings here 's a case in point this is a 
 flagship academy school which was built quite recently in the u k and designed by one of britain 's top architects  
 unfortunately it was designed like a corporate headquarters with a vast central atrium and classrooms leading off it with no back walls at all 
 the children couldn 't hear their teachers
  had to go back in and spend six hundred thousand pounds putting the walls in let 's stop this madness of open plan classrooms right now  please 
 it 's not just these modern buildings which suffer old fashioned classrooms suffer too a study in florida just a few years ago found that if you 're sitting where this photograph was taken in the
  speech intelligibility is just fifty percent 
 children are losing one word in two now that doesn 't mean they only get half their education but it does mean they have to work very hard to join the dots and understand what 's going on this is affected massively by reverberation time how reverberant a room is 
 in a classroom with a reverberation time of one point two seconds which is pretty common  
  if you take that one point two seconds down to zero point four seconds by installing acoustic treatments sound absorbing materials and so forth  this is what
  infinitely many words can be written with a small set of letters in arithmetic  infinitely many numbers can be composed from just a few digits with the help of the simple zero julian treasure what a difference 
 now that education you would receive and thanks to the british acoustician adrian james for those simulations the signal was the same the background noise was the same all that changed was the acoustics of the classroom in those two examples if education can be likened to
  watering a garden which is  a fair metaphor  sadly  much of the water is evaporating before it reaches the flowers  especially for some groups 
 for example those with hearing impairment  
 now that 's not just deaf children that could be any child who 's got a cold  glue ear an ear infection even hay fever on a given day one in eight children fall into that group on any given day  
 then you have children for whom
  english is a second language  or whatever they 're being taught in is a second language in the u k that 's more than ten percent of the school population 
 and finally  after susan cain 's wonderful tedtalk in february we know that introverts find it very difficult to relate when they 're in a noisy environment doing group work  
 add those up that is a lot of children who are not receiving their education properly 
 it 's not just the children who are affected though
 average noise level in classrooms
 is sixty five decibels i have to really raise my voice to talk over sixty five decibels of sound 
 and teachers are not just raising their voices  this chart maps the teacher 's heart rate against the noise level 
 noise goes up heart rate goes up  that is not good for you in fact
  is the very level at which this big survey of all the evidence on noise and health found that that is the threshold for the danger of myocardial infarction 
 to you and me that 's a heart attack 
 it may not be pushing the boat out too far to suggest that many teachers are losing significant life expectancy
  by teaching in environments like that day after day what does it cost to treat a classroom down to that 
  reverberation time two and a half thousand pounds  
 and the essex study which has just been done in the u k which incidentally showed that when you do this you do not just make a room that 's suitable for hearing impaired children you make a room where behavior improves  
 and results
  this found that sending a child out of area to a school that does have such a room if you don 't have one costs
 ninety thousand pounds a year  
 i think the economics are pretty clear on this  
 i 'm glad that debate is happening on this i just moderated a major conference in london a few weeks ago called sound education which brought together top acousticians  government people teachers and so forth 
 we 're at last starting to debate this issue  and the benefits that are available
  for designing for the ears in education  unbelievable out of that conference  incidentally also came a free app
 which is designed to help children study if they 're having to work at home for example in a noisy kitchen  and that
  that 's free out of that conference  let 's
 broaden the perspective a little bit and look at cities  we have urban planners  where are the urban
  sound planners  
 i don 't know of one in the world and the opportunity is there to transform our experience in our cities 
 the world health organization estimates that a quarter of europe 's population is having its sleep degraded by noise in cities we can do better than that 
 and in our offices we spend a lot of time at work where are the
  people who say don 't sit that team next to this team because they like noise and they need quiet  
 or who say don 't spend all your budget on a huge screen in the conference room and then place one tiny microphone in the middle of a table for thirty people 
 if you can hear me you can understand me without seeing me  if you can see me without hearing me that does not work  
 so office sound is a huge area and
  noise in offices has been shown to make people less helpful less enjoy their teamwork  and less productive at work  
 finally we have homes we use interior designers  where are the interior sound designers  hey  let 's all be interior sound designers  
 take on listening to our rooms and designing sound that 's effective and appropriate 
 my friend richard mazuch an architect in london coined the phrase invisible
  i love that phrase  it 's about designing not appearance  but
 experience so that we have spaces that sound as good as they look that are fit for purpose  
 that improve our quality of life our health and well being our social behavior
 and our productivity
