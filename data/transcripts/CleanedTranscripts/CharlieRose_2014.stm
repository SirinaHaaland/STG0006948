  larry sent me an email and he basically said  we 've got to make sure that we don 't seem like we 're a couple of middle aged boring
  the dots and how this journey that began
 some time ago has such interesting prospects mainly we want to talk about the future  so my first question where is google and where is it going lp well this
 is something we think about a lot and our mission
 we defined a long time ago is to organize the world 's information
 and make it universally accessible and useful  and people always say
 that really what you guys are still doing  and i always kind of think about that myself and i 'm not quite sure but
 actually 
 when i think about search  it 's such a deep thing for all of us 
 to really understand what you want to understand the world 's information 
 and we 're still very much in the early stages of that which is totally crazy
 but it 's not at all done cr when it 's done how will it be lp well 
 i guess in thinking about where we 're going you
 know why is it not done a lot of it is just computing 's kind of a mess you know your computer doesn 't know where you are it doesn 't know
  know what you know and a lot we 've been trying to do recently is just make
 your devices work make them understand your context google now you know knows where you are knows what you may need  
 so really having computing
 work and understand you
 and understand that information we
 really haven 't done that yet it 's still very very clunky cr tell me when you look at what google is doing where does deep mind fit
 deep mind is a company we just acquired recently it 's in the
 u k first let me tell you the way we got there  which was
 looking at search and really understanding trying to understand everything  and also make the computers not clunky and really understand you
 like voice was really important so what 's the state of the art on speech recognition
  very good it
 doesn 't really understand you so we started doing machine learning research to improve that 
 that helped a lot  and we started just looking at things like youtube can we understand youtube but we actually
 ran machine learning on youtube and it discovered cats just by itself now that 's an
  we realized there 's really something here if we can learn what cats are that must be really important so i think
 deep mind  what 's really amazing about deep mind is that it can actually
 they 're learning things in this unsupervised way they started with video games 
 and really just maybe i can show the video  just playing video games 
 and learning how to do that automatically
  games and how machines are coming to be able to to do some remarkable things lp the amazing thing about this is this is i mean obviously these are
 old games but
 the system just sees
 what you see the pixels and it has the controls and it has the score
 and it 's learned to play all of these games  same program it 's learned to play all of these games
 with superhuman performance
  not been able to do things like this with computers before and
 maybe i 'll just narrate this one quickly this is boxing  and it figures out it can sort of pin pin the opponent down the computer
 's on the left and it 's just racking up points  
 so imagine if this kind of intelligence were thrown at your schedule or
  information needs or things like that 
 we 're really just at the beginning of that  and that 's what what i 'm really excited about cr when you look at at all that 's taken place with deep mind and
 and the boxing also a part of where we 're going
 is artificial intelligence where are we  when you look at that lp well i think
 for me this is kind of one of the most exciting things i 've seen in a long time
 the guy who started this company
 has a neuroscience and a computer science background  he went back to school to get his ph d to
 study the brain  and so i think we 're seeing a lot of exciting work
 going on that sort of crosses computer science and neuroscience in terms of really understanding
 what it takes to make something smart
  and do really interesting things cr but where 's the level of it now and how fast do you think we are moving lp well this is the state of the art right now
 understanding cats on youtube and things like that improving voice recognition  we used a lot of machine learning
 to improve things incrementally but i think for me this example 's really exciting because it 's one program
 that can do a lot of different things cr i don 't know if we can do this but we 've got the image of
  cat it would be wonderful to see this this is how machines looked at cats and what they came up with can we see that image lp yeah cr 
 there it is can you see the cat  designed by machines seen by machines lp that 's right so this is learned from just watching youtube 
 and there 's no training no notion of a cat but
 this concept of a cat is something important
  can kind of understand maybe just finishing also on the search part it started with search really understanding
 people 's context and their information i did have a video
 i wanted to show quickly on that
  then suddenly they started dying one after the other i checked out the books and they didn 't tell me much  so i went and 
 potato
 diseases one of the websites told me that ants could be the problem  it said
 sprinkle wood ash over the plants  then after a few days the ants disappeared  i got excited about the internet  i have this friend who
 really would like to expand his business  
 so i went with him to the cyber cafe and we checked out several sites  when i met him next he was going to put a windmill
 at the local school  i felt proud because something that wasn 't there before
 was suddenly there i
  that not everybody can be able to access
 what i was able to access i thought that i need to have an internet that my grandmother can use  so i thought about a notice board
  a simple wooden notice board  when i get information on my phone i 'm able to post the information on the notice board  so it 's basically like a computer
  to that is our knowledge  when people have the knowledge they
  amazing thing about that video actually was we just read about it in the news and we found this gentlemen and made that little clip cr when i talk to people about you
  they say to me people who know you well say  larry wants to change the world and he believes technology
 can show the way
  and that means access to the internet it has to do with languages it also means how people can get access and do things that will affect their community  and this is an example
  released this loon project which is using balloons to do it it sounds totally crazy we can show the video here
 actually two out of three people in the world don 't have good internet access now  we actually think this can really help people 
 it 's a balloon lp yeah  get access to the internet
  why does this balloon give you access to the internet because there was some interesting things you had to do to figure out how to make balloons possible they didn 't have to be tethered lp 
 yeah and this is a good example of innovation like 
 we 've been thinking about this idea for five years or more before we started working on it but it was just really how do we get
 access points up high cheaply you normally have to use satellites and it takes a
  saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon and get it up and
 actually again it 's the power of the internet i did a search on it 
 and i found  thirty forty years ago someone had put up a balloon and it had gone around the earth multiple times and
 i thought why can 't we do that today  
 and that 's how this project got going cr but are you at the mercy of the wind lp yeah but it turns out 
 we did some weather simulations which probably hadn 't really been
  before  and if you control the altitude of the balloons which you can do by pumping air into them
 and other ways you can actually control roughly where they go and so i think we can build a worldwide mesh of these balloons
 that can cover the whole planet cr before i talk about the future and transportation where you 've been a nerd for a while  
  and this fascination you have with transportation and automated cars and bicycles  let me talk a bit about what 's been the subject here earlier
 with edward snowden it is security and privacy you have to have been thinking about that lp 
 yeah absolutely i saw the picture of sergey with edward snowden yesterday some of you may have seen
 it but i think for me i guess privacy and security are a really important thing 
 we think about it in terms of both things
 and i think you can 't have privacy without security so let me just talk about security first because you asked about snowden and
 all of that and then i 'll say a little bit about privacy  i think
 for me  it 's tremendously disappointing that the government secretly did all this stuff and didn 't tell us  i don 't think we can have a democracy
 if we 're having to protect you and our users from
  the government
 for stuff that we 've never had a conversation about  and i don 't mean we have to know
 what the particular terrorist attack is they 're worried about protecting us from but we do need to know
 what the parameters of it is what kind of surveillance the government 's going to do and how and why  
 and i think we haven 't had that conversation so i think the government 's actually done
 itself a tremendous disservice
  by doing all that in secret cr 
 never coming to google to ask for anything lp not google but the public  i think we need to have a debate about that 
 or we can 't have a functioning democracy it 's just not possible  so i 'm sad that google 's in the position of protecting you and our users
  and then
 there 's a privacy side of it lp yes the privacy side  i think it 's the world is changing you carry a phone it knows where you are 
 there 's so much more information about you and
 that 's an important thing and it makes sense why people are asking
  we spend a lot of time thinking about this
 and what the issues are i 'm a little bit
 i think the main thing that we need to do is just provide people choice show them what data 's being collected
 search history  location data we 're excited about incognito mode in chrome and doing that in more ways 
  people more choice and more awareness of what 's going on i also think
 it 's very easy what i 'm worried is that we throw out the baby with the bathwater  and i look at
 on your show actually i kind of lost my voice and i haven 't gotten it back i 'm hoping that by talking to you i 'm going to get it back
 and i got all this information we got a survey done on medical conditions with people who have similar issues  and
 i look at medical records and i say wouldn 't it be amazing if everyone 's medical records were available anonymously
 to research doctors  and when someone accesses your medical record a research doctor
 they could see you could see which doctor accessed it and why and you could maybe learn about
 what conditions you have i think if we just did that we 'd save one hundred thousand lives this year
 about the tremendous good that can come from people sharing information
 with the right people
 in the right ways cr
 and the necessary condition that people have to have confidence that their information will not be abused lp yeah and i had this problem with my voice stuff i was scared to share it  sergey encouraged me to do that 
  are super positive we got
 thousands and thousands of people with similar conditions which there 's no data on today 
 so it was a really good thing cr so talking about the future what is it about you and transportation systems lp 
 yeah i guess i was just
 frustrated with this when i was at college in michigan i had to get on the bus and take it and
 wait for it and it was cold and snowing
 i did some research on how much it cost and i just became a bit obsessed with transportation systems cr and
 that began the idea of an automated car lp yeah about eighteen years ago i learned about people working on
 automated cars and i became fascinated by that and it takes a while to get these projects going but
 i 'm super excited about the possibilities of that
 improving the world there 's
 twenty million people
 or more injured per year  it 's the leading cause of death for people under thirty four in the u s cr so you 're talking about saving lives lp yeah and also
 saving space and making life better  los angeles is half
 parking lots and roads  half of the area
  and most cities are not far behind actually it 's just crazy that that 's what we use our space for cr and how soon will we be there lp i
 think we can be there very very soon we 've driven
 well over one hundred thousand miles now totally automated
 i 'm super excited about
  you also have this idea for bicycles lp well
 at google we got this idea that
 we should just provide free bikes to everyone  and that 's been amazing most of the trips  you see bikes going everywhere and the bikes wear out
 is actually
 how you might separate bikes from cars with minimal cost 
 anyway it looks totally crazy but i was actually
  about our campus working with the zippies and stuff and just trying to get a lot more bike usage  and i was thinking about how do you
  cost effectively separate the bikes from traffic and i went and searched and this is what i found and we 're not actually working on this 
 that particular thing but it gets your imagination going cr let me close with this give me a sense of the philosophy of your own mind you have this idea of [ google
  you don 't simply want
 to go in some small measurable
 arena of progress lp yeah i think
 many of the things we just talked about are like that where they 're really i
 almost use the economic concept of additionality which means that you 're doing something
 that wouldn 't happen unless you were actually doing it  and
 i think the more you can do things like that the bigger impact you have
 and that 's about doing things that
 people might not think are possible  and i 've been amazed  the more i learn about technology  
 the more i realize i don 't know  and that 's because this technological horizon  
 the thing that you can see to do next  the more you learn about
  the more you learn what 's possible  you learn that the balloons are possible
 because there 's some material that will work for them cr what 's interesting about you too though for me is that we have lots of people who are thinking about the future 
 and they are going and looking and they 're coming back but we never see the implementation
 i think of somebody you knew and read about  tesla  the principle of that for you is
 what
  if you invent something tesla invented electric power that we use but he struggled to get it out to people
 that had to be done by other people it took a long time  and i think if we can actually combine both things where we have
 an innovation and invention focus  plus the ability to really a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people
 in a way that 's positive
  for the world
 and to give people hope you know i 'm amazed
 with the loon project just how excited people were about that because it gave them hope
 for the two thirds of the world that doesn 't have internet right now
 that 's any good cr which is a second thing about corporations you are one of those people who believe that corporations are an agent of change if they are run well
  most people think companies are basically evil they get a bad rap  and i think that 's somewhat correct companies are doing the same
 incremental thing that they did fifty years ago
 or twenty years ago that 's not really what we need we need
 especially in technology we need revolutionary change not
  you once said actually as i think i 've got this about right that you might consider rather than giving your money  if you were leaving it to some
 cause just simply giving it to elon musk  because you had confidence that he would change the future 
 and that you would therefore lp yeah if you want to go mars he wants to go to mars to back up humanity 
 that 's a worthy goal but it 's a company  and it 's
  so i think
 we aim to do kind of similar things and i think you ask we have a lot of employees at google
 who have become pretty wealthy  
 people make a lot of money in technology a lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy you 're working because you want to change the world you want to make it better
 why isn 't the company that you work for
 worthy not just of your time but your money as well  i mean but we don 't have a concept of that
 think about companies  and i think it 's sad because companies
 are most of our effort they
 're where most of people 's time is where a lot of the money is 
 and so i think i 'd like for us to help out more than we are cr when i close conversations with lots of people i always ask this question
  what state of mind  what quality of mind is it that has served you best people like rupert murdoch have said
  curiosity and other people in the media have said that  bill gates and warren buffett have said focus  what quality of mind  as i leave this audience has enabled you 
 to think about the future and at the same time change the present lp 
  don 't succeed over time  we 've had a more rapid turnover of companies and i said what did they fundamentally do wrong what
 did those companies all do wrong  and usually it 's just that they missed the future 
 and so i think 
 for me i just try to focus on that and say  what is that future really going to be and how do we create it and how do we
 cause our organization our organization to really focus on
  and drive that at a really high rate  and so that 's been curiosity it 's been
 looking at things people might not think about working on things that
 no one else is working on because that 's where the additionality really is 
 and be willing to do that to take that risk look at android i felt guilty
 working on android
 when it was starting it was a little startup we bought
 it wasn 't really what we were really working on and i felt guilty about spending time on that that was stupid  that was the future right that was a good thing
 to be working on cr it is great to see you here it 's great to hear from you and a pleasure to sit at this table with
