  i want you to imagine this for a moment 
 two men  rahul and rajiv living in the same neighborhood 
 from the same educational background  similar occupation  and they both turn up at their local accident emergency complaining of acute chest pain  
 rahul is offered
 a cardiac procedure  but rajiv is sent home 
 what might explain the difference in the experience of these two nearly identical men  
 rajiv suffers from a mental illness  
 the difference in the quality of medical care received by people with mental illness is one of the reasons why they live shorter lives than people without mental illness  even in the
  countries in the world  this life expectancy gap is as much as twenty years in the developing countries of the world  this gap is even larger  
 but of course mental illnesses can kill in more direct ways as well  the most obvious example is suicide 
 it might surprise some of you here as it did me when i discovered that suicide is at the top of the list of the leading causes of death in young people
 in all countries in the world including the poorest countries of the world  
 but beyond the impact of a health condition on life expectancy we 're also concerned about the quality of life lived now
 in order for us to examine the overall impact of a health condition both on life expectancy as well as on the quality of life lived  we need to use a metric called the daly  which stands for a
 now when we do that we discover some startling things about mental illness from a global perspective  
 we discover that for example mental illnesses are amongst the leading causes of disability around the world depression for example is the 
  of disability alongside conditions such
 diarrhea and pneumonia in children 
 when you put all the mental illnesses together they account for roughly fifteen percent of the total global burden of disease  
 indeed mental illnesses are also very damaging to people 's lives  but beyond
 just the burden of disease  let us consider the absolute numbers  
 the world health organization estimates that there are nearly four to five hundred million people living on
  tiny planet who are affected by a mental illness  now some of you here look a bit astonished by that number  
 but consider for a moment the incredible diversity of mental illnesses from autism and intellectual disability in childhood  through to depression and anxiety substance misuse and psychosis in adulthood all the way through to dementia in old age  and i 'm pretty sure
 that each and every one us present here today can think of at least one person
 at least one person who 's affected by mental illness in our most intimate social networks  
 i see some nodding heads there  
 but beyond the staggering numbers  what 's truly important from a global health point of view what 's truly worrying from a global health point of view
  is that the vast majority of these affected individuals do not receive the care that we know can transform their lives and remember  we do have robust evidence that a range of 
  interventions medicines  psychological interventions  and social interventions can make a vast difference and yet 
  an astonishing ninety percent 
 it isn 't surprising then that if you should speak to anyone affected by a mental illness  the chances are
 that you will hear stories of hidden suffering  shame and discrimination in nearly every sector of their lives  
 but perhaps most heartbreaking of all
 are the stories
 of the abuse of even the most basic human rights such as the young woman shown in this image here that are played out every day  
 sadly  even in the very institutions that were built to care for people with mental illnesses the mental hospitals 
 it 's this injustice that has really driven my mission to try to do a little bit
  to transform the lives of people affected by mental illness  and a particularly critical action that i focused on is to bridge the gulf
 between the knowledge we have that can transform lives the knowledge of effective treatments and how we actually use that knowledge
 in the everyday world  
 and an especially important challenge that i 've had to face is the great shortage of mental health professionals such as psychiatrists and psychologists particularly in
  now i trained in medicine in india 
 and after that i chose psychiatry as my specialty much to the dismay of my mother and all my family members who kind of thought neurosurgery would be a more respectable option for their brilliant son  
 any case i went on i soldiered on with psychiatry and found myself training in britain in some of the best hospitals in this country i was very privileged i worked in a team of incredibly
  but most importantly highly trained specialized mental health professionals  
 soon after my training i found myself working first in zimbabwe and then in india and i was confronted by an altogether new reality  
 this was a reality of a world in which there were almost no mental health professionals at all 
 in zimbabwe for example there were just about a dozen psychiatrists most of whom lived and worked in harare
  a couple to address the mental health care needs of nine million people living in the countryside 
 in india i found the situation was not a lot better to give you a perspective if i had to translate the proportion of psychiatrists in the population that one might see in britain to india  
 one might expect roughly one hundred and fifty thousand psychiatrists in india  
 in reality  take a guess the
 actual number is about three thousand about two
  percent of that number  
 it became quickly apparent to me that i couldn 't follow the sorts of mental health care models that i had been trained in one that relied heavily on specialized expensive mental health professionals to provide mental health care in countries like india and zimbabwe  
 i had to think out of the box about some other model of care 
 it was then that i came across these books  and in these books i discovered the idea
  of task shifting in global health 
 the idea is actually quite simple the idea is when you 're short of specialized health care professionals 
 use whoever is available in the community 
 train them to provide a range of health care interventions and in these books i read inspiring examples  for example of how ordinary people had been trained to deliver babies  
 diagnose and treat early pneumonia to great effect
 and it struck me that if you could train ordinary people to deliver such complex health care interventions then perhaps they could also do the same with mental health care 
 well today i 'm very pleased to report to you
 that there have been many experiments in task shifting in mental health care across the developing world over the past decade  and i want to share with you the findings of three particular such experiments all three of which focused on depression the most
  common of all mental illnesses 
 in rural uganda  paul bolton and his colleagues  using villagers  
 demonstrated that they could deliver interpersonal psychotherapy for depression
 and using a randomized control design showed that ninety percent of the people receiving this intervention recovered as compared to roughly forty percent in
  using a randomized control trial in rural pakistan  atif rahman and his colleagues showed that lady health visitors who are community maternal health workers in pakistan 
  's health care system could deliver cognitive behavior therapy for mothers who were depressed again showing dramatic differences in the recovery rates roughly seventy five percent of mothers recovered as compared to about forty five percent in the
  and in my own trial in goa in india  we again showed that lay counselors drawn from local communities could be trained to deliver psychosocial interventions for depression anxiety  leading 
  to seventy percent recovery rates as compared to fifty percent in the comparison primary health centers 
  i have coined this particular acronym sundar 
 what sundar stands for in hindi is attractive 
 it seems to me that there are five key lessons that i 've shown on this slide that are critically important for effective task shifting 
 the first is that we need to simplify the message that we 're using stripping away all the jargon that medicine has invented around itself 
 we need to unpack
  complex health care interventions into smaller components that can be more easily transferred to less trained individuals 
 we need to deliver health care not in large institutions but close to people 's homes and we need to deliver health care using whoever is available and affordable in our local communities  
 and importantly  we need to reallocate the few specialists who are
  task shifting is an idea with truly global significance 
 because even though it has arisen out of the situation of the lack of resources that you find in developing countries i think it has
 a lot of significance for better resourced countries as well  why is that 
 well in part  because health care in the developed world the health care costs in the [ developed ] world are rapidly spiraling out of control
  a huge chunk of those costs are human resource costs  
 but equally important is because health care has become so incredibly professionalized that it 's become very remote and removed from local communities 
 for me  what 's truly sundar about the idea of task shifting though isn 't that it simply makes health care more accessible and affordable
  but that it is also fundamentally empowering it empowers ordinary people
 to be more effective in caring for the health of others in their community  
 and in doing so to become better guardians of their own health  
 indeed for me task shifting is the ultimate example of the democratization of medical knowledge and therefore medical power 
 just over thirty years ago the nations of the world assembled at alma ata and made this iconic declaration
  i think all of you can guess that twelve years on we 're still nowhere near that goal 
 still today  
 armed with that knowledge that ordinary people in the community can be trained and with sufficient supervision and support can deliver a range of health care interventions effectively perhaps that promise is within reach now  
  to implement the slogan of health for all we will need to involve all in that particular journey  
 and in the case of mental health  in particular we would need to involve people who are affected by mental illness and their caregivers 
 it is for this reason that some years ago the movement for global mental health was founded as a sort of a virtual platform
 upon which professionals like myself and
  receive the care that we know can transform their lives
