  love a challenge and saving the earth is probably a good one 
 we all know the earth is in trouble  we have now entered in the 6x the sixth major extinction on this planet  
 i often wondered if there was a united organization of organisms otherwise known as
  every organism had had a right to vote would we be voted on the planet or off the planet  i think that vote is occurring right now  
 i want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions using fungi and these solutions are based
 on mycelium
  the mycelium infuses
  all landscapes it holds soils together it 's extremely tenacious this holds up to thirty thousand times its mass they 're
 the grand molecular disassemblers of nature the soil magicians  they generate the humus soils across the landmasses of earth
 we have now discovered that there is a  multi directional transfer of nutrients between plants mitigated by the mcyelium so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks cedars and douglas firs 
 dusty and i we
  like to say on sunday this is where we go to church i 'm in love with the old growth forest and i 'm a patriotic american because
 we have those 
 most of you are familiar with portobello mushrooms  and frankly i face a big obstacle when i mention mushrooms to somebody they immediately think portobellos or magic mushrooms their eyes glaze over and they think i 'm a little crazy 
 so i hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group
  we call it mycophobia  the irrational fear
 of the unknown  when it comes to fungi mushrooms are very fast in their growth day twenty one day twenty three day twenty five 
 mushrooms produce strong antibiotics in fact we 're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom a group of twenty eukaryotic microbiologists published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta
  that joins animalia and fungi together  
 we share in common the same pathogens fungi don 't like to rot from bacteria  and so our best antibiotics come
 come from fungi  but here is a mushroom that 's past its prime after they sporulate they do rot but i propose to you that the sequence of microbes
 that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest they give rise to the trees they create the debris fields that
  feed the mycelium  
 and so we see a mushroom here sporulating  
 and the spores are germinating  and the mycelium forms and goes underground 
 in a single cubic inch of soil there can be more than eight miles of these cells my foot is covering approximately three hundred miles of mycelium  
 this is
  from nick read and patrick hickey and notice that as the mycelium grows it conquers territory and then it begins the net  
 i 've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years i have thousands of electron micrographs  and when i 'm staring
 at the mycelium i realize that they are microfiltration membranes  we exhale carbon dioxide so does mycelium it inhales oxygen just like we do 
 but these are essentially externalized stomachs
 and lungs  and i
  to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes  and in these cavities these micro cavities form and as they fuse soils they absorb water these are little wells and inside these wells then microbial communities begin to form  
 and so the spongy soil not only resists erosion but sets up a microbial universe that gives rise to a plurality
 of other organisms
 i first proposed in the early  1990s that mycelium is earth 's natural internet when you look at the mycelium
 they 're highly branched and if there 's one branch that that is broken then very quickly because of the nodes of crossing internet engineers maybe call them hot points
  alternative pathways for channeling nutrients
 and information the mycelium is sentient  
 it knows that you are there when you walk across landscapes  it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab
 debris 
 so i believe the invention of the computer internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously
  biologically successful model the earth invented the computer internet for its own benefit  and we now being the top
 organism on this planet are trying to allocate resources in order to to protect the biosphere 
 going way out  dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype  
 i believe matter begets life life becomes single cells
  single cells become strings strings become chains chains network and this is the paradigm that we see throughout
 the universe 
 most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land they came to land one point three billion years ago 
 and plants followed several hundred million years later  how is that possible it
 's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids and many other acids and enzymes  pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other
  minerals and forming calcium oxalates  makes the rocks crumble  and the first step in the generation of soil  
 oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together 
 so fungi and mycelium sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates and all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering
 carbon dioxide through the minerals that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix
  this was first discovered in one thousand eight hundred and fifty nine this is a photograph by franz hueber  
 this photograph 's taken  1950s in saudi arabia  four hundred and twenty million years ago 
 this organism existed  it was called prototaxites 
 prototaxites laying down was about three feet tall  the tallest plants on earth at that time were less than two feet
  boyce at the university of chicago  published an article in the journal of geology this past year
 determining
 that prototaxites was a giant fungus a giant mushroom 
 across the landscapes of earth were dotted these giant mushrooms 
 all across most land masses  
 and these existed for tens of millions of years
  several extinction events  and as we march forward sixty five million years ago most of you know about it
 we had an asteroid impact the earth was struck by an asteroid a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere 
 sunlight was cut off and fungi inherited the earth 
 those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded  because fungi do not need light
  more recently at einstein university they just just determined
 that fungi use radiation as a as a source of energy much like plants use light 
 so the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere i think is a forgone conclusion at least in my own mind  
 the largest organism in the world
 is in eastern oregon
  two hundred acres in size two
 thousand two hundred acres in size two thousand years old the largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat one cell wall thick  
 how is it that this organism
 can be so large and yet be one cell wall thick  whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us 
 the mycelium in the right conditions produces a mushroom it bursts through with such ferocity
  show you six if i can solutions for helping to save the world  battelle laboratories and i joined up in bellingham washington there were four piles saturated
 with diesel and other petroleum waste one was a control pile one pile was treated with enzymes one pile
 was treated with bacteria  and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium  the mycelium absorbs the oil the mycelium is producing
  enzymes peroxidases that break carbon hydrogen bonds these are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together so the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil  
 and then when we returned six weeks later  
 all the tarps were removed all the other piles were dead dark and stinky  we came back to our pile it was covered with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms  and the color changed to a light form  
 the enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons
 into carbohydrates fungal sugars  
 some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms they 're very large they 're showing how much nutrition that they could 've obtained but something else happened which was an epiphany in my life  
 they sporulated the spores attract insects the insects laid eggs eggs
 became larvae  birds then came bringing in seeds and our pile became an oasis of life  whereas the other three piles were dead
  dark and stinky  and the pah 's the aromatic hydrocarbons went from ten thousand parts per million to less than two hundred in eight weeks 
 the last image we don 't have the entire pile was a green berm of life these are gateway species vanguard species that open the door
 for other biological communities 
 so i invented
 burlap sacks bunker spawn
 and putting the mycelium
 using storm blown debris 
 you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that 's producing  e coli or other wastes or a factory with chemical toxins and it leads to habitat restoration 
 so we set up a site in mason county washington  and we 've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms  and i 'll show you
  a graph here  this is a logarithmic scale ten to the eighth power there 's more than a one hundred million colonies per gram  
 and ten to the third power is around one thousand in forty eight hours to seventy two hours 
 these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria ten thousand times 
 think of the implications this is a space conservative method that uses storm debris and we can guarantee that we will have storms every
  this one mushroom in particular has drawn our interest over time  this is my wife dusty with a mushroom called fomitopsis officinalis  agarikon it
 's a mushroom exclusive to the old growth forest that dioscorides first described in sixty five a d as a treatment against consumption 
 this mushroom grows in washington state oregon northern california british columbia now thought to be extinct in europe may not seem that large
  is extremely rare fungus 
 our team and we have a team of experts that go out we went out twenty times in the old growth forest last year  we found one sample to be able to get into culture  
 preserving the genome of these fungi in the  old growth forest i think is absolutely critical for human health i
 've been involved with the u s defense department bioshield program  we submitted over three hundred samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites
  and a few years ago  we received these results  we have
 three different strains of agarikon mushrooms that were highly active against poxviruses 
 dr earl kern who 's a smallpox expert of the u s defense department states that any compounds that have a selectivity index of two or more are active ten or greater are considered to be very active
  our mushroom strains
  were in the highly active range there 's a vetted press release that you can read it 's vetted by dod if you
 google stamets and smallpox or you can go to npr org and listen to a live interview  
 so  encouraged by this naturally we went to flu viruses  
 and so for the first time i am showing this we have three different strains of agarikon mushrooms highly active against flu viruses here 's the selectivity index
  numbers against pox you saw 10s and  20s now against flu viruses compared to the ribavirin controls 
 we have an extraordinarily high activity and we 're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical 
 we tried it against flu a viruses
 as well as flu b viruses so then we tried
  i then think that we can make the argument that we should save the old growth forest as a matter of national defense 
 i became interested in entomopathogenic fungi fungi that kill insects
 our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants so i went to the epa homepage  and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants as well as termites  
 i did something that nobody else had done  i actually chased the mycelium  when it stopped stopped producing spores these are spores this is in their spores  i was able to morph the culture
  industry has spent over one hundred million dollars specifically on on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house 
 but the insects aren 't stupid and they would avoid the spores when they came close  and so i morphed the cultures into a non sporulating form  
 and i got my daughter 's barbie doll dish i put it right right where a bunch of carpenter ants were making debris fields every day  in my house  and the ants were
  to the mycelium because there 's no spores  they gave it to the queen one week later  i had no sawdust piles whatsoever  and then
 a delicate dance between
 dinner and death the mycelium is consumed by the ants  they become mummified and boing a mushroom pops out of their head 
 now after sporulation the spores repel
  of termites 
 and so my house came down  i received my first patent against carpenter ants termites and fire ants 
 then we tried extracts and lo and behold we can steer insects to different directions this has huge implications  
 i then received my second patent and this is a big one it 's been called an alexander graham bell patent it covers over
  hundred thousand species 
 this is the most disruptive technology i 've been told by executives of the pesticide industry that they have ever witnessed this could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world 
  you could fly one hundred ph d students under the umbrella of this concept because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi prior to sporulation attract the very insects that are otherwise repelled by those spores  
  i needed a delivery system  the life box you 're gonna be getting a dvd of the ted conference
 you add soil  you add water  
 you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores like of the agarikon mushroom the seeds then are mothered
 by this mycelium  
 and then you put tree seeds in here  and then you end up growing potentially an old growth forest from a cardboard box i want to reinvent the delivery system  and the use of
  cardboard around the world so they become ecological footprints if there 's a youtube like
 site that you could put up you could make it interactive zip code specific where people could join together  and through satellite imaging systems through virtual earth or google earth you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered by the trees that are coming through life boxes 
 you could take a cardboard box delivering shoes  you could add water i developed this for
  refugee community corns beans and squash and onions i took several containers my wife said if i could do this anybody could
 and i ended up growing a seed garden then you harvest the seeds
 and thank you eric rasmussen  for your help on this
 and then you 're harvesting the seed garden then you can harvest the kernels  and then you just need a few kernels i add mycelium to it  and then i inoculate the corncobs
  now three corncobs  no other grain lots of mushrooms begin to form  too many withdrawals from the carbon bank  
 and so this population will be shut down but watch what happens here 
 the mushrooms then are harvested  but
 very importantly the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars  and so i thought
 how could we address the energy crisis in this country  and we came up with econol
