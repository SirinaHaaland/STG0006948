  i 'm a neurosurgeon  
 and like most of my colleagues i have to deal  every day with human tragedies 
 i realize how your life can change from one second to the other
 after a major stroke
 or after
  a car accident  and what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons
 is to realize that
 unlike other organs of the body  the brain has very little ability for self repair 
 and after a major injury of your central nervous system the patients often remain with a severe handicap
  and that 's probably the reason why i 've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon 
 what is a functional neurosurgeon  it 's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function
 through different surgical strategies 
 you 've certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation where you implant an electrode in the depths
  of the brain
 in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function 
 it 's really an amazing technology
 in that it has improved the destiny of patients with parkinson 's disease with severe tremor with severe pain  
 however 
  and the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain  
 i think that we are approaching this dream and i would like to show you
 that we are very close to this  and that with a little bit of help the brain is able
 to help itself  so the story started fifteen
  years ago 
 at that time i was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room 
 i often had to take care of patients with head trauma  
 you have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma his brain is swelling
 and he 's increasing his intracranial
  and in order to save his life you have to decrease this intracranial pressure and to do that you sometimes have
 to remove a piece of swollen brain  
 so instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain we decided with 
  jean franois brunet  who is a colleague of mine a biologist to study them 
 what do i mean by that we wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue
  it 's not an easy task  
 growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family  
 so you need to find the right nutrients  the warmth the humidity and all the nice environments to make them thrive  
 so that 's exactly what we had to do with these cells  
 and after many attempts
  jean franois did it  and that 's what he saw under his microscope  
 and that was for us a major surprise why because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture 
 with large green cells surrounding small 
  and you may remember from biology class
 that stem cells are immature cells  able to turn into any type of cell of the body  
 the adult brain has stem cells but they 're very rare and they 're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain
  so it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture from the superficial part of swollen brain we had in the operating theater 
 and there was another intriguing observation 
 regular stem cells are very active cells cells that divide divide divide very quickly 
 and they never die they 're immortal cells 
 but these cells behave
  they divide slowly  and after a few weeks of culture they even died  
 so we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells
 but behaved differently  and it took us a long time to understand where they came from they come from
 these cells  these blue and red cells are called
  have them in your brain  
 they represent four percent of your cortical brain cells  
 they have a very important role during the development stage when you were fetuses  
 they helped your brain to fold itself 
 but why do they stay in your head this we don 't know  we think that they may participate
  brain repair because we find them in
 higher concentration close to brain lesions but it 's not so sure 
 but there is one clear thing that from these cells  we got our stem cell culture  
 and we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain  
 and we had to prove this so to prove it  we decided to design
  experimental paradigm  the idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a  non eloquent area of the brain  and then to culture the cells exactly the 
  way jean franois did it in his lab  and then label them to put color in them in order to be able to track them in the brain  
  autologous grafts autografts so the first question we had what will happen if we re implant these cells in a normal brain 
 and what will happen if we re implant the same cells in a lesioned brain thanks to the help
 of professor eric rouiller we worked with monkeys so in the
  the cells in the normal brain
 and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks as if
 they were taken from the brain  they go back home the space is already busy they are not needed there so they disappear 
 in the second case scenario  we performed the lesion we re implanted exactly the same
  and in this case  the cells remained
 and they became mature neurons  
 and that 's the image of what we could observe under the microscope  those are the cells that were re implanted 
 and the proof they carry these little spots  those are the cells that we 've labeled in vitro when they were in culture  
 could not stop here of course 
 do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion  so for that we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task 
 they had to retrieve food pellets from a tray 
 they were very good at it 
 and when they had reached a plateau of performance 
 we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion  so the monkeys were
  move their hand anymore 
 and exactly the same as humans would do 
 they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent exactly the same as after a stroke patients are completely  plegic and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism  
 they recover to a certain extent exactly the same for
  so when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery  we implanted his own cells  
 so on the left side you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered he
 's at about forty to fifty percent of his previous performance before the lesion he 's not so accurate
  i tell you since that
  we 've understood much more about these cells  we know that we can cryopreserve them we can use them later on  
 we know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models like parkinson 's disease for example but our dream is still to implant them in humans 
 and i really hope
 that i 'll be able to show you soon
 that the human
  sure that right now there are several dozen people in the audience possibly even a majority who are thinking i know somebody who can use this i do in any
 case and of course the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into
  human clinical trials jocelyne bloch the biggest obstacles are regulations 
 so from these exciting results you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials bg which is understandable the brain is delicate etc jb 
  but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it you know 
 bg if you project yourself having done the research and having tried to get permission
 to start the trials if you project yourself yourself out in time 
 how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available jb 
 so it 's very difficult to say it depends first on the approval of
  trial will the regulation allow us to do it soon  
 and then you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients  
 so it takes already a long time to select the patients do the the treatment and evaluate if it 's
 useful to do this kind of treatment and then you have to
 deploy this to a multicentric trial you have to really prove first
  first that it 's useful before offering this treatment up for everybody bg and safe of course jb of course bg jocelyne thank you for coming to ted and sharing this
