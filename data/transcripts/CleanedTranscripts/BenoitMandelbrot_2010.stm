  the topic i 'm going to discuss is one which is in a certain sense very peculiar because it 's very old roughness is part of human life forever
  forever and ancient authors have written about it  it was very much uncontrollable  and
 in a certain sense it seemed to be the extreme of complexity just a mess  a mess and a mess there are many different kinds of mess  now
  in fact  by a complete fluke  i got involved
 many years ago in a study of of this form of complexity and
 to my utter amazement  i found
 traces very strong traces i must say
 of order in that roughness  and so today  i would like to present to you a few examples of what
 this represents i prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity to someone who had latin
  means the contrary of regularity  but it is not so regularity is the contrary of roughness
 because the basic aspect of the world is very rough  
 so let me show you a few objects some of them are artificial  others of them are very real in a certain sense  
  it 's a cauliflower  now why do i show a cauliflower a very ordinary and ancient vegetable because
 old and ancient as it may be it 's very complicated
 and it 's very simple  both at the same time if you try to weigh it of course it 's very easy to weigh it and when you eat it the weight matters
 but suppose suppose you try
  one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it
 separately  you think of a whole cauliflower  but smaller  
 and then you cut again  again again again again again again again again and you still get small cauliflowers  
 so the experience of humanity has always been
 that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property that each part is
 like the whole  but smaller  
 now what did humanity do with that very very little so
 what i did actually is to is to study this problem and i found something quite
  quite surprising that one can measure roughness by a number a number 
 two point three one point two and sometimes much more  one day a friend of mine  to bug me  brought a picture and said what 
 is the roughness of this curve i said well  just short of one point five it was one point four eight 
  roughness of these surfaces i
 hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial they were
 done on a computer  and the only input is a number  and that number is roughness 
 so on the left  i took the roughness copied from many landscapes  to the right  
 i took a higher roughness  so the eye after a while can distinguish these two very well
 humanity had to learn about measuring roughness this is very rough and this is sort of smooth and this perfectly smooth  very few things are very smooth  
 so then if you try to
 to ask questions what 's the surface of a cauliflower well you measure and measure and measure each time you 're closer it gets bigger
  down to very very small distances  what 's the
 length of the coastline of these lakes  the closer you measure the longer it is 
 the concept of length of coastline 
 which seems to be so natural because it 's given in many cases is in fact  complete fallacy there 's no such thing
  you must do it differently what good is that to know these things  well  surprisingly
  's good in many ways  to begin with artificial landscapes which i
 invented sort of 
 are used in in cinema all the time we see mountains in the distance they may be mountains but they may be just formulae just cranked on now it 's very easy to do 
 it used to be very time consuming but now it 's nothing
 now look at that  that 's a real lung  now a lung is something very strange
  if you take this thing you know very well it weighs very little  the volume of a lung is very small but what about the area of the lung  
 anatomists were arguing very much about that some say that a normal male 's
 lung has an area of the inside of a basketball [ court ] and the others say no five basketball [ courts ] enormous disagreements
  and they stop branching not because of of any matter of principle but because of physical
 considerations  the mucus  which is in the lung  so what happens is that in a way you have a much
  branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale for a man and for a little rodent 
 now what good is it to have that  well surprisingly enough  amazingly enough  
 the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently  
 and i think that my mathematics  
 surprisingly enough  has been of great
  to the surgeons studying lung illnesses
 and also kidney illnesses all these branching systems for which there was no geometry  so i found myself in other words  
 constructing a geometry  a geometry of things which had no geometry 
 and a surprising aspect of it is that very often the rules of this geometry are extremely
  you get things like that this cloud is completely one hundred percent artificial
  point nine  and the only part which is natural is a number the roughness of the cloud  which is taken from nature something so
  so unstable so varying should have a simple rule behind it  now this simple rule
 is not an explanation of clouds  the seer of clouds had to take account of it i don 't know
 how much advanced these pictures are they 're old i was very much involved in it but then turned my attention to
  here is another thing which is rather
 interesting one of the shattering events in the history of mathematics  which is not appreciated by many people occurred
 about one hundred and thirty years ago one hundred and forty five years ago  mathematicians began to create shapes that didn 't exist  mathematicians got into into
 self praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing that man can invent things that nature did not know
  in particular  it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane 
 a curve 's a curve  a plane 's a plane and the two won 't mix  well they do mix  
 a man named peano
 did define such curves  and
 it became an object of extraordinary interest it was very important but mostly
  mostly interesting because a kind of break a separation between
 the mathematics coming from reality on the one hand and new mathematics coming from pure
 man 's mind well  i was very sorry to point out that the pure man 's mind has  in fact  
 seen at long last what had been seen for a long time and so here i introduce something the set of
  an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world  
 and the objects which were used as examples when i was a child and and a student as examples of the break between mathematics
 and visible reality
 completely around  i used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature  
 well a man named hausdorff in one thousand nine hundred and nineteen introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke  and i found that this number was a good measurement of roughness when
 i first told it to my friends in mathematics they said
  the things on the ground are algae he did not know the mathematics it didn 't yet exist  and he was japanese who had no contact with the west  but
 painting for a long time had a fractal side i could speak of that for a long time  the eiffel tower has a fractal aspect
 i read the book that mr eiffel wrote about his tower and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood  this is a mess mess mess
  loop  one day i decided halfway through my career i was held by so many things
 in my work i decided to test myself  could i just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time
 and find something dramatically new  well  so i looked
  i played with it for a while and i made it return to the origin then i was telling my assistant i don 't see anything can you paint it so he painted it  which means he put inside everything
  measured it  one point three three again again again  long measurements big brownian 
 mathematical problem how to prove it  it took my friends twenty years three of them
 were having incomplete proofs  they got together and together they had the proof 
  medal in mathematics  one of the three medals that people
 have received for proving things which i 've seen without being able to prove them 
 now everybody asks me at one point or another how did it all start what got you in that
 strange business what got you to be at the same time  a mechanical engineer  
 a geographer and a mathematician and so on a physicist well actually i started
  oddly enough  studying stock market prices  and so here i had this this theory  and
 i wrote books about it
 financial prices increments to the left you see data over a long period to the right on top you see a theory which is very very fashionable it was very easy and you can write many books very fast about it
  of books on that  now
 compare that with real price increments where are real price increments  well these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which i did  
 so the idea there was that one must be able to to how do you say  
 model price variation and it went really well fifty years ago for fifty years
  sort of pooh poohing me because they could do it much much easier but i tell you at this point people listened to me 
 laughter these two curves are averages  standard  & poor the blue one  and the red one is standard & poor 's from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out  
 now discontinuities are a nuisance
  one puts them aside well  acts of god  and you have
 the little nonsense which is left  acts of god in this picture  five acts of god are as important as everything else  
 in other words  it is not acts of god that we should put aside that is the meat the problem  if you
 master
  you master price  and if you don 't master these you can master the little noise
 as well as you can but it 's not important well here are the curves for it  now i get to the final thing which is the set of which my name is attached  in
 a way it 's the story of my life my adolescence was spent during the german occupation of france since i thought that i might
 vanish within a day or a
  had very big dreams  and
 after the war
  i saw an uncle again  my uncle was a very prominent mathematician and he told me look there 's a problem which i could not solve twenty five years ago  
 and which nobody can solve this is a construction of a man named [ gaston ] julia and [ pierre ] fatou if you could
 find something new anything you will get your
  so i looked  and like the thousands of people that had tried before i found nothing  but then the computer came  and
 i decided to to apply the computer not to new problems in mathematics like this wiggle wiggle that 's a new problem but to old problems  
 and i went from what 's called real numbers which are points on a line 
  which is what one should do there  and this shape came out  this shape is of an extraordinary complication  
 the equation is hidden there z goes into z squared plus c it 's so simple so dry it 's so
  don 't want to explain these things this comes out  this comes out shapes which are of such complication  such harmony and such beauty  
 this comes out
 repeatedly again again again  
 and that was one of my major discoveries to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing more or less  
 and then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place
  that from this little formula which has whatever five symbols in it  
 and then this one the color was added for two reasons first of all because these shapes are so complicated
 that
 one couldn 't make any sense of the numbers  and if you plot them you must choose some system  and so
 my principle has been to always present the
 with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that and others it is that or that  it 's so complicated in one thousand nine hundred
 and ninety i was in cambridge u k to receive a prize
 from the university  and three days later  a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing  
  so the newspaper in cambridge published an article about that discovery and received the next day five thousand letters from people saying but that 's simply a mandelbrot set
 very big 
 well  let me finish  this shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics  bottomless wonders spring from simple rules  
 which are repeated
  without end  thank you very much
