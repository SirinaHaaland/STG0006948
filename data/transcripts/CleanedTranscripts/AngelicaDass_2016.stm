  it has been one hundred and twenty eight years since the last country in the world abolished slavery
 and fifty three years since martin luther king pronounced his i have a dream
  we still live in a world
 where the color of our skin
 not only gives a first impression  but a lasting one that remains  
 i was born in a family full of colors  my father
 is the son of a maid from whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate
  tone 
 he was adopted by those who i know as my grandparents the matriarch my grandma  has a porcelain skin
 hair  my grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone  like my uncle and
  of a native brazilian with a pinch of hazel and honey 
 and a man [ who is ] a mix of coffee with milk but with a lot of coffee 
 she has two sisters one in a toasted peanut skin and the other  
 also adopted more on the beige side like a pancake
  growing up in this family color was never important for me  
 outside home however  things were different soon 
 color had many other meanings  i remember
 my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contradictory feelings it was exciting
 and creative but i never understood the unique
 i was made of flesh but i wasn 't pink  my skin was brown and people said i was black  
 i was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head 
  when i took my cousin to school i was usually taken for the nanny 
 by helping in the kitchen at a friend 's party people thought i was the maid 
 i was even treated like a prostitute
 just because i was walking alone on the beach with european friends and many times  visiting my grandma or
  i was invited not to use the main elevator because
 in the end with this color and this hair  i cannot belong to some places 
 in some way  i get to used to it and accept part of it 
 however  something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling 
 years later
  married a spaniard  but not any spaniard  i chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt 
 since then a new question started to chase me  what will be the color of your children 
 as you can understand this is my last
  thinking about it 
 with my previous background  my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer  
 and that is how humanae was born
  a pursuit to highlight our true colors  rather than the untrue white  red black
 or yellow associated with race it 's a kind of game to question
  question our codes it 's a work in progress from a personal story to a global history  
 i portray the subjects in a white background  then i choose
  square from the nose  paint the background  and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette pantone
  i started with my family and friends then
 more and more people joined the adventure thanks to public calls coming through the social media  
 i thought that the main space to show my work was the internet
 because i want an open concept that invites everybody to push the share button in both the computer
  and their brain 
 the snowball started to roll the project had a great welcome
 invitations exhibitions  physical formats  galleries and museums  just happened
  when humanae occupies public spaces
 and appears in the street it fosters a popular debate
 and creates a feeling of community  
 i have portrayed more than three thousand people
  nineteen different cities around the world just to mention some of them
 from someone included in the forbes list to refugees who crossed the mediterranean by boat 
 in paris from the unesco headquarters to a shelter 
 and students both in switzerland and favelas in rio de janeiro  
  all kinds of beliefs gender identities or physical impairments 
 a newborn or terminally ill  we all together build humanae 
 those portraits make us rethink how we see each other 
 when modern science is questioning the race concept  what does it mean for us
  is it the eye the nose the mouth the hair  
 or does it have to do with our origin nationality or bank account 
 this personal exercise turned out to be a discovery suddenly
  that humanae was useful for many people 
 it represents a sort of mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label 
 it was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me  
 i have hundreds of that i will share with you too 
 a mother of eleven years
  very good for me as a tool to work on her confidence as this past weekend
 one of her girlfriends argued with her that she does not belong and should not be allowed to live in norway  
 so your work has a very special place in my heart and it 's very important
  woman shared her portrait on facebook and wrote all my life people from across the globe
 had difficulties to place me in a group a stereotype a box  
 perhaps we should stop instead of framing  ask the individual ' how would you label yourself
  i grew up in a mixed family and i 'm a bisexual woman ' 
 besides these unexpected and touching reactions
  new life in a different variety of fields just to show you some examples  
 illustrators and art students using it as a reference for their sketches
  's a collection of faces  
 researchers in the fields of anthropology physics and neuroscience use humanae with different scientific approaches related to human ethnicity
 face recognition or
  one of the most important impacts of the project
 is that humanae was chosen to be the cover of foreign affairs  one of the most relevant political publications 
 and talking about foreign affairs  i found the perfect ambassadors for my project 
 teachers  they are the ones that use humanae
 their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes  but this time as a teacher myself 
 my students both adults and kids
  as a photographer  i realize
 that i can be a channel
 for others to communicate as an individual as anglica 
 every time i take a picture i feel
 that i am sitting in front of a therapist all the
  frustration  fear and loneliness that i once felt  becomes love 
 the last country
 the last country in the world who abolished slavery is the country where i was born
  have to work hard to abolish discrimination 
 that remains a common practice worldwide and that will not disappear by itself  thank you
