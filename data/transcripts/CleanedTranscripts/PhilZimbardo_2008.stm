  theologians have grappled with this question for centuries  what makes people go wrong  interestingly  i asked this question when i was a little kid  i grew up in the south bronx inner city ghetto in new york and
 i was surrounded by evil as all kids are who grew up in an inner city
 and i had friends who were really good kids
 who lived out the dr jekyll mr hyde scenario robert louis stevenson  that is they took drugs got in trouble went to jail some got killed 
 and some did it without drug assistance so when i read robert louis stevenson  that wasn 't fiction the only question is what was in the juice and more
  that line between good and evil which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable with them on the good side the others on the bad side i knew that line was movable  and it was permeable 
 good people could be seduced across that line and under good and some rare circumstances bad kids could recover
 with help with reform with rehabilitation  so i want to begin with this wonderful this wonderful illusion by
  if you look at it and focus on the white what you see is a world full of angels but let 's look more deeply  and as we do what appears is the demons the devils in the world 
 that tells us several things one the world is was will always be filled with good and evil  because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition it tells me something else if you remember god 's favorite angel was lucifer 
 apparently
  it also means the morning star in some scripture and apparently he
 disobeyed god  and that 's the ultimate disobedience to authority  and when he did 
 michael the archangel was sent to kick him out of heaven along with the other fallen angels  
 and so lucifer descends into hell becomes satan becomes the devil and the force of evil in the universe begins paradoxically it was god who created hell
 as a place to store evil  he didn
  of keeping it there though  so this arc of the cosmic transformation of god 's favorite angel into the devil 
 for me sets the context for understanding human beings who are transformed from good ordinary people into perpetrators of evil  
 so the lucifer effect although it focuses on the negatives
 the negatives that people can become not the negatives that people are
 leads me to a
  psychological definition evil is the exercise of power and that 's the key it 's about power to intentionally harm people psychologically
 to hurt people physically to destroy people mortally or ideas  and to commit crimes against humanity  
 if you google evil a word that should surely have withered by now  you come up with
  million hits in a third of a second 
 a few years ago i am sure all of you were shocked as i was with the revelation of american soldiers abusing
 prisoners in a strange place in a controversial war abu ghraib in iraq and these were men and women who were putting prisoners through
 unbelievable humiliation i was shocked but i wasn 't surprised because i had seen those same visual parallels when i was the prison superintendent of the stanford prison study
  immediately the bush administration military said what  what all administrations say when there 's a scandal don 't blame us it 's not the system it 's the few bad apples the few rogue soldiers 
 my hypothesis is  american soldiers are good usually maybe it was the barrel that was bad 
 but how am i going to deal with that hypothesis i became an expert witness for one of the guards sergeant chip frederick and in that position i had access to the dozen investigative
  reports  i had access to him  i could study him have him come to my home get to know him do psychological analysis to see was he a good apple or bad apple 
 and thirdly i had access to all of the one thousand pictures that these soldiers took 
 these pictures are of a violent or sexual nature all of them come from the cameras of american
  because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera  they took pictures of everything more than one thousand and
 what i 've done is i organized them into various categories but these are by united states military police army reservists  
 they are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all 
 and it all happened in a single place tier 1 a on the night shift why tier 1 a was the center for military
  it was the interrogation hold the
 cia was there interrogators from titan corporation all there 
 and they 're getting no information about the insurgency  so they 're going to put pressure on these soldiers military police to cross the line 
 give them permission to break the will of the enemy  to prepare them for interrogation to soften them up to take the gloves off those are the euphemisms  
 and this is how it was interpreted 
 down to that dungeon
  by
  one of the
 visual
 illustrations of evil  and it should not have escaped you that that the reason i paired the prisoner with his arms out with leonardo da vinci 's ode to humanity
 is that that prisoner was mentally ill that prisoner covered himself with shit every day  they had to roll him in dirt so he wouldn 't stink
 but the guards ended up calling him shit boy what was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution 
 in any event here 's former secretary of defense rumsfeld he comes down and says i want to know who is responsible  who are the bad  apples well
 that 's a bad question you have to reframe it and ask what is responsible what could be the who of
  but it could also be the what of the situation and obviously that 's wrongheaded
 how do psychologists try to understand such transformations of human character if you believe that they were good soldiers before they went down to that dungeon  there are three ways  the main way is called dispositional we look at what 's inside of the person the bad apples 
 this is the foundation of all of social science the foundation of religion the foundation of war
 social psychologists like me come along and say yeah people are the actors on the stage but you 'll have
  to be aware of the situation  who are the cast of characters  what 's the costume is there a stage director and so we 're interested in what are the external factors around the individual the bad barrel
 social scientists stop there and they miss the big point that i discovered when i became an expert witness for abu ghraib 
 the power is in the system the system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals and the system is the legal political
  cultural background  
 and this is where the power is of the bad barrel makers  if you want to change a person change the situation and to change it you 've got to know where the power is in the system 
 so the lucifer effect involves understanding human character transformations
 with these three factors  and it 's a dynamic interplay  what do the
 people bring into the situation  what does the situation bring out of them and what is the system that creates and maintains that situation  
 my recent book the lucifer effect is about how do you understand how good people turn evil and it has
 a lot of detail about what i 'm going to talk about today so dr z 's 
 lucifer effect although it focuses on evil  really is a celebration of the human mind 's infinite capacity
 to make any of us kind or
  creative or destructive and it makes some of us villains  and the good news that i 'm going to hopefully come to at the end is that it makes some of us heroes 
 this wonderful cartoon in the new yorker summarizes my whole talk i 'm neither a good cop nor a bad cop jerome like yourself i 'm a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not depending on the circumstances
  there 's a study some of you think you know about but very few people have ever read the story you watched the movie 
 this is stanley milgram little jewish kid from the bronx and he asked the question could the holocaust happen here now
 one thousand ordinary people five hundred new haven connecticut five hundred bridgeport  and the ad said 
 psychologists want to understand memory  we want to improve people 's memory  because it is the key to success ok we
 're going to give you five bucks four dollars for your time  we don 't want college
  we want men between twenty and fifty in the later studies they ran women ordinary people barbers clerks white collar people so you go down
 one of you will be a learner one will be a teacher the learner 's a genial middle aged guy he gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room the learner
 could be middle aged could be as young as twenty 
 and one of you is told by the authority the guy in the lab coat your job as teacher is to give him material to learn gets it right reward gets it wrong  you press a button on the shock box
  button is fifteen volts  he doesn 't even feel it that
 's the key 
 all evil starts with fifteen volts  and then the next step is another fifteen volts  the problem is at the end of the line it 's four hundred and fifty volts  
 and as you go along the guy is screaming i 've got a heart condition i 'm out of here
  the question is  
 who would go all the way to four hundred and fifty volts
  you should notice here when it gets up to three hundred and seventy five it says danger severe shock when it gets up to here there 's xxx the pornography of power  
 so milgram asks forty psychiatrists what percent of american citizens would go to the end they said only one percent because that 's sadistic behavior
  and we know psychiatry knows only one percent of americans are sadistic  ok  
 here 's the data  
 they could not be more wrong two thirds go all the way to four hundred and fifty volts  this was just one study milgram did more than sixteen studies  and look at this
 in study sixteen where you see somebody like you go all the way  ninety percent go all the way  in study five if you see people rebel  ninety
  what about women study thirteen no different than men so milgram is quantifying evil
 as the willingness of people to blindly obey authority to go all the way to four hundred and fifty volts  
 and it 's like a dial on human nature a dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient 
 down to the
 majority down to none what are the external parallels for all research is artificial what 's the validity in the
  nine hundred and twelve american citizens committed suicide or were murdered by family and friends in guyana jungle in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight because they were blindly obedient to this guy their pastor not their priest their pastor 
 reverend jim jones  he persuaded them to commit mass suicide  
 and so he 's the modern lucifer effect a man of god
 who becomes the angel of death  milgram 's study is all about individual authority
 to control people most of the time we are in institutions
 so the stanford prison study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior  interestingly  stanley milgram and i were in the same high school class
 in james monroe in the bronx 
  i did this study with my graduate students especially craig haney and it also began work with an ad we had a cheap little ad  but we wanted college students for a study of prison life
  personality tests we did interviews picked two dozen the most normal the most healthy 
 randomly assigned them to be prisoner and guard so on day one we knew we had good apples  i 'm going to put them in a bad situation 
 and secondly we know there 's no difference between the boys who will be guards
 we didn 't tell them that the city police were going to come and do realistic arrests
  cop comes to the front door and knocks and says he 's looking for me so they right there you know they took me out the door they put my hands against
  was a real cop car it was a real policeman and there were real neighbors in the street who didn 't know that this was an
 experiment  and there was cameras all around and neighbors all around they put me in the car then they drove me around palo alto  
 they took me to 
 the basement of the police station 
  then they put me in a cell i was the first one to be picked up so they put me in a cell which was just like a room
 with a door with bars on it you could tell it wasn 't a real jail  they locked me in there  in this
 degrading little outfit  
 they were taking this experiment too seriously  here are the prisoners who are going to be dehumanized they 'll become numbers  here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity
  guards get prisoners to clean the toilet bowls out
  hands to do other humiliating tasks they strip them naked they sexually taunt them  they begin to do degrading activities like having them simulate sodomy you saw simulating fellatio
 in soldiers in abu ghraib  my guards did it in five days  the stress reaction was so extreme that normal kids we picked because they were healthy had breakdowns within thirty six hours
  the study ended after six days because it was out of control five kids had emotional breakdowns 
 does it make a difference if warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not if they 're anonymous how do they treat their victims
 in some cultures they go to war without changing their appearance in others they paint themselves like lord of the flies in some they wear masks in many soldiers are anonymous in uniform 
 so this
  that had two bits of data  do they change their appearance  fifteen do they kill torture mutilate thirteen 
 if they don 't change their appearance only one of eight kills tortures or mutilates the key is in the red zone  if they change their appearance  twelve of thirteen that 's ninety percent kill  torture mutilate  
 and that 's the power of anonymity  so what are the seven social processes that grease the slippery slope of evil
  mindlessly taking the first small step dehumanization of others de individuation of self diffusion of personal responsibility blind obedience to authority  uncritical conformity to group norms 
 passive tolerance of evil through inaction or indifference and it happens when you 're in a new or unfamiliar situation your habitual response patterns don 't work your personality and morality are disengaged 
  psychology is not excuse ology 
 so social and psychological research reveals how ordinary good people can be transformed without the drugs  you don 't need it you just need the social psychological processes 
 real world parallels  compare this
 with this 
 james schlesinger i 'm going to end with this says psychologists have attempted to understand how and why individuals and groups who usually act humanely can sometimes act
  otherwise in certain circumstances that 's the lucifer effect and he goes on to say 
 the landmark stanford study provides a cautionary tale for all military operations if you give people power without oversight  it 's a prescription for abuse  they knew that and let that happen 
 so another report an investigative report by general fay says the system is guilty in this report he says it was the environment that created abu ghraib
 by leadership failures that contributed to the occurrence of such abuse  and because it remained undiscovered by higher authorities for a long period of time 
 those abuses went on for three months  who was watching the store the answer is nobody i think on purpose he gave the guards permission to do those things and they knew nobody was ever going to come down to that dungeon  
 so you need a paradigm shift in all of these areas  the shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual
 the shift is toward a public health model that recognizes situational and systemic vectors of disease  
 bullying is a disease  prejudice is a disease violence is a disease since the inquisition we 've been dealing with problems at the individual level  it doesn 't work 
 aleksandr solzhenitsyn says the line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being
  that means that line is not out there  that 's a decision that you have to make a personal thing  
 so i want to end very quickly on a positive note heroism as the antidote to evil  
 by promoting the heroic imagination especially in our kids in our educational system  we want kids to think i 'm a hero in waiting  waiting for the right situation to come along and i will act heroically 
 my whole life i 'm now going to focus away from evil that i 've been in since i was a kid
  it 's ordinary people who do heroic deeds  it 's the counterpoint to hannah arendt 's banality of evil our traditional societal heroes are wrong because they they are the exceptions they organize their life around this that 's why we know their names
 our kids ' heroes are also wrong models for them because they have supernatural talents  we want our kids to realize most heroes are everyday people  and the heroic act is unusual
  this is joe darby  he was the one that stopped those abuses you saw because when he saw those images he turned them over to a senior investigating officer  he was a low level private  and that stopped it 
 was he a hero no they had to put
 him in hiding  because people wanted to kill him  and then his mother and his wife for three years they were in hiding 
 this is the woman who stopped the stanford prison study  
 when i said it got out of control i was the prison superintendent i didn 't know it was out of control i was totally indifferent  she saw that madhouse and said you know what
 's terrible what you 're doing to those boys they 're not prisoners nor guards they 're boys  and you are responsible and i ended the study the next day 
 the good news is i married her the next year 
 i just came to my senses obviously so situations have the power to do
 things ] but the point is this is the same situation
 that can inflame the hostile imagination in some of us that makes us perpetrators of evil  can inspire the heroic imagination in others  it 's the same situation and you 're on one side or the other 
 most people are guilty of the evil of inaction because your mother said don 't get involved
  mind your own business and you have to say mama  
  psychology of heroism is we 're going to end in a moment
 how do we encourage children in new hero hero courses that i 'm working on with matt langdon he has a hero workshop to develop this heroic imagination 
 i am a hero in waiting and teach them skills to be a hero you have to learn to be a deviant  because you 're always going against the conformity of the group 
 heroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary who act the key to heroism is two things you have to act when other people are passive
  you have to act socio centrically not egocentrically  and i want to end with a known story about wesley autrey new york subway hero
  construction worker standing on a subway a white guy falls on the tracks  the subway train is coming
 there 's seventy five people there you know what they freeze he 's got a reason not to get involved he 's black the guy 's white  and he 's got two
  gives his kids to a stranger  jumps on the tracks  puts the guy between the tracks lays on him  the subway goes over him  
 wesley and the guy twenty and a half inches height  the train clearance is twenty one inches a
 half an inch would have taken his head off  
 and he said 
 i did what anyone could do no big deal to jump on the tracks  and the moral imperative is i did what everyone should do and so one day you will be in a new situation
  take path one you 're going to be a perpetrator of evil
  meaning you 're going to be arthur andersen you 're going to cheat or you 're going to
 allow bullying path two you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction  path three you become a hero 
 the point is are we ready to take the path to celebrating ordinary heroes  waiting for the right situation to come along to put heroic imagination into action 
 because it may only happen once in your life and when you pass it by you 'll always know i could have been a hero and i let it pass me
  by  so the point is thinking it and then doing it so
 i want to thank you thank you let 's oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad  and let 's focus on the positive advocate for respect of personal dignity for justice and peace which sadly our administration has not been doing thanks so much
