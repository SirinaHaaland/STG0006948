  my name is amit  and eighteen months ago  i had another job at google  and i pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art
 to my boss who 's actually here  and she allowed me to do it  and it took eighteen months a lot of fun negotiations and
  stories i can tell you with seventeen very interesting museums from nine countries but i 'm going to focus on the demo there are
 a lot of stories about why we did this i think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide and it 's access  and
 i grew up in india i
 had a great education i 'm not complaining but i didn 't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks  and so when i started traveling and going to these
  museums i started learning a lot and while working at google  i tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together  
 so we formed a team a great team of people and we started doing this i 'm going to probably get into the demo and then
 tell you a couple of the interesting things we 've had since launch
  look around at all these museums here  you 've got the uffizi you 've got the moma  the hermitage the rijks the van gogh i
 'm going to actually get to one of my favorites  the metropolitan museum of art in new york  
 two ways of going in very simple click
 and bang you 're in this museum it doesn 't matter where you are bombay  mexico it doesn 't really matter you move around you have fun  you want to navigate around the museum
  the plan up and in one click jump 
 you 're in there you want to go to the end of the corridor  keep going have fun 
 thanks i haven 't come to the best part 
 so now i 'm in front of one of my favorite paintings the harvesters by pieter bruegel at the met
  this plus sign if the museum has given us the image  you click on it 
 now this is one of the images so this is all of the meta data information for those of you who are truly interested in art you can click this but i 'm going to click this off right now 
 and this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology so
 this image for example has close to i think around ten billion pixels
 i get a lot of people asking me 
 what do you get for ten billion pixels so i 'm going to try and show you what you really get for ten billion pixels  you can zoom around very simply you see some fun stuff happening here
 i love this guy  his expression is priceless
 but then you really want to go deep  and so i started playing around  and i found something going on over here and i was like 
 hold on that sounds interesting 
  and i started noticing that these kids were actually beating something 
 i did a little research spoke to a couple of my contacts at the met  and actually found out that this is a game called squall  which involves beating a goose with a stick 
 on shrove tuesday  and apparently it was quite popular i don 't know why they did it but i learned something about it  
  i 'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get here
 is where we were  and this
 is the painting 
 the best is yet to come so in a second 
 so now let 's just quickly jump into the moma  again in new
  another one of my favorites the starry night now the example i showed you was all about finding details  but what if you want to see brush strokes and what if you want to see
 how van gogh actually created this masterpiece you zoom in you really go in i 'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting  and i 'm really going to get to the cracks 
 this is the starry night i think  never seen like this before 
 i 'm going to show you my other favorite feature there 's a lot of other stuff here but i don 't have time 
 this is the real cool
  part it 's called collections any one of you anybody doesn 't matter if you 're rich if you 're poor  if you have
 a fancy house doesn 't matter you can go and create your own museum online create your own collection across all these images very simply  you go in
 and i 've created this called the power of zoom you can just zoom around this is the ambassadors
  based in the national gallery  you can annotate the stuff send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you 're feeling when you go through these masterpieces  
 so i think in conclusion  
 for me the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google  it doesn 't in my opinion even come from the museums i probably shouldn 't say that
 it really comes from these artists  and
 that 's been my
  humbling experience in this i mean i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online and the biggest question i get asked nowadays
 is did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum and the answer is no it 's to supplement the experience and that 's it
