  i just met you on a bus 
 and we would really like to get to know each other but i 've got to get off at the next stop  
 so you 're going to tell me three things about yourself
 that just define you as a person
  three things about yourself that will help me understand who you are three things that just get to your very essence 
 and what i 'm wondering
 is of those three things is any one of them
 surviving some kind of trauma 
 cancer survivor
 rape survivor  holocaust survivor  incest survivor  
 ever notice how we tend to identify ourselves by our wounds and where i have seen this
 survivor identity have the most consequences is in the cancer community and i 've been around this
  community for a long time because i 've been a hospice and a hospital chaplain for almost thirty years 
 and in two thousand and five i was working at a big cancer center
 when i received the news that my mother had breast cancer 
 and then five days later i received the news
 that i had breast cancer
 my mother and i can be competitive 
 laughter but
 i was really not trying to compete with her on this one  
 and in fact i thought well if you have to have cancer it
 's pretty convenient to be working at a place that treats it but this is what i heard from a lot of outraged people what 
 you 're the chaplain you should be
  immune like  maybe i should have just gotten off with a warning instead of an actual ticket because i 'm on the force  
 so i did get my treatment at the cancer center where i worked which was amazingly convenient 
 and i had chemotherapy and a mastectomy and a saline implant put in and so before i say another word let me just say right now this is the fake one
 laughter i have found that i need to get that out of the way  because i 'll see somebody go
  medicine most of it is about feelings and faith and losing and finding your identity
 and discovering strength and flexibility you never even knew you had 
 it 's about realizing that the most important things in life are
 not things
  and it 's about laughing in the face of uncertainty
 and learning that the way to get out of almost anything is to say i have cancer 
 so the other thing i learned was that i don 't have to take on cancer survivor as my identity 
 but boy are there powerful
 forces pushing me to do just that now don 't
 please misunderstand me 
 cancer organizations and the drive for early screening and cancer awareness and cancer research have normalized cancer 
 and this is a wonderful thing we can now talk about cancer without whispering  
 we can talk about cancer and we can support
  but sometimes it feels like people go a little overboard and they start telling us how we 're going to feel  
 so about a week after my surgery we had a houseguest 
 that was probably our first mistake and keep in mind that at this point in my life i had been a chaplain for
 over twenty years and issues like dying and death
  death and the meaning of life  these are all things i 'd been yakking about forever  
 so at dinner that night our houseguest proceeds to stretch his arms up over his head and say you know deb 
 now
 you 're really going to learn what 's important yes you are going to make some big changes in your
  you 're going to start thinking about your death yep this cancer is your wakeup call 
 now these are golden words coming from someone who is speaking about their own experience  
 but when someone is telling you how you are going to feel  
 it 's instant crap 
 the only reason i did not kill him with my bare hands was because i could
  not lift my right arm  
 but i did say
 a really bad word to him  followed by a regular word that 
 made my husband say she 's on narcotics 
 and then after my treatment it just felt like everyone
  was telling me what my experience was going to mean oh this means you 're going to be doing the walk oh this means you 're coming to the luncheon this means you 're going to be wearing the pink ribbon and the pink  t shirt
 and the headband and the earrings and the bracelet and the panties 
 panties no seriously google it 
 how is that raising awareness only my husband
  he 's pretty aware of cancer already 
 it was at that point where i felt like oh my god this is just taking over my life 
 and that 's when i told myself claim your experience  don 't let it claim you  
 we all know that the way to
  is to find meaning  
 but here 's the thing  
 no one can tell us what our experience means  we have to decide what it means and it
 doesn 't have to be some gigantic  extroverted meaning  we don 't all have to start a foundation or an organization or write a book or make a documentary 
  can be
 quiet and introverted  maybe we make one small decision about our lives
 that can bring about
 big change
 many years ago i had a patient just a wonderful young man who was loved by the staff  and so it was something of a shock to us to
  realize that he had no friends  
 he lived by himself  
 he would come in for chemotherapy by himself 
 he would receive his treatment  and then he 'd walk home alone  
 and i even asked him i said hey how come you never bring a friend with you 
  really have any friends 
 but he had tons of friends on the infusion floor we all loved him and people were going in and out of his room all the time  so
 at his last chemo  
 we sang him the song and we put the crown on his head and we blew the bubbles  and then i asked him i said so what
 are you going to do now 
 and he answered
  did 
 he started volunteering and he made friends there 
 and he began going to a church and he made friends there  and at christmas he invited my husband and me to a party in his apartment and the place was filled
 with his friends  claim your experience  don 't let it claim you he decided
 that the meaning of his experience
  was to know the joy of friendship  and then learn to make friends  
 so what about you how are you going to find meaning
 in your crappy experience  it could be a recent one or it could be one that you 've been carrying around for a really long time
  's never too late to change what it means  
 because meaning is dynamic what it means today may not be what it means a year from now or ten years from now  
 it 's never too late to become someone other than simply a survivor  hear how static
  claim your experience  don 't let it claim you because if you do i believe you will become trapped 
 you will not grow you will not evolve  
 but of course sometimes it 's not outside pressures that cause us to take on that identity of survivor
  sometimes we just like the perks  sometimes there 's a payoff  
 but then we get stuck 
 now one of the first things i learned as a chaplain intern was the three c 's of the chaplain 's job 
 comfort 
  or challenge 
 now we all pretty much love the comforting and the clarifying the confronting 
 not so much 
 one of the other things that i loved about being a chaplain was
 seeing patients a year or even several years after their treatment because it was just really cool to see
  they had changed and how their lives had evolved and what had happened to them  so i was thrilled one day to get a page down into the lobby of the clinic
 from a patient who i had seen the year before 
 and she was there with her two adult daughters who i also knew for her one year follow up exam  
  so i got down to the lobby and they were ecstatic because she had just gotten all of her test results back and she was
 no evidence of disease  which i used to think meant not entirely dead 
 so they were ecstatic  we sat down to visit and it was so weird because
 within two minutes she started retelling me the story of her
  diagnosis
 and her surgery and her chemo even though as her chaplain i saw her every week and so i knew this story  
 and she was using words like suffering  agony
 and she ended her story with
  going to go get coffee 
 and they left 
 tell me three things about yourself before the next stop  people were leaving the bus before she even got to number two or number three 
 so i handed her a tissue  and i gave her a hug
 and then because i really cared for this woman  i said 
 get down off your cross and she said what and
 i repeated get down off your cross and to her
  she could talk about her reasons for
 embracing and then clinging to this identity 
 it got her a lot of attention people were taking care of her for a change  
 but now it was having the opposite effect it was pushing people away 
 people kept leaving to get coffee  
 she felt crucified by her experience  but she didn 't want to let that crucified
  self die 
 now  perhaps you are thinking i was a little harsh with her 
 so i must tell you that
 i was speaking out of my own experience  
 many many years before i had been fired from a job that i loved and i would not stop talking about my
  innocence and the injustice and the betrayal and the deceipt until finally just like this woman people were walking away from me
 until i finally realized
 i wasn 't just processing my feelings i was feeding them  i didn 't want to let that crucified self die
  we all know that with any resurrection story you have to die first 
 the christian story jesus was dead a whole day in the tomb
 before he was resurrected  and i believe that for us being in the tomb
 means doing our own deep inner work around our wounds
 and allowing ourselves to be healed
  we have to let that crucified self die
 so that a new self a truer self is born  we have to let that old story go
 so that a new story a truer story can be told 
  don 't let it claim you 
 what if there were no survivors meaning what if people decided
 to just claim their trauma as an experience
 instead of taking it on as an identity  maybe it would be the end of being trapped in our wounds
 and the beginning of
  and discovery and growth  maybe it would be the start of defining ourselves by who we have become
 and who we are becoming 
 so
 perhaps survivor was not one of the three things that you would tell me 
 no matter
  i just want you all to know that i am really glad that we are on this bus together  and this is my stop
