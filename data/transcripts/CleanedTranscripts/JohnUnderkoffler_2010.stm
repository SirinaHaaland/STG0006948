  years after the advent of the macintosh which was an astoundingly seminal event in in
 the history of human machine interface and in computation in general it fundamentally changed the way that people thought about computation thought about computers how they
 used them and who and how many people were able to use them it was such a radical change in fact  that the early macintosh development team in 
 had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up now this is an interesting little message and
 it 's a lesson that has since i think been forgotten or lost or something  and that is namely  that the os is the interface the interface is the os it 's like the land and the king
  are one and to write a new operating system was not
 a capricious matter it wasn 't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines there were no graphics routines  there were no mouse drivers  so it was a necessity  
 but in the quarter century since then we 've seen all of the fundamental supporting technologies go berserk so memory capacity and
  been multiplied by something between ten thousand and a million same thing for processor speeds networks we didn 't have networks at all at the time of the
 macintosh 's introduction  
 and that has become the single most salient aspect of how we live with computers and of course graphics today eighty four dollars and  ninety seven cents at best buy
 buys you more graphics power than you could have gotten for a million bucks from sgi only a decade
  on the side we 've got the web and increasingly the cloud which is fantastic  but also in the regard in which an interface is fundamental kind of a distraction  so we 've forgotten 
  to invent new interfaces  certainly we 've seen in recent years a lot of change in that regard and people are starting to wake up about that 
 computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in that we teach them in are hideously insensate when it comes to space they don 't understand real world space it
  's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well they also don 't understand time but that 's a matter for a separate talk 
 one thing you might get is something
  like the luminous room the
 luminous room is a system in which it 's considered that input and output spaces are co located that 's a strangely simple 
 and yet unexplored idea right when you use a mouse your hand is down here on the mouse pad it 's not even on the same plane as what you 're talking about the pixels are up on the display  so here was a room in which all the walls
  potted plants whatever was in there were capable not only of display but of sensing as well and that means input and output are in the same space enabling stuff like this that 's a digital storage in a physical container
 the contract is the same
 as with real word objects in real world containers has to come back out whatever you put in 
 this little design experiment that that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well if you presented it with a chess board it tried to figure out what you might mean by that 
 and
  if there was nothing for them to do the chess pieces eventually got bored and hopped away  the academics who were overseeing this work
 thought that that was too frivolous so we built deadly serious applications like this optics prototyping workbench in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box becomes a laser
  the beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects and the system projects down the laser beam path
  so you 've got an interface that has no interface you operate the world as you operate the real world which is to say with your hands 
 similarly a digital wind tunnel with digital wind flowing from right to left
 not that remarkable in a sense we didn 't invent the mathematics but if you displayed that on a crt or flat panel display  it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object a real world object in that here the real world merges with the simulation
  and finally to pull out all the stops this is a system called urp for urban planners in which we give architects architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated when we insisted that they use cad systems  
 and we make the machine meet them half way it projects down digital shadows as you see here 
 and if you introduce tools like this inverse clock 
  then you can control the sun 's position in the sky  that 's eight a m shadows they get a little shorter at nine  a m there you are swinging the sun around  
 short shadows at noon and so forth  
 and we built up a series of tools like this there are inter shadowing studies that children can
 operate even though they don 't know anything about urban planning 
 to move a building you simply reach out your hand and you move the building a material wand makes the building into a sort of frank gehry thing that reflects light in all directions are you blinding passers
  by and motorists on the freeways 
 a zoning tool connects distant structures a building and a roadway are you going to get sued by the zoning commission 
 and so forth  
 now  if these ideas seem familiar or perhaps even a little dated  that 's great they should seem familiar this work is fifteen years old 
 this stuff was undertaken at mit and the media lab under the incredible direction of professor hiroshi ishii director of the
  tangible media group but it was that work that was
 seen by alex mcdowell one of the world 's legendary production designers but alex was preparing a little sort of obscure  indie arthouse film called minority report for steven spielberg 
 and invited us to come out from mit and design
 the interfaces that would appear in that film 
 and the great thing about it was that alex was so
  dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude the idea that the the
 putative two thousand and fifty four that we were painting in the film be believable that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an r & d effort and the result
 is sort of gratifyingly perpetual people still reference those sequences in minority report when they talk about new
  led full circle in a strange way to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface  
 the spatial operating environment we call it  
 so here we have a bunch of stuff some images 
 and using a hand  we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom six degrees of navigational control 
 and it 's fun to fly through mr beckett 's eye and you can come back out through the scary
  orangutan and that 's all well and good  let 's do something a little more
 difficult here we have a whole bunch of disparate images  
 we can fly around them so navigation is a fundamental issue you have to be able to navigate in 3d 
 much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place is inherently spatial
 and the part that isn 't spatial can often be spatialized to allow our wetware to make greater
  sense of it now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways so we can throw it out like that let
 's reset it we can organize it this way and of course  it 's not just about navigation but
 about manipulation as well  
 so if we don 't like stuff or we 're intensely curious about ernst haeckel 's scientific falsifications we can pull them out like that 
 and then if it 's time for analysis  we can pull back a little bit
 and ask for a different distribution 
 let 's just come down a bit
 and fly around 
 so that 's a different way to look at stuff if you 're of a more analytical nature then you might want actually to look at this
 as a color histogram  so now we 've got the stuff
  onto color 
 and now if we want to select stuff
 3d space  the idea that we 're tracking hands in real space becomes really important because we can reach in  
 not in 2d not in fake 2d but in actual 3d here are some selection planes 
 and we 'll perform this boolean operation
 because we really love yellow and tapirs
 on green grass
 so from there to
 the world of real work here 's a logistics system a small piece of one that we 're currently building 
 there 're a lot of elements and one thing that 's very important is to combine traditional tabular data
 with three dimensional and geospatial
  so here 's a familiar place and we 'll bring this back here for a second  maybe select a little bit of that  
 and bring out this graph  
 and we should now be able to fly in here
 and have a closer look these are logistics elements that are scattered across
  interactions and the general idea of imbuing computation with space affords you is a final destruction of that unfortunate one to one pairing between human beings and computers that 's the old way that 's the old mantra one machine one human one mouse one screen well 
 that doesn 't really cut it anymore
  in the real world we have people who collaborate we have people who
 have to work together  and we have many different displays  
 and we might want to look at these various images  we might want to ask for some help the author of this new
 pointing device is sitting over there so i can
 pull this from there to there these are unrelated machines right so the computation is space soluble and network soluble  so i 'm going to leave that over there
  i have a question for paul paul is the designer of this wand and maybe its easiest for him to come over here and tell me in person what 's going on 
 so let me get some of these out of the way  
 let 's pull this apart i
 'll go ahead and explode it kevin can you help
  me see if i can help us find the circuit board  
 mind you it 's a sort of gratuitous field stripping exercise but we do it in the lab all the time 
 all right  so collaborative work whether it 's
 immediately co located or distant and distinct is always important and again that stuff needs to be undertaken in the context of space
  and finally i 'd
 like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery this is a system called tamper
  which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be we at oblong believe that
 media should be accessible in much more fine grained form  so we have a large
  number of movies stuck inside here and let 's just pick out a few elements  we can zip through them
 as a possibility  we can grab elements off the front  where upon they reanimate 
 come to life and drag them down onto the table here we
 'll go over to jacques tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well
  we may need more than one  
 and we probably need well we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest yeah 
 let 's take that one 
  cowboys and french farce people don 't go well together and the system knows that
  let me leave with one final thought  and that is that
 one of the greatest english language writers of the last three decades
 suggested that great art is always a gift and he wasn 't talking about whether the novel costs twenty four point nine five [ dollars ] or whether you have to spring
 seventy million bucks to buy the stolen vermeer he was talking about the circumstances of its creation and of its existence  and i think that it 's time
 that we asked for the same from technology technology is capable of
 expressing
 and being imbued with a certain generosity  and we need to demand that in fact  for some of this kind of technology 
 ground center is
 is a combination of design which is crucially
  we can 't have advances in technology any longer unless design is integrated from the very start 
 and as well as of efficacy  agency we 're as human beings the creatures that create  and we should make sure that our machines
 aid us in that task and are built in that same image so i will leave you with that thank you
  when real when for us not just in a lab and on a stage can it be for every man or is this just for corporations
  it has to be for every human being that 's
 our goal entirely we won 't have succeeded unless we take that next big step i mean it 's been twenty five years can there really be only one interface there can 't ca but does that mean that at your desk or in your home you need projectors cameras
 you know how can it work ju no this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display it 'll be built into architecture the gloves go away in a matter of months or
  this is the inevitability about it ca so in your mind five years time someone can
 buy this as part of a standard computer interface ju i think in five years time when you buy a computer you 'll get this ca well that 's cool 
 the world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used what do you think what in your mind is the
  a good question and we ask ourselves that every day at the moment our early adopter customers and these systems are deployed out in the real world
 do all the big data intensive data heavy problems with it so whether it 's logistics and supply chain management or natural gas and resource extraction  financial services pharmaceuticals bioinformatics those are the topics right now but that 's not a killer app  and i understand
