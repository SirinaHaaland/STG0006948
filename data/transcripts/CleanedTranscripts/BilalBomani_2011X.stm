  what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to explain to you an extreme green concept
 that was developed at nasa 's glenn research center
 in cleveland ohio  but before i do that we have to go over the definition of what green is ' cause a lot of us have a different definition of
 the product is created through environmentally and socially conscious means there 's plenty of things that are being called green now what does it actually mean 
 we use three metrics to determine green the first metric is is it sustainable  
 which means are you preserving what you are doing for future use or for future generations
  is it alternative is it different than what is being used today or does it have a lower carbon footprint than what 's used conventionally  
 and three is it renewable does it come from earth 's natural replenishing resources such as sun  
 wind and water  
 now my task at nasa is to develop the next generation of aviation fuels extreme green why aviation
  the field of aviation uses more fuel than just about every other combined 
 we need to find an alternative also it 's a national aeronautics directive 
 one of the national aeronautics goals is to develop the next generation of fuels biofuels using domestic and safe friendly resources 
  combating that challenge we have to also meet the big three metric
 actually extreme green for us is all three together that 's why you see the plus there i was told to say that 
 so it has to be the big three at grc that 's another metric  ninety seven percent
 of the world 's water is saltwater  how about we use that 
 combine that with number three do not use arable land
 because crops are already growing on that land that 's very scarce around the world number two 
 don 't compete with food crops that 's already a well established entity they don 't need another entry  
 and lastly the most precious resource we have on this earth
 is fresh water  don 't use fresh water 
  point five percent of the world 's water is saltwater two point five percent is fresh water  less than a half percent of that is accessible for human use but sixty percent of the population lives within that one percent 
 so combating my problem was now i have to be extreme green
 and meet the big three ladies and gentlemen  welcome to the  greenlab research facility this is a facility
  we also are using weeds
 and we are also using algae 
 the good thing about our lab is we 've had three thousand six hundred visitors in the last two years  why do you think that 's so  
 because we are on to something special 
 so in the lower you
  see the greenlab obviously and on the right hand side you 'll see algae
  if you are into the business of the next generation of aviation fuels algae is a viable option there 's a lot of funding right now and we have an algae to fuels program 
 there 's two types of algae growing one is a closed photobioreactor that you see here  and what you see on the other
  our job at nasa is to take the experimental and computational and make a better mixing for the closed photobioreactors 
 now the problems with closed photobioreactors are they are quite expensive they are automated and it 's very difficult to get them in large scale  so on large scale what do they use 
 we use open pond systems  
 now around the world they are growing algae with
  this racetrack design that you see here looks like an oval with a paddle wheel and mixes really well  but when it gets around the last turn which i call turn four
 it 's stagnant  
 we actually have a solution for that in the greenlab in our open pond system we use something that happens in nature waves  
 we actually use wave technology on our open pond systems we have ninety five percent mixing and our
  content is higher than a closed 
  system which we think is significant 
 there is a drawback to algae however  it 's very expensive is there a way to produce algae
 inexpensively and the answer is yes we do the same thing we do with
  have six primary ecosystems that range from freshwater all the way to saltwater 
 what we do we take a potential species we start at freshwater  we add a little bit more salt  when the second tank here will be the same ecosystem as brazil right next to the sugar cane fields you can have our plants
 the next tank represents africa the
  next tank represents arizona the next tank represents florida  and the next tank represents california or the open ocean 
 what we are trying to do is to come up with a single species that can survive
 anywhere in the world where there 's barren desert  
 we are being very successful so far 
 now here 's one of the problems if you are a farmer  you need five things to be successful you need seeds  you need soil  you need
  water and you need sun  and the last thing that you need is fertilizer 
 most people use chemical fertilizers but guess what 
 we do not use chemical fertilizer wait a second i just saw lots of greenery in your greenlab 
 you have to use fertilizer  believe it or not in our analysis of our saltwater ecosystems eighty percent of what we need are in these tanks themselves
 the twenty percent that 's missing
 is nitrogen and phosphorous  we have a natural solution fish no we don 't cut up the fish and put them in there 
 fish waste is what we use 
 as a matter of fact we use freshwater mollies that we 've used our climatic adaptation technique from freshwater all the way
  they love to make babies  
 and they love to go to the bathroom  and the more they go to the bathroom the more fertilizer we get the better off we are believe it or not 
 it should be noted that we use sand
 as our soil  regular beach sand fossilized coral so a lot of people ask me how did you get started
  started
 in what we call the indoor biofuels lab it 's a seedling lab we have twenty six different species of halophytes and five are winners 
 what we do here is actually it should be called a death lab ' cause we try to kill the seedlings make them
 rough
 and then we come to the greenlab what you see in the lower corner is a wastewater treatment plant experiment that we are growing a
  about in a minute  and lastly it 's me actually working in the lab to prove to you i do work i don 't just talk about what i do
 here 's the plant species  salicornia virginica 
 it 's a wonderful plant i love that plant  everywhere we go we see it it 's all over the place from maine all the way to
  very difficult to get around the world it is the highest lipid content that we have  but it has a shortcoming it 's short 
 now you take europaea  which is the largest or the tallest plant that we have  
 and what we are trying to do with natural selection or adaptive biology
 combine all three
  when a hurricane decimated the delaware bay soybean fields gone
 we came up with an idea can you have a plant that has a land reclamation
 positive in delaware and the answer is yes  it 's called seashore mallow
 biofuels the rest  cattle feed it
 's there for ten years it 's working very well now we get to chaetomorpha 
 this is a macro algae that loves excess nutrients if you are in the aquarium industry you know we use it to clean up dirty tanks 
 this species is so significant to us the properties
  are very close to plastic we are trying right now to convert this macro algae into a 
 if we are successful we will revolutionize the plastics industry so 
 we have a seed to fuel program we have to do something with this biomass that we have and so we do g c 
  lipid optimization so on and so forth  because our goal really is
 to come up with the next generation of aviation fuels aviation specifics so on and so forth so far we talked about water
 and fuel  but along the way
 we found out something
 interesting about salicornia it
 's a food product  so we talk about ideas worth spreading right  how about this
 in sub saharan africa next to the sea saltwater  
 barren desert  how about we take that plant plant it  
 half use for food  half use for fuel we can make that happen inexpensively 
 you can see there 's a greenhouse in germany that sells it as a health food product
  harvested  and in the middle here is a shrimp dish and it 's being pickled so i have to tell you a joke
 salicornia is known as sea beans 
 saltwater asparagus and pickle weed  so we are pickling pickle weed in the middle oh i thought it was funny 
 and at the bottom is seaman 's mustard it does make sense this is a logical snack you have mustard you are a seaman
 the halophyte you mix it together it 's a great snack with some crackers
 and last garlic with salicornia which is what i like 
 so water  fuel
 and food  
 none of this is possible without the greenlab team just like the miami heat has the big three  we have the big three at nasa grc that 's myself
 professor bob hendricks our fearless leader and dr arnon chait  the backbone of the greenlab is
 students over the last two years we 've had thirty five different students from around the world
 working at greenlab as a matter fact my division chief says a lot you have a green
  i 'm okay with that ' cause we are nurturing the next generation of extreme green thinkers  which is significant 
 so in first summary
 i presented to you what we think is a global solution for food  fuel
 and water  there 's something missing
 to be complete  clearly we use electricity  we have a solution for you
 we 're using clean energy
  sources here  so we have two wind turbines connected to the greenlab we have four or five more hopefully coming soon  
 we are also using something that is quite interesting
 there is a solar array field at nasa 's glenn research center hasn 't been used for fifteen years
  along with some of my electrical engineering colleagues we realized that they are still viable 
 so we are refurbishing them right now in about thirty days or so they 'll be connected to the greenlab 
 and the reason why you see red red and yellow is a lot of people think nasa employees don 't work on saturday
 this is a picture taken on saturday  there are no cars around but you see my truck in yellow i
  this is a proof to you that i 'm working  ' cause we do what it takes to get the job done most people know that here 's a concept with this 
 we are using the greenlab for a  micro grid test bed
 for the smart grid concept in ohio  we have the ability to do that and i think it 's going to work
  renewable energy ecosystem was presented today  we really really hope this concept catches on
 worldwide we think we have a solution
 for food  water  fuel and now energy 
  don 't compete with food crops
