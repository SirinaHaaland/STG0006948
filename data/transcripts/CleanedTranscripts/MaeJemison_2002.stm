  do today
 is to spend some time talking about some stuff that 's sort of given me a little bit of existential angst
 for lack of a better word over the past couple of years and basically these three quotes
  tell what 's going on when god made the color purple god was just showing off alice walker wrote in the color purple
 and zora neale hurston in dust tracks on a road
 research is a formalized curiosity it 's poking and prying with a purpose
 and then finally when i think about the near future you know we have this attitude well whatever happens happens right so that goes along with
 the cheshire cat saying if you don 't care much where you want to get to it doesn 't much matter which way you go but i think it does matter
 which way we go and what road we take because when i think about design in the near future
 what i think are the most important issues what 's really crucial and vital is that we need to revitalize the arts and sciences right now in two thousand and
 if we describe the near future as ten twenty fifteen years from now that means 
 that what we do today is going to be critically important because in the year twenty fifteen in the year twenty twenty twenty twenty five the world our society is going to be building on the basic knowledge and abstract ideas the discoveries that we came up with today
  as all these wonderful things we 're hearing about here at the ted conference that we take for granted in the world right now were really knowledge and ideas that came up in the fiftys the sixtys and the seventys
 that 's the substrate that we 're exploring today whether it 's the internet genetic engineering laser scanners guided missiles fiber optics high definition television
 sensing remote sensing from space and the wonderful remote
  sensing photos that we 're seeing threed weaving tv programs like tracker and enterprise cd read write drives flat screen alvin ailey 's suite otis
 or sarah jones your revolution will not be between these thighs which by the way is banned by the fcc or ska all of these things without question
 almost without exception are really based on ideas and abstract and creativity
 from years before so we have to ask ourselves what are we contributing to that legacy right now
 and when i think about it i 'm really worried to be quite frank i 'm concerned i 'm skeptical that we 're doing very much of anything
 we 're in a sense failing to act in the future we are purposefully consciously being laggards we 're lagging behind
 frantz fannon
  who was a psychiatrist from martinque said each generation must out of relative obscurity discover its mission and fulfill or betray it
 what is our mission what do we have to do i think our mission is to reconcile to reintegrate science and the arts because right now there 's a schism that exists in popular culture
 you know people have this idea
 that science and the arts are really separate we think of them as separate and different things and this idea was probably introduced centuries ago but it 's really becoming critical now
 because we 're making decisions about our society every day
 that if we keep thinking that the arts are separate from the sciences and we keep thinking it 's cute to say i don 't understand anything about this one i don 't understand anything
  about the other one then we are going to have problems now i know no one here at ted thinks this all of us we already know that they 're very connected but i 'm going to let you know that some folks in the outside world 
 believe it or not they think it 's neat when they say you know scientists and science is not creative
 artists are not analytical they 're ingenious perhaps
 but not analytical
 and when these concepts underlie our teaching and what we think about the world
 then we have a problem because we stymie support for everything by accepting this dichotomy whether it 's tongue in cheek
 when we attempt to accommodate it in our world and we try to build our foundation for the world we 're messing up the future
 because who wants to be uncreative
 who wants to be illogical talent would run from either of these fields if you said you have to choose either then they 're going to go to something where they think well i can be creative and logical at the same time
 now i grew up in the sixtys and i 'll admit it
 actually my childhood spanned the sixtys and i was a wanna be hippie and i always resented the fact that i wasn 't really old enough to
 be a hippie i know there are people here you know the younger generation of wanna be hippies
 people talk about the sixtys all the time and they talk about the anarchy that was there but when i think about the sixtys what i took away from it
 was that there was hope for the future we thought everyone could participate there were wonderful incredible ideas that were always percolating and so much of what 's cool or hot today is really based on
  some of those concepts whether it 's people trying to use a prime directive from star trek being involved in things
 or again that three dimensional weaving and fax machines that i read about in my weekly readers as the technology and engineering was just getting started
 but the sixtys left me with a problem you see
 i always assumed i would go into space
  because i followed all of this but i also loved the arts and sciences you see when i was growing up as a little girl and a teenager i loved designing and making doll clothes 
  and wanted to be a fashion designer i took art and ceramics i loved dance
 about the
 infinity and the big bang theory and when i was at stanford i found myself my senior year chemical engineering major half the folks thought i was a political science and performing arts major which 
  was sort of true because i was black student union president and i did major in some other things
  producing and choreographing a dance production
 and i had to do the lighting and the design work
 i was trying to figure out do i go to new york city to try to become a professional dancer or do i go to medical school
 now my mother helped me figure that one out
 but when i went into space when i went into space i carried a number of things up with me i carried a poster by alvin ailey who you can figure
  out now i love the dance company an alvin ailey poster of judith jameson performing the dance cry
 dedicated to all black women everywhere a bundu statue which was from the women 's society in sierra leone and a certificate for the chicago public school students to work to improve their science and math
 folks ask me
  you take up what you took up i had to say because it represents human creativity
 the creativity that allowed us that we were required to have to conceive and build and launch the space shuttle springs from the same source of imagination and analysis that it took to carve a bundu statue
 or the ingenuity it took to design choreograph and stage cry
 each one of them are different manifestations incarnations of creativity avatars
  of human creativity
 and that 's what we have to reconcile in our minds how these things fit together the difference between arts and sciences is not analytical versus intuitive right e equal mc
 required an intuitive leap
 and then you had to do the analysis afterwards
 einstein said in fact the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true
  art and science
 dance requires us to express and want to express the jubilation in life but then you have to figure out exactly what movement do i do to make sure that it comes across correctly
 the difference between arts and sciences is also not constructive versus deconstructive right a lot people think of the sciences as deconstructive you have to pull things apart yes subatomic physics is deconstructive you literally
  try to tear atoms apart to understand what 's inside of them but sculpture from what i understand from great sculptors
 is deconstructive because you see a piece and you remove what doesn 't need to be there biotechnology is constructive
 orchestral arranging is constructive so in fact we use constructive and deconstructive techniques in everything
 the difference between science and the arts is
  not that they are different sides of the same coin even or even different parts of the same continuum but rather they are manifestations of the same thing
  our attempt as humans to build an understanding of the universe the world around us it 's our attempt to influence things the universe internal to ourselves and external to us
 the sciences to me
 are manifestations of our attempt to express or share our understanding our experience to influence the universe external to ourselves
 it doesn 't rely on us as individuals
 it 's a universe as experience by everyone
 the arts manifest our desire our attempt to share or influence others through experiences that are peculiar to us as individuals
 let me say it again another way science provides an understanding of a universal experience arts provides a universal understanding of a personal experience
 that
  's what we have to think about
 that they are all part of us they 're all part of a continuum it 's not just the tools it 's not just the sciences you know the mathematics and the numerical stuff and the statistics because we heard very much on this stage people talked about music being mathematical
 right
 arts don 't just use clay are not the only ones who use clay light and sound and movement
 they use
  analysis as well
 so people might say well i still like that intuitive versus analytical thing because everybody wants to do the right brain left brain thing right we 've all been accused of being right brain or left brain at some point in time depending on who we disagreed with when
 people say intuitive that 's like you 're in touch with nature in touch with yourself and relationships analytical you put your mind to work and i
  you a little secret you all know this though but sometimes people use this analysis idea that things are outside of ourselves to say that this is what we 're going to
 elevate as the true most important sciences right
 and then you have artists and you all know this is true as well artists will say things about scientists
 because they say they are too concrete they are disconnected with the world but
  we 've even had that here on stage so don 't act like that you all don 't know what i 'm talking about we had the
 we had folks talking about the flat earth society and flower arrangers so there is this whole dichotomy that we continue to carry along even when we know better
 and folks say we need to chose either or
 but it would really be foolish to chose
  either one right intuitive versus analytical
 that 's a foolish choice that 's foolish just like trying to choose between being realistic or idealistic you need both in life
 why do people do this i 'm just going to quote a molecular biologist sydney brenner who is seventy years old so he can say this he said it 's always important to distinguish between chastity and impotence
  i want to share with you i want to share with you a little equation okay how do understanding science and the arts
 fit in to our lives and what 's going on and the things that we 're talking about here at the design conference and this is a little thing i came up with understanding and our resources and our will
 cause us to have outcomes our understanding is our science our arts our religion how we see the universe around us our resources our money our labor
  our minerals those things that are out there in the world that we have to work with but more importantly there 's our will
 this is our vision our aspirations of the future our hopes our dreams our struggles and our fears our successes and our failures influence what we do with all of those and to me design and engineering craftsmanship and skilled labor are all the
  things that work on this to have our outcome which is our human quality of life
  what 's going on
  need to revitalize the
  we have to reconcile
  and that 's what we have to
  let me finish by saying that my personal design issue in the future
 is really about integrating to think about that intuitive and that analytical the arts and sciences are not separate
 high school
 physics lesson before we leave high school physics teacher used to hold up a ball she would say this ball has potential energy
 but nothing will happen to it it can 't do any work until i drop it and it changes states
 i like to think of ideas as potential energy they 're really wonderful but nothing will happen until we risk putting them into action this conference is filled with wonderful ideas
 we 're going to share lots of things with people
 but nothing is going to happen until we risk putting those ideas into action we need to revitalize the arts and sciences today we need to take responsibility for the future 
 we can 't hide behind saying it 's just for company profits profits or it 's just a business or i 'm an artist or an academician
  intuitive analytical
 fran lebowitz my favorite cynic she said the three questions of greatest concern now i 'm going to add on to design is
 is it attractive
 that 's the intuitive is it amusing the analytical and does it know its place the balance thank you very much
