  a very important impact on us it changed the way our history developed  but it 's a technology so pervasive so
 invisible
  to take it into account when we talked about human
 evolution  but we see the results of this technology still so let 's make a little test  
 so everyone of you turns to their neighbor
 please  turn and face your neighbors  please also on the balcony
 do you see any canine teeth 
 laughter count dracula teeth
 in the mouths of your neighbors of course not because
 our dental anatomy is actually made not for tearing down raw meat from bones
 or chewing fibrous leaves for hours
 is made
 for a diet
 which is soft  mushy  
 which is reduced in fibers  which is very easily chewable and digestible  
 sounds like fast food
 food transformation made us
 what we are 
 so i would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves  we talk about ourselves as omnivores i would say we should call ourselves coctivors
  to live of cooked food  so cooking is a very important technology it 's technology i don
 't know how you feel but i like to cook for entertainment 
 and you need some design
 to be successful  so cooking is a very important technology because it allowed us
 to acquire what brought you all here
  the big brain  
 this wonderful cerebral cortex we have because brains are expensive 
 those have to pay tuition fees know 
 but it 's also metabolically speaking expensive  
 you now our brain is two to three percent of the body mass but actually it uses twenty five percent of the total energy
 we use it 's very
  where does the energy come from of course from food  if we eat raw food we cannot release really the energy  
 so this ingenuity of our ancestors to invent
 this most marvelous technology  invisible everyone of us does it every day so to speak cooking
 made it possible that mutations  natural selections our environment
 could develop
 us  so if we think about this unleashing
 human potential which was possible
 by cooking and food  why do we talk so badly about food  why is it always do and don 'ts and it 's good for you it 's not good for you 
 i think
 the good news for me would be
 if we could go back and talk about
 the unleashing the continuation of the unleashing of human potential now cooking allowed also that we became a migrant
 species  we walked out of africa two times 
 we populated all the ecologies if you can cook  nothing can happen to you 
 because whatever you find you will try to transform it it keeps also your brain working
 easy and simple
 technology which was developed actually runs after this formula take something which looks like food  
 transform it and it gives you a good very easy accessible energy this technology affected two organs 
 the brain and the gut  which it actually affected the brain could grow  but the gut actually shrunk okay it 's not obvious to be honest
 it shrunk to sixty percent of primate gut of my body mass  so
 because of having cooked food it 's easier to
 digest 
 now having a large brain  as you know 
 is a big advantage because you can actually influence your environment you can influence your own technologies you have invented you can continue
  to innovate and invent  now the big brain did this also with cooking  but how did it actually
 run this show how did it actually interfere what kind of
 criteria did it use and this is actually taste reward and energy  you know we have up to five tastes three of them sustain us 
  this is a meaty taste you need proteins for muscles  recovery  
 salty  because you need salt  otherwise your electric body will not work and two tastes which protect you
 bitter and sour  which are against
 poisonous and rotten material  
  but we use them still in a sophisticated way think about bittersweet chocolate or think about the acidity of yogurt wonderful mixed with
 strawberry fruits so we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing because we know
 that in cooking we can transform it to the form reward this is a more complex
 and especially
 integrative form of our brain
 with various different elements
 the external states our internal states how do we feel and so on are put together  and something which maybe you don 't like
 but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat so satisfaction was a very important part and as i say energy was necessary  
 now how did the gut actually
 participate in this development and the gut is a silent
  voice it 's going more for feelings i use the euphemism digestive comfort
 actually it 's a digestive discomfort which the
 gut is concerned with 
 if you get a stomach ache if you get a little bit bloated was not the right food  was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong  
 so my story is a tale of two brains because it might
  surprise you our gut has a full fledged brain  
 all the managers in the room say you don 't tell me something new because we know gut feeling this is what we are using 
 laughter and actually you use it and it 's actually useful because our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system  they do speak with each other
 and make decisions
  what it means to have a brain there is that not only the big brain has to talk
 with the the food the food has to talk with the brain  because
 we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains  now if there 's a gut brain we should also learn to talk with this brain now one hundred
 fifty years ago anatomists described very very carefully
 here is a model of a wall of a gut  i took the three elements stomach small intestine and colon  
 and within this structure you see these two pinkish
 layers which are actually the muscle  and between this muscle they found nervous tissues a lot of nervous tissues  which penetrate actually the muscle penetrate the
  where you have all the elements for the immune system the gut is actually the largest immune system  defending your body it penetrates the mucosa this is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you
 digest  which is actually the lumen  now if you think about the gut the gut is if you could stretch it
 forty meters long the length of a tennis court if we could unroll it get out all the folds and so on it would have four hundred
  meters
 of surface and now this brain takes care over this to move it with the muscles
 and to do defend the surface and of course digest our food we cook  
 so if we give you a specification this brain which is autonomous have five hundred million nerve cells one hundred million neurons
 so around the size of a cat brain so there sleeps a little cat
 thinks for itself  optimizes whatever it digests it has twenty different neuron
 types it 's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain where you have one hundred billion neurons 
 it has autonomous organized microcircuits has these programs which run  it senses the food it knows exactly what to do 
 it senses it by chemical means
  very importantly by mechanical means 
 because it has to move the food it
 has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion  
 this control of muscle is very very important because you know there can be reflexes if you don 't like a food especially if you 're a child  you gag  it 's this brain which makes this reflex  
 and then finally  it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery which actually digests the
  we cook  now how do the two brains work with each other i took here a model from robotics
 it 's called the subsumption architecture what it means is that we have a layered control system 
 the lower layer our gut brain has its own goals digestion defense
 and we have the higher brain
  of integration and generating behaviors  
 now both look and this is the blue arrows both look to the same food which is in the lumen and in the area of your intestine  
 the big brain integrates signals which come from the running programs of the lower brain  
 but subsumption means that the higher brain
 can interfere with the lower it can replace or it can
  so if we take two types of signals a hunger signal for example 
 if you have an empty stomach your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin it 's a very big signal  
 it 's sent to the brain says go and eat 
 you have stop signals we have up to eight stop signals
 at least in my case  they are not listened to 
 so what happens if the big brain
 integration
 overrides the signal  so if you override the hunger signal  you can have a disorder which is called anorexia  
 despite generating a healthy hunger signal the big brain ignores it
 and activates different programs in the gut the more usual case
  it actually takes the
 signal and changes it and we continue even [ though ] our eight signals would say stop enough we have transferred enough energy 
 now the interesting thing is that along this lower layer layer this gut
 the signal becomes stronger and stronger if
 undigested but digestible
  could penetrate this we found from bariatric surgery that then the
 the signal would be very very high  so now back to the cooking question and back to the design we have learned
 to talk to the big brain taste and reward as you know  now what would be the language we have to talk to the gut brain
 that its signals are so strong
 that the big brain cannot ignore it then we would generate something
 all of us would like to have a balance between the hunger and the satiation now i give you from our research a very short
 claim  this is fat
 digestion you have on your left an olive oil droplet and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes this is an in vitro experiment
  everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens when the constituents are liberated  they disappear  they go away because they [ were ] absorbed 
 actually what happens is that a very intricate structure
 appears and i hope you can see that there are some ring like structures in the middle image  
 which is water this whole system generates a huge surface to allow more enzymes
 to attack the remaining oil
  and finally on your right side you see a bubbly cell like structure appearing from which the body will absorb the fat  
 now if we could take this language and this is a language of structures
 and make it
  that it can go through the
  so our research and i think the research also at the universities are now fixing on these points to say  how can we actually
 and this might sound trivial now to you how can we change cooking how can we cook
 that we have this language developed  so what we have actually it 's not an omnivore 's dilemma we have a coctivor 's opportunity
 because we have learned over the last two million years
 which taste and reward quite sophisticated to cook
 to please ourselves to satisfy ourselves if we add the matrix if we add the structure language which we have to learn 
 when we learn it then we can put it back and around energy we could generate a balance which comes out from our
 really primordial operation
 cooking  so to make cooking really a very important
 element i would say even philosophers have to change and have to finally recognize that cooking is
 what made us  so i would say  coquo ergo sum i cook therefore i am  thank you very much
