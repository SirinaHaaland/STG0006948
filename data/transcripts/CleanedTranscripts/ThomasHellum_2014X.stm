  only got eighteen minutes to explain something that lasts for hours and days so i 'd better get started 
 let 's start with a clip from al jazeera 's listening post
  a country that gets relatively little media coverage even the elections this past week passed without much drama  and that 's the norwegian media in a nutshell not much drama 
 a few years back norway 's public tv channel nrk decided to broadcast live coverage of a seven hour train ride seven hours of simple footage a 
  train rolling down the tracks norwegians more than a million of them according to the ratings
  of reality tv show was born and it goes against all the rules of tv engagement there is no story line no script no drama no climax  and it 's called slow tv 
 for the past two months norwegians have been watching a cruise ship 's journey up the coast and there 's a lot of fog on that coast  executives at norway 's national broadcasting service are now considering broadcasting a night of knitting
  nationwide on the surface it sounds boring because it is but something about this tv experiment has gripped norwegians  
 so we sent the listening post 's marcela pizarro to oslo to find out what it is but first a warning viewers may find some of the images in the following report disappointing
  programs in little norway al jazeera cnn  how did we get there  
 we have to go back to two thousand and nine  when one of my colleagues got a great idea where do you get your ideas in the lunchroom 
 so he said  why don 't we make a radio program
 marking the day of the german invasion of norway in one thousand nine hundred and forty we tell the story at the exact time during the night  wow brilliant idea
  except this was just a couple of weeks before the invasion day  so we sat in our lunchroom and discussed
 what other stories can you tell as they evolve  what other things take a really long time  
 so one of us came up with a train the bergen railway
 had its 100 year anniversary that
 goes from western norway to eastern norway  and it takes exactly the same time as it did forty years ago  
 over seven hours 
 so we caught our commissioning editors in oslo  and we said we want to make a documentary about the bergen railway and we want to make it in full length  
 and the answer was yes but how long will the program be
  laughter  very very good laughter  
 so one bright day in september we started a program that we thought should be seven hours and four minutes actually it turned out to be seven hours and fourteen minutes due to
 a signal failure
 at the last station we had four cameras  three of them pointing
  and that 's about it but of course also the one hundred and sixty tunnels gave us
  and now we thought yes  we have a brilliant program  it will fit
 for the two thousand train spotters in norway we
 brought it on air in november two thousand and nine  but no this was far more attractive this is the five biggest tv channels in norway
 on a normal friday and if you look at
  happened when they put on the bergen railway show one point two million norwegians watched part of this program 
 and another funny thing when the host on our main channel after they have got news for you she said and on our second
  the train has now nearly reached myrdal station thousands of people just jumped on the train on our second channel like this 
 this was also a huge success in terms of social media  it was so nice to see all the thousands of facebook and twitter users
 discussing the same view  talking to each other as if they were on the same train together
  he 's watched all the program and at the end station  he rises up to pick up what he thinks is his luggage  and his head hit the curtain rod and he
 realized he is
  first night  the first twitter message came why be a chicken why 
  stop at four hundred and thirty six when you can expand that to eight thousand and forty  minute by minute and do the iconic journey in norway the coastal ship journey hurtigruten from bergen to kirkenes almost three thousand
  part in life and death along the coast  so just a week after the bergen railway we called the hurtigruten company and we started planning for our next show  
 we wanted to do something different the bergen railway was a recorded program  
 so when we sat in our editing room  we watched this picture it 's all l station
  we saw this journalist  we had called him  we had spoken to him  and when we left the station  he took this picture of us and he waved to the camera  and we thought  what if 
  more people knew that we were on board that train would more people show up what
  we wanted this picture of us on the fjord and on the screen at the same time  
 so this is not the first time nrk had been on board a ship  this is back in one thousand nine hundred and sixty four when the technical managers have suits and ties and
 nrk rolled all its equipment on board a ship 
 and two hundred meters out of the shore  transmitting the signal back and in the machine room they talked to the
 machine guy and on the deck they have splendid entertainment
  so being on a ship it 's not the first time
  but five and a half days in a row and live  we wanted some help  and we asked our viewers out there what do 
 you want to see what do you want us to film  how do you want this to
  do you want us to make a website what do you want on it 
 and we got some answers from you out there and it helped us a very lot to build the program  so in june two thousand and eleven twenty three of us went on board the hurtigruten coastal ship and we
  to be
  i have some really strong memories from that week  and it 's all about people this guy for instance  he 's head of research at the university in troms 
 and i will show you a piece of cloth this one  
 it 's the other strong memory  it belongs to a guy called erik hansen
  it 's people like those two
 who took a firm grip of our program  
 and together with thousands of others along the route  they made the program what it became  they made all the stories 
 this is karl he 's in the ninth grade  it says i will be a little late for school tomorrow 
 he was supposed to be in the school at eight a m he came at nine
  and he didn 't get a note from his teacher because the teacher had watched the program 
 how did we do this  yes we took a conference room on board the hurtigruten 
 we turned it into a complete tv control room  we made it all work of course  
 and then we took along eleven cameras  this is one of
  this is my sketch from february  and when you give this sketch to professional people in the norwegian broadcasting company nrk you get some cool stuff back 
 and with some very creative solutions
  another camera is this one it 's normally used for sports  it made it possible for us to take
 and asked how is this man doing he 's doing fine everything went well we also could take pictures of people
 waving at us people along the route  thousands of them 
 and they all had a phone in their hand  and when you take a picture of them and they get the message now we are on tv dad they start waving back this was waving tv for five
  and a half days and people get so extremely happy when they can send
 a warm message to their loved ones  
 it was also a great success on social media 
 on the last day we met her majesty the queen of norway  and twitter couldn 't quite handle it  
 and we also on the web during this week we streamed more than one hundred years of
  and the websites are still there and they will be forever actually because hurtigruten was selected to be part of the norwegian unesco list of
 documents  and it 's also in the guinness book of records as the longest documentary
  's a long program  so some watched part of it like the prime minister some watched a little bit more it says 
 i haven 't used my bed for five days and 
 years old and he hardly slept he kept watching because something might happen  though it probably won 't 
 this is the number of viewers along the route  you can see the famous
  and a day after all time high for 
 if you see the four biggest channels in norway during june two thousand and eleven they will look like this  
 and as a tv producer  it 's a pleasure to put hurtigruten on top of it it looks like this 
 three point two million norwegians watched part of this program  and we are only five million here  even the passengers on board
  the hurtigruten coastal ship 
 they chose to watched the telly instead of turning ninety degrees and watching out the window  
 so we were allowed to be part of people 's living room with this strange tv program  with music  nature people 
 and slow tv was now a buzzword  and we started looking for other things we could make slow
 about so we could either take
 something long and make it a topic like with the railway and the hurtigruten or we could take a topic and make it long  
 this is the last project it 's the peep show  it 's fourteen hours of birdwatching
 on a tv screen actually eighty seven days on the web  
 we have made eighteen hours of live salmon fishing  it actually took three hours before we got the first fish and that
 we have made twelve hours of boat ride into the beautiful telemark canal 
 and we have made another train ride with the northern railway 
 and because this we couldn 't do live  we did it in four seasons just to give the viewer another experience on the way 
 so our next
  i 've got my eye on a wildly popular program from norway called national firewood night which
 consisted of mostly people in parkas chatting and chopping in the woods  and then eight hours of a fire burning in a fireplace 
 it destroyed the other top norwegian shows like so you think you can watch paint dry
  get this  almost twenty percent of the norwegian population tuned in twenty percent th 
 so when wood fire and wood chopping can be that interesting why not knitting so on our next project  
 we used more than eight hours to go live from a sheep to a sweater
  and
  the people on the show are falling asleep and after all that 
 the knitters actually failed to break the world record they did not succeed  but remember the old norwegian saying it 's not whether you win or lose that counts in fact  nothing counts and death is coming for us all
  this stand out this is so completely different to other tv programming  we take the
 the viewer on a journey that happens right now in real time  and the viewer gets the feeling of actually being there actually being on the train on the boat and knitting together with others 
 and the reason i think why they 're doing that is because we don 't edit
  it 's important that we don 't edit the timeline  
 and it 's also important that what we make slow tv about is something that we all can relate to that the viewer can relate to and that somehow has a root in our culture 
 this is a picture from last summer when we traveled the coast again for seven weeks 
 and of course this is a lot of planning  this is a lot of logistics so this is the working plan for one hundred and fifty people last summer  but more important is what you don 't plan
 you don 't plan what 's going to happen 
 you have to just take your cameras with you it 's like a sports event you rig them and you see what 's happening  
 so this is actually the whole running order for hurtigruten one hundred and thirty four hours just written on one page  
 we didn 't know anything more when we left bergen  
  so you have to let the viewers make the stories themselves  and i 'll give you an example of that  
 this is from last summer  and as a tv producer  it 's a nice picture but now you can
 cut to the next one  but this is slow tv so you have to keep this picture until it really starts hurting your stomach  and then you keep it a little bit longer  
 and when you keep it that long i 'm sure some of you now have noticed the cow
  some of you have seen the flag some of you start wondering is the farmer at home has he left is he watching the cow  and where is that cow going  
 so my point is the longer you keep a picture like this  and we kept it for ten minutes 
 you start making the stories in your own head that 's slow tv  
 so we think that slow tv is one nice way of telling a tv story and we think that
  we can continue doing it not too often  once or twice a year so we keep the feeling of an event
  and we also think that the good slow tv idea that 's the idea when people say oh no you can 't put that on tv 
 when people smile  it might be a very good slow idea  so
 after all life is best when it 's a bit strange thank you
