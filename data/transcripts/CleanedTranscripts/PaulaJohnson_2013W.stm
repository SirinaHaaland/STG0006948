  some of my most wonderful memories of childhood are of spending time with my grandmother mamar 
 in our four family home in brooklyn new york her apartment
 was an oasis it was a place where i could sneak a cup of coffee which was really warm milk with just
  touch of caffeine she loved life 
 and although she worked in a factory  she saved her pennies and she traveled to europe and i remember
 poring over those pictures with her and then dancing with her to her favorite music and then when i was eight
  and she was sixty something changed 
 she no longer worked or traveled she no longer danced there were no more coffee times 
 my mother missed work and took her to doctors who couldn 't make a diagnosis  
 and my father who worked at night would spend every afternoon with her just to make sure she ate 
 her care became
  for our family  and by the time a diagnosis was made she was in a deep spiral  now many of you will recognize her symptoms 
 my grandmother had depression a deep
  depression from which she never recovered  
 and back then so little was known about depression but even today fifty years later there 's still so much more to learn
 today  we know that women are seventy percent more likely to experience depression over their lifetimes compared with men 
 and even with this high prevalence women are misdiagnosed between thirty and fifty percent of the time  
 now we know that women are more likely to experience the symptoms
 of fatigue sleep disturbance  
 pain and anxiety compared with men and these symptoms are often overlooked as symptoms of depression
  and it isn 't only depression in which these sex differences occur but they occur across so many diseases  
 so it 's my grandmother 's struggles that have really led me on a lifelong quest
 and today i lead a center in which the mission is to discover why these sex differences occur and to use that knowledge to improve the health of women  
 today  we know that every cell has a sex now that 's a term coined by the institute of
  and what it means is that men and women are different
 down to the cellular and molecular levels 
 it means that we 're different across all of our organs 
 from our brains to our hearts our lungs our joints 
 now it was only twenty years ago
 that we hardly had any data on women 's health beyond our reproductive functions
  but then in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three the nih revitalization act was signed into law  
 and what this law did was it mandated that women and minorities be included in clinical trials that were funded by the national institutes of health 
 and in many ways
  the law has worked 
 women are now routinely included in clinical studies and we 've learned that there are major differences in the ways that women and men experience disease  
 but remarkably  
 what we have learned about these differences is often overlooked  
 so we have to ask ourselves the question  why leave women 's health to chance  
 and we 're leaving it to chance in two ways
  the first is that there is so much more to learn and we 're not making the investment
 in fully understanding the extent of these sex differences and the second
 is that we aren 't taking what we have learned and routinely applying it in clinical care we are
  to share with you three examples of where sex differences have impacted the health of women and where we need to do more 
 let 's start with heart disease it 's the number one killer of women in the united states today  
 this is the face of heart disease  linda is a 
 who had a stent placed in one of the arteries going to her heart when she had recurring
  symptoms she went back to her doctor her doctor did the gold standard test a cardiac catheterization it showed no blockages  
 linda 's symptoms continued she had to stop working and that 's when she found us 
 when linda came to us  we did another cardiac catheterization and this time  we found clues  but we
  needed another test
 to make the diagnosis  
 so we did a test called an intracoronary ultrasound where you use soundwaves to look at the artery from the inside out  
 and what we found
 was that linda 's disease didn 't look like the typical male
  the typical male disease looks like this 
 there 's a discrete blockage or stenosis 
 linda 's disease like the disease of so many women  
 looks like this the plaque is laid down more evenly more diffusely along the artery  and it 's harder to see 
 so for linda and for so many women  the gold standard test wasn 't gold 
 now linda
  received the right treatment she went back to her life and fortunately today she is doing well  
 but linda was lucky  she found us  we found her disease  but for too many women that 's not the case 
 we have the tools we have the technology to make the diagnosis  but it 's all too often that these sex
  what about treatment 
 a landmark study that was published two years ago asked the very important question 
 what are the most effective treatments for heart disease in women  
 the authors looked at papers written over a 10 year period  and hundreds had to be thrown out  
 and what they found out was that of those that were tossed out
 were excluded because even though women were included in the studies  
 the analysis didn 't differentiate between women and men  
 what a lost opportunity  the money had been spent
 and we didn 't learn how women fared and these studies could not contribute one iota to the very very important question
  what are the most effective treatments for heart disease in women  
 i want to introduce you to hortense my godmother 
 hung wei a relative of a colleague  and somebody you may recognize dana christopher reeve 's wife 
 all three women have something very important in common all three
 were diagnosed with lung cancer the number one cancer killer of women in the united states today  all three
 were nonsmokers  sadly dana and hung wei died of their disease 
 today what we know is that women
  who are nonsmokers are three times more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men who are nonsmokers 
 now interestingly when women are diagnosed with lung cancer their survival tends to be better than that of men now here are some clues 
 our investigators have found that there are certain genes in the lung tumor cells of both women and men 
 and these genes are activated mainly by estrogen  and when these genes are
 over expressed it 's associated with improved survival only in young women  
 now this is a very early finding and we don 't yet know whether it has relevance to clinical care  
 but it 's findings like this that may provide hope and may provide an opportunity
  save lives of both women and men  
 now let me share with you an example of when we do consider sex differences it can drive the science 
 several years ago a new lung cancer drug was being evaluated  
 and when the authors looked at whose tumors shrank they found that eighty two percent were women  
 this led them to ask the question well why  and what they found
  was that the genetic mutations that the drug targeted were far more common in women 
 and what this has led to is a more personalized approach to the treatment of lung cancer that also includes sex 
 this is what we can accomplish
 when we don 't leave women 's health to chance  
 we know that when you invest in research you get results  take a look at the death rate from breast cancer over time
  now take a look at the death rates from lung cancer in women over time  
 now let 's look at the dollars invested in breast cancer these are the dollars invested per death
 and the dollars invested in lung cancer now it 's clear that our investment in breast
  they may not be fast enough  but it has produced results  
 we can do the same for lung cancer and for every other disease  
 so let 's go back to depression 
 depression is the number one cause of disability in women in the world today  our investigators
  have found
 that there are differences in the brains of women and men in the areas that are connected with mood  
 and when you put men and women in a functional mri scanner that 's the kind of scanner that shows how the brain is functioning when it 's activated so you put them in the scanner and you expose them to stress 
 you can actually see the difference  
 and it 's findings like this
 that we believe hold some of the clues for why
  we see these very significant sex differences in depression  but even though we know that these differences occur
 percent of the brain research that begins in animals
 is done in either male animals or animals in whom the sex is not identified so i think we have to ask
  again the question  why leave women 's health to chance  
 and this is a question that haunts those of us in science and medicine who believe that we are on the verge of being able to
 dramatically improve the health of women  we know that every cell has a sex  we know that these differences are often overlooked
  and therefore we know that women are not getting the full benefit of modern science and medicine today  
 we have the tools but we lack the collective will and momentum 
 women 's health is an equal rights issue as important
 as equal pay  and it 's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine
 so
 imagine the momentum we could achieve in advancing the health of women if we considered whether these sex differences were present at the very beginning of designing research 
 or if we analyzed our data by sex
  people often ask me what can i do and here 's what i suggest 
 first 
 i suggest that you think about women 's health in the same way that you think and care about other causes that are important to you 
 and second  and equally as important
  that as a woman you have to ask your doctor
 and the doctors who are caring for those who you love 
 is this disease or treatment different in women  
 now this is a profound question because the answer is likely yes  but your doctor may not know the answer at least not yet  but if you ask the question  your doctor will very likely go looking for the answer  
 and this is so
  important not only for ourselves  
 but for all of those whom we love  whether it be a mother a daughter a sister 
 a friend
 or a grandmother it was my grandmother 's suffering that inspired my work to improve the health of
  that 's her legacy our legacy can be to improve the health of women for this generation
 and for generations to come
