  i 've got something to show you
  think about this as a pixel a flying pixel 
 this is what we call  in our lab sensible design let me tell you a bit about it  
 now if you take this picture i 'm italian originally and every boy in italy grows up with this picture on the
 wall of his bedroom but the reason i 'm showing you this is that
 something very interesting happened in formula one racing over the past couple of decades  
 now some time ago if you wanted to win a formula one race  you take a budget  and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car 
 and if the car and the driver were good enough then you 'd win the race  now today if you want to win the race actually you need also something like this something that monitors the car in real time has a few
  thousand sensors collecting information from the car transmitting this information into the system  
 and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected 
 this is what in engineering terms  you would call a
 real time control system
  and basically it 's a system made of two components a sensing and an actuating component 
 what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives our cities 
 over the past few years just have been blanketed with
 networks  electronics they 're becoming like computers in open air and as computers in open air they 're starting to respond in a different
  to be able to be sensed and to be actuated 
 if we fix cities actually it 's a big deal  just as an aside i wanted to mention cities are only two percent of the earth 's crust  but they are fifty percent of the world 's population they are seventy five percent of the energy consumption
 up to eighty percent of co2 emissions  so if we 're able to do something with cities that 's a big deal  beyond cities
  all of this sensing and actuating is entering our everyday objects 
 that 's from an exhibition that paola antonelli is organizing at moma later this year during the summer it 's called talk to me well our objects our environment is starting 
  to talk back to us in a certain sense it 's almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator  and that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment
 it 's almost as if the old dream of michelangelo you know
 when michelangelo sculpted the moses at the end it said that he took the hammer threw it at the moses actually you can still see a small chip underneath
 and said  shouted perch non parli  why don 't you talk well today for the first time our environment is starting to talk back to us
  show just a few examples again with this idea of sensing
 our environment and actuating it 
 let 's starting with sensing well the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab  it was four and a half years ago
 in italy and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed
 all across the world that 's a cellphone network and use anonymous
  and aggregated information from that network that 's collected anyway by the operator in order to understand how the city works 
 the summer was a lucky summer two thousand and six  it 's when italy won the soccer world cup 
 some of you might remember it was italy and france playing and then zidane at the end the headbutt and anyway italy won at the end now
 look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network here you see the city
 you see the colosseum in the middle  the river
 tiber  it 's morning before the match  you see the timeline on the top
 early afternoon people here and there making calls and moving the match begins silence france
  people make a quick call and go to the bathroom  second half end of normal time first overtime  second zidane the headbutt in a moment 
 italy wins yeah 
 applause well that night everybody went to celebrate in in the center you saw the big peak the following
  everybody went to the center to meet
 the winning team and the prime minister at the time and then everybody moved down you see the image of the place called circo massimo where since roman times people go to celebrate 
 to have a big party and you see the peak at the end of the day well that 's just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn 't have done just a few years ago  
 another quick example about sensing  it 's
 not about people but about things we use and consume well today
  know everything about where our objects come from this is a map that shows you all the chips that form a
 mac computer how they came together  but we know very little about where things go so in this project we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system  so we actually started with
 a number of volunteers who helped us in seattle  just over a year ago
  to tag what they were throwing away
 different types of things as you can see here
 things they would throw away anyway then we put a little chip little tag onto the trash
 and then started following it here are the results we just obtained
  this information we realized there 's a lot of inefficiencies in the system  we can actually do the same thing with much less energy 
 this data was not available before but there 's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening 
 but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we 're throwing away it doesn 't disappear it 's still somewhere on the
  planet and the plastic bottle we 're throwing away every day still stays there and if we show that to people then we can also promote some behavioral change  so that was the reason for the project  my colleague at mit 
 assaf biderman he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing but i wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning  and that 's actuating our environment and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in zaragoza
 it started with a question by the mayor of the city who came to us saying that spain and southern europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space  in architecture 
 and the question was how could technology new technology be added to that and one of the ideas that was developed at mit in a workshop was imagine this pipe and you 've got
  create like a water curtain with pixels made of water if those pixels fall you can
 write on it  you can show patterns images text and even you can approach it and it will open up to let you
 jump through as you see in this image 
 well we presented this to mayor belloch he liked it very much and we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo
 we called it digital water pavilion
  the whole building is made of water 
 there 's no doors or windows but when you approach it it will open up to let you in
  the roof also is covered with water  
 and if there 's a bit of wind if you want to minimize splashing you can actually lower the roof or
 you could
 close the building  and the whole architecture will disappear like in this case you know these days you always get images during the winter when they take the roof down of people who have been there
  it just when it goes down the architecture almost
 disappears  here 's the building working you see the person puzzled about what was going on inside and
 here was myself trying not to get wet  testing the sensors that open the water  
 well  i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working
  but actually
  more fun all the kids from zaragoza came to the building because the way of engaging with the building became something different not anymore a building that would open up to let you in 
 but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water and you had to jump without getting
  very interesting because as architects as engineers  as designers we always think about how people will use the things we design  but then reality 's always unpredictable and that 's the beauty of 
 of doing things that are used and interact with people here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels the pixels made of water  and then projections on them and this is what led us to think about the following project i 'll show you now 
  pixels could actually start flying imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air  and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights almost 
  as a cloud that can move in space  here is the video 
 so imagine one helicopter 
  before  
 moving with others  in synchrony  so you can have this cloud
 you can have a kind of flexible screen or display like this a regular configuration in two dimensions
 or in
 regular but in three dimensions  where the thing that changes is the light not the pixels ' position
 you can play with
  type imagine your screen could just appear in different
 scales or sizes 
 different types of resolution  
 but then the the whole thing can be
  cloud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many many directions  here is
 the real flyfire control and going down to form the regular grid as before when you turn on the light actually you see this so the same as we saw before and imagine each of them then controlled 
  by people  you can have each pixel having an input that comes from people from people 's movement or so and so i want to show you something here for the first time  
  top ballet dancers the toile at metropolitan in new york and la scala in milan and actually captured his movement in 3d
 in order to use it as an input for flyfire  and here you can see
 roberto dancing  
 you see on the left the pixels the different resolutions being captured it 's both 3d scanning in real time and motion capture
  so you can reconstruct a whole movement you
 can go all the way through 
 but then once we have the pixels then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and
  so we want to use this as one of the possible inputs for flyfire 
  to show you the last project we are working on it 's something we 're working on for the london olympics  it 's called the cloud
 and the idea here is imagine again  we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment almost to impart what we call cloud raising like 
  barn raising but with a cloud imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel  and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that over
 past couple of decades  we went from the physical world to the digital one this has been digitizing everything knowledge and making that accessible through the internet 
 now today for the first time and the obama campaign showed us this we can go from the digital world from the self organizing power of networks to the physical one 
 this can be in our case we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol that means something built in a city  but
  tomorrow it can be in order to tackle today 's pressing challenges think about climate change or co2 emissions how we can go from the
 digital world to the physical one  so the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together collectively  the cloud is a cloud again made of pixels in the same way as 
 the real cloud is a cloud made of particles and those particles are water  where our cloud is a cloud of pixels it 's a physical structure in london but covered with pixels  you can move inside have different types of experiences you can
  actually see from underneath sharing the main moments for the olympics in two thousand and twelve and beyond and
 really using it as a way to connect with the community  so both the physical cloud in the sky
 and
 something you can go to the top [ of ] like london 's new mountaintop  
 you can enter inside it and a kind of new digital beacon for the night but most importantly a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top
