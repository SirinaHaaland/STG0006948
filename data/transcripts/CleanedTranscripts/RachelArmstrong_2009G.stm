  all buildings today have something in common 
 they 're made using victorian technologies  
 this involves blueprints industrial manufacturing and construction using teams of workers 
 all of this effort results in an inert object
 and that means that there is a one way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities this is not sustainable 
 i believe that the only way that it is possible for us to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities is by connecting them to nature not insulating them from it 
  in order to do this we need the right kind of language 
 living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism  
 and this is the conversion of one group of substances into another  either through the production or the absorption of energy  and this is the way in which
 living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way  so i 'm interested in the use
  of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture  
 but they don 't exist so i 'm having to make them 
 i 'm working with architect neil spiller at the bartlett school of architecture  
 and we 're collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach that means we 're generating them from scratch 
 one of our collaborators is chemist martin hanczyc  and he 's really interested
  in the transition from inert to living matter now that 's exactly the kind of process that i 'm interested in when we 're thinking about sustainable materials  
 so  martin he works with a system called the protocell now all this is
 and it 's magic is a little fatty bag  and it 's got a chemical battery in it and it has no dna  
 this little bag is able to conduct itself in a way
 that can only be described as living 
 it is able to move around its environment 
 it can follow chemical gradients it can undergo complex reactions some of which are happily architectural 
 so here we are these are protocells patterning their environment  we don 't know how they do that yet
  this is a protocell and it 's vigorously shedding this skin now this looks like a chemical kind of birth  this is a violent process 
 here we 've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into carbonate  and that 's the shell around that globular fat they are
 quite brittle so you 've only got a part of one there so what we 're trying to do is we 're trying to push these technologies
  construction approaches for architecture which contrast the current victorian top down methods which impose structure upon matter 
 that can 't be energetically sensible 
 so bottom up materials actually exist today  they 've been in use
  in architecture since ancient times if you walk around the city of oxford where we are today  and have a look at the brickwork which
  i 've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days you 'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone  and if you look even closer you 'll see in that limestone there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other and then they are fossilized over millions of years 
 now a block of limestone in itself isn 't particularly that interesting it
 looks beautiful
  but imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere
 maybe they could extract carbon dioxide 
 would it give this block of limestone new properties well most likely it would it might be able to grow it might be able to self repair and even respond to dramatic changes in the in the immediate environment  
 so  architects are never happy with just one block of an
  when we think about scaling up metabolic materials we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water 
 so one of these examples would of course be the historic city of venice  now venice as you know has a tempestuous relationship with the sea and is built upon
  so we 've devised a way by which it may be possible for the protocell technology that we 're working with to sustainably reclaim venice  
 and architect christian kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city 
 so here is the technology we have today  this is our protocell technology effectively making a shell like its limestone forefathers and depositing it in a very complex environment
  against natural materials we 're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this 
 now this is the very interesting part we don 't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals what we need it to do is to be creatively
 crafted around the wooden piles  so you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light
  the dark foundations we 've observed this in the laboratory the protocells can actually move away from the light they can actually also move towards the light you have to just choose your species so that these don 't just exist as one entity  we kind of chemically engineer them and
 so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically around the foundations of venice effectively petrifying it  
 now  this isn 't going to happen
  's going to take a while it 's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case by case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of venice  
 but gradually as the buildings are repaired we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city an accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide  
 also it will attract the
  who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture 
 so this is really interesting now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way  
 but perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere  this is
 terrestrial chemistry we 've all got it which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for first world countries 
 so in summary
 i 'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to victorian technologies and building architectures from a
