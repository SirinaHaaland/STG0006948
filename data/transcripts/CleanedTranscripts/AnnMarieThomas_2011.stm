  i 'm a huge believer in hands on education  
 but you have to have the right tools  if i 'm going to teach my daughter about electronics i 'm not going to give her a soldering iron  and similarly  she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands 
 so my wonderful student sam and
 and i decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of play doh and so we spent a summer
 looking at different play doh recipes  
 and these recipes probably look really familiar to any of you who have made homemade  play dough pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen 
 we have two favorite recipes one that has these ingredients
 and a second that had sugar instead of salt  and they 're great we can make great little sculptures with these
  these but the really cool thing about them is when we put them together 
 you see that really salty play doh well it conducts electricity  and this is nothing new it turns out that regular play doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity and high school physics teachers have used that for years  
 but our homemade play dough actually has half the resistance of commercial play doh and that sugar dough  
 well it 's one hundred and fifty times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough so what does that mean  well it means if you them together
 you suddenly have circuits
 circuits that the most creative tiny little hands can build on their own applause
 so i want to do a little demo for you 
 so if i take this salt dough again it 's like the play dough you probably made as kids and i plug it in
 's a two lead battery pack simple battery pack you can buy them at radio shack and pretty much anywhere else
 we can actually then
 light things up
 but if any of you have studied electrical engineering we can also create a short circuit if i push these together 
 the light turns off right the current wants to run through the play dough not through that led if i separate them again
  have some light  
 well now if i take that sugar dough the sugar dough doesn 't want to conduct electricity it 's like a wall to the electricity  if i place that between now all the dough is touching  
 but if i stick that light back in 
 i have light in fact i could even add some movement to my sculptures if i want a spinning tail let 's grab a motor put some play dough on it 
 stick it on
 and we have spinning
 and once you have the basics  we can make a slightly more complicated circuit  
 we call this our sushi circuit it 's very popular with kids  i plug in again the power to it 
 and now i can start talking about parallel and series circuits i can start plugging in lots of lights 
 and we can start talking about things like electrical load what happens if i put in lots
  of lights and then add a motor it 'll dim  we can even
 add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we 've done 
 you could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this 
 so this is all in your home
 actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab we have a website it 's all there these are the home recipes we 've got some videos you can make them yourselves and it 's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone 
  we 've had a mom in utah who used them with her kids to a science researcher in the u k and curriculum developers in hawaii  
  an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers but maybe we should have fun thank you
