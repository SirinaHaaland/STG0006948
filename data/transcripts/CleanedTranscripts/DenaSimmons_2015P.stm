  with my two sisters and immigrant mother  i loved our neighborhood  it was lively  there was all this
  blasting neighbors socializing on building stoops and animated conversations over domino playing 
 it was home 
 and it was sweet  
 but it wasn 't simple in
 fact everyone at school knew the block where we lived because it was where people came to buy weed and other drugs and with
  comes conflict so we often went to sleep
 to the sound of gunshots  
 i spent much of my childhood worried worried about our safety 
 and so did our mother she worried that the violence we witnessed would overtake our
  that our poverty meant that the neighbors with whom we lived and shared space would harm us 
 our entire life was in the bronx but my mother 's anxiety spurred her into action and soon
 we were driving so fast to connecticut to boarding school campuses with full scholarships in tow
  don 't underestimate the power of a mother determined to keep her children safe 
 at boarding school 
 for the first time i was able to sleep without worry 
 i could leave my dorm room unlocked  walk barefoot in the grass
  and look up to see a night sky full of stars  
 happy novelties  
 but there were other novelties as well 
 very quickly  
 i felt like i didn 't belong  
 i learned that i didn 't speak the right way and to demonstrate the proper ways of speaking my teachers gave me frequent
  lessons in public  on the appropriate way to enunciate certain words 
 a teacher once instructed me in the hallway 
 she said this loudly dena it 's not ' axing ' like you 're running around with an axe
  's silly now at this point  you can imagine the snickers of my classmates 
 but she continued 
 think about breaking the word into ' ass ' and ' king ' and then put the two together to say it correctly
  there were some other moments that reminded me that i didn 't belong 
 once  i walked into a classmate 's dorm room  and i watched her watch her valuables around me 
 like why would she do that i thought to myself  
 and then
 there was the time when another classmate walked
  as i was applying hair grease to my scalp 
 there is emotional damage done when young people can 't be themselves 
 when they are forced to edit who they are in order to be acceptable 
 it 's a kind of violence  
 ultimately
  a quintessential success story  i attended boarding school and college in new england studied abroad in chile
 and returned to the bronx to be a middle school teacher i received a truman scholarship a fulbright
 and a soros fellowship and i could list more
  then i landed a job at yale 
 i am proud of everything that i 've been able to accomplish on my journey thus far 
 i have eternal imposter syndrome  either i 've been invited because i 'm a token which really isn
  about me but rather about a box someone needed to check off 
 or  i am exceptional  which means i 've had to leave the people i love behind 
 it 's the price that i and so many others pay for learning while
  i police myself
 all the time 
 are my pants too tight  
 should i wear my hair up or in a fro  
 should i speak up for myself or will the power of my words be reduced to she 's angry
 why did i have to leave the bronx to gain access to a better education 
 and why 
 in the process of getting that better education did i have to endure the trauma of erasing what made
 me me
 a black girl from the bronx  raised by an antiguan mother
 so when i think about our current education reform initiatives  i can 't help asking 
 what are our students of color learning about themselves 
 three
 three decades of research reveal that students of color are suspended and expelled at a rate three times greater than white
  students and are punished in harsher ways for the same
 infractions 
 they also learn this through the absence of their lives and narratives in the curricula 
 the cooperative children 's book center did a review of nearly four thousand books
  and they further learn this through the lack of teachers that look like them 
 an analysis of data from the national center for education statistics
 found that forty five percent
 of our nation 's pre k to high school students were people of color while only seventeen percent
 of our teachers are
 our youth of color pay a profound price when their schooling sends them the message that they must be controlled 
 that they must leave their identities at home in order to be successful 
 every child deserves an education that guarantees
  the safety
 to learn in the comfort of one 's
 own
 skin 
 it is possible to create emotionally and physically safe classrooms where students also thrive academically  
  i know because i did it in my classroom when i returned to teach in the bronx so what did that look like 
 i centered my instruction on the lives  histories and identities of my students  
 and i did all of this because i wanted my students to know that everyone around them
 was supporting them to be their best self 
 so while i could
  not
 control the instability of their homes the uncertainty of their next meal or the loud neighbors that kept them from sleep 
 i provided them with a loving classroom that made them feel proud of who they are that made them know
 that they mattered you know
  time i hear or say the word asking 
 i am in high school again  
 i am thinking about ass and king 
 and putting the two together so that i speak in a way where someone in power will want to listen
 there is a better way one that doesn 't force kids of color into a double bind 
 a way for them to preserve their ties to their families  homes and communities 
 a way that teaches them
 to trust their instincts
 and to have faith in their own creative
  genius  thank you
