  when i was about sixteen years old
 i can remember flipping through channels at home during summer vacation looking for a movie to watch on hbo and how many of you remember ferris bueller 's day off 
  i saw matthew broderick on the screen and so i thought sweet ferris bueller i 'll watch this it
 wasn 't ferris bueller and forgive me matthew broderick i know you 've done other movies besides ferris bueller but that 's how i remember you you 're ferris  but you weren 't doing ferris y things at the time you were
 doing gay things at the time  he was in a movie called torch song trilogy and torch song trilogy was based on a play
 about this drag queen who essentially was looking for love
  love love and respect that 's what the whole film was about 
 and as i 'm watching it i 'm realizing that they 're talking about me not the drag queen part i am not shaving my hair for anyone
 but
 the gay part the finding love and respect  the part about trying to find your place in the world 
 so as i 'm watching this i see this powerful scene
  brought me to tears and it stuck with me for the past  twenty five years and there 's this quote that the main character  arnold  tells his mother
 as they 're fighting about
 who he is and the life that he lives 
 there 's one thing more there 's just one more thing you better understand  i 've taught myself to
 sew cook fix plumbing
  furniture i can even pat myself on the back when necessary all so i don 't have to ask anyone
 for anything there 's nothing i need from anyone except for love
 and respect and anyone who can 't give me those two things has no place in my life i remember that
  i was sixteen i was in tears  i was in the closet and i 'm looking at these two people ferris bueller and some guy i 'd never seen before 
 fighting for love 
 when i finally got to a place in my life where i came out and accepted who i was and was really quite happy to tell you the truth i was happily gay and i guess that 's supposed to be right because gay means happy too  
  there were a lot of people who weren 't as gay as i was gay being happy not gay being attracted to the same sex in fact i heard that there was a lot of hate
 and a lot of anger and a lot of frustration and a lot of fear
 about who i was and the gay lifestyle now i 'm sitting here trying to figure
  and i keep hearing this word over and over and over again lifestyle lifestyle lifestyle  i 've even heard politicians say that the gay lifestyle is a greater threat
 to civilization than terrorism that 's when i got scared because i 'm thinking  if i 'm gay
 and i 'm doing something that 's going to destroy civilization i need to figure out what this stuff is and i need to stop doing it right now
  so i took a look at my life a hard look at my life  and i saw some things very disturbing 
 and i want to begin sharing these evil things that i 've been doing with you starting with my mornings
  do i drink coffee i know other gay people who drink coffee  
 i get stuck in traffic
 evil evil traffic sometimes i get stuck in lines at airports  
 i look around and i go my god look at all these gay people we 're all trapped in these lines these long
  lines trying to get on an airplane my god this lifestyle that i 'm living is so freaking evil 
 i clean up  this is not an actual photograph of my son 's room his is messier  
 and because i have a 15 year old all i do is cook and cook and cook any parents out there of teenagers 
 all we do is cook for these people they eat
 two three four dinners a night it 's ridiculous
 this is the gay lifestyle
  and after i 'm done cooking and cleaning and and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic 
 my partner and i we get together
 and we decide that we 're gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun
  're usually in bed before we find out who 's eliminated on american idol 
 we have to wake up and find out the next day who 's still on because we 're too freaking tired
 to hear who stays on this is the super duper evil gay lifestyle  run for your heterosexual lives people
  and i
 first started dating he told me this story about penguins  and
 i didn 't know where he was going with it at first he was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me but he told me that
 when a penguin finds a mate that they want to spend the rest of their life with they present them with a pebble
  perfect pebble and then he reaches into his pocket  and he brings this out to me  
 and i looked at it and i was like  this is really cool and he says i want to spend the rest of my life with you 
 so i wear this whenever i have
  i wear this when i am apart from him for a long period of time  and sometimes i just wear it just because 
 how many people out there are in love anyone in love out there 
 you might be gay 
 because i too am in love and apparently that 's part of the gay lifestyle that i warned you about
 you may want to tell your spouse 
 who if they 're in love might be gay as well  how many of you are single 
 any single people out there you too might be gay 
 because i know some gay people who are also single  it 's really scary this gay lifestyle thing it 's super duper evil and there
  's no end to it it goes and goes and engulfs it
 's really quite silly isn 't it that 's why i 'm so happy to finally hear president obama
 come out and say 
  a wonderful day in our country 's history it 's a wonderful day in the globe 's history to be able to have an actual sitting president say enough of this
 first to himself  and then to the rest of the world  it 's wonderful 
 but there 's something that 's been disturbing me since he made that remark just a short time ago  
 and that is apparently  this is just
  another move by
 the gay activists that 's on the gay agenda  
 and i 'm disturbed by this because i 've been openly gay now for quite some time  
 i 've been to all of the functions i 've been to fundraisers i 've written about the topic and i have yet to receive my copy of this gay agenda 
 i 've paid my dues on time
 i 've marched in gay pride flags parades and the whole nine  and i 've yet to see a copy of the gay 
  agenda it 's very very frustrating and i was feeling left out like i wasn 't quite gay enough 
  and i came across
 a bootleg copy of the official gay agenda  
 and i said to myself lz for so long you have been denied this 
 when you get in front of this crowd  you 're gonna share the news  
 you 're gonna spread the gay agenda so no one else has to wonder what exactly
  what are these gays up to what do they want 
 so without further ado  i will present to you ladies and gentlemen now be careful ' cause it 's evil
 a copy the official copy of the gay agenda
  you soak it all in the gay agenda some of you may be calling it what 
 the constitution of the united states is that what you call it too the u s constitution is
 the gay agenda  these gays people like me
  want to be treated like full citizens  and it 's all written down
 in plain sight  
 i was blown away when i saw it i was like  wait  this is the gay agenda  why didn 't you just call it the constitution so i knew what you were talking about 
 i wouldn 't have been so confused i wouldn 't have been so upset  
 but
 there it is the gay agenda  run for your heterosexual lives
  did you know that in all the states where there is no shading that
 people who are gay  lesbian bisexual or transgendered can be kicked out of their apartments for being gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered  
 that 's the only reason that a landlord needs
 to have them removed because there 's no protection from discrimination
  of glbt people 
 did you know in the states where there 's no shading that you can be fired
 for being gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered not based upon
 the quality of your work how long you 've been there if you stink just if you 're gay
 bisexual or transgendered  all of which flies in the face
 of the gay agenda  also known as the u s constitution  
 specifically this little amendment right here 
 no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens
 of the united states
 i 'm looking at you north carolina  but you 're not looking at the u s constitution  
 this is the gay agenda  equality not special rights  but the rights that were already written
 by these people these elitists if you will
  some would dare say questionably dressed 
 nonetheless 
 our forefathers right the people that we say knew what they were doing when they wrote the constitution the gay agenda  if you will 
 all of that flies in the face
 of what they did
  that is the reason why i felt it was imperative that i presented you
 with this copy of the gay agenda  
 because i figured if i made it funny  you wouldn 't be as threatened 
 i figured if i was a bit irreverent  you wouldn 't find it serious  but when you see the map  
 and you see our state of michigan
 it 's legal
 to fire someone
 for being gay  lesbian bisexual or transgendered that it 's legal to remove someone from their home
 because they 're gay lesbian  bisexual or transgendered  then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality
 is not about stripping someone 's rights away
  away it 's about granting them the rights that [ have ] already been stated 
 and we 're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated that we 've already agreed upon 
 there are people
 living in fear
 of losing their jobs
 so they don 't show anyone
 who they really are
 right here at home  this isn 't just about north carolina  all those states
 that were clear  it 's legal 
 if i could brag for a second i have a 15 year old son
 from my marriage he has a four point
  he is starting a new club at school policy debate  
 he 's a budding track star 
 he has almost every single record in middle school for every event that he competed in 
 he volunteers he prays before he eats  
  to think as his father and he lives with me primarily
 that i had a little something to do with all of that i would like to think that he 's a good boy a respectful young man
 i would like to think that
 i 've proven to be a capable father 
 but if i were to go to the state of michigan today and try to adopt a young
  person
 who is in an orphanage  i would be disqualified for only one reason because i 'm gay it
 doesn 't matter what i 've already proven what i can do with my heart  
 it 's because of what the state of michigan says that i am that i am disqualified
 for any sort of adoption
  and that 's not just about me 
 that 's about so many other michiganders u s citizens 
 who don 't understand why what they are
 is so much more significant
 than who they are 
  this story just keeps playing over and over and over again in our country 's history 
 there was a time in which i don 't know people who were black couldn 't have the same rights 
 people who happened to be women didn 't have the same rights couldn 't vote 
 there was a point in our history in which if you were considered disabled that an employer could just fire you before the americans with disabilities act
  we keep doing this over and over again
