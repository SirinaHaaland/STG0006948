  talking about designing humor which is sort of an interesting thing but it goes to some of the
 discussions about constraints and how in certain contexts humor is right and in other contexts it 's wrong  now i
 'm from new york so it 's one hundred percent satisfaction
 actually that 's ridiculous because
 when it comes to humor seventy five percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for nobody is ever satisfied one hundred percent with humor
 except this woman
  that part of the relationship went fine 
 laughter now let 's look at this
  things i 'm pointing out is that cartoons appear within the context of the new yorker magazine that lovely caslon type and it seems like a fairly benign cartoon within this context 
  it 's making a little bit fun of getting older and you know people might like it but like i said you cannot satisfy everyone you couldn 't satisfy this guy 
 yorker is rather a sensitive environment very easy
 for people to get their nose out of joint and one of the things
 that you realize is it 's an unusual environment  here i 'm one person talking to you you 're all collective  you all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh in the new yorker it goes out to
 a wide audience and when you actually look
  that and
 nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at and when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor is really interesting let 's look at this cartoon 
 discouraging data on the antidepressant 
 indeed it is discouraging now  you would think well look most
  was funny in general that seems like a funny cartoon but let 's look what online survey i did 
 generally about  eighty five percent of the people liked it a hundred and nine voted it a ten the highest ten voted it one  but look at the individual responses 
 i like animals look how much they like them 
 i don 't want to hurt them that doesn 't seem very funny to me
  to people like this i point out we use anesthetic ink 
 other people thought it was funny that actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor when you don 't have the contagion of humor  
 humor is a type of entertainment 
 all entertainment contains a little frisson of danger something that might happen wrong and yet we like it when there 's protection
  's what a zoo is it 's danger the tiger is there the bars protect us  that 's sort of fun right  that 's a bad zoo it 's
 a very politically correct zoo  but it 's a bad zoo but this is a worse one 
 so in dealing with humor in the context of the new yorker
  you have to see where is that tiger going to be where is the danger going to exist how are you going to manage it  
 my job is to look at one thousand cartoons a week  but the new yorker only can take sixteen or seventeen cartoons  
 and we have one thousand cartoons of course many many cartoons must be rejected now we could fit more cartoons in the magazine
 if we removed the articles
 i feel that would be a huge loss  
 one i could live with but still huge 
 cartoonists come in through the magazine every week the average cartoonist who stays with the magazine does ten or fifteen ideas every week  but
 they mostly are going to be rejected that 's the nature of any creative activity
 many of them fade away 
 some of them stay matt diffee is one of them here 's one of his cartoons 
 drew dernavich accounting night at the improv now is the part of the show when we ask the audience to shout out some random numbers
  i know all about rejection because when i quit actually i was booted out of psychology school and decided to become a cartoonist a natural segue 
 from one thousand nine hundred and seventy four to one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven i submitted two thousand cartoons to the new yorker and got two thousand cartoons rejected by the new yorker
 at a certain point  this rejection slip
  i broke into the new yorker and started selling cartoons finally in one thousand nine hundred and eighty i received the revered new yorker contract which i blurred out parts because it 's none of your business
  idea drawings  nowhere in the contract is the word cartoon mentioned 
 the word idea drawings and that  that 's the sine qua non of new yorker cartoons  so what is an idea drawing an idea drawing is something
 that
 requires you to think now that 's not a cartoon  it requires thinking on the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part to make it into a cartoon
  you get my cast of cartoon mind there is no justice in the world there is some justice in the world the world is just 
 this is what lemmings believe
  new yorker and i when we made comments
  the cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is what is it the cartoon is it really about lemmings no it 's about us  
 you know it 's my view basically about religion that the the real
 conflict and all the fights between religion is who
  and this is my most well known cartoon no thursday 's out how about never is never good for you it 's
 been reprinted thousands of times totally ripped off  it 's even on thongs
  but compressed to how about never is never good for you 
 now these look like very different forms of humor but actually they bear a great
  similarity  in each instance our expectations are defied  
 in each instance  the narrative gets switched there 's an incongruity and a contrast in no thursday 's out how about never is never good for you what you have is the syntax of politeness and the message of being rude  
 that really is how
  humor works it 's a cognitive synergy where we mash up these two things which don 't go together and temporarily in our minds exist he is both being polite and rude  
 in here  you have the propriety of the new yorker and the vulgarity of the language basically that 's the way humor works so i 'm a humor analyst you would say now 
 e b white said analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog nobody is much interested and the frog dies  
  there won 't be any genocide but really it makes me
 let 's look at this picture this is an interesting picture  the laughing audience there are
 the people fops up there but everybody is laughing everybody is laughing except one guy  
 this guy  who is he he 's the critic 
 he 's the critic of humor  and really i 'm forced to be in that
  position when i 'm at the new yorker and that 's the danger that i will become
 this guy  now here 's a little video made by matt diffee  sort of how they imagine if we really exaggerated that
  many cartoons so many that there are many books called the rejection collection the rejection collection is not quite new yorker kind of humor and you might notice
 the bum on the sidewalk here who is boozing and his ventriloquist dummy is puking see that 's probably not going to be new yorker humor 
 it 's actually put together by matt diffee one of our cartoonists
  you have an interesting the guilty laugh the laugh against your better judgment
  cartoons you never saw and never will see in the new yorker this humor is perfect i 'm going to explain why there 's a concept about humor about it being a benign violation 
 in other words for something to be funny we 've got to think it 's both wrong and also okay at the same time  if we think it 's completely wrong we say that 's not
  if it 's completely okay what 's the joke  okay  and so this benign  that 's true of no thursday 's out how about never is never good for you it 's rude the world really shouldn 't be 
  that way within that context  we feel it 's okay  so within this context 
  the violation
  it doesn 't work there is no such thing as funny in and of itself  everything will be within the context and our expectations 
 one way to look at it is this it 's
 sort of called a meta motivational theory about how we look a theory about motivation and the mood we 're in and how the mood we 're in determines the things we like or dislike 
 when we 're in a playful mood we want excitement  we want high arousal
  feel excited then if we 're in a purposeful mood that makes us anxious 
 the rejection collection
 is absolutely in this field you want to be stimulated you want to be aroused you want to be transgressed
 it 's like this like an amusement
  is both in danger and safe  incredibly aroused there 's no joke no joke needed  if you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough they will laugh at very very little 
 this is another cartoon from the rejection collection
  cartoon about terrorism the new yorker occupies a very different space it
 's a space that is playful in its own way and also purposeful and in that space  
 the cartoons are different 
 now i 'm going to show you cartoons the new yorker did right after nine eleven a very very sensitive area when humor could be used how would the new yorker attack it it would not be with a guy with a
 or there was another cartoon i didn 't show because actually i thought maybe people would be offended  
 the great sam gross cartoon  this happened
 after the muhammad controversy where it 's muhammad in heaven the suicide bomber is all in little pieces and he 's saying to the suicide bomber you 'll get the
  better left undrawn 
 the first week we did no cartoons 
 that was a black hole for humor and correctly so it 's not always appropriate every time
  but the next week this was the first cartoon i thought i 'd never laugh again then i saw your jacket 
 it basically was about if we were alive we were going to laugh
 we were going to breathe we were going to exist here 's another one i figure if i don 't have that third martini then the terrorists win 
 these cartoons are not about them they 're about us 
 the humor reflects back on us the easiest thing to do with humor  and it 's perfectly legitimate is
 a friend makes fun of an enemy  it 's called dispositional humor  it 's
 ninety five percent of the humor  it 's not our humor here 's another cartoon i wouldn 't mind living in a fundamentalist islamic state
  target is us the target is the readership and the people who do it the humor is self reflective and makes us think about our assumptions 
 look at this cartoon by roz chast the guy reading the obituary two years younger than you twelve years older than you  three years your junior 
 your age on the dot exactly your age 
  a deeply profound cartoon  
 and so the new yorker is also trying to in some way make cartoons say something besides funny and something about us here
 's another one i started my vegetarianism for health reasons  then it became a moral choice and now it 's just to annoy people 
 excuse me i think there 's something wrong with this in a tiny way that no
  one other than me would ever be able to pinpoint 
 so it focuses on our obsessions our narcissism our foils and our foibles really not someone else 's the
 new yorker demands
 some cognitive work on your part and what it demands is what arthur koestler who wrote the act of creation about the relationship between humor
 and science is what 's called bisociation you have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference  and you have to do it quickly to understand the cartoon  if 
  the different frames of reference don 't come together in about 5 seconds it 's not funny but i think they will for you here different frames of reference 
  and this is einstein in bed to you it was fast
  now there are some cartoons that are puzzling like this cartoon would puzzle many people 
 how many people know what this cartoon means 
 the dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk this is the signal for a
  that 's why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year called i don 't get it the new yorker cartoon i q test 
 the other thing the new yorker plays around with is incongruity and incongruity i 've shown you is sort of the basis of humor  something that 's completely normal or logical isn 't going to be funny  
 but the way incongruity works is observational humor is humor within the realm of reality my boss is always telling me what to do
 okay  that could happen it 's humor within the realm of reality  here  cowboy to a cow very impressive i 'd like to find
 five thousand more like you 
 we understand that it 's absurd but we 're putting the two together  here in the nonsense range 
 damn it hopkins didn 't you get yesterday 's memo
  now that 's a little puzzling right it doesn 't quite come together 
 in general people who enjoy more nonsense enjoy more abstract art 
 they tend to be liberal less conservative that type of stuff  but for us and for me helping design the humor it doesn 't make any sense to compare one to the other it 's sort of a smorgasbord that 's made
  so i want to sum all this up with a caption to a cartoon
 and i think this sums up the whole thing really about the new yorker cartoons it
 sort of makes you stop and think doesn 't it and
 now when you look at new yorker cartoons i 'd like you to stop and think a little bit more about
