  here 's the most important economic fact of our time 
 we are living in an age of surging income inequality  particularly between those at the very top and everyone else 
 this shift is the most striking in the
  in the u k but it 's a global phenomenon it 's happening in communist china in formerly communist russia it 's happening in india 
 in my own native canada we 're even seeing it in cozy social democracies like sweden  finland and germany  
 let me give you a few numbers to place what 's happening
  the one percent accounted for about ten percent of the national income in the united states 
 today their share has more than doubled to above twenty percent 
 but what 's even more striking is what 's happening at the very tippy top of the income distribution the zero point one percent in the
  account for more than eight percent of the national income they are where the one percent was thirty years ago
 let me give you another number to put that in perspective  and this is a figure that was calculated in two thousand and five by robert reich  
 the secretary of labor in the clinton administration 
 reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich
  bill gates and warren buffett 
 and he found that it was equivalent to the wealth of the bottom forty percent of the u s population one hundred and twenty million people  
 now as it happens warren buffett is not only himself a plutocrat he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon  and he has his own favorite
  the combined wealth of the people on the forbes four hundred list and this is the list of the four hundred richest americans was three hundred billion dollars 
  just think about it you didn 't even need to be a billionaire to get on that list in one thousand nine 
  today that figure has more than quintupled to one point seven trillion and i probably
  don 't need to tell you that we haven 't seen anything similar happen to the middle class whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased
  so we 're living in the age of the global plutocracy  
 but we 've been slow to notice it 
 one of the reasons i think is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon  changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice
  their ultimate impact is quite dramatic think about what happened after all to the poor frog  but i think there 's something else going on  
 talking about income inequality even if you 're not on the forbes four hundred list can make us feel uncomfortable 
 it feels less positive less optimistic to talk about how the pie is sliced than to think about how to make the pie bigger  
 and if you do
  happen to be on the forbes four hundred list  talking about income distribution 
 and inevitably its cousin income redistribution can be downright threatening  
 so we 're living in the age of surging income inequality  especially at the top 
 what 's driving it  and what can we do about it 
 one set of causes is political
  lower taxes deregulation particularly of financial services  privatization
  weaker legal protections for trade unions 
 all of these have contributed to more and more income going to the very very top a lot of these political factors can be broadly
  but don 't actually do much good for the rest of us 
 in practice getting rid of crony capitalism is incredibly difficult 
 think of all the years reformers of various stripes have tried to get rid of corruption in russia for instance or how hard it is
  the banks even after the most profound financial crisis since the great depression 
 or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies
  including those whose motto might be don 't do evil to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that paid by the middle class  
 but while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice is really really hard at least intellectually  it 's an easy problem
  one is actually in favor of crony capitalism  
 indeed this is one of those rare issues that unites the left and the right 
 a critique of crony capitalism is as central to the tea party as it is to occupy wall street 
 but if crony capitalism is
  intellectually at least the easy part of the problem  things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers of surging income inequality in
 and of themselves  these aren 't too mysterious 
 globalization and the technology revolution 
 the twin economic transformations which are changing our lives and transforming the global economy are also powering the rise
  just think about it 
 for the first time in history if you are an energetic entrepreneur with a brilliant new idea or a fantastic new product you have almost 
 instant almost frictionless access to a global market of more than a billion people 
 the latest poster boy for this phenomenon is david karp the 
  founder of tumblr recently sold his company to yahoo for one point one billion dollars  think about that for a minute 
 one point one billion dollars twenty six years old  
 it 's easiest to see how the technology revolution and globalization are
  creating this sort of superstar effect in highly visible fields like sports and entertainment 
 we can all watch how a fantastic athlete or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills across the global economy as never before 
 but today that superstar effect is happening across the entire economy  we have superstar technologists
  have superstar bankers  we have superstar lawyers and superstar architects there are superstar cooks and superstar farmers there are even and this is my personal favorite example superstar dentists 
 the most dazzling exemplar of whom is bernard touati  the frenchman who ministers to the smiles of fellow superstars like russian oligarch roman abramovich
  fashion designer diane von furstenberg  but while it 's pretty easy to see how globalization and the technology revolution
 are creating this global plutocracy what 's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it  
 and that 's because in contrast with crony capitalism so much of what globalization and the technology revolution have done is highly positive
  let 's start with technology  
 i love the internet i love my mobile devices  i love the fact that they mean that whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk far beyond this auditorium 
 i 'm even more of a fan of globalization 
 this is the transformation which has lifted hundreds of millions of the world 's poorest people out of poverty and into the middle class
  if you happen to live in the rich part of the world it 's made
 many new products affordable who do you think built your iphone
  and things that we 've relied on for a long time much cheaper think of your dishwasher or your t shirt 
 so what 's not to like well a few things one of the things that worries me is how easily what you might call meritocratic
  plutocracy can become crony plutocracy 
 imagine you 're a brilliant entrepreneur who has successfully sold that idea or that product to the global billions and become a billionaire in the process  
 it gets tempting at that point to use your economic nous
 to manipulate the rules of the global political economy in your own favor
 and that 's no mere hypothetical example 
 think about amazon  apple  google starbucks these are among the world 's most admired most beloved most innovative companies 
 they also happen to be particularly adept at working the international tax system so as to lower their tax bill
  and why stop at just playing the global political and economic system as it exists to your own maximum advantage once you have
 the tremendous economic power that we 're seeing at the very very top of the income distribution
 and the political power that inevitably entails  
 it becomes tempting as well to start trying to change the rules of the game in your own favor
  this is no mere hypothetical it 's what the russian oligarchs did
 in creating the sale of the century privatization of russia 's natural resources it
 's one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the u s and the u k 
 a second thing that worries me is how easily meritocratic plutocracy
  one way of describing the plutocrats is as alpha geeks and they are people who are acutely aware of how important highly sophisticated analytical and quantitative skills are in today 's economy 
 that 's why they are spending unprecedented time and resources educating their own children 
 the middle class is spending more on schooling
  but in the global educational arms race that starts at nursery school and ends at harvard stanford or mit  the ninety nine percent is increasingly outgunned by the one percent 
 the result is something that economists alan krueger and miles corak call the great gatsby curve 
 as income inequality increases social mobility decreases
  the plutocracy may be a meritocracy  but increasingly you have to be born on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race 
 the third thing and this is what worries me the most is the extent to which those same largely positive forces which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy
 also happen to be hollowing out the middle class in western industrialized economies  let 's start with technology
  those same forces that are creating billionaires are also devouring many traditional middle class jobs when 's the last time you used a travel agent  
 and in contrast with the industrial revolution the titans of our new economy aren 't creating that many new jobs 
 at its zenith g m employed hundreds of thousands  facebook fewer than ten thousand
 the same is true of globalization 
 for all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the emerging markets it
 's also outsourcing a lot of jobs from the developed western economies  the terrifying reality is that there is no economic rule which automatically translates
 increased economic growth into widely shared prosperity
 that 's shown in what i consider to be the most scary economic statistic of our time since the late 
 increases in productivity have been decoupled from increases in wages and employment 
 that means that our countries are getting richer our companies are getting more efficient
  but we 're not creating more jobs and we 're not paying people as a whole more one
 scary conclusion you could draw from all of this is to worry about structural unemployment 
 what worries me more is a different nightmare scenario  
 after all in a totally free labor market we could find jobs for pretty much everyone 
 the dystopia that worries me is a universe in which
 a few geniuses invent
  google and its ilk
 and the rest of us are employed giving them massages  
 so when i get really depressed about all of this i comfort myself in thinking about the industrial revolution  
 after all for all its grim  satanic mills it worked out pretty well  didn 't it  after all 
 all of us here are richer
  healthier  taller well  there are a few exceptions and live longer
 than our ancestors in the early  19th century  but it 's important to remember
 that before we learned how to share the fruits of the industrial revolution with the broad swathes of society we had to go through
  two world wars 
 communist revolutions in russia and in china  and an era of tremendous social and political upheaval in the west  
 we also not coincidentally
 went through an era of tremendous social and political inventions  we created the modern welfare state  we created public education  we created public health
  care  we created public pensions  we created unions  
 today we are living through an era of economic transformation comparable in its scale and its scope to the industrial revolution 
 to be sure that this new economy benefits us all and not just the plutocrats we need to embark on an era of comparably ambitious social and political change
 we need a new new deal
