  when we 're designing new products services or businesses the only time you 'll know if they 're any good if the designs are good 
 is to see how they 're used
 in the real world in
  i 'm reminded of that every time i walk past highbury fields in north london it
 's absolutely beautiful there 's a big open green space there 's georgian buildings around the side 
 but then there 's this mud trap that cuts across the middle 
 people clearly don 't want to walk all the way around the edge  instead they want to take the shortcut  and that shortcut is 
  this shortcut is called a desire path  
 and it 's often the path of least resistance  i find them fascinating because they 're often the point where design
 and user experience diverge 
 now at this point i should apologize because you guys are going to start seeing these everywhere  but today i 'm going to pick three i find interesting and share
 what actually it reminds me about launching new products and services the first is in the capital city of brazil
  brasilia  and it reminds me that sometimes you have to just focus on designing for a real need
 at low friction  
 now brasilia is fascinating it was designed by niemeyer in the ' 50s it was the golden age of flying so he laid it out like a plane as you can see there  
 slightly worryingly he put most of
  important government buildings in the cockpit 
 but if you zoom in in the very center of brasilia just where the point is there 
 you see it 's littered with desire paths they 're absolutely everywhere  
 now they thought that they had future proofed this design they thought in the future we wouldn 't need to walk anywhere
 we 'd be able to drive so there was little need for walkways or pavements  but as you can
  there 's a real need 
 these are very dangerous desire paths if we just pick one in the middle you can see it crosses fifteen lanes of traffic 
 it won 't surprise you guys that brasilia has five times the pedestrian accident rate
 of your average us city 
 people are resourceful they 'll always find the low friction route to save money save time 
 not all these desire paths are dangerous i was reminded flying here when i was in
  heathrow many of us get frustrated when we 're confronted with the obligatory walk through duty free 
 it was amazing to me how many people refused to take the long meandering path to the left and just cut through to the right  cut through the desire path 
 the question that 's interesting is what do designers think when they see our behavior here do they think we 're stupid
 do they think we 're lazy 
 or do they accept that this is the only truth this is their product we 're effectively co designing their product  so our job
 is to design for real needs at low friction  because if you don 't the customer will anyway  
 the second desire path i wanted to share is at the university of california  and it reminds me that sometimes
  the best way to come up with a great design
 is just to launch it 
 now university campuses are fantastic for spotting desire paths i think it 's because students are always late and they 're pretty smart  
 so they 're dashing to lectures they 'll always find the shortcut  
 and the designers here knew that  so they built the buildings
 and then they waited a few months for the paths to form
  then paved them 
 incredibly smart approach in fact often just launching the straw man of a service can teach you what people really want 
 for example ayr muir in boston knew he wanted to open a restaurant  but where should it be 
 what should the menu be he launched a service
  in this case a food truck  and he changed the location each day he 'd write a different menu on the side in a whiteboard marker
 to figure out what people wanted 
 he now has a chain of restaurants  so it can be incredibly efficient to launch something to spot the desire paths  
 the third and final desire path i wanted to share with you is the 
 it reminds me that the world 's
  and we have to respond to those changes  
 so as you 'll guess this is a hospital 
 i 've marked for you on the left the oncology department the patients would usually stay in the hotels down on the bottom right 
 this was a patient centered organization so they laid on cars for their patients  but what they realized when they started offering chemotherapy
 is the patients rarely wanted to get in cars they were too nauseous so they 'd walk back to
  hotels this desire path that you see diagonally formed  the patients even called it the chemo trail 
 now when the hospital saw this originally they tried to lay turf back over it ignore it  
 but after a while they realized it was an important
 need they were meeting for their patients so they paved it and i think our job is often to pave these emerging desire paths if we look back at the one
 in north london again that desire path hasn 't always been there 
 the reason it sprung up is people were traveling to the mighty arsenal football club stadium on game days from the underground station you see on the bottom right  
 so you see the desire path if we just wind the clock back a few years when the stadium was being
  there is no desire path  
 so our job is to watch for these desire paths emerging 
 and where appropriate pave them as someone did here  
 someone installed a barrier 
 people started walking across and round the bottom as you see and they paved it 
 laughter but i think this is a wonderful reminder as well that actually the world
  's constantly changing because if you look at the top of this image there 's another desire path forming  so these three desire paths remind me
 we need to design for real human needs 
 i think empathy for what your customers want is probably the biggest leading indicator of business success 
 design for real needs and design them in low friction
  because if you don 't offer them in low friction  
 someone else will often the customer 
 secondly often the best way to learn what people really want is to launch your service  the answer is rarely inside the building 
 get out there and see what people really want  
 and finally in part because of technology the world is incredibly flux at the moment it 's changing constantly 
 these desire paths are going to spring up faster than ever 
 our job
 is to pick the appropriate ones and pave over them  thank you very much
