  i 've come here to share with you an experiment
 of how to get rid of one form of human suffering it really is a story of dr venkataswamy
  and his message is about the aravind eye care system  i think first it 's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind
  a big part of it but i think it also deprives the person
 of their livelihood their dignity their independence and their status in the family so she is just one amongst the millions who are blind 
 and the irony is that they don 't need to be a simple
 well proven surgery can restore sight to millions and something even simpler a pair of glasses can make millions more see
  if we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses then almost one in five indians
 will require eye care a staggering two hundred million people  today we 're reaching
 not even ten percent of them so this is the context in which aravind
  started this with
 no money he had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan and over time we have grown into a network of
 five hospitals  predominately in the state of tamil nadu and puducherry  and then we added several  what we call vision centers
  and then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well  
 the last three decades  we have done
 about three and a half million surgeries a vast majority of them
 for the poor people now  each year we perform about three hundred thousand surgeries 
 a typical day at aravind  we would do about a thousand surgeries
  see about six thousand patients
  send out teams into the villages to examine bring back patients
  lots of telemedicine consultations and on top of that do a lot of training both for doctors and
 technicians
 who will become the future staff of
  and doing it well requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work 
 and i think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by dr v 
 a value system an efficient delivery process  and fostering the the culture of innovation
  you seem to be one with
 him here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence doctor whatever you say i accept it  an implicit
  faith in you
 and then you respond to it here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me i must do my best for her 
 when we grow in spiritual consciousness 
 we identify ourselves with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation it
 is ourselves we are helping it is ourselves
  this helped us build
 a very ethical and very highly patient centric organization
 and systems that that support it  but on a practical level you also have to deliver services efficiently  and
  a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in
  he kept talking about mcdonalds and hamburgers and none of it made any sense to us 
 he wanted to create a franchise a mechanism of delivery of eye care
 with the efficiency of mcdonald 's dr v supposing i 'm able to produce
  think about it  i think the the eyeball is the same
 as american or african the problem is the same  the treatment is the same  and yet why should there be so much
 variation in quality and in service and that was the fundamental
 principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems and of course  the challenge was that it 's a huge problem we are talking of millions of people
  very little resource to to deal with it  and then
 lots of logistics and and affordability issues  and then so one had to constantly innovate  
 and one of the early innovations which still continues is to create ownership in the community to the problem  
 and then engage
 with them as a partner and here is one such event here a community camp just organized
  by the
 community themselves where they find a place organize volunteers  and then we 'll do our part you know check their vision  
 and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done 
 and then those tests are done by
 technicians
 who check for glasses
  or check for glaucoma  
 and then with all these results  the doctor makes a final diagnosis  and then prescribes a line of treatment 
 and if they need a pair of glasses they are available right there at the camp site  usually under a tree  
 but they get glasses
  in the frames of their choice and that 's very important because i think glasses in addition to
 helping people see is also a fashion statement and they 're willing to pay for it  
 so they get it in about twenty minutes and those who require surgery 
 are counseled and then there are buses waiting  
 which will
 transport them to
  and if it was not for this
 kind of logistics and support many people like this would probably never get services and certainly
 not when they most need it  they receive surgery the following day
 and then they will stay for a day or two  and then they are put back on the buses
 to be taken back to where they came from and where their families will be waiting to
 take them back home
 and this happens several thousand times
 each year 
 it may sound impressive that we 're seeing lots of patients very efficient process  but we looked at are we solving the problem
 we did a study a scientifically designed process and then to our dismay we found
  this was only reaching seven percent of those in need 
 and we 're not adequately addressing more bigger problems  so we had to do something different so we set up what we call
 primary eye care centers vision centers these are truly paperless offices with
 completely electronic medical records and so on  they receive comprehensive eye exams  we kind of changed
  simple digital camera into a retinal camera  and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor
 the effect of this has been
 that within the first year we really had a forty percent penetration in the market that it served  which is over fifty thousand people  
  we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach
 everyone who needs it  and in this process of using technology make sure that
 most don 't need to come to the base hospital  
 and how much will they pay for this we fixed the pricing taking into account what they would save in bus fare
 in coming to a city so they pay about twenty rupees  and that 's good for three consultations
  the other challenge was how do you give high tech or more advanced treatment and care we
 designed a van with a vsat which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is
 diagnosed  and then as the patient is waiting  the report goes back to the patient
  it gets printed out the patient gets it
 and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing i mean go see a doctor or come back after six months  and then this happens
 as a way of bridging the the technology competence  
 so the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market  because it focused on the 
 and then by reaching the unreached we 're able to significantly grow the market
  the other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists  so what is in this video
 is a surgeon operating and then you see on the other side another patient is getting ready so as they finish
 the surgery  they just swing the microscope over the tables are placed so that their distance is just right  and then we need to do this because
  doing this kind of process we 're able to
 more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon  
 and then to support the surgeon we require a certain workforce  and then we focused on
 village girls that we recruited  and then they really are the backbone of the organization they do almost all of
  they do one thing at a time they do it extremely well  with the result we have very high productivity very high quality at very very low cost 
 so putting all this together what really happened was the productivity of our staff
 was significantly higher than
 anyone else 
 this is a very busy table
  but what this really is conveying is that when it comes to quality we have put in very
 good quality assurance systems as a result our complications are significantly lower than what has been reported in the
 united kingdom  and you don 't see those kind of numbers very often 
 so the final part of the puzzle is how do you make all this work financially  especially when the people can 't pay
  for it  so what we did was  we gave away a lot of it for free  
 and then those who pay i mean they paid local market rates nothing more and often much less  and we were helped by the market inefficiency i think that has been a big savior even now 
 and of course one needs the mindset to be wanting to
 give away what you have as a surplus the result has been over the years
  expenditure has increased with volumes  the revenues increase at a higher level giving us a healthy margin
 while you 're treating a large number of people for free  
 i think in absolute terms last year we earned about 20 odd million dollars  spent about thirteen million 
 with over a forty percent ebita
  really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness and what we did was a couple of very counter intuitive things  we created competition for ourselves 
 and then we
  we proactively and systematically
 promoted these practices to many hospitals
 in india many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well  
 the impact of this has been that these hospitals in the second year after our consultation are double their output
 and then achieve financial
 recovery as well
  other part was how do you
 address this increase in cost of technology
 there was a time when we failed to negotiate the [ intra ocular lens ] prices to be at affordable levels so we set up
 a manufacturing unit  
 and then over time we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be
 when we started out
  today  we believe we have about seven percent of the global market and they 're used in about 120 odd countries 
 to conclude  i mean  what we do does it have a broader relevance or is it just
 india or developing countries  so to address this we
  what it shows is that we do roughly about sixty percent of the
 volume of what the uk does near a half million surgeries as a whole country and we do about
 three hundred thousand  and then we train about fifty ophthalmologists against the seventy trained by them comparable quality  both in training and in
  i think it is simple to say just because the u k isn 't india the difference is happening i think
 there is more to it  i mean i think one has to look at other aspects as well  maybe there is
 the solution to the cost could be in productivity
  maybe in efficiency in the clinical process  or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables or
 regulations their defensive practice  so i think decoding this can probably bring answers to
 most developed countries including the u s and maybe obama 's
  i want to leave with you in conditions where the problem is very large 
 which cuts across all economic strata where we have a good solution  
 i think the process i described you know productivity quality patient centered care can give an answer 
 and there are many which fit this paradigm you take dentistry
  hearing aid maternity and so on there are many where this paradigm can now play  
 but i think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side now how do you create compassion 
 now how do you make people own the problem want to do something about it there are a bit harder issues and i 'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the
  all that is in the world so there is no exploitation it is ourselves we are helping it is ourselves we
