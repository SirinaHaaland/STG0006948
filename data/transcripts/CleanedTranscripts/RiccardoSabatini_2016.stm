  the next sixteen minutes  i 'm going to take you on a journey that is probably the biggest dream of humanity to
 understand the code of life  so for me everything started many many years ago when i met
  printer needs three elements  a bit of information some raw material some energy and it can produce any object that was not there before  
 i was doing physics i was coming back home and i realized that i actually always knew a 3d printer and everyone does it was my mom laughter
 my mom takes
 three elements  a bit of information which is between my father and my mom in this case
  elements and energy in the same media that is food  and after several months  produces me and i was not existent before  
 so apart from the shock of my mom discovering that she was a 3d printer
  i immediately got
 mesmerized by that piece the first one the information what amount of information does it
  to build and assemble a human is it much is it little how many thumb drives can you fill  well  i was studying physics at the beginning and i took
 this approximation of a human as a gigantic lego piece so imagine that the building blocks are little atoms and there is a hydrogen here 
  a carbon here  a nitrogen here  so in the first approximation if i can list the number of atoms that compose a human being
  now you can run some numbers and that happens to be quite an astonishing number  so the number of atoms the file that i will save in my thumb drive to assemble a little baby 
 will actually fill an entire titanic of thumb drives multiplied two thousand times
  this is the miracle of life  every time you see from now on a pregnant lady she 's assembling the biggest amount of information that you will ever encounter 
  forget big data forget anything you heard of this is the biggest amount of information that exists but
 nature fortunately is much smarter than a young
  and in four billion years managed to pack this information in a small crystal we call dna  
 we met it for the first time in one thousand nine hundred and fifty when rosalind franklin an amazing scientist a woman took a picture of it  but it took us more than forty years
 to finally poke inside a human cell take out this crystal unroll it and read it for the first time 
 the code comes out to be a fairly simple alphabet four letters
  a t c and g and to build a human you need three billion of them 
 three billion 
 how many are three billion  it doesn 't really make any sense as a number right  
 so i was thinking how i could explain myself better about how big and enormous this code is but
  the man in the flesh  but for the first time in
  thousand pages of information four hundred and fifty kilograms  shipped from the united states to canada thanks to bruno bowden 
  did everything it was an amazing feat  but this is the visual perception of what is the code of life and now for the first time i can do something fun  i can
  actually poke inside it and read so let me take an interesting book  like this one  
 i have an annotation it 's a fairly big book  so just to let you see what is the code of life 
 thousands and thousands and
  sounds like mute letters  but this sequence gives the color of the eyes to craig i 'll show you another part of the book this is actually
  this human is lucky  because if you miss just two letters in this position two letters of our three billion he will be condemned to a terrible
  disease  cystic fibrosis we have no cure for it  we don 't know how to solve it and it 's just two letters of difference from what we are 
 a wonderful book  a mighty book  
 a mighty book that helped me understand and show you something quite remarkable  
 every one of you what makes me me and you you is just about
 five million
  of these half a book for the rest  we are all absolutely identical  five hundred pages
 is the miracle of life that you are the rest  we all share it  
 so think about that again when we think that we are different  this is the amount that we share  
 so
 now that i have your attention the next question is
 how do i read it how do i make sense out of it well for however good you can be at assembling swedish furniture  this instruction manual
 is nothing you can crack in your life 
 and so in two thousand and fourteen two famous tedsters  peter diamandis and craig venter himself  decided to assemble a new company human longevity was born with one mission  
 trying everything we can
 and learning everything we can learn from these books with one target
 making real the dream of personalized medicine  understanding what things should be done to have better health and what are the secrets in these books 
 an amazing team forty data scientists and many many more people a pleasure
  the concept is actually very simple we 're going to use a technology called machine learning
  on one side  we have genomes thousands of them 
 on the other side  we collected the biggest database of human beings phenotypes 3d scan
 everything you can think of inside there on these two opposite sides there is the secret of translation and in
  we build a machine  we build a machine and we train a machine well not exactly one machine many many machines
 to try to understand and translate the genome in a phenotype 
 what are those letters  and what do they do 
 it 's an approach that can be used for everything but using it in genomics is particularly complicated little by little we grew and we wanted to build
 different challenges we started from the beginning from common traits common traits are are comfortable because they are common everyone has them  so we started to ask our questions can we predict height 
 can we read the books and predict your height well we actually can with five centimeters of precision bmi is fairly connected to your lifestyle but we still can we get in the ballpark  eight kilograms of precision 
 can we predict eye
  can we predict age  
 we can 
 because apparently the code changes during your life it gets shorter you lose pieces it gets insertions we read the signals  and we make a model 
 now an interesting challenge can we predict a human face it
  's a little complicated  because a human face is scattered among millions of these letters  and a human face is not a very well defined object  so we had to build an entire tier of it to learn and teach a machine what a face is and embed and compress it  
 and if you 're comfortable with machine learning you understand what the challenge is here 
 now after fifteen years fifteen years after
 we read the first sequence
  this october we started to see some signals and it was
 a very emotional moment what you see here
 is a subject coming in our lab  
 this is a face for us  so we take the real face of a subject we reduce the complexity because not everything is in your face lots of features and defects and asymmetries come from your life 
 we  symmetrize the face  and we run our our algorithm the results that i show you right now  this is the prediction we have
 from the
 wait a second 
 in these seconds your eyes are watching  left and right left and right  and your brain wants those pictures to be identical  so i ask 
  you to do another exercise to be honest please search for the differences  which are many 
  ethnicity component of a human and scaling up over that signal is much more complicated  
 but what you see here  even in the differences  lets you understand that we are in the right ballpark
  that we are getting closer and it 's already giving you some emotions  this is another subject that comes in place and this is a
  't get the complete cranial structure  but still it 's in the ballpark  this is a subject that comes in our lab  and this is the prediction 
 so these people have never been seen in the training of the machine these are 
 but these are people that you will probably never believe we 're publishing everything in a scientific publication you can read it  but since we are onstage
  challenged me  i probably exposed myself and tried to predict someone that you might recognize  so in this vial of blood
 and believe me you have no idea what we had to do to have this blood now here 
  in this vial of blood  is the amount of biological information that we need to do a full
  we ran this sequence and i 'm going to do it with you 
 and we start to layer up all the understanding we have in the vial of blood  we predicted he 's a male  and the subject is a male  
 we predict that he 's a meter and seventy six cm the subject is a meter and
  predict his eye color  
 too dark we predict his skin color  we are almost there that 's his face 
 now  the reveal moment  the subject is this person 
 and i did it intentionally i am a very particular and peculiar ethnicity
  southern european italians they never fit in models 
 and it 's particular that ethnicity is a complex corner case for our model  but there is another point so one of the things that we use a lot to recognize people will never be written in the genome it 's our free will it 's how i look 
 not my haircut in this case but my beard cut
  so i 'm going to show you i 'm going to in this case transfer it and this is nothing more than photoshop no modeling the beard on the subject 
 and immediately we get much much better in the feeling  
 so  why do we do this 
 we certainly don 't do it for predicting height or taking a beautiful picture out of your
  we do it because the same technology and the same approach 
 the machine learning of this code is helping us to understand how we work how your body works how your body ages how disease 
 generates in your body how your cancer grows and develops  
  is a challenge that we share with thousands of other researchers around the world it 's called personalized medicine it
 's the ability to move from a statistical approach where you 're a dot in the ocean to a personalized approach where we read all these books
 and we get an understanding of exactly how you are but it is a particularly complicated
  because of all these books as of today  we just know probably two percent  four books
 of more than one hundred and seventy five and
 this is not the topic of my talk because we will learn more 
 there are the best minds in the world on this topic 
 the prediction will get
  we will be confronted with decisions that we never had to face before
 about life about death about parenting so
 we are touching the very inner detail on how life works and it 's a revolution that cannot be
  confined
 in the domain of science or technology 
 this must be a global conversation 
 we must start to think of the future we 're building as a humanity we need to interact with creatives  with artists with philosophers with politicians  
 everyone is involved because it 's the future of our species  
 without fear
 but with the understanding that the decisions that we make in the next year will change the course of history
 forever thank
