  we 're going to go on a dive to the deep sea  and anyone that 's had that lovely opportunity
 knows that for about two and half hours on the way down it 's a perfectly positively pitch black world and we used to
 see the most mysterious animals out the window that you couldn 't describe these blinking lights a world of bioluminescence like fireflies 
 dr edith widder she 's now at the ocean research and conservation association
 was able to come up with a camera that could capture some of these incredible animals and that 's what you 're seeing here on the screen 
 that 's all bioluminescence like i said just like fireflies  there 's a flying turkey under a tree 
 i 'm a geologist by training but i love that
 and you see some of the bioluminescence they use to avoid being eaten some they use to attract prey  but all of it from an artistic point of view is just positively amazing  
 and a lot of what goes on inside there 's a fish with glowing eyes pulsating eyes
 some of the colors are designed to hypnotize these lovely patterns  
 and then this last one one of my favorites this pinwheel design just absolutely amazing every
  single dive 
 that 's the unknown world and today we 've only explored about three percent three percent of what 's out there in the ocean 
 already we 've found the world 's highest mountains the world 's deepest valleys  underwater lakes underwater waterfalls a lot of that we shared with you from the stage and in a place where we thought no life at all 
 we find more life we think and diversity and density than the tropical rainforest which tells us that we don 't know much about this planet at all there 's still
  percent and either that ninety seven percent is empty or just full of surprises  but i want to jump up to shallow water now and look at some creatures that are positively amazing 
 cephalopods head foots 
 as a kid i knew them as calamari mostly this is an octopus this is the work of dr roger hanlon at the marine biological lab and it 's just
 fascinating how cephalopods can with their incredible eyes  sense their surroundings look at light look at patterns here 's an octopus moving across the reef 
 finds a spot to settle down curls up and then disappears into the background  
 tough thing to do 
 in the next bit we 're going to see a couple squid now males when they fight if they 're really aggressive they turn white and these two males are fighting  they do it by bouncing their butts together which is an interesting
  here 's a male on the left and a female on the right and the male has managed to split his coloration coloration so the female only always sees the kinder gentler squid in him
  let 's take a look at it again  watch the coloration  white on the right  
 brown on the left he takes a step back he 's keeping off the other males by splitting his body and comes up on the other side bingo
  not just a squid phenomenon with males but i don 't know 
 cuttlefish i love cuttlefish  this is a giant australian cuttlefish and there he is his droopy little eyes up here
 but they can do pretty amazing things too here we 're going to see one backing into
 a crevice  and watch his watch his tentacles he just pulls them in makes them look just like algae disappears right into the background
 positively amazing here 's two males fighting once again they 're smart enough these cephalopods they know not to hurt each other but look at the patterns that they can do with their skin
 that 's an amazing thing 
 here 's an octopus sometimes they don 't want to be seen when they move because predators can see them  this guy can make himself look like a rock and looking at his environment can actually slide across the bottom
  using the waves and the shadows so he can 't be seen 
 his motion blends right into the background
 the moving rock trick 
 so we 're learning lots new from the shallow water still exploring the deep but learning lots from the shallow water there
 's a good reason why the shallow water 's full of predators and if you 're an octopus or a cephalopod you need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide
 in the next scene you 're going to see a nice coral bottom  and you see that an octopus would stand out very easily there if you couldn 't use your camouflage use your skin to change
 color and texture here 's some algae in the foreground
 and an octopus ain 't that amazing now
 roger spooked him so he took off in a cloud of ink and when he lands the octopus says
  seen the best thing to do is to get as big as i can get 
 that big brown makes his eyespot very big 
 so he 's bluffing let 's do it backwards i thought he was joking when he first showed it to me i thought it
 was all graphics so here here it is in reverse watch the skin color watch the skin texture just an amazing animal it can change color and texture to match the surroundings 
 watch him blend right
  now he 's gone and so am i thank you very much
