  on march fourteen this year i posted this poster on facebook  this is an image of me and my daughter
 holding the israeli flag  i will try to explain to you about the context of why and when i posted a few days
  ago  i was sitting waiting
 on the line at the grocery store  and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other  and the owner was explaining to the client that we 're going to get ten thousand missiles on israel  
 and the client was saying no it 's ten thousand a day
 this is where we are now in israel we have this war with iran coming for ten years now  and we have people  you know  afraid  
 it 's like every year it 's
 the last minute that we can do something about the war with iran  it 's like  if we don 't act now it 's too late forever for ten
  so at some point it became you know to me  i 'm a graphic designer so i made posters about it and i posted the one i just showed you before  
 most of the time i make posters i post them on facebook my friends like it don 't like it most of the time don 't like it don 't share it don 't nothing  
 and it 's another day
  so i went to sleep  and that was it for me and later on in the night  i woke up because i 'm always waking up in the night
  and i went by the computer and i see all these red dots you know on facebook  which i 've never seen before 
 and i was like what 's going on 
 so i come to the computer and i start looking on and suddenly i see many people talking to me  most of them i don 't know 
 and a few of them
  you have to understand in israel we don 't talk with people from iran  we don 't know people from iran  it 's like  on facebook you have friends only from it 's like your neighbors are your friends on facebook  
 and now people from iran are talking to me  so i start answering this
  and she 's telling me she saw the poster and
 she asked her family to come because they don 't have a computer she asked her family to come to see the poster and they 're all sitting in the living room crying  
 so i 'm like whoa 
 i ask my wife to come  and i tell her you have to see that people are crying  and she came she read the text  and she started to cry  
 and everybody 's crying now 
 so i don 't know what to do so my first reflex as a graphic designer
 is  you know to show everybody what i 'd just seen and people started to see them and to share them and that 's how it started 
 the day after when really it became a lot of talking i said to myself and my wife said to me  i also want a poster  so
 this is her 
 laughter because
  put me in a poster now
  but more seriously  i was like  okay  these ones work but it 's not just about me  it 's about people from israel who want to say something so i 'm going to shoot all the 
  people i know  if they want and i 'm going to put them in a poster and i 'm going to share them  so i went to my neighbors and friends and students and i just asked them 
 from facebook friends and others just understand that they can be part of it it 's not just one dude making one poster it  's
 we can be part of it so they start sending me pictures and ask me make me a poster post it  tell the iranians we from israel love you too 
 it became you know at some point it was really really intense
  friends
 to come 
 graphic designers most of them to make posters with me because i didn 't have the time it was a huge amount of pictures  so for a few days that 's how my living room
 was and we received
 israeli posters israeli images  but also lots of comments lots of
  this one is really moving for me because it 's the story of a girl who has been raised
 in iran to walk on on an israeli flag to enter her school every morning
 and now that she sees the posters that we 're sending she starts she she said that she changed her mind  and now
 she she loves that blue she loves that star and she loves that flag talking about the israeli flag  and she wished that we 'd meet
 and come to visit one another and just a few days after i posted the first poster 
  the day after iranians started to respond with their own posters  they have graphic designers what crazy crazy 
 so you can see they are still shy they don 't want to show their faces but they want to spread the message they want to respond they want to say the same thing so 
 and now it 's
 communication  it 's a two way story 
  this never happened before  and this is
 two people supposed to be enemies we 're on the verge of a war  and suddenly people on facebook are starting to say 
 i like this guy  i love those guys 
 and it became really big at some point  
 and then
 it became news  because when you 're seeing the middle east  you see only the bad
  news  and suddenly there is something that was happening that was good news  so the guys on the news they say okay let 's talk about this 
 and they just came  and it was so much i remember one day
 michal she was talking with the journalist and she was asking him who 's gonna see the show and he said
  forty million people are going to see you today it 's everybody the chinese  and we were just at the beginning
 of the story something crazy also happened every time a country started talking about it like germany
  america wherever a page on facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories so at the beginning we had 
 which is an iranian sitting in tehran
 this whole list of pages on facebook dedicated to the same message to people sending their love one to each other 
 the moment i really understood that something was happening a friend of mine told me 
 google the word ' israel '
 and those were the first images on those days that popped up from google
  when you were
 typing israel or iran 
 we really changed how people
 see the middle east  because you 're not in the middle east you 're somewhere over there and then you want to see the middle east so you go on google and you say israel and they give you the bad stuff  and for a few days you got those images
  one of the photos  so for five months now that 's what we are doing me michal a few of my friends are just
 making images we 're showing a new reality
 by just making images because that 's how the world perceives us  they see
  images of us  and they see bad images  so we 're working on making good images  end of story 
 look at this one  this is the
  page this is not 
  this is not my page  this is a guy in tehran on the day of remembrance of the israeli
  and it 's going both ways  it 's like we are showing respect one to each other  and we 're understanding 
 and you show compassion and you become friends 
 and at some point you become
  friends on facebook  and you become friends in life  you can go and travel and meet people  and
 i was in munich a few weeks ago  
 i went there to open an exposition about iran and i met there with people from the page that told me okay you 're going to be in europe i 'm coming i 'm coming from france from holland
  of course and from israel people came  and we just met there for the first time in real life i met with people that
 are supposed to be my enemies
 for the first time  and we just shake hands  and have a coffee and a nice discussion  and we talk about food and basketball and that was the end of it  
 remember that image from the beginning at some point we met in real life  and we
 and it goes the other way around some girl that we met on facebook
 never been in israel  born and raised in iran  lives in germany  afraid
 of israelis because of what she knows about us  decides after a few months of talking on the internet
  and she gets on the plane and arrives at ben gurion and says okay  not that big a deal 
 so a few weeks ago the stress is is getting higher  so we start this new campaign called 
 not ready to die in your war i mean  it 's plus minus the same message but we wanted really to to add some aggressivity to it
 again something amazing happened something that we didn 't have on the first wave of the campaign now people from iran  the same ones who were shy
 at the first campaign and just sent you know their foot and half their faces now they 're sending their faces and they 're saying okay  
 no problem we 're into it  we are with you
  just read
 where those guys are from and for every guy from israel 
 you 've got someone from iran  
 just people sending their pictures
  may ask yourself who is this dude 
 my name is ronny edry and i 'm forty one i 'm an israeli i 'm a
 father of two i 'm a husband  and i 'm a graphic designer  i 'm teaching graphic
  and i 'm not that naive  because a lot of the time i 've been asked  many times i 've been asked yeah but 
 this is really naive sending flowers over  i mean
 i was in the army  i was in the paratroopers for three years and i know how it looks from the ground i know how
 it can look really bad so to me  this is the courageous thing to do to try to reach the other
  side before it 's too late  because when it 's going to be too late it 's going to be too late and sometimes
 war is inevitable 
 sometimes but maybe [
 with ] effort we can avoid it  maybe as people because especially in israel we 're in a democracy  
 we have the freedom of speech  and maybe that little thing can change something 
 and really we can be our
 own ambassadors we can just
 send a message and hope for the best
  so i want to ask michal my wife to come with me on the stage just
 to make with you one image because it 's all about images  and maybe that image
