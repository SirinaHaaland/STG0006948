  may have heard about the koran 's idea of paradise being seventy two virgins and i promise i will come back to those virgins but in fact here
 in the northwest we 're living very close to the real
  since i live on a houseboat on the running stream of lake union 
 this makes perfect sense to me  but the thing is how come it 's news to most people 
 i know many 
  non muslims who 've begun reading the koran but given up disconcerted
  the historian thomas carlyle considered muhammad one of the world 's greatest heroes yet even he called the koran as toilsome reading as i ever undertook 
 a wearisome confused jumble 
 laughter part of the problem i think is that we imagine that the koran can be read as we usually read a book
 as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach as though god
  god and the koran is entirely in the voice of god speaking to muhammad were just another author on the best seller list yet
 the fact that so few people do actually read the koran is precisely why it 's so easy to quote
 that is to misquote phrases and snippets taken out of context in what i call the highlighter version which is the
  one favored by both muslim fundamentalists and and 
 so this past spring as i was gearing up to begin writing a biography of muhammad 
 i realized i needed to read the koran properly
 as properly as i could that is my arabic is reduced by now to wielding a dictionary so i took four  well known translations and decided
  to read them side by side verse by verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh century arabic 
 now i did have an advantage 
 my last book was about the story behind the shi 'a sunni split and for that i 'd worked
 closely with the earliest islamic histories so i knew the events to which the koran constantly refers its frame of reference 
 i knew enough that is to know that i 'd be a tourist in the koran
 an informed one 
 an experienced one even but still an outsider an agnostic jew reading someone else 's holy book 
  set aside three weeks for this project  and that i think is what is meant by hubris because it
 turned out to be three months 
 laughter i did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters
  but every time i thought i was beginning to get a handle on the koran that feeling of i get it now 
 it would slip away overnight  and i 'd come back in the morning wondering if i wasn 't lost in a strange land  
 and yet the terrain was very familiar 
 the koran declares that it comes to renew the message of the torah and the gospels so one third of it reprises the stories of biblical figures
  god himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as yahweh  jealously insisting on no other gods
  the presence of camels  mountains desert wells and springs
 took me back to the year i spent wandering the sinai desert and
  there was the language the rhythmic cadence of it reminding me of evenings spent listening to bedouin elders recite  hours long narrative poems
 entirely from memory  and i began to grasp why
 it 's said that the koran is really the koran only in arabic take the fatihah the
  and yet the more you add the more seems to go missing  
 the arabic has an incantatory almost hypnotic quality that begs to be heard rather than read
  more than analyzed it wants to be chanted out loud to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue  
 so the koran in english is a kind of shadow of itself 
 or as arthur arberry called his version an interpretation 
 but all is not lost in translation as the koran promises patience is rewarded and there are many surprises
 a degree of environmental awareness for instance
 and of humans as mere stewards of god 's creation  unmatched in the bible 
 and where the bible is addressed exclusively to men using the second and third person masculine the koran includes women
 talking for instance of believing men and believing women honorable men and
  or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers  
 yes it does say that but in a very specific context 
 the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of mecca  where fighting was usually forbidden 
 and the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers not you must kill unbelievers in mecca
 but you can you are allowed to but
 only after a grace period is over  
 and only if there 's no other pact in place  and only if they try to stop you getting to the kaaba  
 and only if they attack you first and even then
 god is merciful forgiveness is supreme and so essentially  better if you don
  perhaps the biggest surprise
 how flexible the koran is at least in minds that are not fundamentally inflexible 
 some of these verses are definite in meaning it says and others are ambiguous 
 the perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own only god
  knows the true meaning  
 the phrase god is subtle appears again and again 
 and indeed the whole of the koran is far more subtle than most of us have been led to believe as in for instance that little matter of
 virgins and paradise  old fashioned orientalism
  yet all there is in the original arabic is that one word houris 
 not a swelling breast or high bosom in sight 
  an eternal youth but the truth is nobody really knows  and that 's the point  
 because the koran is quite clear when it says that you 'll be a new creation in paradise 
 and that you will be recreated in a
  which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin 
 laughter and that number seventy two never appears
 there are no seventy two virgins in the koran 
 that idea only came into being three hundred years later  and most islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of
 people with wings sitting on
  clouds and strumming harps  paradise is quite the opposite it
 's not virginity it 's fecundity
