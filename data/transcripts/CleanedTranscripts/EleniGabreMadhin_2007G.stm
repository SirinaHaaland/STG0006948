  small country nestled in the himalayan mountains  far from these beautiful mountains  
 where the people of the kingdom of bhutan have decided to do something different  which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product 
 and why not after all happiness
 is not just a privilege for the lucky few  but a fundamental human right for all and what is happiness happiness is the freedom of choice  
 the freedom to chose where to live what to do what to buy what to sell from whom to whom  when and how 
 where does choice come from 
 and who gets to express it and how do we express it
 one way to express choice is through the market 
 well functioning markets provide choices and ultimately the ability to express one 's pursuit for happiness
  the
 great indian economist amartya sen was awarded the nobel prize
 for demonstrating that famine is not so much about the availability of food supply
  rather the ability to acquire or entitle oneself to that food through the market 
 in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity 
 nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth ethiopia 
 not because there was not enough food because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country but because
  in the north people could not access or entitle themselves to that food that was a turning point for my life 
 most africans today by far are farmers and most of africa 's farmers are by and large small farmers in terms of land that they operate and very very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their
  only seven percent of arable land in africa
 is irrigated compared to forty percent in asia  
 african farmers only use some twenty two kilograms of fertilizer per hectare  compared to one hundred and forty four in asia  
 road density is six times greater in asia than it is in rural africa
  there are eight times more tractors
 in latin america and three times more tractors in asia than in africa  
 the small farmer in africa today lives a life without much choice  and therefore without much freedom his livelihood is predetermined
 by the conditions of grinding poverty he comes to the market when prices are lowest with the meager fruits of his hard labor just after the
  harvest because he has no choice she comes back to the market
 some months later  when prices are highest in what we call the lean season when food is scarce because she has to feed her family and has no choice
  the real question is how can markets be developed in rural africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship
 that we know exists  another notable economist  theodore schultz 
 won the nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers are efficient  but poor  
 meaning in fact that farmers are rational and profit minded just like everybody else well we don 't need
  any more nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake at the market and want to make money just like everyone else  and one thing is clear  which is at least now we know that africa is open for business  
 and that business is agriculture 
 over two decades ago the world insisted to africa that markets must be liberalized  that economies must be structurally
  this meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling which they did rather inefficiently and let the private
 market do its magic  well what happened over the last twenty five years did africa feed itself  
 did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors  i think we 're all in this room  probably because we know that in
  africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next ten years 
 where the food import bill is now double what it was twenty years ago  
 where food production per capita has
 stagnated  and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased  so why didn 't agriculture markets perform to
  the market reforms prompted by the west and i 've spent
 some fifteen years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets and have interviewed traders in
 ten to fifteen countries in this continent hundreds of traders trying to understand what went wrong
 with our market reform  and it seems to me that
 the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water like its agriculture africa 's markets are
  highly under capitalized and inefficient  we know from our work around the continent that
 transaction costs of reaching the market and the risks of transacting in rural agriculture markets are extremely high  
 in fact only one third of agricultural output produced in africa even reaches the market  
  africa 's markets are weak not only because of weak
 infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications  but also because of the virtual absence absence of necessary market institutions  such as
 market information grades and standards and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers 
 because of this 
 commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles  in narrow networks of people they know and trust and because of that
  as grain changes hands and i 've measured that it changes hands four five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer
 every time it changes hands and i 've seen this all over rural africa it also changes sacks and i thought that was incredibly peculiar  and really realized that that was because as traders would tell me over and over that 's the only way people know what they 're getting
 in terms of the quantity
  quantity and the product quality  and that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond
 to price signals and situations where there are deficits for example it also has very high cost implications i have measured that twenty six percent of the marketing margin is simply due to the fact that because of the absence of grades and standards and market information
  sacks have to be constantly
 changed and this leads to very high handling costs 
 for their part small farmers who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in africa  come to the market with virtually no information at all blind
 trusting that they 're going to have
 some sort of demand for their produce and completely at the mercy of
  merchants in the only market the nearest local market they know
 where they 're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk  
 speaking of risk  we have seen that price volatility of food crops in africa is the highest in the world 
 in africa small farmers bear the brunt of this risk  in fact  in my view  there is no region of the world and no period in
  have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that africa 's farmers have to bear  and in my view  there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture
 on the kind of risk that our farmers in africa today face 
 in ethiopia for example  the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as fifty percent annually this kind of market risk is
  implications
 for for not only the incentives of farmers to invest in higher productivity technology  such as modern seeds and fertilizers  but also direct implications for food security 
 to give you an example between two thousand and one and two thousand and two  ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest  that
  because of the weak marketing system led to an eighty percent collapse in maize prices in the country 
 this made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields  and we calculated that some three hundred thousand tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early two thousand and two 
 not six months later  in july two thousand and two ethiopia announced a major food crisis
  fourteen million people at risk of starvation what also happened that year is in the areas where there were good rains
 and where farmers had previously produced surplus grain farmers had decided to withdraw from the fertilizer
 market  not use fertilizer and actually had dropped
 their use of fertilizer by twenty seven percent this is a tragic example of arrested development
  or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks  and this is not just specific to ethiopia  but happens over and over all over africa well
 i 'm not here today
 to lament about the situation  or wring my hands i am here
 to tell you that change is in the air africa today is not the africa waiting for aid solutions or
 or cookie cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions 
 africa has learned  or is learning somewhat slowly  that markets don 't happen by themselves in the 1980s it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right 
 there was a very influential book about that which
 was mainly about getting governments
 out of the market  we now recognize that getting markets right is about not just
 price incentives  but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market 
 when conditions are right we know and see
 that that innovation is ready to explode in rural africa just like anywhere else
  nearly three years ago  i decided to leave my comfortable job as a world bank senior economist in washington
 and come back to my country of birth ethiopia  after nearly thirty years abroad  i did so for a simple reason  
 after having spent more than a decade
 understanding studying 
 and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with africa 's agricultural markets i decided it was time to do something about it
  i currently lead in ethiopia an exciting new initiative
 to establish the first ethiopia commodity exchange or ecx now the commodity exchange itself  that concept is not new to the world in fact in one thousand eight hundred and forty eight
 eighty two grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the illinois river
 and lake michigan
 to establish
  establish a way to to trade better amongst themselves 
 that was of course  the birth of the chicago board of trade which is the most famous
 commodity exchange in the world  the chicago board of trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange 
 in the american midwest farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it
  upriver to the chicago market  but once it arrived  if no buyer 
 was to be found or if prices suddenly dropped 
 farmers would incur tremendous losses  and in fact would even dump the grain in lake michigan rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms  
 well  the need to avoid
 these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market
 and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done 
 from there the greatest innovation of all came about in this market 
 which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically
 or visually inspect the grain  that meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances
  and even across time as far forward as eighteen months into the future  this innovation is at the heart of the transformation of american agriculture  and the rise
 of chicago to a global market  agricultural market superpower
 from where it was a small regional town now over the last century
  we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview of western industrialized countries  and that the reference prices for cotton coffee  cocoa products produced mainly in the south are actually
 a reference price  or a price discovered
 in these
 organized commodity exchanges in the in the northern countries  but that is actually changing  and we 're seeing a shift powered
 mainly because of information technology a shift in market dominance towards the emerging
  markets and over the last decade you see that the share of western exchanges and this is
 the  u s share of of exchanges in the world has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade  
 similarly there 's been explosive growth
 in in india for example  where rural farmers are
  using exchanges growing here over the last three years
 by two hundred and seventy percent a year this is powered by low cost vsat technology aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market 
 china 's dalian commodity exchange
  three years ago two thousand and four  overtook the chicago board of trade to become the second largest commodity exchange in the world  
  we 're in the process of designing
 the first organized ethiopia commodity exchange we
 're not trying to cut and paste the chicago model or the india model  but creating a system uniquely tailored to ethiopia 's needs and realities ethiopia 's small farmers so the ecx is an ethiopian exchange for ethiopia  
 we 're creating a system that serves all market actors
 that creates
  and enables small farmers to manage the risks that i have described 
 in the design of our commodity exchange in ethiopia we 've done something rather unique which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective  or what we call the ecx edge  the ecx edge
 pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market
  and this is because one of the things we 've learned over the last
 decade of studying market development in africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work 
 you 've got one donor trying to develop market information another trying to work on or sponsor
 grades and standards another ict and yet another
  on warehousing or warehouse receipts in our approach
  we 've decided to put together the entire
 ecosystem or environment in which trade takes place that means that the exchange will operate a trading system
 which will initially start as an open outcry  because we don 't think the country 's ready for full electronic
 trading  but at the same time we 'll do something which i think no exchange in the world has ever done  which is itself to operate something like an internet cafe in the rural areas  so that farmers
 and small traders can
  actually come to a terminal center what we call the remote access terminal centers
 and actually without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things 
 simply see the trading that 's happening on the addis ababa trading floor 
 at the same time 
 what 's very fundamental to this market is that and again an innovation that we 've designed for our exchange is that the exchange will operate warehouses
  around the country  in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done  and in turn we 'll operate an  in house clearing system to assure
 that payment is done
 appropriately in the right amount and at and at the right time  so that basically we create trust and integrity in the system  
 obviously we work with exchange actors  and as we 're developing the exchange market itself
 the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework the overarching legal framework for making this market work so
 in fact our proclamation is going to parliament next month
  what 's really important is that the ecx will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country using vsat technology
 to bring
  an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers what this does is transforms fundamentally the farmers ' relationship to the market  
 whereas before the farmer used to think local meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market  eight to ten kilometers away on average and sell whatever they happened to have 
 without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was now farmers come with knowledge of
  what prices are at the national market and they start to think national and even global they start to make not only commercial
 marketing decisions but also planting decisions on the basis of information coming from the futures price
 market and they come to the market knowing what grades their products
  achieve in terms of a price premium so all of this will transform farmers  it will also transform the way traders do business it will stop them from doing simple 
 limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from [ surplus regions ] to 
 can ethiopia do this it seems very ambitious  but it will create new opportunities  we believe that this initiative
  requires great political will 
 and we 'll have to align the financial sector as well as the ict sector and really even the underlying legal framework  
 we believe that the winds of change are here  and that we can do it ecx is the market for ethiopia 's new millennium which starts
  of our century opened with our president announcing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today  
 we believe that the stakes are high  but that the returns will be even greater 
 ecx moreover can become a trading platform for a  pan african market
 in in agricultural commodities ethiopia 's domestic market is about one billion dollars of
 that over the next five years  if ethiopia can capture even forty percent just forty percent of the domestic market and add just twenty five percent value 
 to that market  the value of the market doubles ethiopia 's agricultural market is is thirty percent higher than south africa 's
  the second largest maize producer in africa  so the potential is there  the will is there  the commitment is there  
 so we feel that
 we have a winning value proposition
 to transform farmers ' choices to grow our agriculture and to change africa so we are in the business of finding our happiness  thank you very much
