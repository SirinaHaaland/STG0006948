  i was basically concerned about what was going on in the world  i couldn 't understand the starvation the destruction the killing of innocent people making sense of those things is a very
  when i was twelve i became an actor i was bottom of the class i haven 't got any qualifications
 i was told i was dyslexic 
 i have got qualifications i got a d in pottery which was the one thing that i did get which was  which was useful obviously and so concern is where all of this comes from
  and then being an actor i was doing these different kinds of things and i felt the content of the work that i
  involved in really wasn 't cutting it that there surely had to be more and at that point i read a book by frank barnaby  this wonderful nuclear physicist and he said that media had a responsibility that all sectors of society 
 had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward and that fascinated me because i 'd been
  to in some way make a difference maybe there 's a little change i can
 get involved in so i started thinking about peace and i was obviously as i said to you very much moved by these images trying to make sense of that
 could i go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on because it 's obviously incredibly frightening  
 but i realized that having been messing around with structure as an
  that a series of sound bites in itself wasn 't enough  that there needed to be a mountain to climb there needed to be a journey that i had to take and if i took that journey
  no matter whether it failed or succeeded it would be completely irrelevant  the point was that i would have something to hook the questions of
 is humankind fundamentally evil is the destruction of the world inevitable should i have children is that a responsible thing to do etc etc
  so i was thinking about peace and then i was thinking well where 's the starting point for peace and that was when i had the idea there was no starting point for peace  there was no day of
  unity  there was no day of intercultural cooperation there was no day when humanity came together separate in all of those things and just shared it together that we 're in this 
 together  and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated then that might be the key to humanity 's survival that might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces if we did it just for a day
  have any money i was living at my mom 's place and we started writing letters to everybody you very quickly work out what is it that you 've got to do to
 fathom that out how do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day the 21st of september  and i wanted it to be the 21st of september because it was my granddad 's favorite number 
 he was a
  the bomb go off at nagasaki it poisoned his blood he died when i was eleven so he was like my hero and the reason why twenty one was the number is seven hundred men left
 twenty three came back two died on the boat and twenty one hit the ground  and that 's why we wanted it to be the 21st of september as the date of peace  so we began this journey  and we launched it in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and we wrote to heads of state their ambassadors  nobel peace laureates
  various organizations literally wrote to everybody and very quickly some letters started coming back and we started to
 build this case  and i remember the first letter one of the first letters was from the dalai lama and of course we didn 't have the money we were playing guitars and
 getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of [ this mail ] a letter came through from the dalai lama saying this is an amazing thing
 come and see me i 'd love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace and we didn 't have money for the flight and i rang sir bob ayling who was ceo of ba at the time and said mate we 've got this
 invitation  could you give me a flight
 because we 're going to go see him and of course we went and saw him and it was amazing and then dr oscar arias came forward and actually let me go back to that slide because
 when we launched it in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non violence we invited thousands of people well not thousands hundreds of people  lots of people all the press because
  we were going to try and create the first ever world peace day a peace day  and we invited everybody and no press showed up there were one hundred and fourteen people there they were mostly my friends and family 
  and that was kind of like the launch of this thing but it didn 't matter because we were documenting and that was the thing 
  the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually  
 so anyway we began the journey  and here you see people like mary robinson i went to see in geneva  i 'm cutting my hair it 's getting short and long because every time i saw kofi annan i was so worried that he thought i was a hippie that i
 cut it and that was kind of what was going on
  idea whose time has come this must be created kofi annan said this will be beneficial to my troops on the ground the oau at the time led by salim ahmed salim said i must get the african countries involved dr oscar arias  nobel peace laureate president now of costa rica said i
 'll do everything that i can so
 i went and saw amr moussa at the league of arab states i met mandela at the arusha peace talks and so on and so on and so on while i was building the case to prove
 whether this idea would make sense  
 and then we were listening to the people we were documenting everywhere  seventy six countries in the last twelve years i 've visited  and i 've always spoken to women and children wherever i 've gone i 've recorded forty four thousand 
  young people i 've recorded about nine hundred hours of their thoughts i 'm really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry their art their literature
  their music their sport whatever it might be and we were listening to everybody and it was an incredibly thing 
 working with the u n and working with
 ngos and building this case i felt that i was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day and the stronger the case and the more detailed it was the better chance we had of creating this day  
 and it was this
  i actually was in the beginning kind of thinking no matter what happened it didn 't actually matter it didn 't matter if it didn 't create a day of peace the fact is that if i tried and it didn 't work then i could make a statement about how unwilling 
 the global community is to unite until it was in somalia picking up that young girl  and this young child who 'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic  and that young boy who was a child
  who told me he 'd killed people he was about twelve these things made me realize that this was not a film that i could just stop  and that actually at that 
  moment something happened to me  which obviously made me go i 'm going to document if this is the only film that i ever make  i 'm going to document until this becomes a reality because we 've got to 
  stop  we 've got to do something where we unite separate from all the politics and religion that as a young person is confusing me i don 't know
  and then on the seventh of september  i was invited to new york the costa rican government and the british government had put forward to the united nations general assembly with
  the idea of the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day the 21st of september as a fixed calendar date  and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world
  a reality and thank you to all of them that was an incredible moment i was at the top of the general assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen and as i mentioned when it started we were at the globe and there was no press 
 and now i was thinking well the press it really going to hear this story and suddenly we started to institutionalize this day  kofi annan invited me on the morning of september the 11th to do a press conference  
 am when i stood there and i was waiting for him to come down and i knew that he was on his way  and obviously he never came down the
 statement was never made the world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence and it was obviously a tragic moment for the thousands of people who lost their lives 
 there and then subsequently all over the world  
 it never happened  
  this is exactly why actually  
 we have to work even harder  
 and we have to make this day work it 's been created nobody knows  but we have to continue this journey  and we have to tell people and we have to prove it can work and i left new york
 freaked  but actually empowered  and i felt inspired by the
 the possibilities that if it did then maybe we wouldn 't see things like that i remember putting that film out and
  cynics i was showing the film and i remember being in israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered
 by some guys having watched the film that it 's just a day of peace it doesn 't mean anything it 's not going to work you 're not going
 to stop the fighting in afghanistan the taliban won 't listen etc etc
  it 's just symbolism  and that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways
  it couldn 't not work i 'd spoken in somalia burundi gaza the west bank india sri lanka  congo wherever it was  and they 'd all tell me if you can create a window of opportunity we can move aid we can vaccinate children children can lead their projects they can unite they can come together 
 if people would stop lives will be saved that 's what i 'd heard and i 'd heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about and so i went back to the united nations i decided that i 'd continue filming and make another movie  and i went back to the u n for another couple of years
  we started moving around the corridors of the u n system  governments
 and ngos trying desperately to find somebody to come forward and have a go at it see if we could make it possible and after lots and lots of meetings obviously i 'm
 delighted that this man ahmad fawzi one of my heroes and mentors really he managed to get unicef involved and unicef  god bless them they said okay we 'll
  and then unama became involved in afghanistan  it was historical could it work in afghanistan with unama and who and
 civil society etc etc  etc and i was getting it all on film and i was recording it and i was thinking this is it  this is the possibility of it maybe working but even if it doesn 't  at least
 the door is open and there 's a chance and so i went back to london  and i went and saw this chap jude law  and i saw him because he was an actor i was an actor i had a connection to him because we needed to get to the press we needed this attraction we needed the
  media to be involved  because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and
 there 'd be more when we got into certain areas maybe there would be more people interested and maybe we 'd be helped financially a little bit more which had been desperately difficult
 so i said to him do you want to come with me it 'd
 be really interesting if you came it would help and bring attention and that attention would help leverage the situation
  as well as all of the other sides of it i think there 's a number of pillars to to success one is you 've got to have a great idea the other is you 've got to have a constituency you 've got to have finance and you 've got to be able to raise awareness and actually i could never raise awareness by myself no matter what i 'd achieved so these
  guys were were absolutely crucial so he said yes and we found ourselves in afghanistan  it was a really
 incredible thing that when we landed there i was talking to various people and they were saying to me 
 you 've got to get everybody involved here you can 't just expect it to work you have to get out and work and we did  and we traveled around and we spoke to elders we spoke to doctors we spoke to nurses we held press
  we went out with soldiers  we sat down with isaf we sat down with nato we sat down with the u k government i mean we basically sat down with everybody in and out of schools with ministers of education 
 holding these press conferences which of course now were loaded with press everybody was there there was an interest in what was going on this amazing woman fatima gailani was
  in what went on as she she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the russians and her afghan network was just absolutely everywhere and she was really crucial in getting the message in 
 and then we went home we 'd sort of done it we had to wait now and see what happened and i got home  and i remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me from the taliban  
 and that letter basically said we 'll observe this day  we will observe this day  we see it as a window of opportunity
  not engage we 're not going to engage and that meant that humanitarian workers wouldn 't be kidnapped
 or killed  and then suddenly i obviously knew at this point there was a chance and days later one point six million children were vaccinated against polio as a consequence of everybody stopping
  we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back we put it into dari and pashto we put it in the local dialects we went back to afghanistan because the next year was coming  and we wanted to support but more importantly we wanted to go back because
  these people in afghanistan were the heroes  they were the people who believed
 in peace and the possibilities of it etc etc and they made it real  and we wanted to go back and show them the film and say look you guys made this possible
 and thank you very much and we gave the film over  obviously
 it was shown and it was amazing and then that year that year two thousand and eight  this isaf statement from kabul afghanistan september 17th general stanley mcchrystal commander of international security assistance forces in afghanistan  announced today isaf will not conduct
  offensive military operations on the 21st of september 
 they were saying they would stop  and then there was this other statement that came out from the  u n department of security and safety saying that  in afghanistan  because of this work  the violence was down by seventy percent 
 seventy percent reduction in violence on this day at least and that completely blew my mind
 almost more than anything and i remember being stuck in new york  this time because of the volcano
 which was obviously much less harmful  and i was there thinking about what was going on and i kept thinking about this seventy percent seventy percent reduction in violence in what 
  everyone said was completely impossible and you couldn 't do  and that made me think that if we can get seventy percent in afghanistan  then surely surely we can get seventy percent reduction
  we have to go for a global truce  we have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence and go for a global truce go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities both domestically and internationally ever recorded that 's
 exactly what we must do  and on the 21st of september this year we 're going to launch that campaign at the o2 arena to go for that process to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities 
  and we will utilize all kinds of things have a dance and social media and visiting on facebook and visit the website
  sign the petition and it 's in the six official languages of the united nations and we 'll globally link with government 
  education unions sports and you can see the education box there we 've got resources at the moment in one hundred and seventy four countries trying to get young people to be the driving force behind the vision of that global truce  and obviously the life saving is increased the
  we bring truce to life  why don 't you support the process of the largest ever global truce we 'll make a new film about this process we 'll utilize sport and football on the day of peace there 's thousands of football 
  matches all played from the favelas of brazil to wherever it might be so utilizing all of these ways to inspire
  we have to try that we have to work together  and when i stand here in front of all of you and the people who will watch these things i 'm excited
 on behalf of everybody i 've met  that there is a possibility that our world could unite that we could come together as one that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues brought 
  about by individuals  i was with brahimi ambassador brahimi  i think he 's one of the most incredible men in relation to international politics
  him a few weeks ago  and i said to him mr brahimi is this nuts going for a global truce  is this possible is it really possible that we could do this he said it 's absolutely possible i said what would you do would you go to governments and lobby and use the  system he said no i 'd talk to the individuals 
 it 's all about the individuals  it 's all about you and me  it 's all about partnerships it 's about your
  about your businesses
 because together by working together i seriously think we can start to change things and there 's a wonderful man sitting in this audience and i don 't know where he is who said to me a few days ago
 because i did a little rehearsal and he said i 've been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with three hundred and sixty five
 squares and one of them is white and it then made me think about a glass of water which is
  if you put one drop one drop of something in that water  it 'll change it forever by working together we can create peace one day thank you ted
