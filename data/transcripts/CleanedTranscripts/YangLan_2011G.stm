  the night before i was heading for scotland i was invited to host the final of china 's got talent show in shanghai
 with the eighty thousand live audience in the stadium guess who was the performing guest  susan boyle
 and i told her i 'm going to scotland the next day 
 she sang beautifully  and she even managed to say a few words in chinese
  was a line from our chinese parallel susan boyle a 
 a vegetable vendor in shanghai who loves singing western opera  but she didn 't understand any english or french or italian so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in chinese 
 and the last sentence of nessun dorma that
  she was singing in the stadium was green onion for free 
 so [ as ] susan boyle was saying that eighty thousand live audience sang together that was hilarious  
 so i guess both susan boyle and this vegetable vendor in shanghai belonged to
  the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment  
 yet their courage and talent brought them through and a show and a platform
 gave them the stage to realize their dreams  
 well being different is not that difficult  we are all different
 from different perspectives
  but i think being different is good because you present a different point of view you may have the chance to make a difference 
 my generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in
 the historic transformation of china that has made so many changes in the past twenty thirty years 
 i remember that in the year of one thousand nine hundred and ninety when i was graduating from college  i was applying for a job in the sales department
 of the first
  hotel in beijing great wall sheraton it 's still there 
 so after being interrogated by this japanese manager for a half an hour  he finally said so miss yang 
 do you have any questions to ask me 
 i summoned my courage and poise and said yes but could you let me
  actually do you sell 
 i didn 't have a clue what a sales department was about in a five star hotel that was the first day i set my foot in a five star hotel  
 around the same time i was going through an audition the first ever open audition by national television in china
 with another thousand college girls  the producer told us they were looking for some sweet  innocent and beautiful fresh face
 so when it was my turn  i stood up and said why [ do ] women 's personalities on television always have to be beautiful sweet  innocent
 and you know  supportive  why can 't they have their own ideas and their own voice i thought i
 kind of
  offended them but actually they were impressed
 by my words  and so i was in the second round of competition  and then the third and the fourth after seven rounds of competition  i was the last one to survive it 
 so i was on a national television prime time show 
 and believe it or not that was the first show on chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own
  and my weekly audience at that time was between two hundred to three hundred million people  
 well after a few years i decided to go to the u s and columbia university to pursue my postgraduate studies and then started my own media company  which was unthought of
  during the years that i started my career  so we do a lot of things i 've
 interviewed more than a thousand people in the past and sometimes i have young people approaching me say lan you changed my life and i feel proud of that 
 but then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country i was in
 beijing 's bidding for the olympic games
 i was representing the shanghai expo i saw china embracing the world and vice versa
  sometimes i 'm thinking what are today 's young generation up to 
 how are they different and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of china or at large the world  
 so today i want to talk about young people through the platform of social
  they look like  well this is a girl called guo meimei twenty years old beautiful she showed off her expensive bags clothes and car 
 on her microblog  which is the chinese version of twitter  and she claimed to be the general manager of red cross at the chamber of commerce  
  a turmoil  against the credibility of red cross 
 the controversy was so heated that the red cross had to open a press conference to clarify it and the investigation is going on 
 so far 
 as of today we know that she herself made up that title
 probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity all those expensive items
  were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend who used to be a board member member in a subdivision of red cross at chamber of commerce it 's very complicated to explain  
 but anyway the public still doesn 't buy it it is still boiling it shows us a general mistrust of
  lacked transparency in the past  and also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog 
 microblog boomed in the year of two thousand and ten with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled
 a major news portal alone has more than one hundred and forty million
  two hundred million the most popular blogger it 's not me
 it 's a movie star  and she has more than nine point five million followers or fans about eighty percent of those microbloggers are young people under thirty years old  
 and because as you know the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government social media
  to let the steam out a little bit 
 but because you don 't have many other openings the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong active and even violent  
 so through microblogging  we are able to understand chinese youth even better  
 so how are they different first of all most of them were born in the
  by families who favored boys to girls  now we have ended up with thirty million more young men than women 
 that could pose a potential
 danger to the society but who knows we 're in a globalized world so they can look for girlfriends from other countries  most
  have fairly good education the illiteracy rate in china among this generation is under one percent 
 in cities  eighty percent of kids go to college  but they are facing an aging china with a population above  sixty five years 
  old coming up with seven point some percent this year and about to be fifteen percent by the year of two thousand and thirty and you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially and taking
  care of them when they 're sick  so it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy
  years old 
 so making a living is not that easy for young people college graduates are not in short supply in urban areas college graduates find the starting salary is about four hundred u s dollars a month 
 while the average rent
 is above $ five hundred  so what do they do they have to share space squeezed in in very limited space to save money and they call themselves tribe of ants 
 and for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment  they figured out they have to work for thirty to forty years to afford their first apartment 
 that ratio in america would only
  cost a couple five years to earn but in china it 's thirty to forty years with the skyrocketing real estate price 
 among the two hundred million migrant workers  sixty percent of them are young people  
 they find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas most of them don 't want to go back
 to the countryside  but they don 't have the sense of belonging they work
  longer hours with less income  less social welfare and
 they 're more vulnerable to job losses  subject to inflation  tightening loans from banks
  appreciation of the renminbi or decline of demand from europe or america for the products they produce
  appalling incident in
 a southern oem
 manufacturing compound in china thirteen young workers in their late teens and early  20s committed suicide just one by one like causing
 a contagious disease  but they died because of all different personal reasons but this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society
  about the isolation both physical and mental 
 of these migrant workers for those who do return back to the countryside they find themselves very welcome locally because with the knowledge skills and networks
  they have learned in the cities with the assistance of the internet  they 're able to create more jobs upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market 
  so for the past few years the coastal areas they found themselves in a shortage of labor
 these diagrams show a more general social background the first one is the engels coefficient which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade 
 in terms of family income to about 37 some percent  but then in the
  two years it goes up again to thirty nine percent indicating a rising living cost the gini coefficient
 has already passed the dangerous line of zero point four  now it 's zero point five even worse than that in america showing us the income inequality  
 and so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of
  the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread  so any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities 
 or or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest  
  social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand for the past decade or so a massive
 urbanization and development
 have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property  
 and it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation sometimes people get
  and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest  
 so when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the internet people cry for the government to take actions to stop this 
 so the good news is that earlier this year the state council passed a new regulation on
 house requisition
 and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court  
 similarly many other issues concerning public safety
 is a hot topic
 on the internet
  we heard about polluted air  polluted water  poisoned food and guess what we have faked beef  
 they have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a
 piece of chicken or fish and it turns it to look like beef  and then lately
  people are very concerned about cooking oil because thousands of people have been found [
 refining ] cooking oil from restaurant slop  
 so all these things have aroused a huge
 outcry from the internet  and fortunately we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns  
 while young people seem to be very sure about their participation in
 but sometimes they 're a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life 
 china is soon to pass the u s as the number one market for luxury brands
 that 's not including the chinese expenditures in europe and elsewhere  but you know what half of those consumers are earning a
  below two thousand u s dollars they 're not rich at all they 're taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status  
 and this is a girl explicitly saying on a tv dating show that she would rather cry in a bmw than smile on a bicycle  
 but of course we do have young people who would still prefer to smile whether in a bmw or [ on ] a bicycle
  the next picture you see a very popular phenomenon called naked wedding or naked marriage it does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding
  but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house without a car without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet to show their commitment to true love  
 and also people are doing good through social media and the first picture showed us that a truck caging five hundred homeless and kidnapped
  dogs for food processing
 was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging  people were donating money dog food
 and offering volunteer work to stop that truck and after hours of negotiation five hundred dogs were rescued and here also people are helping to find missing children a father posted his son
  's picture onto the internet after thousands of resends in relay  the child was found and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging  
 so happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years 
 happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values  but also it 's about the environment
  are thinking about the following questions are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher gdp  
 how are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth to keep sustainability and stability  
 and also how capable is the
  to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time i guess these are the questions people are going to answer and our younger generation are going to transform this country
 while at the same time being transformed themselves  thank you very much
