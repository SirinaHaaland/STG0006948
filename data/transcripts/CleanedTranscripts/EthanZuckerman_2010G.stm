  i 'm an american which means generally i ignore football unless it involves guys my size or bruno 's size running into each other at extremely high speeds 
 that said  it 's been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks  i go onto twitter there are all these strange words
  that i 've never heard before fifa  vuvuzela weird jokes about octopi  but the one that 's really been sort of stressing me out that i haven 't been able to figure out is this phrase cala a boca galvao 
 if you 've gone onto twitter in the last couple of weeks you 've probably seen this  it 's been a major trending topic  being a monolingual american i obviously don 't know what the phrase
  i went onto twitter and i asked some people if they could explain to me cala a boca galvao and fortunately my brazilian friends were more than ready to help  
 they explained that the galvao bird is a rare and endangered parrot that 's in terrible terrible danger in fact i 'll let them tell you a bit more about
  actually gets worse it turns out that not only is the galvao parrot
 very attractive  useful for headdresses it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties which means that there 's a terrible problem with galvao abuse some 
  sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting galvao and it 's terribly endangered the good news about this is that the global community again my brazilian friends tell me is pitching in to help out
  it turns out that lady gaga has released a new single actually five or six new singles as near as i can tell titled cala a boca galvao and my brazilian friends tell 
  me that if i just tweet the phrase cala a boca galvao ten cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird now most of you have figured out that this was a prank and actually a very very good one
  actually means something very different in portugese it means shut your mouth galvao and it specifically refers to this guy galvao bueno 
 who 's the lead soccer commentator for rede globo and what i understand from my brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine he can ruin the most 
 interesting match by just spouting cliche again and again and again  so brazilians went to that first match against north korea
  up this banner started a twitter campaign and tried to convince the rest of us to tweet the phrase cala a boca galvao and in fact were so successful at this that it topped twitter for two weeks now
 there 's a couple
 there 's a couple of lessons that you can take from this and the first lesson which i think is a worthwhile one 
 is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online  so long as activism just means
  retweeting a phrase  so as long as activism is that simple it 's pretty easy to get away with the other thing you can take from this by the way is that there are a lot of brazilians on twitter  
 there 's more than five million of them as far as national representation  eleven percent of brazilian internet users are on twitter that 's a much higher number than in the u s or u k next to japan it 's the second most represented by population
  now if you 're using twitter or other social networks  and you didn 't realize this was a space with a lot of brazilians in it you
 're like most of us because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with 
 and if you are like me a big geeky white american guy  you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky white american guys
  and you don 't necessarily have the sense that twitter is in fact a very heavily brazilian space  it 's also extremely surprising to many americans a heavily 
  space twitter recently did some research they looked at their local population they believe that twenty four percent of american twitter users are african american that 's about twice as high as african americans are represented in the population  
 and again that was very shocking to many twitter users but it shouldn 't be and the reason it shouldn 't be is that on any day you can go into trending topics
 and you tend to find topics that are almost entirely african american conversations 
 this was a visualization done by fernando viegas and martin wattenberg two amazing visualization designers who looked at a weekend 's worth of twitter traffic
  and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics were basically segregated conversations and in ways that you wouldn 't expect it turns out that oil spill is a mostly white
  white conversation that cookout is a mostly black conversation 
 and what 's crazy about this is that if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on twitter  it 's literally a quick click away  
 you click on that cookout tag there an entirely different conversation with different people participating in it but generally speaking most of us don 't we end up within these filter bubbles as my friend eli pariser calls them where we see the people we
  already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know and we tend not to see that wider picture  
 now for me i 'm surprised by this because this wasn 't how the internet was supposed to be 
 if you go back into the early days of the internet when cyber utopians like nick negroponte were writing big books like being digital 
 the prediction was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force
 to smooth out cultural
  differences to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another 
 negroponte started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connections in the world of atoms he 's at a technology conference in florida and he 's looking 
  at something really truly absurd  which is bottles of evian water on the table  
  slow atoms over long distances that 's very difficult to do we 're heading to the future of bits where everything is speedy  it 's weightless it can be anywhere in the world at any time and it 's going to change the world as we know it now 
 negroponte has been right about a lot of things he 's totally wrong about this one  
 it turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits if i walk into a store in the united states it 's very very easy for me to
  buy water that 's bottled in fiji  shipped at great expense to the united states  it 's actually surprisingly hard for me to see a fijian feature film  
 it 's really difficult for me to listen to fijian music it 's extremely difficult for me to get fijian news which is strange because actually there 's an enormous amount going on in fiji there 's a
 coup government there 's a military government there 's crackdowns on the press it 's actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to
 at the moment here 's what i think is going on i think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization 
 we look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world and that 's a framework that includes things like
 airline routes it includes things like the internet cables we look at a map like this one  and it looks like the entire world is flat because everything is a hop
  or two away  
 you can get on a flight in london you can end up in bangalore later today two hops you 're in suva the capitol of fiji  it 's all right there 
 when you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks you get a very different picture 
 you start looking at how the global plane flights move  and you suddenly discover that the world isn 't even close to flat it 's extremely lumpy there are parts of the world that are very very well
  there 's basically a giant pathway in the sky between london and new york 
 but look at this map and you can watch this for you know two or three minutes you won 't see very many planes go from south america to africa 
 and you 'll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off when we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible and we look at what actually happens we start realizing that the world doesn 't work quite the same way that we think it does
  so here 's the problem that i 've been interested in in the last decade or so 
 the world is in fact getting more global it 's getting more connected 
 more of problems are global in scale more of our economics is global in scale and our media is less global by the day 
 if you watched a television broadcast in the united states in the 
  to forty percent of it would have been international news on a nightly new broadcast that 's down to about twelve to fifteen percent 
 and this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world  here 's a slide that alisa miller showed at a previous ted talk alisa 's the president of public radio international and she made a cartogram which is basically a distorted map
 based on what american television news casts looked at for
  and you see that when you distort a map based on attention the world within american television news is basically reduced to this giant bloated u s and a couple of other countries which we 've invaded  and that 's basically what our media is about 
 and before you conclude that this is just a function of american tv news which is dreadful and i agree that it 's dreadful
 i 've been mapping elite media like the new york times and i get the same thing when you look at the new york times you look at other elite media what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy
  nations and the nations we 've invaded  it turns out that new media isn 't necessarily helping us all that much 
 here 's a map made by mark graham who 's down the street at the oxford internet institute a this is a map of articles in wikipedia that have been geo coded 
 and you 'll notice that there 's a very heavy bias towards north america and western europe even within
  where we 're creating their own content online there 's a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the wikipedia authors are based rather than to the rest of the world 
 in the u k you can get up you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session you could read a newspaper from india or from australia from canada  god forbid from the u s you probably 
 won 't  if you look at online media consumption in this case in the top ten users of the internet more
  percent of the news readership is on domestic news sites it 's one of these rare cases where the u s is actually slightly better than [ the u k ] because we actually like reading your media rather than vice versa 
 so all of this starts leading me to think that we 're in a state that i refer to as imaginary cosmopolitanism 
 we look at the internet  we think we 're getting this wide view of the globe we occasionally stumble onto a page in chinese and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world and we forget
  that most of the time we 're checking boston red sox scores
  so this is a real problem not just because the red sox are having a bad year but it 's a real problem because as we 're discussing here at ted 
 the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve
 are global in scale and scope they require global conversations to get to global solutions this is a problem we have to
 so here 's the good news 
 for six years i 've been hanging out with these guys this is a group called global voices 
 this is a team of bloggers from around the world our mission was to fix the world 's media we started in two thousand and four you might have noticed we haven 't done all that well so far
  nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem but the more that i think about it the more that i think that a few things that we have learned
 along the way are
  lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world 
 the first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention 
 in this case the map of the world at night by nasa they 're dark literally because of lack of electricity  and i used to think that a dark spot on this map basically meant you 're not going to get media from there because there are more basic needs what i 'm starting to realize is that
 you can get media it 's just an enormous amount of work and you need an enormous amount of encouragement 
 one of those dark spots is madagascar a country which is generally better known for the dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there  and so the people who founded foko club in madagascar weren 't actually concerned with
  trying to change the image of their country they were doing something much simpler 
 it was a club to learn english and to learn computers and the  internet but what happened was that madagascar went through a violent coup most independent media was 
  shut down and the high school students who were learning to blog through foko club suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demonstrations the violence everything that was going on within this country 
  publishing their own thoughts publishing independent media  ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country  
 now the trick with this is that i 'm guessing most people here don 't speak malagasy
 i 'm also guessing that most of you don 't even speak chinese which is sort of sad if you think about it as it 's now the most represented language on the internet fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this  if you 're using google chrome and you go to a chinese language site you notice this
  really cute box at the top 
 which automatically detects that the page is in chinese and very quickly at a mouse click will give you a translation of the page  unfortunately it 's a machine translation of the page  
  and while google is very very good with some languages it 's actually pretty dreadful with chinese and the results can be pretty funny 
  being can translate this  and if you think this is absurd  it 's not there 's a group right now in china called yeeyan 
 and yeeyan is a group of one hundred and fifty thousand volunteers
 who get online every day  they look for the most interesting content in the english language they translate roughly one hundred articles a day from major newspapers major websites they put it online for free  it 's the project of a guy named zhang lei
 who was living in the united states during the lhasa riots and who couldn 't believe how biased american media coverage was and he said if there 's one thing i can do i can start translating so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better 
 and my question to you is if yeeyan can line up one hundred and fifty thousand people to translate the english internet into chinese
  where 's the english language yeeyan 
 who 's going after chinese which now has four hundred million internet users out there my guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say  
 so even if we can find a way to translate from chinese  there 's no guarantee that we 're going to find it 
 when we look for information online we basically have two strategies  we use a lot of search and search is terrific if you know what you 're looking for 
 but if what you 're looking for is serendipity if you want to stumble onto something that
  you didn 't know you needed 
 our main philosophy is to look to our social networks to look for our friends what are they looking at maybe we should be looking at it the problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock  
 you end up flocking with a lot of people who are probably similar to you who have similar interests  and it 's very very hard
  to get information from the other flocks from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests 
 to do this at a certain point you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock you need a guide  
 so this is amira al hussaini she is the middle east editor for global voices she has one of the hardest jobs in the world  not only does she have to keep our israeli and palestinian contributors from killing each other she has to figure out
  going to interest you about the middle east 
 and in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal orbit and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who 's given up smoking for the month of ramadan 
 she has to know something about a global audience she has to know something about what stories are available basically she 's a deejay  
 she 's a skilled human curator who knows what material is available
  who 's able to listen to the audience and who 's able to make a selection and push people forward in one fashion or another  
 i don 't think this is necessarily an algorithmic process i think what 's great about the internet is that it actually makes it much easier for deejays to reach a wider audience  i know 
  amira i can ask her what to read but with the internet she 's in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read and you can listen to her as well if this is a way that you 're interested in having your web widened  
  start lighting up voices in the dark spots once you start translating once you start curating you end up in some really weird places 
 this is an image from pretty much my favorite blog which is afrigadget 
 and afrigadget is a blog that looks at technology in an africa context and specifically it 's looking at a blacksmith in kibera in nairobi who is turning the shaft of a landrover into a cold chisel
  and when you look at this image you might find yourself going why would i conceivably care about this 
 and the truth is this guy can probably explain this to you this is erik hersman you guys may have seen him around the conference he goes by the moniker white african
  he 's both a very well known american geek  but he 's also kenyan he was born in sudan grew up in kenya  he is a bridge
  he is someone who literally has feet in both worlds one in the world of the african technology community one in the world of the american technology community  and so he 's able to tell a story
  about this blacksmith in kibera and turn it into a story about repurposing technology about innovating from constraint about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials 
 he knows one world and he 's finding a way to communicate it to another world both of which he has deep connections to 
  i 'm pretty well convinced are the future of how we try to make the world wider through using the web  
 but the trick with bridges is ultimately you need someone to cross them  and that 's where we start talking about xenophiles  
 so if i found myself in the nfl i suspect i would spend my off season nursing my wounds enjoying my house so on and so forth
  the middle linebacker for the cincinnati bengals has a slightly different approach to the off season 
 dhani has a television show it 's called dhani tackles the globe 
 and every week on this television show dhani travels to a different nation of the world  he finds a local sporting team he trains with them for a week and he plays a match with them 
 and his reason
 for this is not just that he wants to master muay thai boxing 
 it 's because for him  sport is the language that allows him to encounter the full width and wonder of the world 
 for some of us it might be music for some of us it might be food for a lot of us it might be literature or writing 
 but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it  
 the goal of my talk here is not to persuade the people in this room to embrace
  your xenophilia my guess given that you 're at a conference called tedglobal is that most of you are xenophiles whether or not you use that term 
 my challenge instead is this  it 's not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wider world 
 we have to figure out how to rewire the systems that we have we have to fix our media  we have to fix the internet  we have to fix our education
  have to fix our immigration policy  we need to look at ways of creating serendipity of making translation pervasive and we need to find ways to embrace 
 and celebrate these bridge figures and we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles that 's what i 'm trying to do i need your help
