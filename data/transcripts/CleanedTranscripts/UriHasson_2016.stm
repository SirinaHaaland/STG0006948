  imagine that you invented a device that can record my memories my dreams my ideas and transmit them to your brain 
 that would be a game changing technology right but in fact  we already possess this device and it 's called human communication system and
  effective storytelling 
 to understand how this device works we have to look into our brains and we have to formulate the question in a slightly different manner  
 now we have to ask
 how these neuron patterns in my brain
 that are associated with my memories and ideas are transmitted into your brains  and we think there are two factors that enable us to communicate
  first your brain is now
 physically coupled to the sound wave that i 'm transmitting to your brain 
 and second  we developed a common neural protocol that enabled us to communicate  
 so how do we know that 
 in my lab in princeton  we bring people to the fmri scanner and we scan their brains while they
  and to give you a sense of the stimulus we are using let me play twenty seconds
 from a story that we used  told by a very talented storyteller jim o 'grady jim o 'grady so i 'm banging out my story and i know it 's good
 and then i start to make it
 better 
 by adding an element of
  and they recommend against crossing that line  but i had just seen the line crossed between a high powered dean
 and assault with a pastry  and i kinda liked it uri hasson ok  so now let 's look into your brain and see what 's happening when you listen to these kinds of stories and let 's start simple
 let 's start with one listener and one brain area
  cortex that processes the sounds that come from the ear and as you can see in this particular brain area the responses are going up and down as the story is unfolding
 now we can take these responses and compare them to the responses in other listeners in the same brain area  and we can ask how similar are the responses across all listeners 
 so here you can see five listeners  
 and we start to scan their brains before the story starts when they 're simply lying in the dark and waiting for the story to begin 
 as you can see the brain area is going up and down in each one of them  
 but the responses are very different  and not in sync  however  immediately as the story is starting something amazing is happening jo 
 so i 'm banging out my story and i know it 's good
  and then i start to make it uh suddenly you can see that the responses in all of the subjects
 lock to the story and now they are going up and down in a very similar way across all listeners and in fact  this is exactly what is happening now in your brains when you
  think of these five metronomes as five brains 
 and similar to the listeners before the story starts 
 these metronomes are going to click  but they 're going to click out of phase 
 now see what will happen when i connect them together by placing them on these two cylinders
  start to rotate this rotation vibration is going through the wood and is going to couple all the metronomes together and now listen to the click
 is it simply the sounds that the speaker is producing or maybe it 's the words or maybe it 's the meaning that the speaker is trying to convey  
 so to test it we did the following experiment  first we took the story and played it backwards  and that preserved many of the original auditory features  
 but removed
  and we flashed colors in the two brains to indicate brain areas that respond very similarly across people  
 and as you can see this incoming sound induced entrainment or alignment in all of the brains in auditory cortices that process the sounds but it didn 't spread deeper into the brain  
  now we can take these sounds and build words out of it so if we take jim o 'grady and scramble the words we 'll get a list of words jo an animal assorted facts  and right on pie man potentially my stories uh 
 and you can see that these words start to induce alignment in early language areas  but not more than that now we can take the words and start to build sentences out
 nice details 
 didn 't she only know about him through me uh now you can see that the responses in all the language areas that process the incoming language become aligned or similar across all listeners 
 however only when we use the full  engaging coherent story do the responses spread deeper into the brain into
  which include the frontal cortex and the parietal cortex and make all of them respond very similarly  and we believe that these responses in higher order areas are induced
 or become similar across listeners  because of the meaning conveyed by the speaker and not by words or sound  and if we are right there 's a strong prediction over here
 if i tell you the exact same ideas using two very very different sets of words your brain responses will still be similar 
 and to test it we did the following experiment in my lab
 we took the english story
 and translated it to russian now you have two different sounds and linguistic systems that convey the exact same meaning  
 and you play the english story to the english listeners 
 and the russian story to the russian listeners  and we can compare their responses across the groups
  we did that we didn 't see responses
 that are similar in auditory cortices in language because the language and sound are very different however you can see that the responses in high order areas
 were still similar across these two groups 
 we believe this is because they understood the story in a very similar way as we confirmed using a test after the story ended  
 and we think that this alignment is necessary for communication  for example  as you can tell
 i am not a native english speaker i grew up with another language and the same might be for many of you in the audience  and still we can communicate how come  we think we can communicate because we have this
 common code that presents meaning  so far i 've only talked about what 's happening in the listener 's brain in your
  happening in the speaker 's brain in my brain when i 'm speaking to you 
 to look in the speaker 's brain  
 we asked the speaker to go into the scanner  we scan his  brain and then compare his brain responses to the brain responses of the listeners listening to the story 
 you have to remember that producing speech and comprehending speech are very different processes
 saw that all these complex patterns
 within the listeners actually came from the speaker brain  
 so production and comprehension rely on very similar processes  and we also found
 the stronger the similarity
 between the listener 's brain and the speaker 's brain the better the communication  so i know
 that if you are completely confused now
  case your brain responses are very different than mine  
 but i also know that if you really understand me now then your brain  and your brain and your brain are really similar to mine
 now let 's take all this information together and ask how can we use it to transmit a memory that i have from my
  people watch for the first time in their life a tv episode from the bbc series sherlock while we scanned their brains  
 and then we asked them to go back to the scanner and tell the story to another person that never watched the movie  
 so let 's be specific think about this exact scene when sherlock is entering the cab in london driven by the murderer he is looking for
  there is a specific brain pattern in my brain when i watch it now the exact same pattern i can reactivate in my brain again by telling the 
 london  
 murderer and when i 'm transmitting these words to your brains now you have to reconstruct it in your mind 
 in fact we see that pattern emerging now in your brains and we were really surprised to see
  that the pattern you have now in your brains when i 'm describing to you these scenes would be very similar to the pattern i had when i watched this movie a few months ago in the scanner
 this starts to tell you about the mechanism by which we can tell stories and transmit information 
 because for example  now you 're listening really hard and trying to understand what i 'm saying and i know that it 's not easy  but i hope that at one point in the talk we
  clicked  and you got me
 and i think that in a few hours a few days a few months you 're going to meet someone at a party  
 and you 're going to tell him about this lecture  and suddenly it will be as if he is standing now here with us now you can see how we can take this
 mechanism and try to transmit
 memories
  and knowledge across people which is wonderful right 
 but our ability to communicate relies
 on our ability to have common ground  because for example if i 'm going to use the british synonym 
 hackney carriage instead of cab i know that i 'm going to be misaligned with most of you in the audience
 this alignment depends not only on our ability to understand the basic
  it also depends on our ability to develop common ground and understanding and shared belief systems 
 because we know that in many cases people understand the exact same story in very different ways  
 so to test it in the lab we did the following experiment  
 we took a story by 
 in which a husband lost track of his wife in the middle of a party and he 's calling his best friend  asking did you see my wife
 half of the subjects we said that the wife was having an affair with the best friend  for 
 that the
 wife is loyal and the husband is very jealous 
 this one sentence before the story started was enough to make the brain responses of all the people that believed the wife was having an affair be very similar in
  if one sentence is enough to make your brain similar to people that think like you and very different than people that think differently than you think how this effect is going to be amplified in real life when we are all listening to the exact same news item
 after being exposed day after day after day to different media channels like fox news or the new york times that give us very different perspectives on reality
 so let me summarize if everything worked as planned tonight i used my ability to vocalize sound
 to be coupled to your brains and i used this coupling to transmit my brain patterns associated with my memories and ideas into your brains 
 in this i start to reveal the hidden neural mechanism by which we communicate and we know that in the future it will enable us to
  improve and facilitate communication  but these studies also reveal
 that communication relies on a common ground 
 and we have to be really worried as a society if we lose this common ground and our ability to speak with people that are slightly different than us
 because we let a few very strong media channels take control of the mic  and manipulate and control the way we all
  think 
 and i 'm not sure how to fix it because i 'm only a scientist but maybe one way to do it
 is to go back to the more natural way of communication  which is a dialogue in which it 's not only me speaking to you now  
 but a more natural way of talking in which i
 am speaking and i am listening and together we are trying to come to a common ground and new ideas because after
  all the people we are coupled to
 define who we are 
 and our desire to be coupled to another brain is something very basic that starts at a very
 early age  so let me finish with an example from my own private life
 that i think is a good example of how coupling to other people
  really going to define who we are this my son jonathan at a very early age  see how he developed a vocal game
 together with my wife only from the desire and pure joy of being coupled to another human being
  the ability of my son to be coupled to us and other people in his life is going to shape the man he is going to become 
 and think how you change on a daily basis from from the interaction and coupling to other people in your life  
 so keep being coupled to other people keep spreading your ideas  because the sum of all of us
 together coupled is greater than our parts  thank you
