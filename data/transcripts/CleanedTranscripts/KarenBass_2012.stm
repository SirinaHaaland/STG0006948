  i 'm a very lucky person 
 i 've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful earth and the people and creatures that live on it 
 and my passion was inspired at the age of seven when my parents first took me to morocco at the edge of the sahara
  desert  
 now imagine a little brit somewhere that wasn 't cold and damp like home what an amazing experience  
 and it made me want to explore more  
 so as a filmmaker  i 've been from one end of the earth to the other trying to get the perfect shot
 and to capture animal behavior never seen before  and what 's more
  'm really lucky  because i get to share that with millions of people worldwide  now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet
 and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step 
 you might think that it 's quite hard to find new stories and new subjects  but new technology is changing the way we can
  film it 's enabling us to get fresh new images and tell brand new stories 
 in nature 's great events 
 a series for the bbc that i did with david attenborough  we wanted to do just that images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar you see them all the
  but there 's a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see and had never been filmed so
 what we did we went to alaska  which is where the grizzlies rely on really high  almost inaccessible mountain slopes for their denning  
 and the only way to film that
 is a shoot from the air
  and british columbia  thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep 
 there is nothing to eat up here  but the conditions were ideal for hibernation  
 lots of snow in which to dig a den 
 to find food
  mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast  where the snow will already be melting  
 but getting down can be a challenge for small cubs
 these 
  the fate of these bear families  and indeed that of all bears around the north pacific depends on the salmon kb 
 i love that shot i always get goosebumps every time i see it 
 that was filmed from a helicopter using a gyro stabilized camera  
 and it 's a wonderful bit of gear  because it 's like having a flying tripod crane and dolly all rolled into one
 but technology alone isn 't enough 
 to really get the money shots it 's down to being in the right place at the right time and that sequence was especially difficult 
 the first year
 we got nothing  we had to go back the following year all the way back to the remote parts
  and we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks and eventually we got lucky 
 the cloud lifted the wind was still  and even the bear showed up and we managed to get that magic moment 
 for a filmmaker 
 new technology is an amazing tool  but the other thing that really really excites me
 is when new species are discovered  now when i heard about one animal
  i knew we had to get it for my next series untamed americas for national geographic 
 in two thousand and five 
 a new species of bat was discovered in the cloud forests of ecuador  and what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery
 of what pollinated a unique flower it depends solely on the bat
  hasn 't even aired yet so you 're the very first to see this see what you think
  but how to reach it  
 necessity is the mother of evolution
  the longest relative to body length of any mammal
  we filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower
 and using a camera that could slow the action by forty times so imagine how quick that thing is in real life
 now people often ask me where 's your favorite place on the planet 
 and the truth is i just don 't have one there are so many wonderful places  
 but some locations draw you back time and time again  
 and one remote location i first went there as a backpacker i 've been back several times for filming most recently for untamed americas
 it 's the
  altiplano in the high andes of south america  and it 's the most otherworldly place i know  
 but at fifteen thousand feet it 's tough it 's freezing cold and
 that thin air really gets you  sometimes it 's hard to breathe especially carrying all the heavy filming equipment  
 and that pounding head just
  feels like a constant hangover  but the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere
 is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens with amazing clarity have a look
 it 's called the altiplano or high plains 
 a place of extremes and extreme contrasts
  mars than earth it seems just as hostile to life 
 stars 
 themselves
 at twelve thousand feet
  dry thin air makes for perfect stargazing  
 some of the world 's astronomers have telescopes nearby 
 but just looking up with the naked eye
 i 'm really
 the
