  a paradise lost 
  we generate six hundred and eighty cubic meters of plastic garbage a day that 's about a 
  building  and when it comes to plastic bags  less than five percent gets recycled mw 
 we know that changes the image you may have of our island
  when we learned about it when we learned that almost all plastic bags in bali end up in our drains and then in our rivers and then in our ocean  
 and those that don 't even make it to the ocean they 're either burned or littered iw 
 so we decided to do something about it  and we 've been working for almost three years now to try to say no to plastic bags on our home island  and we have had some significant successes
  sisters  and we go to the best school on earth 
 green school bali  green school is not only different in the way that it is built out of bamboo  
 but also in the way that it teaches we are taught to become leaders of today 
 something a normal textbook cannot match iw one day we had a lesson in class where we learned about significant people like
  nelson mandela lady diana and mahatma gandhi  walking home that day we agreed that
 we also wanted to be significant  why should we wait until we were grown up to be significant we wanted to do something now mw 
 sitting on the sofa that night we brainstormed and thought of all the issues facing bali and one thing that stood out to us the most was the plastic garbage
 but that is a huge problem 
 so we looked into what was a realistic target for us kids plastic bags and the idea was born iw 
 we started researching  and let 's just say the more we learned there was nothing good about plastic bags and you know
  we don 't even need them mw 
 we were really inspired by the efforts to say no to plastic bags in many other places 
 from hawaii to rwanda and to severals cities like oakland and dublin iw 
 and so the idea turned into the launch of bye bye plastic bags mw 
 in the years that we have been campaigning we have learned
  lesson number one 
 you cannot do it all by yourself you need a big team of like minded kids  and so we formed the bye bye plastic bags crew 
 the volunteer team includes children from all over the island from both international and local schools 
 and together with them we started a multi layered approach based on an on an on and off line signature petition  
 educational and inspirational presentations at schools and we raise general awareness at markets
  beach clean ups and last but not least we distribute alternative bags bags like net bags
  recycled newspaper bags or one hundred percent organic material bags all made by local initiatives on the island iw 
 we run a pilot village home of eight hundred families the village mayor was our first friend and he loved our t shirts so that helped  
 we focused on making the customers
  aware because that 's where the change needs to happen the village is already  two thirds along the way of becoming plastic bag free 
 our first attempts to get the government of bali on board
 failed  so we thought hmm a petition with one million signatures
  have guessed one million signatures is like a thousand times a thousand 
 we got stuck
 till we learned lesson number two  
 think outside the box  
 someone mentioned that the bali airport handles sixteen million arrivals and departures a year
  get into the airport and here comes lesson number three persistence
  off we headed to the airport  we got past the janitor 
 and then it was his boss 's boss and then the assistant office manager  and then the office manager and then  
 we got shuffled down two levels and thought well  here comes the
  and after several days knocking on doors and just being kids on a mission 
 we finally got to the commercial manager of bali airports  and we gave him the bali of plastic bags speech and being a very nice man he said
  and a half there  we got almost one thousand signatures how cool is that 
 lesson number four you need champions at all levels of society 
 from students to commercial managers to famous people 
 and thanks to the attraction of green school we had access to a steady stream of
  of the united nations
 don 't sign petitions 
 laughter even if kids ask nicely but he promised to spread the word and now we work closely with the united nations mw 
 jane goodall taught us the power of a people 's network  
 she started with just one roots & shoots group and now she has four thousand groups around the world we are one of them  she 's a real inspiration 
 if you 're a fellow
 rotarian nice to meet you we 're interactors the youngest department of rotary international iw 
 but we have also learned much about patience mw 
 how to deal with frustrations iw leadership mw teamwork iw friendship mw we learned more about the balinese and their culture iw 
 and we learned about the importance
  it 's not always easy  sometimes it does get a little bit hard to walk your talk iw 
 but last year  we did exactly that we went to india to give a talk and our parents took us to visit the former private house of mahatma gandhi  
 we learned about the power of hunger strikes he did to reach his goals  yes by the end of the tour when we met our parents again  
  you can probably imagine their faces it took a lot of convincing and not only to our parents but to our friends and to our teachers as well
 isabel and i were serious about doing this so we met with a nutritionist  and we came up with a compromise of not eating from sunrise
 to sunset every day until the governor of bali would agree to meet with us to talk about how to stop plastic
  bags on bali iw 
 our mogak makan as it is called in bahasa indonesia started 
 we used social media to support our goal and already on day two police started to come to our home and school what were these two girls doing 
 we knew we weren 't making the governor look his best by doing this food
  hours later we were picked up from school and escorted to the office of the governor mw and there he was waiting for us to meet
 and speak being all supportive and thankful for our willingness to care for the beauty and the environment of bali 
 he signed a promise to help the people of bali say no to plastic
  and we are now friends and on a regular basis we remind him and his team of the promises he has made 
 and indeed recently he stated and committed that bali will be plastic bag free by two thousand and eighteen iw also 
 at the international airport of bali one of our supporters is planning to start a plastic
 bag free policy by two thousand and sixteen mw 
 stop handing out free plastic bags and bring in your own reusable bag is our next message to change that mindset of the public iw 
 our short term campaign one island one voice is all about this  we check and recognize the shops and restaurants that have declared themselves a
  and we put this sticker at their entrance and publish their names on social media and some important magazines on bali  
 and conversely that highlights those who do not have the sticker mw 
 so why are we actually telling you all of this  
 well partly it is because we are proud of the results that together with our team we have been able to reach  
 but also because along the way we have learned that kids can do things we can make
  things happen  
 isabel and i were only ten and twelve years old when we started this  we never had a business plan  
 nor a fixed strategy nor any hidden agendas just the idea in front of us and a group of friends working with us all we wanted to do was stop those plastic bags from wrapping and suffocating our beautiful home 
 kids have a boundless energy and a motivation
  to be the change the world needs iw so to all the kids of this beautiful
 but challenging world 
 go for it make that difference we 're not telling you it 's going to be easy  we 're telling you it 's going to be worth it 
 us kids may only be twenty five percent of the world 's population  but we are one hundred percent of the future
 we still have a lot of work to do 
 but know that we still not stop until the first question asked when arriving at the bali airports will be
