  start out obsessed with food i started out obsessed with global security policy because i lived in new york during nine eleven and it was obviously a very relevant thing  
 and i got from global security policy to food because i realized when i 'm hungry i 'm really pissed off  and i 'm assuming that the rest of the world is too
  especially if you 're hungry and your kids are hungry and your neighbor 's kids are hungry and your whole neighborhood is hungry you 're pretty angry and actually lo and behold it looks pretty much like the areas of the world that are hungry are also the 
  areas of the world that are pretty insecure  so i took a job at the united nations world food programme as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues 
  of the cycle of poverty and hunger that continues for a lot of people around the world and stop it by giving kids a free school meal it gets them into school  which is obviously education the first step out of poverty  but it also gives 
  them the micronutrients and the macronutrients they need to really develop both mentally and physically while i was working at the u n i met this girl her name is lauren bush  and she had this really awesome idea to sell the
  really beautifully ironic because you can strap on the feed bag
 but each bag we 'd sell would provide a year 's worth of of school meals for one kid it 's so simple and we thought you know okay  it costs between twenty and fifty bucks to provide school feeding for a year 
  we could sell these bags and raise a ton of money and a ton of awareness for the world food programme but of course  you know at the u n sometimes things move slowly and they basically said no and we thought god this is such a good idea and it 's going to raise so much money so we said screw it we 'll just start our own company which we did three years ago so that was kind
  my first dream was to start this company called feed and here 's a screenshot of our website we did this bag for haiti and we launched it just a month after the earthquake to provide school meals for kids in haiti  so feed 's 
  doing great  we 've so far provided fifty five million meals to kids around the world by selling now five hundred and fifty thousand bags a ton of bags a lot of bags all this time you 're when you think
  hard thing to think about because what we think about is eating i think about eating a lot  and i really love it and the thing that 's a little strange about international hunger and talking about international issues is that most people kind of want to know what are you doing in america what are you doing for america 's kids 
 there 's definitely hunger in america forty nine million people and almost sixteen point seven million children i mean that 's pretty dramatic for our own country 
 hunger definitely means something a little bit different in america than it does internationally  but it 's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country  but obviously the bigger problem that we all know about
 is obesity and it 's dramatic the other thing that 's dramatic is that both hunger and obesity have really risen in the last thirty years  unfortunately obesity 's not only an american problem it 
  's actually been spreading all around the world and mainly through our kind of food systems that we 're exporting the numbers are pretty crazy there 's a billion people obese or overweight and a billion people hungry  so those seem like two bifurcated problems but i kind of started to think about
  is obesity and hunger what are both those things about well they 're both about food  and when you think about food the underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture and
 agriculture is where food comes from well agriculture in america 's very interesting it 's very consolidated and the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we
  the foods that are produced are more or less corn soy and wheat and as you can see that 's three quarters of the food that we 're eating for the most part processed foods and fast foods  unfortunately in our agricultural system we haven 't done a good job 
  in the last three decades of exporting those technologies around the world  so african agriculture which is the place of of most hunger in the world has actually fallen precipitously as hunger has risen so somehow we 're not making the connect between exporting a good
  agricultural system that will help feed people all around the world 
 who is farming them that 's what i was wondering  so i went and stood on a big grain bin in the midwest  and that really didn 't help me understand farming but i think it 's a really cool picture  
 and you know the reality is that between between farmers in america who actually quite frankly when i spend time in the midwest are
 pretty large in general and their farms are also large
  but farmers in the rest of the world are actually quite skinny and that 's because they 're starving most hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers and most of those
  people are women
 which is a totally other topic that i won 't get on right now but i 'd love to do the feminist thing at some point 
 i think it 's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides there 's this large consolidated farming that 's led to what we eat in america and it 's really been since around one thousand nine hundred and eighty after the oil crisis when you know mass consolidation  mass exodus of small farmers
  and then in the same time period you know we 've kind of left africa 's farmers to do their own thing  unfortunately  what is farmed ends up as what we eat and in america a lot of what we eat has led to obesity 
 and has led to a real change in sort of what our diet is in the last thirty years 
  just in our own country but really we 're exporting the system around the world and when you look at the data of least developed countries especially in cities which are growing
 really rapidly people are eating american processed foods and in one generation they 're going from hunger and all of the detrimental health effects of hunger to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation so
 the problematic food system is affecting both hunger
  and obesity not to beat a dead horse but this is a global food system where there 's a billion people hungry and billion people obese  i think that 's the only way to look at it and instead of taking 
  these two things as bifurcated problems that are very separate  it 's really important to look at them as one system we get a lot of our food from all around the world and people from all around the world are importing our food system so it 's incredibly relevant to start a new way of looking at it 
  learned and the technology people that are here which i 'm totally not one of them but apparently it really takes thirty years for a lot of technologies to become really endemic to us like the mouse and and 
  the internet and windows you know there 's 30 year cycles  i think two thousand and ten can be a really interesting year because it is the end of the 30 year cycle  and it 's the birthday of the global food system so that 's the first birthday
 i want to talk about you know  i think if we really think that this is something that 's happened in the last thirty years there 's hope in that it 's the thirtieth anniversary of gmo crops and the big gulp chicken mcnuggets high fructose corn 
  syrup  the farm crisis in america and the change in how we 've addressed agriculture internationally so there 's a lot of reasons to take this 30 year time period as as sort of the creation of this new food system i
 three decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change well i really care about one thousand nine hundred and eighty because it 's also the thirtieth anniversary of me this year
 and so
 in my lifetime a lot of what 's happened in the world and being a person obsessed with food a lot of this has really changed  
 so my second dream is that i think we can
  look to the next thirty years as a time to change the food system again  and we know what 's happened in the past  so if we start now and we look at technologies and improvements to the food system long term 
  we might be able to recreate the food system so when i give my next talk and i 'm sixty years old i 'll be able to say that it 's been a success  
  ideas for food system change and i think by aligning international advocates that are addressing hunger and domestic advocates that are addressing obesity  we might actually look for long term solutions 
  that will make the food system better for everyone  we all tend to think that these systems are quite different and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world but if we take a 30 year view there 's more hope in collaborative 
  ideas  so i 'm hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations like the one campaign and slow food which don 't seem right now to have much in common we can talk about
  holistic long term systemic solutions that will improve food for everyone  
 some ideas i 've had is like look the reality is kids in the south bronx need apples and carrots and so do kids in botswana and how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods  
 another thing that 's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish  understanding how to produce protein in a way that 's healthy for the environment and healthy for people will be incredibly important to address things like climate change and
 how we use petrochemical fertilizers and you
 know these are really relevant topics that are long term and important for both people in in africa who are small farmers and people in america who are farmers and eaters  
 and i also think that thinking about processed foods in a new way where we actually price the negative externalities like petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff into the price of a bag of chips well if that bag of chips then becomes
 inherently more expensive than an apple then maybe it 's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three quarters of the products being made just from corn soy and wheat the 
 is launched  and i 've gathered a coalition of a few organizations to start and it 'll be growing over
 the next few months  but i really hope that you will all think of ways that you can look long term at at things like the food system and make change
