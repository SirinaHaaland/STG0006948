  came into the forest under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously 
 the one eyed monkey recognized the woman  a sekhri  she was the wife of an even more famous brahmin
 to watch her better the one eyed monkey climbed onto the tree
 just then with a loud bang the heavens opened and the god indra jumped into the clearing 
 indra saw the woman  a sekhri ah hah the woman paid him no heed
 threw her onto the floor and proceeded to rape her  
 then indra disappeared 
 and the woman 's husband the brahmin appeared  
 he realized at once what had happened
  really wanted for the woman  a sekhri to get justice  so she retold events exactly as they had
  vishnu gave his judgment 
 the god indra has sinned in that he has sinned against 
 a brahmin  may he be called to wash away his sins so  indra arrived  
 and performed the sacrifice of the horse and so it transpired
 that a horse was killed
 a god was made
 a brahmin 's ego was appeased a woman  was ruined  
 and a one eyed monkey was left
 very confused at what we humans call justice
  in india there is a rape every three minutes in india only twenty five percent of rapes
 come to a police station  
 and of these twenty five percent that come to a police station convictions are only in four percent of the
  that 's a lot of women who don 't get justice 
 and it 's not only about women  
 look around you look at your own countries there is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes 
 if you 're in australia  it 's mostly aboriginals who are in jail 
 if you 're in india it 's either muslims or adivasis our tribals the naxalites if you 're in
  's mostly the blacks 
 there is a trend here and the brahmins and the gods like in my story  always get to tell their truth as the truth so have we all become
 i have told this story
 close to five hundred and fifty times in audiences in forty countries to school students to
 black tie dinners at the smithsonian and so on and so forth and every time it hits something now if i were to go into the same crowd and say i want to lecture you about justice and injustice
  thank you very much we have other things to do and that is the astonishing power of art 
 art can go through where other things can 't you can 't have barriers  because it breaks through your prejudices breaks through
 everything that you have as your mask that says i am this i am that i am that no it breaks through those and it reaches somewhere where other things don 't 
 and in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change we need a language that reaches through
 hitler knew it he used wagner to make all the nazis feel wonderful and aryan 
 and mr berlusconi knows it as he sits atop this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth  
 and all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don 't require  they also know the power of the arts
 for me it came very early  
 when i was a young child my mother who was a choreographer 
 came upon a phenomenon that worried her 
 it was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural gujarat because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in laws ' families  and she created a dance piece which then prime minister
  nehru saw he came to talk to her and said what is this about she told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call dowry dance 
 imagine a dance piece for the first inquiry into something that even today kills thousands of women  
 many years later when i was working with the director peter brook in the mahabharata playing this feisty feminine
  feminist called draupadi  i had similar experiences 
 big fat black mamas in the bronx used to come and say hey girl that 's it 
 and then these trendy young things in the sorbonne would say madame draupadi on n 'est pas feministe mais a a 
 and then aboriginal women in africa would come and say this is it and i thought this is what we need
  we had somebody from public health and devdutt also mentioned public health  well  millions of people around the world die of waterborne disease every year  
 and that 's because there is no clean water to drink or in countries like india people don 't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation  
 so what do they do they drink the water they know is dirty 
 they get cholera they get diarrhea they get jaundice and they die 
  have not been able to provide clean water 
 they try and build it they try and build pipelines it doesn 't happen and the mncs give them machines that they cannot afford so what do you do do you let them die  well somebody 
  had a great idea  and it was a simple idea it was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help
  most houses in asia and india have a cotton garment 
 and it was discovered and who endorses this that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over can reduce bacteria up to eighty percent from water sieved through  
 so  why aren 't governments blaring this on television why isn 't it on every poster across the third world 
 because there is no profit in it because nobody can get a kickback but it still needs to get to people  and here is one of the ways we get it to people
  it 's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives  
 while universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at
 borders we are surrounded by violence whether it 's road rage or whether it 's domestic violence  whether it 's 
  a teacher beating up a student and killing her because she hasn 't done her homework it 's everywhere  so why are we not doing something to actually
  that problem on a day to day basis what are we doing to try and make children and young people realize that violence is something that we
 indulge in that we can stop  and that there are other ways of actually
 taking violence taking anger taking frustrations into different things that do not harm other people  
  here is one such way
 one of the
  gangs from this neighborhood killing gangs from
 that neighborhood  hello governments of rich countries selling arms to
  governments of poor countries who can 't even afford to give them food
  has been used across the world to talk about social issues a few years ago we had a film called rang de basanti which suddenly
 spawned thousands of young people wanting to volunteer for social change in venezuela one of the most popular soap operas has a heroine called crystal and when onscreen crystal got breast
  thousand more young women went to have mammographies done  
 and of course the vagina monologues we know about and there are stand up comics who are talking about racial issues about ethnic issues  
 so why is it that if we think that we all agree that we need a better world we need a more just world why is it that we are not using 
  the one language that has consistently showed us that we can break down barriers that we can reach
 what i need to say to the planners of the world the governments the strategists is 
 you have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake it needs to be the yeast 
 because any future planning if two thousand and forty eight is when we want to get there unless the arts are put with the scientists with the economists with
 prepare for the future badly we 're not going to get there 
 and unless this is actually internalized it won 't happen so what is it that we require what is it that we need we need to break down our vision of what planners are of what the
 correct way of a path is and to say
 all these years of trying to make a better world and we have failed there are more people being raped there are more wars there are more people dying of simple things so 
 something has got to give and that is what i want can i have my last audio track please  
 once there was a princess who whistled beautifully 
  her father the king said don 't whistle 
 her mother the queen said hai don 't whistle but the princess continued whistling 
 the years went by and the princess grew up into a beautiful young woman
  who whistled even more beautifully 
 her father the king said who will marry a whistling princess
  her mother the queen said who will marry a whistling princess 
 but the king had an idea  he announced a swayamvara  he invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom
 and
  but the princess said father mother don 't worry  i have an idea  i am going to go to each of these young men and i am going to ask them if they
 defeated correctly and if
  somebody answers that shall be my wish so she went up to each and said do you accept that i have defeated you
