  if you want to liberate a society  all you need is the internet i was wrong  
 i said those words back in two thousand and eleven  when a facebook page i anonymously created helped spark the egyptian revolution
 the arab spring revealed social media 's greatest potential  but it also exposed its greatest shortcomings 
 the same tool that united us to topple dictators
 eventually tore us apart  
 i would like to share my own experience in using social media for activism and talk about some of the challenges
  have personally faced and what we could do about them in the early 
 arabs were flooding the web  
 thirsty for knowledge for opportunities for connecting with the rest of the people around the globe  we escaped
 our frustrating political realities
 and lived a virtual
  life 
 just like many of them i was completely apolitical until two thousand and nine 
 at the time  when i logged into social media  
 i started seeing more and more egyptians aspiring for political change in the country  
 it felt like i was not alone 
 in june two thousand and ten internet
 changed my life
  forever while browsing
 facebook  i saw a photo a terrifying photo of a tortured  dead body
 of a young egyptian guy his name was khaled
  i thought i could be khaled i could not sleep that night  and i
 decided to do something i anonymously created a facebook page and called it we are all khaled said 
 in just three days the page had over one hundred thousand people fellow
  to stop 
 i recruited my co admin abdelrahman mansour 
 we worked together for hours and hours  we were crowdsourcing ideas from the people we
 were engaging them we were calling collectively for actions  and sharing news that the regime did not want egyptians to know 
 the page became the most followed page in the arab world  it had more
  fans than established media organizations
 and even top celebrities 
 on january fourteen two thousand and eleven  ben ali fled out of tunisia after mounting protests against his regime  
 i saw a spark of hope  egyptians on social media were wondering if tunisia did it why can 't we
  posted an event on facebook and called it a revolution against corruption injustice and dictatorship 
 i posed a question to the three hundred thousand users of the page at the time 
 of january
 the 25th of january is police day  it 's a national holiday if one hundred thousand of us take to the streets of cairo
 no one is going to stop us i wonder if we could do it 
 in just a few days the invitation reached over a million people and over one hundred thousand people confirmed attendance 
 social media was crucial for this campaign it helped a decentralized movement arise 
 it made people realize that they were not alone  and it made it impossible for the regime
  to stop it at the time they didn 't even understand it 
 and on january 25th 
 egyptians flooded the streets of cairo and other cities  calling for change breaking the barrier of fear
 and announcing a new era  
 then came the
  a few hours before the regime cut off the internet and telecommunications i was walking in a dark street in cairo  around midnight  
 i had just tweeted pray for egypt  the government must be planning a massacre tomorrow 
 i was hit hard on my head  
 i lost my balance and fell down to find four armed men surrounding me one covered my mouth and the others
  paralyzed me  i knew i was being kidnapped by state security  i found myself in a cell  
 handcuffed  blindfolded  i was terrified  so was my family  
 who started looking for me in hospitals police stations and even
  after my disappearance a few of my fellow colleagues who knew i was the admin of the page told the media
 about my connection with that page and that i was likely arrested by state security 
 my colleagues at google started a search campaign trying to find me 
 and the fellow protesters in the square demanded my release after eleven days of complete darkness i was set free  
 and three days later mubarak
  was forced to step down  it was the most inspiring and empowering moment of my life  it was a time of great hope  
 egyptians lived a utopia for eighteen days during the revolution they all shared the belief that we could actually live together despite our
  egypt after mubarak would be for all but unfortunately the post revolution events
 were like a punch in the gut  
 the euphoria faded  we failed to build consensus 
 and the political struggle led to intense polarization social media only amplified that state by facilitating the spread
  echo chambers and hate speech  the environment was purely toxic 
 my online world became a battleground filled with trolls  lies  hate speech  
 i started to worry about the safety of my family  
 but of course this wasn 't just about me  the polarization reached its peak between the two main powers
 the army supporters and the islamists
 people in the center like me started feeling helpless  
 both groups wanted you to side with them you were either with them or against them  
 and on the 3rd of july two thousand and thirteen the army ousted egypt 's first democratically elected president  
 after three days of popular protest that demanded his resignation 
  day i made a very hard decision i decided to go silent completely silent  it was a moment of defeat  
 i stayed silent for more than two years and i used the time to reflect on everything that happened 
 trying to understand why did it happen  
 it became clear to me that while it 's true that polarization
  primarily driven by our human behavior social media shapes this behavior and magnifies its impact 
 say you want to say something that is not based on a fact  pick a fight or ignore someone that you don 't like
 these are all natural human impulses  but because of technology 
 acting on these impulses is only one click away 
  view  there are five critical challenges facing today 's social media 
 first  we don 't know how to deal with rumors  
 rumors that confirm people 's biases are now believed and spread among millions of people 
 second  we create our own echo chambers we tend to only communicate with people that we agree with
  and thanks to social media we can mute un follow and block everybody else  
 third online discussions quickly descend into angry mobs all of us probably know that it
 's as if we forget that the people behind screens are actually real people and not just avatars  
 and fourth  it became
  really hard to change our opinions 
 because of the speed and brevity of social media  
 we are forced to jump to conclusions and write sharp opinions in one hundred and forty characters about complex world affairs  
 and once we do that it lives forever on the internet 
 and we are less motivated to change these views even when new evidence arises
  fifth and in my point of view this is the most critical
 today our social media experiences are designed in a way that favors broadcasting over engagements posts over discussions 
 shallow comments over deep conversations  
 it 's as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other instead of talking with each other
  i witnessed how these critical challenges contributed to an already polarized egyptian society  but this is not just about egypt 
 polarization is on the rise in the whole world 
 we need to work hard on figuring out how technology could be part of the solution  rather than part of the problem
  there 's a lot of debate today on how to combat online harassment and fight trolls this is so important  no one could argue against that but
 we need to also think about how to design social media experiences that promote civility and reward thoughtfulness  
 i know for a fact if i write
 a post that is more sensational
  get to have more people see that post i will get more attention  
 but what if we put more focus on quality 
 what is more important the total number of readers of a post you write 
 or who are the people who have impact that read what you write 
 couldn 't we just give people more incentives to engage in conversations  rather than just broadcasting opinions all the time
 or reward people for reading and responding to views that they disagree with 
 and also make it socially acceptable that we change our minds  or probably even reward that 
 what if we have a matrix that says how many people changed their minds  and that becomes part of our social media
  if i could track how many people are changing their minds  i 'd probably write more thoughtfully  trying to do that  
 rather than appealing to the people who already agree with me and liking because i just confirmed their biases  
 we also need to think about effective crowdsourcing mechanisms to fact check
 widely spread online information and reward people who take part in
  we need to rethink today 's social media ecosystem and redesign its experiences to reward thoughtfulness  civility and mutual understanding 
 as a believer in the internet  i teamed up with a few friends started a new project trying to find answers and explore possibilities 
 our first product is a new media platform for conversations
  we 're hosting conversations that promote mutual understanding and hopefully change minds  we don 't claim to have the answers 
 but we started experimenting with different discussions about very divisive issues such as race  gun control the refugee debate relationship between islam and terrorism 
 these are conversations that matter 
  at least one out of three people
 on the planet have access to the internet  
 but part of this internet is being held captive by the less noble aspects of our human behavior 
 five years ago  i said if you want to liberate society  
 all you need is the internet today  i believe
 if we want to liberate society  we first need to liberate the internet  thank you very much
