  this story begins about fifteen years ago when i was a hospice doctor at the university of chicago  and i was taking care of people who were dying and their families in the south side of chicago 
  and i was observing what happened to people and their families over the course of their terminal illness
  in my lab i was studying the widower effect which is a very old idea in the social sciences going back one hundred and fifty years known as dying of a broken heart so when i die my wife 's risk of death can double for instance in the first year  
 and i had gone to take care of one particular patient a woman who was dying of dementia  and in this case  unlike this
  she was being cared for by her daughter and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother  
 and the daughter 's husband he also
 was
 sick from his wife 's exhaustion  
 and i was driving home one day and i get a phone call from the husband 's friend  calling me because he was depressed about what was happening to his friend  
 so here i get this call from this random guy that 's having an experience that 's being influenced by people at some social distance
 and so i suddenly realized two very simple things first the widowhood effect was not restricted to husbands and wives  and second it was not restricted to pairs of people 
 and i started to see the world in a whole new way like pairs of people connected to each other  and then i realized that these individuals would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby and
  fact these people were embedded in other sorts of relationships marriage and spousal and friendship and other sorts of ties and that in fact these connections were vast
  and that we were all embedded in this broad set of connections with each other so i started to see the world in a completely new way and i became obsessed with this  i
 became obsessed with how it might be that we 're embedded in these social networks and how they affect our lives  
 so  social networks are these intricate things of beauty and they 're so elaborate and so complex and so ubiquitous in fact that one has to ask what purpose they serve 
  why are we embedded in social networks  i mean how do they form how do they operate and how do they effect us 
  it had become trendy to speak about the obesity epidemic and  along with my collaborator james fowler we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic and could it spread from person to person like the four people i discussed earlier  
 so this is a slide of some of our initial results it 's two thousand two hundred people in the year two thousand every dot is a person
  we make the dot size proportional to people 's body size  so bigger dots are bigger people
 in addition if your body size if your bmi your body mass index is above thirty if you 're clinically obese we also colored the dots yellow 
 so if you look at this image right away you might be able to see that there are clusters of obese and non obese people in the image  but the visual complexity is still very high it 's not obvious exactly what
  in addition some questions are immediately raised how much clustering is there is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone how big are the clusters how far do they reach and most importantly what causes the clusters  
 so we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters this here shows on the y axis the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and on the x axis
  the degrees of separation between the two people on the far left you see the purple line it says that if your friends are obese your risk of obesity is forty five percent higher  and the next bar over the 
 [ red ] line says if your friend 's friends are obese your risk of obesity is twenty five percent higher  
  that there 's no longer a relationship between that person 's body size and your own body size  
 well  what might be causing this clustering there are at least three possibilities one possibility is that as i gain weight  it causes you to gain weight a kind of induction a kind of spread from person to person 
 another possibility very obvious is homophily or birds of a feather flock together here i form my tie to you because you and i share a similar body size 
 and the last possibility is what is known as
  confounding because it confounds our ability to figure out what 's going on and here the idea is not that my weight gain is causing your weight gain nor that i preferentially form a tie with you because you and i 
  share the same body size  but rather that we share a common exposure to something like a health club that makes us both lose weight at the same time
 we found evidence for all of these things  including for induction  and we found that if your friend becomes obese  it increases your risk of obesity by about fifty seven percent in the same given time period
 there can be many mechanisms for this effect one possibility is that your friends say to you something like you know they adopt a behavior that spreads to you like they say let 's go have muffins and beer which is a terrible combination 
  you adopt that combination and then you start gaining weight like them
 another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is here what 's spreading from person to person is not a behavior  but rather a norm an idea is spreading  
 now  headline writers had a field day with our studies  i think the headline in the new york times was 
 are you packing it on blame your fat friends
  is that the european headline writers had a different take they said are your friends gaining weight  perhaps you are to blame 
 and we thought this was a very interesting comment on america and a kind of self serving 
 not my responsibility kind of phenomenon now i want to be very clear we do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all
  all 
 our next questions was could we actually visualize this spread 
 was weight gain in one person actually spreading to weight gain in another person 
 and this was complicated because we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure the architecture of the ties was changing across time in addition because obesity is not
  a patient zero of the obesity epidemic if we find that guy there was a spread of obesity out from him it 's a multicentric epidemic  lots of people are doing things at the same time and i 'm about to show 
  you a thirty second video animation that took me and james five years of our lives to do 
  you 're going to see people be born and die dots will appear and disappear ties will form and break  marriages and divorces  friendings and defriendings a 
  lot of complexity a lot is happening just in this 30 year period that includes the obesity epidemic and by the end you 're going to see clusters of obese and non obese individuals within
  changed the way i see things 
 because this thing this network that 's changing across time it has a memory  it moves things flow within it it has a kind of consistency people can die but it doesn 't die it still
 persists and it has a kind of resilience
  that allows it to persist across time and so i came to see these kinds of social networks as living things 
 as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope to study and analyze and understand  
 and we used a variety of techniques to do this  and we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena we looked at smoking and drinking behavior  and voting behavior  and divorce which can spread and altruism 
 and eventually we became interested in emotions 
 now
 when we have emotions  we show them  
 why do we show our emotions  
 i mean there would be an advantage to experiencing our emotions inside you know anger or happiness  but we don 't just experience them we show them and not only do we show them  but others can read them and not only can 
  they read them  but they copy them  there 's emotional contagion that takes place in human populations  
  suggests that in addition to any other purpose they serve  they 're a kind of primitive form of communication 
 and that in fact if we really want to understand human emotions  we need to think about them in this way now we 're accustomed to thinking about emotions in this way in simple  
 sort of brief periods of time so for example  i was giving this talk recently in new york city
  when you 're on the subway and the other person across the subway car smiles at you and you just instinctively smile back and they looked at me and said we don 't do that in new york city 
 and i said everywhere else in the world that 's normal human behavior 
 and so there 's a very instinctive way in which we briefly transmit emotions to each other  and in fact emotional contagion can be broader still like we could have punctuated
  as in riots  the question that we wanted to ask was could emotion spread in a more sustained way
 than riots across time and involve large numbers of people not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car  maybe there 's a kind of below the surface quiet 
  riot that animates us all the time  maybe there are emotional stampedes that ripple through social networks  maybe in
  emotions have a collective existence not just an individual existence  and this is one of the first images we made to study this phenomenon  again a social network but now we color the people 
  yellow if they 're happy and blue if they 're sad and green in between and if you look at this image you can right away see clusters of happy and unhappy people again spreading to three degrees 
  of separation and you might form the intuition that the unhappy people occupy a different structural location within the network there 's a middle and an edge to this
  network and the unhappy people seem to be located at the edges  
 so to invoke another metaphor if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabric of humanity i 'm connected to you and you to her on out endlessly into the distance this 
  fabric is actually like an old fashioned american quilt  and it has patches on it happy and unhappy patches
  and whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch 
 so 
 this work with emotions which are so fundamental then got us to thinking about maybe the fundamental causes of human social networks are somehow encoded in our genes 
  because human social networks whenever they are mapped always kind of look like this  the picture of the network  but
  they never look like this  why do they not look like this  why don 't we form human social networks that look like a regular lattice  
 well  the striking patterns of human social networks  their ubiquity and their apparent purpose beg questions about whether we evolved to have human social networks in the first place  and whether we evolved to form networks with a particular structure  
 and notice first of all so to understand this though we need to dissect
  network structure a little bit first and notice that every person in this network has exactly the same structural location as every other person  
 but that 's not the case with real networks 
 so for example here is a real network of college students at an elite northeastern university and now i 'm highlighting a few dots if you look here at the dots  compare node b in 
  the upper left to node d in the far right b has four friends coming out from him and d has six friends coming out from him and so  those two individuals have different
  of friends that 's very obvious we all know that 
 but certain other aspects of social network structure are not so obvious  compare node b in the upper left to node a in the lower left now those people both have four friends  but 
 a 's friends all know each other and b 's friends do not so the friend of a friend of a 's is back again a friend of a
  whereas the friend of a friend of b 's is not a friend of b 's but is farther away in the network  this is known as transitivity in networks 
 and finally compare nodes c and d c and d both have six friends 
 if you talk to them and you said what is your social life like they would say i 've got six friends that 's my social experience but now we with a bird 's eye view looking at this network can see that they occupy very different
  and i can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network would you rather be c or d you 'd rather be d on 
  the edge of the network  and now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip not about you was spreading through the network 
  percent of the variation in how many friends you have is explained by your genes  
 and this is not surprising we know that some people are born shy and some are born gregarious that 's obvious  
 but we also found some non obvious things for instance forty seven percent in the variation in whether your friends know each other is attributable to your genes 
 whether your friends know each other has not just to do with their genes but with yours  and we
  think the reason for this is that some people like to introduce their friends to each other you know who you are and others of you keep them apart and don 't introduce your friends to each other  
 and so some people knit together the networks around them  creating a kind of dense web of ties in which they 're comfortably embedded  
 and finally we even found that thirty percent of the variation in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network can also be attributed to their genes  so whether you find
  in the middle or on the edge is also partially heritable  now  what is the point of this  how does this help us understand  
 how does this help us
 figure out some of the problems that are affecting us these days  well the argument i 'd like to make is that networks have value they are a kind of social
  new properties emerge because of our embeddedness in social networks and these properties
 inhere in the structure of the networks not just in the individuals within them  so think about these two common objects they 're both made of carbon  
 and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way on the left and you get graphite which is soft and dark
  but if you take the same carbon atoms and interconnect them a different way you get diamond which is clear and hard  and those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness
  do not reside in the carbon atoms they reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms or at least arise because of the interconnections between the carbon atoms 
  greater than the sum of its parts  
 and so it is not just what 's happening to these people whether they 're losing weight or gaining weight or becoming rich or becoming poor or becoming happy or not becoming happy that affects us it 's also the actual architecture of the ties around us 
 our experience of the world depends on the actual structure of the networks in which we 're residing and on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow through the network
 now  
 the reason i think that this is the case is that human beings assemble themselves and form a kind of superorganism 
 now a superorganism is a collection of individuals
 which show or evince behaviors or phenomena that are not reducible to the study of individuals and that must be understood by reference to and by studying the collective 
  example
  a hive of bees that 's finding a new nesting site or a flock of birds that 's evading a predator or a flock of birds that 's able to pool its wisdom and navigate and find a tiny speck of an island in the middle of the pacific 
 or
 a pack of wolves that 's able to bring down larger prey  superorganisms have properties that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals i think
  understanding social networks and how they form and operate
 can help us understand not just health and emotions but all kinds of other phenomena like crime and warfare and economic phenomena like bank runs and market 
  crashes and the adoption of innovation and the spread of product adoption  
  i think we form social networks because the benefits of a connected life outweigh the costs 
 if i was always violent towards you or gave you misinformation or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs  you would cut the ties to me and the network would disintegrate  
 so the spread of good and valuable things is required to sustain and nourish social networks 
  social networks are required for the spread of good and valuable things like love and kindness and happiness and altruism and ideas  
 i think in fact that if we realized how valuable social networks are we 'd spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them  
 because i think social networks are fundamentally related to goodness and what i think the world needs now is more connections
