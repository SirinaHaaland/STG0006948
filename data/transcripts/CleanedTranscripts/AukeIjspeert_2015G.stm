  is a robot that we designed to closely mimic a salamander species called
  can walk as you can see here  and as you 'll see later it can also swim
  so you might ask why did we design this robot and in fact this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience  
 indeed we designed it together with neurobiologists to understand how animals move  and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion but
 the more i work in biorobotics the more i 'm really impressed by animal locomotion  
 if you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat running or jumping around or even us as humans  when you go jogging or play tennis we do amazing things
 and in fact our nervous system solves a very very complex control problem  
 it has to coordinate more or less two hundred muscles perfectly  because if the coordination is bad we fall over or we do bad locomotion 
 and my goal is to understand how this works 
 there are four main components behind animal locomotion  the first component is just the body  and in fact we should never underestimate to what extent the biomechanics
  already simplify locomotion in animals 
 then you have the spinal cord and in the spinal cord you find reflexes multiple reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop between neural activity in the spinal cord and mechanical activity 
 a third component are central pattern generators 
 these are very interesting circuits in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals that can generate by themselves very coordinated rhythmic patterns of activity
 while receiving only very simple input signals  and these input signals coming from descending modulation from higher parts of the brain like the motor cortex the cerebellum the basal ganglia will all modulate activity of the spinal cord while we do locomotion  
 but what 's interesting is to what extent just a low level component the spinal cord together with the body already solve a big part of the locomotion
  you probably know it by the fact that you can cut the head off a chicken it can still run for a while showing that just the lower part spinal cord and body already solve a big part of locomotion  
 now  understanding how this works is very complex because first of all recording activity in the spinal cord is very difficult it 's much easier to implant electrodes in the motor cortex than in the spinal cord because it 's protected by the vertebrae  especially in humans very hard to do 
 a second difficulty is that locomotion is really due to a very complex and very dynamic interaction between
  these four components  so it 's very hard to find out what 's the role of each over time 
 this is where biorobots like pleurobot and mathematical models can really help  
  is a very active field of research in robotics where people want to take inspiration from animals to make robots to go outdoors like service robots or search and rescue robots or field robots
 and the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals to make robots that can handle complex terrain stairs mountains forests  places where robots still have difficulties and where animals can do a much better job 
 the robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well there are some very nice projects where robots are used like a scientific tool for neuroscience for biomechanics or for
  do in my lab is to collaborate with neurobiologists like jean marie cabelguen a neurobiologist in bordeaux in france  and we want to make spinal cord models and validate them on robots 
 and here we want to start simple so it 's good to start with simple animals like lampreys which are very primitive fish  and then gradually go toward more complex locomotion  like in salamanders but also in cats and in humans in mammals  
 and here a robot becomes an interesting tool
 to validate our models 
 and in fact for me pleurobot is a kind of dream becoming true  like more or less twenty years ago i was already working on a computer making simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion during my phd 
 but i always knew that my simulations were just approximations  like simulating the physics in water or with mud or with complex
  very hard to simulate that properly on a computer why not have a real robot and real physics 
 so among all these animals one of my favorites is the salamander you might ask why  and it
 's because as an amphibian it 's a really key animal from an evolutionary point of view it makes a wonderful link between swimming as you find it in eels or fish 
 and quadruped locomotion as you see in mammals in cats and humans  
 and in fact the modern salamander is is very close to the first terrestrial vertebrate so it 's almost a living fossil which gives us
  us access to our ancestor the ancestor to all terrestrial
 tetrapods so the salamander swims by doing what 's called an anguilliform swimming gait so they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail 
 and if you place the salamander on the ground  it switches to what 's called a walking trot gait in this case you have nice periodic activation of the limbs
 which are very nicely coordinated with this standing wave undulation of the body
 that 's exactly the gait that you are seeing here on pleurobot now
 one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body  
 so if you take a decerebrated salamander it 's not so nice but you remove the head and if you electrically stimulate the spinal cord  
 at low level of stimulation this will induce a walking like gait  if you stimulate a bit more the gait accelerates and at some point
  automatically the animal switches to swimming 
 this is amazing 
 just changing the global drive as if you are pressing the gas pedal of descending modulation to your spinal cord makes a complete switch between two very different gaits 
 and in fact the same has been observed in cats if you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat you can switch between walk trot and gallop 
 or in birds  you can make a bird switch between walking at a low level of
 and flapping its wings at high level stimulation  
 and this really shows that the spinal cord is is a very sophisticated locomotion controller  
 so we studied salamander locomotion in more detail  and we had in fact access to a very nice x ray video machine from professor martin fischer in jena university in germany 
 and thanks to that you really have an amazing machine to record all
  the bone motion in great detail that 's what we did  so we basically figured out which bones are important for us and
 collected their motion in 3d 
 and what we did is collect a whole database of motions both on ground and in water to really collect a whole database of motor behaviors that a real animal can do and then our job as roboticists was to replicate 
  that in our robot so we did a whole optimization process to find out the right structure where to place the motors how to connect them together to be able to replay these motions as well as possible
 and this is how pleurobot came to life  so let 's look at how close it is to the real animal  
 so what you see here is almost a direct comparison between the walking of the real animal and the pleurobot you can see that we have almost a one to one exact replay of the walking gait  if you 
  go backwards and slowly you see it even better  
 but even better  we can do swimming
  so for that we have a dry suit that we put all over the robot 
 and then we can go in water and start replaying the swimming gaits and here we were very happy because this is difficult to do
 the physics of interaction are complex our robot is much bigger than a small animal  so we had to do what 's called dynamic scaling of the frequencies to make sure we had the same interaction physics
  but you see at the end we have a very close match  and we were very very happy with this so let 's go to the spinal cord so here what we did 
 is model the spinal cord circuits  
 and what 's interesting is that the salamander has kept a very primitive circuit which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey this primitive eel like fish  
 and it looks like during evolution  new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs to do the leg locomotion  and we know where these neural oscillators are but what
  did was to make a mathematical model to see how they should be coupled to allow this transition between the two very different gaits 
 and we tested that on board of a robot 
 and this is how it looks
  so what you see here
  is a previous version of pleurobot that 's completely controlled by our spinal cord model programmed on board of the robot and
 the only thing we do is send to the robot through a remote control the two descending signals it normally should receive from the upper part of the brain
 and what 's interesting is by playing with these signals we can completely control speed  heading and type of gait 
 for instance  when we stimulate at a low level we have the
  and at some point if we stimulate a lot very rapidly it switches to the swimming gait  
 and finally we can also do turning very nicely by just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other 
 and i think it 's really beautiful how nature has distributed control to really give a lot of responsibility to the spinal cord so that the upper part of the brain doesn 't need to worry about every muscle  
 it just has to worry about this high level
  's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles 
 so now let 's go to cat locomotion and the importance of biomechanics  
 so this is another project where we studied cat biomechanics and we wanted to see how much the morphology helps locomotion  and we found three important criteria in the properties basically of the limbs  
 the first one is that a cat limb more or less looks
  is a mechanical structure which keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel so a
 simple geometrical system that kind of coordinates a bit the internal movement of the segments 
 a second property of cat limbs is that they are very lightweight  most of the muscles are in the trunk  which is a good idea because then the limbs have low inertia and can be moved very rapidly the
 last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb so to handle impacts and forces  and this
 so let 's invite  cheetah cub onstage  
 so this is peter eckert who does his phd on on this robot and as you see it 's a cute little robot it looks a bit like a toy but it was really used as a scientific tool to investigate these properties of
  the legs of the cat  so you see it 's very compliant very lightweight  
 and also very elastic so you can easily press it down and it will not break it
 will just jump in fact  and this very elastic property is also very important 
 and you also see a bit these properties of these three segments of the leg as pantograph now
 what 's interesting is that this quite dynamic gait is obtained purely in open loop  meaning no sensors
  no complex feedback loops 
 and that 's interesting 
 because it means that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait  
 and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion  
 to the extent that we can even disturb a bit locomotion  as you will see in the next video where we can for instance do some exercise where we have the robot go down a step 
 and the robot will not fall over  which was a surprise for us
  this is a small perturbation i was expecting the robot to immediately fall over because there are no sensors no fast feedback loop  but no just the mechanics stabilized the gait  and the robot doesn 't fall over  
 obviously if you make the step bigger and if you have obstacles  you need the full control loops and reflexes and everything 
 but what 's important here is that just for small perturbation the mechanics are right and i think this is a very important message from biomechanics and robotics to neuroscience saying
 don 't underestimate to what extent the body already helps locomotion
 now how does this relate to human locomotion  clearly human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion  
 but at the same time  the nervous system of humans is very similar to that of other vertebrates  and especially the spinal cord is also the key controller for locomotion in humans 
 that 's why if there 's a lesion of the spinal cord this has dramatic effects  the person can become paraplegic or
 this is because the brain loses this communication with the spinal cord especially it loses this descending modulation to initiate and modulate locomotion  
 so a big goal of neuroprosthetics is to be able to reactivate that communication
 using electrical or chemical stimulations and there are several teams in the world that do exactly that especially at
 but to do this properly it 's very important to understand
 how the spinal cord works how it interacts with the body  and how the brain communicates with the spinal cord
 this is where the robots and models that i 've presented today will hopefully play a key role towards these very important goals  thank you
  seen in your lab other robots that do things like
 swim in pollution and measure the pollution while they swim  but for this one you mentioned in your talk like a side project 
 search and rescue  and it does have a camera on its nose
  we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection so this robot is now seeing you 
 and the big dream is to if you have a difficult situation like a collapsed building or a building that is flooded  
 and this is very dangerous for a rescue team or even rescue dogs why not send in a robot that can crawl around swim walk with a camera onboard to do inspection and identify survivors and possibly create a communication link with the survivor
 don 't get scared by the shape of this
 ai yeah we should probably change the appearance quite a bit because here i guess a survivor might die of a heart attack just of being worried that this would feed on you but by changing the appearance and it making it more robust i 'm sure we can make a good tool out
