  things happen at intersections 
 in fact i would argue that some of the most interesting things of the human experience occur at the intersections in the liminal space
  some of the great intersections of the world come to mind 
 like the arc de triomphe in paris or times square in new york city both bustling with the excitement of a seemingly endless stream of people
  other intersections  like the edmund pettus bridge in selma alabama or canfield drive and copper creek court in ferguson missouri  also come to mind
 because of the tremendous energy at the intersection of human beings
 ideologies and the ongoing struggle for justice  
 beyond the physical landscape of our planet some of the most famous celestial images are of
  intersections  stars are born at the messy intersection of gas and dust instigated by gravity 's irrevocable pull  
 stars die by this same intersection this time flung outward in a violent collision of smaller atoms intersecting and efficiently fusing into altogether new and heavier things 
 we can all think of intersections
  that have special meaning to us to be 
 is to occupy a position
 at an intersection 
 i 've lived the entirety of my life in the in between 
 in the liminal space between dreams and reality  race and gender
  and plenty science and society 
 i am both black and a woman 
 like the birth of stars in the heavenlies this robust combination of knowing results in a shining example of the explosive fusion of identities  
 i am also an astrophysicist i study  blazars supermassive
  hyperactive black holes that sit at the centers of massive galaxies and shoot out jets nearby those black holes at speeds approaching the speed of light
 in a process we are still trying to completely understand 
 i have dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist since i was twelve years old  
 i had no idea that at that time  according to dr jamie alexander 's archive of
  black women in the united states had ever earned a phd in a physics related discipline and that the first black woman to graduate with a phd in 
  field did so just one year before my birth 
 as i journeyed along my path  i encountered the best and worst of life at an intersection the tremendous opportunity to
 of expectation and experience 
 the exhilaration of victorious breakthroughs and sometimes the explosive pain of regeneration  
 i began my college experience just after my family had fallen apart 
 our financial situation disintegrated just after my father 's departure from our lives this thrust my mother my
  sister and i out of the relative comfort of middle class life
 and into the almost constant struggle to make ends meet  
 thus  i was one of roughly sixty percent of women of color who find finances to be a major barrier to their educational goals  
 thankfully  norfolk state university provided me with full funding and i was able to achieve my bachelor 's in physics
  after graduation and despite knowing that i wanted a phd in astrophysics i fell through the cracks 
 it was a poster that saved my dream  and some really incredible people and programs  
 the american physical society had this beautiful poster encouraging students of color to become physicists  
 it was striking to me because it featured a young black girl
  probably around twelve years old looking studiously at some physics equations  
 i remember thinking
 i was looking directly back at the little girl who first dared to dream this dream  
 i immediately wrote to the society and requested my personal copy of the poster  
 which to this day still hangs in my office i described to them in the email my
  educational path and my desire to find myself again in pursuit of the phd 
 they directed me to the  fisk vanderbilt university bridge program itself an intersection of the master 's and phd degrees at two institutions 
 after two years out of school they accepted me into the program and i found myself again on the path to the phd
  receiving my master 's at fisk  i went on to yale to complete my phd  
 once i was physically occupying the space that would ultimately give way to my childhood aspirations i anticipated a smooth glide to the phd 
 it became immediately apparent that not everyone was thrilled to have that degree of liminality in their space i was
  ostracized by many of my classmates 
 one of whom went so far as to invite me to 
 do what i really came here to do as he pushed all the dirty dishes from our meal in front of me to clean up  
 i wish that were an isolated occurrence  but for many women of color in science  
  and mathematics or stem  this is something they have long endured 
 one hundred percent of the sixty women of color interviewed in a recent study by joan c williams at uc hastings reported facing racialized
  gender bias  including being mistaken for the janitorial staff 
  women in total  
 while there is nothing inherently wrong with a janitorial position 
 and in fact my forefathers and foremothers were able to attend college because many of their parents worked these jobs 
 it was a clear attempt to put me in my place  
 while there was certainly the acute pain of the
  the real issue is that my appearance can tell anyone anything about my ability 
 beyond that though it underscores that the women of color in stem do not experience the same set of barriers that just women or just people of color face 
 that 's why today i want to highlight women of color in stem who are
  as the inseparable sum of identities 
 stem itself is an  intersectional term  
 such that its true richness cannot be appreciated without considering the liminal space between disciplines 
 science  the pursuit of understanding the physical world by way of chemistry physics biology 
 cannot be accomplished in the absence of mathematics  engineering requires the application of
  basic science and math to the lived experience  
 technology sits firmly on the foundation of math engineering and science 
 math itself serves the critical role of rosetta stone decoding and encoding the physical principles of the world 
 stem is utterly
  this is to say nothing of the enrichment that is realized when stem is combined with other disciplines  
 the purpose for this talk is twofold 
 first to say directly to every black latina  indigenous first nation or any other woman or girl who finds herself resting at the blessed intersection of race and gender 
 that you can be anything you want to be
  my personal hope is that you 'll become an astrophysicist  but beyond that anything you want do not think
 for one minute that because you are who you are you cannot be who you imagine yourself to be 
 hold fast to those dreams and let them carry you into a world you can 't even imagine 
 secondly among the most pressing
  issues of our time most now find their intersection with stem 
 we have as a global society solved most of the single faceted issues of our time  
 those that remain require a thorough investigation of the liminal space between disciplines to create the multifaceted solutions of tomorrow 
 who better to solve these
  those who have faced their whole lives at the intersections 
 we as thought leaders and decision makers must push past the first steps of diversity and into the richer and more robust territory of full inclusion and equal opportunity 
 one of my favorite examples of liminal excellence comes from the late  dr claudia alexander a black woman plasma
  physicist who passed away this past july after a 10 year bout with breast cancer 
 she was a nasa project scientist who spearheaded the nasa side of the rosetta mission  which became famous this year for landing a rover on a comet 
 and the one point five billion dollar galileo mission to jupiter
 and the world
 dr alexander said it this way 
 i 'm used to walking between two cultures 
 for me it 's among the purposes of my life to take us from states of ignorance to states of understanding with bold exploration that you can 't do every day 
 this shows exactly
  she had the technical ability to spearhead some of the most ambitious space missions of our time  
 and she perfectly understood her place of being exactly who she was in any place she was 
 jessica matthews inventor of the soccket line of sports products like soccer balls that generate renewable energy as you play with them said it this way 
 a major part of invention isn 't just creating things
 people and understanding the systems that make this world 
 the reason i tell my story and the story of dr alexander and jessica matthews is because they are fundamentally  intersectional stories 
 the stories of lives lived at the nexus of race gender and innovation 
 despite implicit and explicit questions of my right to be
  in an elite space  i 'm proud to report that when i graduated i was the first black woman to earn a phd in astrophysics in yale 's then 
 i am now part of a small but growing
 cadre of women of color in stem who are poised to bring new perspectives and new
  ideas to life on the most pressing issues of our time 
 things like educational inequities  police brutality  
 hiv  aids  climate change  genetic editing  artificial intelligence and mars exploration  
 this is to say nothing of the things we haven 't even thought of yet 
 women of color in stem occupy some of the toughest and most exciting
  sociotechnological issues of our time  
 thus  we are uniquely positioned to contribute to and drive these conversations in ways that are more inclusive of a wider variety of lived experience 
 this outlook can be expanded to the many intersectional people whose experiences  positive and
  this is not a request born out of a desire to fit in 
 it 's a reminder that we cannot get to the best possible outcomes for the totality of humanity
 without precisely this collaboration  this bringing together of the liminal the differently lived
  simply put we cannot be the most excellent expression of our collective genius without the full measure of humanity brought to bear  thank you
