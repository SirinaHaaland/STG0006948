  for years i 've been feeling frustrated because as a religious historian i 've become acutely aware
 of the centrality of compassion in all the
  major world faiths every single one of them has evolved their own version of what 's been called the golden rule 
 sometimes it comes in a positive version always treat all others as you 'd like to be treated yourself and equally important
 is the negative version don 't do to others what you would not like them to do to you 
 look into your own heart  discover what it is that gives you
  pain
 and then refuse under any circumstance whatsoever to inflict that pain on anybody else and
 people have
 emphasized the importance of compassion not just because it sounds good but because it works 
 people have found that when they have
 implemented the golden rule as confucius
  said all day and every day 
 not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then returning to a life of greed and egotism
  but to do it all day and every day you dethrone yourself from the center of your world put another there and you transcend yourself
 and it brings you into the presence of what 's been called god
  nirvana rama  tao  something that goes beyond
 what we know in our ego bound existence  
 but you know you 'd never know it a lot of the time that this was so central to the religious life because with a few wonderful exceptions very often when religious 
  people come together religious leaders come together they 're arguing about abstruse doctrines
 or uttering a council of hatred
 or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort 
 often people don 't really want to be compassionate 
 i sometimes see when i 'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead
  and that of course defeats the object of the exercise now why was i so grateful to ted 
 because they took me very gently
 from my  book lined study
 and brought me into the 21st century enabling me to speak to a much much wider audience than i could have ever conceived because i feel
  an urgency about this if we don 't manage to implement the golden rule
 globally 
 so that we treat all peoples  wherever and whoever they may be as though they were as important as ourselves  
 i doubt that we 'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation the task of our time one of the great tasks
  of our time is to build a global society as i said where people can live together in peace and the religions
 that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem  and of course
 it 's not just religious people who believe in the golden
  this is the source of all morality this imaginative act of empathy putting yourself in the place of another  
 and so we have a choice it seems to me we can either go on
 bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith or we can
 go back to the rabbis  rabbi hillel
  older contemporary of jesus who when asked by a pagan
 to
 sum up the whole of jewish teaching while he stood on one leg said that which is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor 
 that is the torah and everything else is only commentary 
 and the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture
  that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate and we need to revive that spirit  and it 's not just going to happen
 because a spirit of love wafts us down we have to make this happen  and we can do it
 with the modern communications that ted has introduced
  i 've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners in singapore 
 we have a group going to use the charter to heal divisions recently
 that have sprung up in singaporean society  and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically  in
  there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to to be taking
 people  young people and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art
 throughout europe the muslim communities are holding events and discussions are
 discussing the centrality of compassion in islam and in all faiths  
 but it can 't stop there it can 't stop with the launch
  launch religious teaching this is where we 've gone so wrong concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines 
 religious teaching must always lead to action  
 and
 i intend to work on this till my dying day and
 i want to continue with our
  we 've so
 dropped out of compassion people often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody  but of course you don 't understand compassion
 if you 're just going to think about it you also have to do it i want them to get the media involved because the media are
  crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people which are dividing us from one another 
 the same applies
 to educators i 'd like youth to get
 a sense of the dynamism the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate
  and also see that it demands acute intelligence not just a gooey feeling i 'd like to call upon scholars to explore
 the compassionate
 theme in their own and in other people 's traditions and perhaps above all to encourage a sensitivity
 about uncompassionate speaking so that because people have this charter
 lack of them they feel empowered to challenge
 uncompassionate speech  disdainful remarks from their religious leaders their political leaders from the captains of industry
 because we can change the world we have the ability
  i would never have thought of putting the charter online i was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of
  boffins sitting together in a room
 and issuing yet another arcane statement 
 and ted introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas because that is what is so wonderful about ted in this room 
 all this expertise
  if we joined it all together we could change the world  and of course the problems
  sometimes seem insuperable but i 'd just like to quote  finish at the end with a reference to
 a british author an oxford author whom i don 't quote very often c s lewis
 but he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since i read it when i was a schoolgirl it 's in his book the four loves
  distinguished between erotic love when two people gaze spellbound into each other 's eyes
 and then he compared that to friendship 
 when two people stand side by side as it were shoulder to shoulder with their eyes fixed on a common goal
  side by side
