  caught me when i was between seven and ten years old  and i realized how
  that i knew were able to withstand the
 tragedies that the war visited on them how few of them could
 even resemble a normal  contented satisfied happy life once their
  security was destroyed by the war so i became interested in understanding what
 contributed to a life that
 was worth living  and i tried as a child as a teenager to read philosophy and to
 get involved in art and
  and many other
 ways that i could see as a possible answer to that question  and finally i ended up
 encountering psychology by chance i was at a
 ski resort in switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself because
  i didn 't have money to go to a movie but i found that
 on the i read in the newspapers that there was to be a
 presentation
 by someone in in a place that i 'd seen in the center of zurich  and it was
 about
  he was going to talk and i thought well since i can 't go to the movies at least i will go
 for free to listen to flying saucers  and the man who talked
 at that
 evening lecture
 was very interesting instead of talking about little green men he talked about how
  the psyche of the europeans had been traumatized by the war and now they 're projecting
 flying saucers into the sky he talked about how the mandalas of
 ancient hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky
 as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the
  this seemed very interesting to me and i started reading his books after that lecture and that was carl jung whose
 name or work i had no idea about then i came to this country to study psychology and
 i started trying to understand the roots of happiness
  this is a typical result that many people have presented and there are many variations on it but
 this for instance shows that about thirty percent of the people surveyed in the united states since 
 say that
 their life is very happy  and that hasn 't changed at all whereas the personal income on
 a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation
 has more than doubled  almost tripled in that period  
 but you find essentially the same results namely that after a certain basic point which corresponds more or less to just a few 
 one thousand dollars above the minimum poverty level increases in material
  don 't seem to affect how happy people are in fact you can find that
 the lack of basic resources material resources  contributes to unhappiness but
 the increase in material resources does not increase happiness  so my research has been focused more
 on after
 finding out these things
  that actually
 corresponded to my own experience i tried to understand  where in everyday life in our
 normal experience do we
 do we feel really happy and to start
 those studies about forty years
 i began to look at creative people first artists and scientists and so forth trying to understand
 what made them feel that it was worth
 essentially spending their life
 doing things for which many of them didn 't expect either fame or fortune but which made their life meaningful and worth
 doing
 this was one of the leading composers of american music back in the ' 70s and the interview was forty pages long  but 
 this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying
  ecstatic state now ecstasy in greek meant simply to stand to the side of something  and then it became
 essentially
 an analogy for a
 mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines  
 so ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative
 reality
 and it 's interesting if you think about it how 
 when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement whether it
 's china greece the hindu civilization or the mayas or
 egyptians
 what we know about them is really about their ecstasies not about their everyday life we know the temples they built where people could come to experience a different reality 
 we know about the circuses the arenas the theaters 
 these are the
 remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to
 experience life in a more concentrated more
 ordered
 form  
 now  this man doesn 't need to go to a place like this which is also this place 
 this arena  which is built like a greek amphitheatre 
 is a place for ecstasy also we are participating in a reality that is different from that of the everyday life that we 're used to but this man doesn
  need to go there he needs just a piece of paper
 where he can put down little marks  and as he does that he can imagine
 sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination so
 once he gets to that point of beginning to create like jennifer did in her
  improvisation a new reality that is a
 moment of ecstasy he enters that different reality  
 now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn 't exist  
 and that sounds like
 a kind of a
  our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about one hundred and ten bits of information per second  and
 in order to hear me and understand what i 'm saying you need to process about sixty bits per second 
 that 's why you can 't hear more than two people you can 't understand more than two people talking to you
  when you are really involved in this
 completely
 engaging process of creating something new as this man is he doesn 't have enough
 attention left over to monitor
 how his body feels or his problems at home  he can
 feel even that he 's hungry or tired
 his body disappears his identity
 disappears from his consciousness because he doesn 't have enough attention like none of us do 
 to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration 
 and at the same time to feel that he exists so existence is temporarily
  he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself now 
 i could look at my hand for two weeks  and i wouldn 't feel any awe or wonder because i can 't compose
 process that he 's describing can only happen to someone who is
 very well trained and who has developed technique and it has become a kind of a
 truism in the study of creativity that you can 't be creating anything with less than ten years of
  in a particular field whether it 's mathematics or music it takes that long to be able to
 to
 begin to change something in a way that it 's better than what was there before
  now  when that happens he says
 the music just flows out and because all of these people i started interviewing
  this was an interview which is over thirty years old
 so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that i called this
 type of experience the flow experience and it happens in different realms for instance a poet describes it
 in this form this is by a student of mine who interviewed
  some of the leading
 writers and poets in the united states and it describes the same effortless  spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into 
  this ecstatic state this poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky a very similar description to what albert einstein gave as to how he imagined
  relativity when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked  
 but it happens in other activities for instance this is another student of mine 
 susan jackson from australia who did
 work with some of the leading athletes in the world  and you see here in this description of an olympic skater the same
  essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person you don 't think it goes automatically if you merge yourself with the music and so forth 
 it happens also actually in the most recent book i wrote called good business where i interviewed some of the ceos
 who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical very
 socially responsible you see that these people define success as something that helps others
 and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it and like all of these successful and
 responsible ceos say
  you can 't have just one of these things be successful
 if you want a meaningful and successful job  anita roddick is another one of these ceos
 we interviewed she is the founder of body shop the natural cosmetics king 
 it 's kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you 're working 
 this is an interesting little
  from masaru ibuka who was at that time starting out sony without any money without a product they didn 't have a product they didn 't have anything but they had an idea 
 and the idea he had was to establish a place of work
 where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart 's
  content i couldn 't improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace  
 now when we do studies we have 
 with other colleagues around the world  done over eight thousand interviews of people from dominican monks to
  navajo shepherds who enjoy their work 
 and regardless of the culture regardless of education or whatever  there are these seven
 conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow there 's this focus that once it becomes
  a sense of ecstasy a sense of clarity  
 you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other you get immediate feedback  you know that what you need to do is possible to do even though difficult 
 and sense of time disappears you forget yourself you feel part of something larger  
 and once the conditions are present what you are doing becomes
 worth doing for its own sake in our studies
  we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme  
 and we can measure this very precisely actually because we give people electronic pagers
 that go off ten times a day and whenever they go off you say what you 're doing how you feel 
 where you are what you 're thinking about and two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that
  moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment so for each person we can establish an
 average which is the center of the diagram 
 that would be your mean level of challenge and skill which will be different from that of anybody else but you have a kind of a set point there 
  in the middle 
 if we know what that set point is we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are
 higher than average and you may be doing things very differently from other people  but for everyone
 that flow channel that area there will be when you are doing what you really like to do
  be with your best friend 
 perhaps work if work is what provides flow for you 
 and then the other areas become less and less positive arousal is still good because you are
 your skills are not quite as high as they should be but you can move into flow fairly easily by
 just developing a little more skill  so arousal is the area where
  most people learn from because that 's where they 're pushed beyond
 their comfort zone and to enter that going back to flow then they develop higher skills 
 control is also a good place to be because
 there you feel comfortable  but not very
  it 's not very challenging any more 
 and if you want to enter flow from control you have to increase the challenges 
 so those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into 
 the other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal  relaxation is fine you still feel ok  
 feel that you 're doing anything you don 't
 use your skills there 's no challenge unfortunately a lot of
 people 's experience is in apathy the largest single
 contributor contributor to that experience is watching television the next one is
  being in the bathroom sitting
 even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow 
 but that 's when you choose a program you really want to watch
 and you get
 feedback from it so the question we
  address and i 'm way over time is how to put more and more of
 everyday life in that flow channel  and that is the kind of challenge that we 're trying to
 understand and some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any
 advice but unfortunately a lot of people don 't  and that 's what our
 mandate is in a way to do
