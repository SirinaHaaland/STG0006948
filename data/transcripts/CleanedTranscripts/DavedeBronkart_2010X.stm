  it 's an amazing thing that we 're here to talk about the year of patients rising 
 you heard stories earlier today about patients who are taking control of their cases 
 patients who are saying you know what i know what the odds are  but i 'm going to look for more information i 'm going to define
  define what the terms of my success are 
 i 'm going to be sharing with you how four years ago i almost died found out i was in fact  already almost dead and what i then found out about what 's called the 
  explain what that term means i had been blogging under the name patient dave and when i discovered this i just renamed
  when i first started a few years ago getting involved in health care and attending meetings as just a casual observer i noticed that people would talk about patients as if it was somebody who 's not in 
  the room here somebody out there some of our talks today we still act like that but i 'm here to tell you 
  you yourself will find yourself in a hospital bed or your mother your child there are heads nodding people who say yes i know exactly what you mean 
 so when you hear what i 'm going to talk about here today first of all i want to say that i am here on behalf of all the patients that i have ever met all the ones i haven 't met  
 this is about letting patients play a more active role in helping health care in fixing health care 
 one of the senior doctors at my hospital charlie safran and
  his colleague warner slack have been saying for decades that the most underutilized resource in all of health care is the patient  they have been saying that since the 
  going to step back in history  this is from july one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine i was a freshman in college  and this was when we first landed on the moon  
 and it was the first time we had ever seen from another surface that 's the place where
  you and i are right now where we live the world was changing it was about to change in ways that nobody could foresee 
 a few weeks later woodstock happened  
 three days of fun and music here just for historical authenticity is a picture of me in that year 
  the wavy hair  the blue eyes it was really something that fall of one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine the whole earth catalog came out it was a hippie journal of 
 we think of hippies of being just hedonists  but there 's a very strong component i was in that movement a very strong component of being responsible for yourself this book 's title 's subtitle is access to tools 
 it talked about how to build your own house how to grow your own food all kinds of things
  in the 1980s this young doctor tom ferguson was the medical editor of the whole earth catalog  he saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine and health care is taking care of ourselves 
 in fact he said it was seventy to eighty percent of how we actually take care of our bodies  well  
 he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease  the key thing
  that holds us back is access to information  and when the web came along  that changed everything because not only could we find information we could find other people like ourselves 
 who could gather who could bring us information  and he coined this term e patients equipped engaged empowered enabled obviously at this stage of
  life he was in a somewhat more dignified
 form than he was back then now i was an engaged patient long before i ever heard of the term 
 in two thousand and six i went to my doctor for a regular physical and i had said i have a sore shoulder well  i got an x ray and the next morning
 you may have noticed those of you who have been through a medical crisis will understand this this morning some of the speakers named the date
 when they found out about their condition for me it was
  on january three two thousand and seven  i was at the office my desk was clean i had the blue partition carpet on the walls  the phone rang and it was my doctor 
 he said   dave i pulled up the x ray image on the screen on the computer at home he said your shoulder is going to be fine but dave there 's something in your
  if you look in that red oval that shadow was not supposed to be there 
 to make a long story short i said so you need me to get back in there he said yeah we 're going to need to do a ct scan of your chest
  in parting i said is there anything i should do he said
 think about this one this is the advice your doctor gives you just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife 
 i went in for the cat scan it turns out there
  were five of these things in both my lungs  so at that point we knew that it was cancer we knew it wasn 't lung cancer  that meant it was metastasized from somewhere
  the question was where from 
 so i went in for an ultrasound i got to do what many women have the jelly on the belly and the bzzzz 
 my wife came with me she 's a veterinarian so she 's seen
  lots of ultrasounds i mean she knows i 'm not a dog
 this is an mri image this is much sharper than an ultrasound would be what we saw in that kidney
 was that big blob there there were actually two of these one was growing out the front and had already erupted and latched onto the bowel one was growing out the back and it attached to the  psoas muscle which is a big muscle in the back that i
  'd never heard of but all of a sudden i cared about it 
 i went home  now i 've been googling i 've been online since one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine on compuserve  i went home and i know you can 't read the details here that 's not important 
 my point is i went to a respected medical website webmd because i know how to filter out junk i also found
  before i met her  i went through some suboptimal search results 
 so i looked i looked for quality information there 's so much about trust what sources of information can we trust where does my body
 end and an invader start  a cancer a tumor is something you grow out of your own tissue how does that happen where does
  so what i read on webmd 
 the prognosis is poor for progressing renal cell cancer almost all patients are incurable 
 i 've been online long enough to know if i don 't like the first results i get i go look for more 
 and what i found on other websites was even by the third page of google results
  the heck i didn 't feel sick at all i mean  i 'd been getting tired in the evening but i was fifty six years old you know  i was slowly losing weight but for me that was what the doctor told me to do
 it was really something and this is the diagram of stage four kidney cancer from the drug i eventually got totally by
  there 's that thing in my lung 
 in the left femur the left thigh bone there 's another one i had one my leg eventually snapped i fainted and landed on it and it broke there 's one in the skull and then
  for good measure i had these other tumors including by the time my treatment started one was growing out of my tongue  i had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue  and what i read was that my median survival was twenty four weeks 
  mother 's face going to look like on the day of my funeral i had to sit down with my daughter and say 
 here 's the situation her boyfriend was with her i said i don 't want you guys to get married prematurely just so you can do it while dad 's still alive it
 's really serious if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help think about this well my doctor prescribed a
 a network of cancer patients of all amazing things 
 very quickly they told me kidney cancer is an uncommon disease get yourself to a specialist center there is no cure but there 's something that sometimes works it usually doesn 't called high dosage interleukin most hospitals don 't offer it
 so they won 't even tell you it exists
 don 't let them give you anything else first and by the way here are four doctors in your part of the united states who offer it and their phone numbers how amazing is that 
 here 's the thing here we are four years later you can 't find a website that gives patients that information  government approved american cancer society  but patients know what patients want to know  
 it 's the power of patient networks
 this amazing substance again  i mentioned where does my body end my oncologist and i talk a lot these days because i try to keep my talks technically accurate  
 and he said you know the immune system is good at detecting invaders
  bacteria coming from outside but when it 's your own tissue that you 've grown it 's a whole different thing and i went through a mental exercise actually because i
  started a patient support community of my own
 on a website  and one of my friends one of my relatives actually said look dave who grew this thing 
 are you going to set yourself up as mentally attacking yourself so we went into it the story of how all that happened is in the book  
 anyway this is the way the numbers unfolded me being me i put the numbers from my hospital 's website
  my tumor sizes into a spreadsheet don 't worry about the numbers you see that 's the immune system amazing thing those two yellow lines are where i got the two doses of interleukin 
 two months apart  and look at how the tumor sizes plummeted in between just incredible who knows what we 'll be able to do when we learn to make more use of it
  daughter 
 got married and when she came down those steps  
 and it was just her and me for that moment  i was so glad that she didn 't have to say to her mother i wish dad could have been here 
 and this is what we 're doing when we make health care better 
 now i want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients who are doing everything in their power to improve health care  this is regina holliday  a painter
 in washington dc whose husband died of kidney cancer a year after my disease she 's painting here a mural of his horrible final weeks in the hospital one of the things that she discovered
 was that her husband 's medical record in this paper folder
 was just disorganized and she thought you know if i have a nutrition facts label on the side of a cereal box  why can 't there be something that simple
  telling every new nurse who comes on duty every new doctor the basics about my husband 's condition so she painted this medical facts mural
 with a nutrition label something like that in a diagram of him she then last year painted this diagram she studied health care like me she came to realize there were
  that you just don 't hear about at medical conferences patients are such an underutilized resource 
 well as it said in my introduction i 've gotten somewhat known for saying that patients should have access to their data i actually said at one conference a couple of years ago give
 me my damn data because you people can 't be trusted to keep it clean and here she has our damned data it 's a pun
 which is starting to break out starting to break through the water symbolizes
 and in fact i want to do a little something improvisational for you there 's a guy on twitter that i know a health it guy outside boston  and he wrote the e patient rap 
 and it goes like this 
 gimme my damn data
  i wanna be an e patient just like dave gimme my damn data ' cause it 's my life to
  ipads advance far faster than the health tools that are available to you to help take care of your family  here 's a website 
 that i stumbled across and i thought you know i wonder what my psoas muscle is so you can click on things and remove it and i saw aha 
 that 's the kidney and the psoas muscle i was
  and then i realized it reminded me of google earth where you can fly to any address  
 and i thought why not take this and connect it to my digital scan data
 and have google earth for my body 
 what did google come out with this year now there 's google body browser  but you see it 's still generic it 's not my
  but if we can get that data out from behind the dam so software innovators can pounce on it the way software innovators like to do who knows what we 'll be able to come up with 
 one final story this is kelly young a rheumatoid arthritis patient from florida
  this is a live story unfolding just in the last few weeks ra patients as they call themselves her blog
  have a big problem because forty percent of them have no visible symptoms
 and that makes it really hard to tell how the disease is going and some doctors think yeah right you 're really in pain 
 well  she found through her online research a nuclear bone scan that 's usually used for cancer  
 but it can also reveal inflammation  and she saw that
 if there is no
  then the scan is a uniform gray  so she took it and the radiologist 's report
 said no cancer found well that 's not what he was supposed to do with it so
  she wanted to have it read again and her doctor fired her 
 she pulled up the cd he said if you don 't want to follow my instructions go away so she pulled up the cd of the scan images and look at
  she 's now actively engaged on her blog in looking for assistance in getting better care 
 see that is an empowered patient no medical training we are you are the most underused resource in health care what she was able to do was because she had access to the raw data how big a deal was this well at
 tim  berners lee himself inventor
  gave a talk where he said the next big thing is not to have your browser
 find other people 's articles about the data but the raw data and he got them chanting by the end of the talk raw data now  raw data now 
 and i ask you three words  please to improve health care  
  patients around the world watching this on the webcast god bless you everyone let patients help
