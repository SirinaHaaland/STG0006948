  i 've always written primarily about architecture about buildings  and writing about architecture is based on certain assumptions 
 an architect designs a building and it becomes a place or many architects design many buildings and it becomes a
  and regardless of this complicated mix of forces of politics and culture and economics that shapes these places 
 at the end of the day  you can go and you can visit them  you can walk around them you can smell them you can get a feel for them  you can experience
 their sense of place  
 but what was striking to me over the last several years was that less and less was i going out into the world and more and more i was sitting in front of my computer
  and especially since about two thousand and seven 
 when i got an iphone i was not only sitting in front of my screen all day  but i was also getting up at the end of the day and looking at this little screen that i carried in my pocket  
 and what was surprising to me was how quickly
 my relationship to the physical world had changed in this very short period of time you know whether you call it the last fifteen years or so of being online or the last you know four or five years of being online
  all the time 
 our relationship to our surroundings had changed in that our attention is constantly divided you know we 're both looking inside the screens and we 're looking out in the world around us  
 and what was even more striking to me and what i really got hung up on was that the world inside the screen seemed to have no physical reality of its own 
 if you went and looked for images of the internet  this was all that you found  this famous image by opte
 of the internet as the kind of milky way  this infinite expanse where we don 't seem
  to be anywhere on it we can never seem to grasp it in its totality it 's always reminded me of the apollo image
 of the earth the blue marble picture and it 's similarly meant to suggest i think that we can 't really understand it as a whole we 're always sort of small in the face of its expanse 
 so if there was this world and this screen and if there was the physical world around me i couldn 't ever get them together in the same place
 and then this happened 
 my internet broke one day as it occasionally does  
 and the cable guy came to fix it and he started with the dusty clump of cables behind the couch and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard  
 and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall 
 and then he saw a squirrel running along the wire  
  there 's your problem a squirrel
 is chewing on your internet 
 and this seemed astounding the internet is a transcendent idea it 's a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions 
 it was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on 
 but that in fact seemed to be the case a squirrel had in fact chewed on my internet and then i got this image in my head of what would happen
  if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it where would it go 
 was the internet actually a place that you could visit could i go there who would i meet you know was there something actually out there
  and the answer by all accounts was no  this was the internet this black box with a red light on it as represented in the
  it lives on the top of big ben  because that 's where you get the best reception
  but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation  
 the elders of the internet were willing to part with it for a short while 
 and she looks at it and she says this is the internet  the whole internet is it heavy they say 
 of course not the
  and i was embarrassed i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for 
 the internet was that amorphous blob or it was a silly black box with a blinking red light on it it wasn 't a real world out there  
 but in fact it is there is a real world of the internet out there and that 's what i spent about two years visiting these places of the internet  
 i was in large data centers that use as much power as the cities in which they sit
  and i visited places like this sixty hudson street in new york  which is one of the buildings in the world one of a very short list of buildings about a dozen buildings  where more networks of the internet connect to each other
 than anywhere else  and that connection is an unequivocally physical process it 's about the router of one network a facebook or a google or a b t or a comcast or a time warner whatever it is 
 connecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up into the ceiling and down into the router of another network  and that 's unequivocally physical and it 's surprisingly intimate
 a building like sixty hudson and a dozen or so others 
 has ten times more networks connecting within it than the next tier of buildings there 's a very short list of these places  and sixty hudson in particular is interesting
 because it 's home to about a half a dozen very important networks which are the networks which serve the undersea cables that travel underneath the ocean
 that connect europe and america and connect all of us  and it 's those cables in particular that i want to focus on
  if the internet is a global phenomenon if we live in a global village it 's because there are cables underneath the ocean cables like this 
 and in this dimension they are incredibly small you can you hold them in your hand they 're like a garden hose  but in the other dimension
 they are incredibly expansive as expansive as you can imagine they stretch across the ocean they 're three or five or eight thousand miles in length
  and if the material science and the computational technology is incredibly complicated  the basic physical process is shockingly simple light goes in on one end of the ocean
 and comes out on the other  
 and it usually comes from a building called a landing station that 's often tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood
  and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor that look kind of like bluefin tuna  and every fifty miles they amplify
  the signal and since the rate of transmission is incredibly fast the basic unit is a 
  wavelength of light maybe a thousand times your own connection or capable of carrying ten thousand video streams  
 but not only that but you 'll put not just one wavelength of light through one of one of the fibers but you 'll put maybe fifty or sixty or seventy different wavelengths or colors of light through a single fiber  and then you 'll have maybe eight fibers in a
  cable four going in each direction  and they 're tiny they 're the thickness of a hair  
 and then they connect to the continent somewhere they connect in a manhole like this literally this is where the 5 000 mile cable plugs in 
 this is in halifax a cable that stretches from halifax to ireland  
 and the landscape is changing  three years ago when i started
  thinking about this there was one cable down the western coast of africa  
 represented in this map by steve song as that thin black line  now there are six cables and more coming three down each coast 
 because once a country gets plugged in by one cable they realize that it 's not enough if they 're going to build an industry around it they need to know that their connection isn 't tenuous but permanent because if a cable 
  breaks you have to send a ship out into the water throw a grappling hook over the side  pick it up find the other end and then fuse the two ends back together and then
  dump it over it 's an intensely intensely physical process 
 so this is my friend simon cooper  
 who until very recently worked for tata communications the communications wing of tata the big indian industrial conglomerate
  and
 i 've never met him we 've only communicated via this telepresence system  which always makes me think of him as the man inside the internet
  and he is english the undersea cable industry is dominated by englishmen  and they all seem to be forty two 
 because they all they all started at the same time with the with the boom about twenty years ago  
 and tata had gotten its start as a communications business when they when they bought two cables one across the atlantic and one across the pacific
  and proceeded to add pieces onto them  
 until they had built a belt around the world which means they will send your bits to the east or the west they have this is literally a beam of light around the world and if a cable breaks in the pacific it 'll send it around the other direction
  and then having done that they started to look for places
 to wire next they looked for the unwired places and that 's meant north and south primarily these cables to africa  but what amazes me is simon 's incredible geographic imagination he thinks about the world with this incredible
  expansiveness  
 and i was particularly interested because i wanted to see one of these cables being built 
 see you know all the time online we experience these fleeting moments of connection these sort of brief adjacencies  a tweet or a facebook post or an email  
 and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that it seemed like there was a moment when the continent was being plugged in  and i
 i wanted to see that 
 and simon was working on a new cable wacs the west africa cable system that stretched from lisbon down the west coast of africa to cote d 'ivoire to ghana to nigeria to cameroon
  and he said there was coming soon depending on the weather but he 'd let me know when and so with about four days notice 
 he said to go to this beach south of lisbon  and a little after nine this guy will walk out of the water 
 and he 'll be carrying a green nylon line a lightweight line called a messenger
  line  and that was the first link between sea and land this link that would then be leveraged into this 9 000 mile path of light 
 then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this specialized cable landing ship  and it was floated on these buoys until it was in the right place
  then you can see the english engineers looking on  and then once it was in the right place he got back in the water holding a big knife
  and he cut each buoy off and the buoy popped up into the air  and the cable dropped to the sea floor  and he did that all the way out to the ship  and when he got there they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie  
 and then he jumped back in and he swam back to shore and then he lit a cigarette 
 and then once that cable was on shore  they began to prepare to connect it to the other side
  for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station 
 and first they got it with a hacksaw  and then they start sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a sort of working like chefs and then finally they 're working like jewelers to get these hair thin fibers to line up with the cable that had come down 
 and with this hole punch machine they fuse it together 
 and when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw  you stop thinking about the internet as a cloud it starts to
  seem like an incredibly physical thing  
 and what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology as much as this is an incredibly new thing 
 the physical process itself
 has been around for a long time and the culture is the same you see the local laborers you see the english engineer giving directions in the background and more
  the places are the same these cables still connect these classic port cities places like lisbon  mombasa mumbai singapore new york
  and then the process on shore takes around three or four days  and then  when it 's done 
 they put the manhole cover back on top  and they push the sand over that and we all forget about it
