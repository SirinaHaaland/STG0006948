  good morning my name is david rose  i am a serial entrepreneur turned serial investor  and by the use of pitching
 powerpoints to vcs i have personally raised tens of millions of dollars from vcs
  to the other side of the equation i 've personally supervised the investment of tens of millions of dollars into companies who have pitched me with powerpoint presentations  
 so i think it 's safe to say i know a little bit about the process of pitching 
 so the very first question you 've got to figure out is what is the single most important thing that a vc is looking for when you come to them pitching your new business idea
  of all the things that you have to do  what is the single most important thing the vc is going to be investing in 
 somebody what audience people david rose 
 people 
 you that 's it you are the person therefore the entire purpose of a vc pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return 
 now how do you do this  you can 't just walk up and say
 i 'm a really good guy good girl and you should invest in me right 
 so in the course of your vc pitch you have a very few minutes most vc pitches angel pitches are about fifteen minutes  most  should be less than half an hour people 's attention span after eighteen minutes begins to drop off  tests have shown  
 so in that eighteen or ten or five minutes you have to
 convey a whole bunch of different characteristics about ten different characteristics while you 're standing up there  what 's the single most important thing you 've got to convey 
 what audience integrity dr boy oh boy oh boy that 's a straight line look at that
 and i didn 't even prompt him right integrity  the key thing i would much rather invest in take a chance on somebody who i know is straight than where there 's any possible question of who are they looking out for and what 's going on  
 so the most important thing is integrity  what 's the second most important thing
  can get this one audience self confidence 
 close enough passion
  right entrepreneurs by definition are people who are leaving something else starting a new world creating and putting their lifeblood into this thing 
 you 've got to convey passion if you 're not passionate why should anyone else be  or put money into your company if you 're not passionate
  then there 's a whole panoply of other things you 've got to wrap up in this package you 're presenting to a vc 
 experience you 've got to be able to say hey you know  i 've done this before done this before is starting an enterprise creating value and taking something from beginning to end that 's why
  vcs love to fund serial entrepreneurs even if you didn 't do it right the first time you 've learned the lessons  which puts you in good stead
  with the experience of starting an enterprise or running something doesn 't have to be a business it can be an organization in a school a not for profit but experience in creating an organization next knowledge if you tell me you 
  're going to be the developer of the map of the human genome you better know what a human genome is  i want you to have expertise
  that it takes to get a company going those skills include everything from
 technical skills if it 's a technology business to marketing and sales and management and so on but
 you know not everybody has all these skills very few people have the full set of skills it takes to run a company   what else do you require  well leadership you 've got to be able to convince us
  that you either have developed a team that has all those factors in it or else you can  and you
  have the charisma and the management style and the ability to to get people to follow your lead to inspire them to motivate them to be part of your team
 having done all that  
 what else do i want to know as a vc  i want to know that you have commitment that
 you are going to be here to the end  i want you to say or i want you to convey that you are going to die if you have to with your very last breath your fingernails scratching as they draw you
 alive and make more from it i don 't want someone who 'll cut and run at the first opportunity bad things happen there 's never been a
  venture funded company where bad things didn 't happen  so know that you 're committed to the very end  you 've got to have vision to see where this is going i don 't want another me too product i want somebody who can change the world out there  
 but on top of that i need realism
 before you get to change the world bad things are going to take place you have to deal with that  and you have to have rational projections   finally you 're asking for my money not just because it 's my money but because it 's me you need to be coachable  i need to know you have the ability to listen
  we 've had a lot of experience people who are vcs or angels investing in you have had experience  and they 'd like to know that you want to hear that experience 
 so how do you convey these ten things in ten minutes without saying
 them you can 't say i 've got integrity  invest in me  you 've got to do a whole pitch that conveys this without conveying it think about your pitch as a timeline it starts off  you walk in the door they know nothing whatsoever about you you can take them on an emotional
 all pitches all sales presentations are emotional at some level you can go up you can go down right and it goes from beginning
  the first thing you 've got to do  the overall arc of your presentation it 's got to start like a rocket you 've got maybe ten seconds between ten and thirty seconds depending on how long the pitch is to get their attention in
 my case  i 've invested i 've gotten millions of dollars from powerpoint pitches i 've invested millions that should get you right there this can be a fact or something counterintuitive 
  it can be a story or an experience but you 've got to grab their emotional attention focused on you within that first few seconds  
  on a very solid steady  upward path  right from beginning to end  everything has to reinforce this and you 've got to get better and better and better and better revving up to the very end  then
  you 've got to boom  knock them out of the park  you want to get them to such an emotional high they 're ready to write you a check  throw money at you before you leave how do you do that  first
  logical progression any time you go backwards any time you skip a step imagine walking up a staircase where some of the treads are missing or the the heights are different you stop you 
 need to figure out a nice  logical progression start with what the market is why are you going to do x y or z  and then you 've got to tell me how you 're going to do it and what you 're going to do and it 's got to flow from beginning to end  
  of or
 basic items in your business i want to know about things that i can relate to 
 validators or anything that tells me somebody else has approved this or there 's outside validation it can be sales  it can be you got an award for something  it can be people have done it before it can be
 your beta tests are going great whatever i want
  but that somebody or something else out there says this makes sense 
 and then i 'm looking for the upside i need a believable upside that 's two parts it 's got to be upside and believable the upside means if you tell me that five years out you 're making a million dollars a year 
 that 's not really upside telling me you 'll be making a billion dollars a year that 's not believable  so it 's got to be
 both on the other hand are things that take the emotional level down  you have to recover from those for example anything that i know is not true we have no competition
  makes a widget like this odds are i know somebody who 's made a widget and the minute you tell me that  i discount half of what you 're saying from then from then on 
  anything i don 't understand where i have to make the leap myself in my own head will stop the flow of the presentation so you 've got to take me through like a sixth grader dub dub dub but without patronizing me and it 's a very tricky path but if you can do it it works really really well anything that
  inconsistent within 
  your concept if you tell me sales of x y or z are ten million dollars  five slides later  they 're five million dollars one may have been gross sales one may have been net sales  but i want to know that all the numbers make sense together  and then finally  anything
 that 's an error or a typo or a stupid mistake or a line that 's in the wrong place that shows me that if you can 't do a presentation how can you run a company so this this all feeds feeds in together
 the best way to do this is to look at our betters people who have done this before let 's look at the most successful technology executive in the business and see how a presentation goes 
 bill gates 's powerpoint presentation over here  here 's gates doing a thing for for windows is this how to do a powerpoint presentation what do you think no who do you think we should look at as our role model
  this is the zen of presentation 
 right here he is one little guy  black jeans and stuff on a totally empty stage  what are you focusing on you 're focusing on him this is steve jobs so are these wonderful long 
  bullet points whole list of things good no they 're not the long bullet points are bad what 's good 
 bullet points does steve jobs use basically none 
 what do you do best of all images just a simple image i look at the image a picture 's worth a thousand words you look at the image and you 've got the whole thing then you come back to me 
 you 're focused on me why i 'm such a great guy why you want to invest why this all makes sense
  big long titled slides with blah blah i 'm presenting to so and so on x date i know the day i know who i am i don 't need all that  just give me your company logo i look at the logo and it ties it to my brain then i come back to you i 'm focused on you
 you ok you give me your quick
  30 second intro grab my attention  then you give me a quick business overview this is
  and that is like the picture on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box that lets me know the context it gives me the armature for the whole thing you 'll be going going through  it lets me put everything in relation to what you 've told me  
 then you 've got to walk me through show me who your management team is
  what the heck is it if it 's a website  show me a screenshot of your website don 't
 do a live demo never do a live demo do a canned demo or something that lets me know why people are going to buy whatever  whatever it is
 now that i know what you 're selling tell me how you make money on it for every x you sell you get y
  i want to know what the business model is on a per unit basis or for the actual product you 're selling  i want to know who you 're selling to in terms of customers and if you have any special relationships that will help you whether it
 's a distribution relationship or a producing partner  again validation this helps to say you 're bigger than just one little thing over here  
 way of doing something i want to know exactly what your competition is and that will help me judge how you fit into the whole operation 
 i want to know how you 're special i know what your competition does how are you going to prevent them from eating your lunch 
 all this ties into the financial overview and you can 't do a vc pitch without giving me your financials i want to  know a year or two back or as long as you 've been in existence  and i want to know four or five years forward five is a bit much probably four
  and i want to know how that business model  on a product basis will translate into a company model  how many widgets will you sell you make x amount per widget  i want to know what the driver is we 'll have one thousand customers this year and 
  ten thousand the next our revenues will do this and that that gives me the whole picture for the next several years into which i 'm investing and i want to know how the money from me will help you get there you 're going to
  but then comes the ask where you tell me how much you want you 're looking for five million at what valuation two million one hundred thousand
  what 's the money in so far who invested  i hope you invested 
  if you can 't invest in your own thing  why should i so i like to know if you have friends and family or angel investors or more vcs before  what 's the capital structure up until this point 
 finally having done all that you 've now told
  to give me the final boom the final pitch that 's going to send me into space now in the process
  how do you remember
 the sequences and do it you 've noticed i 'm not looking at the screen right 
 the screen   is in front of me so i couldn 't even see if i wanted to so how do i know what 's going on  well i have a laptop in front of me 
 you 're looking at me and at this what am i looking at you think that i 'm looking at that  no  i 'm looking actually at a special version of powerpoint over here  which shows me the slides ahead and behind my notes  so i can see what 's going
  powerpoint has this built into every copy of it that 's shipped if you use apple 's keynote it 's got an even better version 
  there 's another program called ovation
 you can get from adobe that they bought last summer  which helps you run the timers and lets you figure out what 's going on 
 so here 's my wrap up to take you to the moon right i usually do a top ten but we don 't have time so david 's top five presentation tips  number five always use presenter mode or ovation or
  or presenter tools it lets you know exactly where you 're going helps you pace yourself gives you a timer  the whole bit  
 number four  always use remote control have you seen me touch the computer no why not because i 'm using remote control  always use remote control  number three  
 the handouts you give are not your presentation if you follow my suggestions you 'll have a very spare zen like presentation which is great to convey who you  are and get people emotionally involved  but not good as a handout you want a handout that gives more information
  don 't read your speech can you imagine
