  we look around the media as we see on the news from iraq afghanistan sierra leone  and the conflict seems
 incomprehensible to us  and that 's certainly how it seemed to me when i started this project  but as a physicist i thought  well if you give me some
  data i could maybe understand this you know give us a go  so as a naive new zealander i thought well i 'll go to the pentagon 
 can you get me some information 
 so i had to think a little harder  
 and i was watching the news one night in oxford  and i looked down at the chattering heads on my channel of choice  and i saw that there was information there 
  data within the streams of news that we consume all this noise around us actually has information
 so what i started thinking was perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here if we can get enough of these streams of information together  
 we can perhaps start to understand the war
 so this is exactly what i did we started bringing a team together an interdisciplinary team of scientists of economists
 we brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this 
 we did it in three steps the first step we did was to collect  we did one hundred and thirty different sources of information from ngo reports to newspapers and cable news
 we brought this raw data in and we filtered it  we extracted the key bits on information to build the database 
 that database contained the timing of attacks the location the size and the weapons used it 's all
  in the streams of information we consume daily  we just have to know how to pull it out and once we had this we could start doing some cool stuff what if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks  what would that tell us
 so we started doing this and you can see here on the horizontal axis you 've got the number of people killed in an attack or the size of the attack  and on the vertical
  axis you 've got the number of attacks 
 so we plot data for sample on this you see some sort of random distribution perhaps sixty seven attacks one person was killed or forty seven attacks where seven people were killed 
 we did this exact same thing for iraq and we didn 't know for iraq what we were going to find it turns out what we found was pretty surprising 
 you take all of the conflict all of the chaos all of the noise  and out of that
 comes this precise mathematical distribution of the
  way attacks are ordered in this conflict this blew our mind why should a conflict like iraq have this
 as its fundamental signature  why should there be order in war  we didn 't really understand that we thought
 maybe there is something special about iraq so we looked at a few more conflicts  we looked at colombia we looked at afghanistan  and we looked at senegal and the same pattern
 emerged in each conflict this wasn 't supposed to happen these are different wars with different religious factions different political factions  
 and different socioeconomic problems and yet the fundamental patterns underlying them
 are
 the same
 so we went a little wider
  we looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on from peru to indonesia we
  studied this same pattern again  and we found
 that not only were the distributions these straight lines  but the slope of these lines they clustered around this value of alpha equals two point five  
 and we could generate an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack what we 're saying here
 is the probability of an attack killing x number of people in a country like iraq is equal to a constant
  times the size of that attack  raised to the power of negative alpha  and negative alpha is the slope of that line i showed you before
 so what 
 this is data statistics what does it tell us about these conflicts that was a challenge we had to face as physicists how do we explain
  and what we really found was that alpha if we think about it is the organizational structure of the insurgency 
 alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks  which is really the distribution
 of the group strength carrying out the attacks so we look at a process of group dynamics coalescence and fragmentation 
 groups coming together  groups breaking apart  and we start running the numbers on this can we simulate it can we create the kind of patterns that we 're seeing
 in places like iraq
  iraq turns out we kind of do a reasonable job  we can run these simulations we can recreate this using a process of group dynamics
 to explain the patterns that we see all around the conflicts around the world  
 so what 's going on  why should these different seemingly different conflicts have the same patterns now what i believe is going on is
  that
 the insurgent forces they evolve over time they adapt  
 and it turns out there is only one solution to fight a much stronger enemy  and if you don 't find that solution as an insurgent force 
 you don 't exist  so every insurgent force that is ongoing  every conflict that is ongoing it 's going to look something like this  
  we think is happening  
 taking it forward  how do we change it  how do we end a war like iraq what does it look like 
 alpha is the structure it 's got a stable state at two point five this is what wars look like
 when they continue we 've got to change that 
 we can push it up the forces become more fragmented there is more of them  but they are weaker or
 we push it down they 're more robust there is less groups
 but perhaps you can sit and talk to them
  structure of the insurgency
