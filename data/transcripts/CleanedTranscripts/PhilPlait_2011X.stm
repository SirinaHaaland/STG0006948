  i want to talk to you about something kind of
  a chunk of rock six miles across  moving something like fifty times the speed of a rifle bullet  slammed into the earth  
 it released its energy all at once  and it was an explosion that was mind numbing 
 if you took every nuclear weapon ever built at the height of the cold war  lumped them together  and blew them up at the same time  that would be one
 of the energy released at that moment  
 the dinosaurs had a really bad day ok  
 now a six mile wide rock is very large we all live here in boulder  if you look out your window and see longs peak you 're probably familiar with it now  scoop up longs peak and put it out in space  
 take
  lump that in there and put that in space as well  and mt everest and k2 and the indian peaks  then you 're starting to get an idea of how much rock we 're talking 
  about ok  we know it was that big because of the impact it had and the crater it left  
  huge to give you a sense of the scale  there you go  
 the scale here is fifty miles on top a hundred kilometers on the bottom this thing was three hundred kilometers across two hundred miles an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around
 the globe and set fires all over the planet threw up enough dust to block out
  percent of all species on earth  
 now  not all asteroids are that big some of them are smaller 
 here is one that came in over the united states in
 october of one thousand nine hundred and ninety two it came in on a friday night  why is that important because back then video cameras were just starting to become popular and
  parents would bring them to their kids ' football games to film their kids playing football and since this came in on a friday they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over west virginia maryland pennsylvania and new jersey until it did that
 to a car in new york now  this is not a
  crater  but then again you can see the rock which is sitting right
  about the size of a football that hit that car and did that damage  now this thing was probably about the size of a school bus when it first came in it broke up through atmospheric pressure  it 
  crumbled  and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage  now you wouldn 't want that falling on your foot or your head  
  is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock and in fact if any of you have ever been to near winslow arizona there is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic that it is actually called meteor crater 
 to give you a sense of scale  this is about a mile wide if you look up at the top  that 's a parking lot and
  those are recreational vehicles right there  
 so it 's about a mile across six hundred feet deep the object that formed this was probably about thirty to fifty yards across  so roughly the size 
 of macky auditorium here  it came in at speeds that were tremendous slammed into the ground  blew up and exploded with the energy of roughly a 20 megaton nuclear bomb a very hefty
  this was fifty thousand years ago  so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope or something like that out in the desert  
 but it probably would not have caused global devastation 
 it turns out that these things don 't have to hit the ground to do a lot of damage  now in one thousand nine hundred and eight over siberia near the tunguska region
 for those of you who are dan aykroyd fans and saw ghostbusters when he talked about the greatest
  that 's fine i can live with that 
 another rock came into the earth 's atmosphere
 and this one blew up above the ground several miles up above the surface of the earth  
 the heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles
  this did a huge amount of damage  and again this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we 're sitting in in meteor crater it was made of metal and metal is 
  much tougher so it made it to the ground  the one over tunguska was probably made of rock and that 's much more crumbly so it blew up in the air 
  do global ecological damage they 're not going to do something like the dinosaur killer did they 're just not big enough but they will do global economic damage  because 
  they don 't have to hit necessarily to do this kind of damage they don 't have to do
  some of them we depend on more on the global economic basis that could do a huge amount of damage
 to us as a civilization so now that i 've scared the crap out of you 
 what can we do about  this  this is a potential threat  let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur killer for sixty five million years they 're very rare 
  smaller ones happen more often  but probably
 on the order of a millennium every few centuries or every few thousand years  but it 's still something to be aware of well
 what do we do about them the first thing we have to do is find them  this is an image of an asteroid that passed us in two thousand and nine  
 it 's right here  but you can
  if you can see that in the back row these are just stars  
 this is a rock that was about thirty yards across so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over tunguska and hit arizona fifty thousand years ago 
 these things are faint they 're hard to see and the sky is really big  we have to find these things first well the good news is we 're looking for them  nasa has
 devoted money to this the national science foundation and other countries are interested in doing this we 're building telescopes that are looking for the threat
  's a great first step  but what 's the second step the second step is if we see one heading toward us we have to stop it  what do we do 
 you 've probably heard about the asteroid apophis if you haven 't yet  you will
  if you 've heard about the mayan two thousand and twelve apocalypse you 're going to hear about apophis because you 're keyed in to all the doomsday
 networks anyway
  apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in two thousand and four it 's roughly two hundred and fifty [ meters ] across so it 's pretty big bigger than a football stadium  
 and it 's going to pass by the earth in april of 
 and it 's going to pass us so close that it 's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites the earth 's gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much that if it 's just right if it passes through this region of space
 the earth 's gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later on april thirteen which is a friday i 'll note in the year 
 you can 't plan that kind of stuff 
 apophis is going to hit us 
 and it 's two hundred and fifty meters across  so it would do unbelievable damage  the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go around are one in a million roughly very very low odds
 so i personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all i don 't think apophis is a problem in fact 
 apophis is a blessing in disguise  because it woke us up to the dangers of these things this thing was discovered just a few years ago and could hit us a few years from now it won 't but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids we didn 't really necessarily understand
  and now we do and it turns out that 's really important  because how do you stop an asteroid like this  well  let me ask you what happens if you 're standing in the road and a car 's headed for you what do you do 
 you do this  right move and the car goes past you  but we can 't move the earth at least not easily  but we can move a small asteroid and it turns out we 've even done it in the year two thousand and five  nasa launched a probe called deep
  slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet  comets are very much like asteroids  
 the purpose wasn 't to push it out of the way  the purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet  which we learned quite a bit about we did 
  move the comet a little tiny bit not very much but that wasn 't the point  however think about this this thing is orbiting the sun at ten twenty miles per second we shot a space probe at it and hit it
  imagine how hard that must be and we did it  that means we can do it again  if we see an asteroid that 's coming toward us headed right for us and we have two years to go  boom we hit it  you know 
 if you watch the movies 
 you might think  why don 't we use a nuclear weapon well you can try that but the problem is timing shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else you
  miss it  and there are a lot of other problems with that it 's very hard to do  but just hitting something that 's pretty easy i think even nasa can do that and proved that they can 
 the problem is if you you hit this asteroid  you 've changed the orbit  you measure the orbit then you find out oh yeah  we just pushed it into a keyhole and now it 's going to hit us in three years well
  it 's not hitting us in six months that 's good now we have three years to do something else and you can hit it again that 's kind of ham fisted you might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever  so you don 't do that and this is the part it
 's the part i just love 
 after the big macho grr bam we 're gonna hit this thing in the face then we bring in the velvet gloves
 's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves the b612 foundation for those of you who 've read the little prince you understand that reference i hope the little prince lived on an asteroid called b612 
 these are smart guys men and women astronauts like i said engineers rusty schweickart who was an apollo nine astronaut is on this  dan durda my friend
  who made this image works here at southwest research institute in boulder
 on walnut street he created this image for this he 's actually one of the astronomers who works for them  if we see an asteroid that 's going to hit the earth and we have enough time
  we can hit it to move it into a better orbit  but then what we do is launch a probe that has to weigh a ton or two it doesn 't have to be huge a couple of tons not that big
 and you park it near the asteroid you don 't land on it because these things are tumbling end over end it 's very hard to land on them instead you get near
  it  the gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe and the probe has a couple of tons of mass  it has a little
 tiny bit of gravity  but it 's enough
 that it can pull the asteroid  
 and you have your rocket set up you can barely see it here but there 's rocket plumes and  these guys are connected by their own gravity  and if you move the probe very slowly very very gently  you can
 very easily finesse
  that rock into a safe orbit  you can even put in orbit around the earth where we could mine it  although that 's a whole other thing i won 't go into that 
 but we 'd be rich 
 so think about this  right there are
  giant rocks flying out there and they 're hitting us and they 're doing damage to us  but we 've figured out how to do this and all the pieces are in place to do this  we have astronomers with 
  telescopes looking for them we have very very smart people who are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem  and we have the technology to do this  this probe actually 
  can 't use chemical rockets chemical rockets provide too much thrust too much push the probe would just shoot away  we invented something called an ion drive which is a very very very
  engine it generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand incredibly light  but it can run for months and years  providing that very gentle push 
  if anybody here is a fan of the original star trek they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive and spock said they 're very technically sophisticated they 're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive yeah  we have an ion drive now we don 't have the enterprise but we 've
 spock 
 so 
 that 's the difference that 's the difference between us and the dinosaurs this happened to them  
 it doesn 't have to happen to us the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and
  we can vote  and so we can change our future 
 we have the ability to change our future sixty five million years from now we don 't have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum  thank you very much
