  we all go to doctors  and we do so with
 trust and blind faith that the test they are ordering and the medications they 're prescribing are based upon evidence
 evidence that 's designed
  to help us however the reality is that that hasn 't always been the case for everyone  
 what if i told you that the medical science discovered over the past century has been based on only half the population 
 i 'm an emergency medicine doctor i was trained to be prepared in a medical emergency
  it 's about saving lives how cool is that 
 ok there 's a lot of runny noses and stubbed toes but no matter who walks through the door to the er 
 we order the same tests 
 we prescribe the same medication without ever thinking about the sex or gender of our patients 
 why would we we were never taught
  that there were any differences between men and women a recent government accountability study revealed that eighty percent of the drugs withdrawn from the market
 are due to side effects on women so let 's think about that for a minute why are we discovering side effects on women
 only after a drug has been released to the market do you know that it takes
  years for a drug to go from an idea
 to being tested on cells in a laboratory to animal studies 
 to then clinical trials on humans  finally to go through a regulatory approval process to be available for your doctor to prescribe to you 
 not to mention the millions and billions of dollars of funding it takes
  to go through that process  
 so why are we discovering unacceptable side effects on half the population after that has gone through 
 what 's happening well it turns out that those cells used in that laboratory  they 're male cells
  and the animals used in the animal studies were male animals  and the clinical trials have been performed almost exclusively on men  
 how is it that the male model became our framework for medical research 
 let 's look at an example that has been popularized in the media  and it has to do with the sleep aid ambien 
 ambien was released on the market over twenty years ago 
 and since then
 of millions of prescriptions have been written primarily to women because women suffer more sleep disorders than men  
 but just this past year the food and drug administration recommended cutting the dose in half for women only 
 because they just realized that women metabolize the drug at a slower rate than men  causing them to wake up in
  morning with more of the active drug in their system  
 and then they 're drowsy and they 're getting behind the wheel of the car  and they 're at risk for motor vehicle accidents
 and i can 't help but think as an emergency physician how many of my patients that i 've cared for over the years
  were involved in a motor vehicle accident that possibly could have been prevented
 if this type of analysis was performed and acted upon twenty years ago when this drug was first released 
 how many other things need to be analyzed by gender what else are we missing 
  a lot of things  and one of them was this need to protect people from becoming victims of medical research without informed consent 
 so some much needed guidelines or rules were set into place  and part of that was this desire to protect women of childbearing age from entering into any medical research studies  
 there was fear
  what if something happened to the fetus during the study  who would be responsible  
 and so the scientists at this time actually thought this was a blessing in disguise  because let 's face it
 men 's bodies are pretty homogeneous 
 they don 't have the constantly fluctuating levels of hormones that could disrupt clean data they could get if they had only men 
 it was easier  it was cheaper
  not to mention at this time there was a general assumption that men and women were alike in every way 
 apart from their reproductive organs and sex hormones 
 so
 it was decided 
 medical research was performed on men and the results were later applied to women 
 what did this do
  to the notion of women 's health 
 women 's health became synonymous with reproduction  
 breasts ovaries uterus pregnancy  
 it 's this term we now refer to as bikini medicine 
 and this stayed this way until about the 1980s when this concept
 was challenged by the medical community and by the public health policymakers when they realized that by excluding women from all medical research studies
 we actually did them a disservice 
 in that apart from reproductive issues  virtually nothing was known about the unique needs of the female patient 
 since that time an overwhelming amount of evidence has come to light that shows us just how
 different men and women are in every way you know 
 we have this saying in medicine 
 children are not just little adults  
 and we say that to remind ourselves that children actually have a different physiology than normal adults
  because of this that the medical specialty of pediatrics came to light  and we now conduct research on children
 in order to improve their lives 
 and i know the same thing can be said about women women are not just men
 with boobs and tubes
  they have their own anatomy and physiology that deserves to be studied with the same intensity 
 let 's take the cardiovascular system for example 
 this area in medicine has done the most to try to figure out why it seems men and women have completely different heart attacks 
 heart disease is the number one killer for both men and women 
 but more women die within the
  first year of having a heart attack than men 
 men will complain of crushing chest pain an elephant is sitting on their chest and
 we call this typical 
 women have chest pain too but more women
  can 't seem to get enough air in just so tired lately 
 and for some reason we call this atypical even though as i mentioned women do make up half the population  
 and so what is some of the evidence to help explain some of these
  if we look at the anatomy the blood vessels that surround the heart are smaller in women
 compared to men and the way that those blood vessels develop disease is different
 in women compared to men 
 and the test that we use to determine if someone is at risk for a heart attack well they were initially designed
  tested and perfected in men and so aren 't as good at determining that in women 
 and then if we think about the medications
 common medications that we use like aspirin 
 we give aspirin to healthy men to help prevent them from having a heart attack  
 but do you know that if you give aspirin to a healthy woman it
 's actually harmful 
 what this is doing is merely telling us that
  we are scratching the surface emergency medicine is a fast paced business in how many 
 areas of medicine like cancer and stroke 
 are there important differences between men and women that we could be utilizing 
 or even why is it that some people get those
  runny noses more than others or
 why the pain medication that we give to those stubbed toes work in some
 and not in others 
 the institute of medicine has said every cell has a sex 
 what does this mean sex is dna
  gender is how someone presents themselves in society  
 and these two may not always match up as we can see with our transgendered population  
 but it 's important to realize that from the moment of conception 
 every cell in our bodies skin  hair heart and lungs contains our own unique dna
  and that dna contains the chromosomes that determine whether we become
 male or female man or woman  it used to be thought that those 
  chromosomes pictured here xy if you 're male xx if you 're female
 merely determined whether you would be born with ovaries or testes
  and it was the sex hormones that those organs produced that were responsible for the differences we see in the opposite sex  
 but we now know that that theory was wrong
 or it 's at least a little incomplete  and thankfully scientists like dr page from the whitehead institute 
 who works on the y chromosome and doctor yang from
 ucla they have found evidence
 that tells us that those sex determining chromosomes that are in every cell in our bodies continue to remain active
 for our entire lives
 and could be what 's responsible for the differences we see in the dosing of drugs or why there are differences between men and women
 in the susceptibility and severity of diseases 
 this new knowledge is the game changer and
 it 's up to those scientists that continue to find that evidence but it 's up to the clinicians to start translating this data
  of a national organization called sex and gender women 's health collaborative  and we collect all of this data so that it 's available for teaching
 and for patient care  and we 're working to bring together the medical educators to the
  's a big job  it 's changing the way medical training has been done since its inception  
 but i believe in them i know they 're going to see the value
 of incorporating the gender lens
 into the current curriculum it 's about training the future health
  of a division within the department of emergency medicine here at brown university called sex and gender in emergency medicine and we conduct the research to determine the differences between men and women in emergent conditions  
 like heart disease and stroke
 and sepsis and substance abuse  but we also believe that education is
  paramount  we 've created a 
  360 degree model of education we have programs for the doctors for the nurses for the students
 and for the patients  because this cannot just be left up to the health care leaders 
 we all have a role in making a difference  
 but i must warn you
 this is not easy in fact it 's hard  
 it 's essentially changing the way we think about medicine and health
 and research it 's changing our relationship to the health care system  but
 there 's no going back we now know just
  enough to know that we weren 't doing it right  
 martin luther king jr has said change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability  
 but comes through continuous struggle 
 and the first step towards change is awareness this is not just about improving medical care for women
 this is about personalized individualized health care for everyone 
 this awareness has the power to transform medical care for men and women 
 and from now on i want you to ask your doctors
 whether the treatments you are receiving are specific to your sex and gender
 they may not know the answer
 yet  but the conversation has begun and together we can all learn  remember for me
 and my colleagues in this field your sex and gender matter thank you
