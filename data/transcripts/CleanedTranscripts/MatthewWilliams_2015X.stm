  my name is matthew williams  and i am a champion  
 i have won medals in three different sports and national games in canada competed at the international level in basketball
 and was proud
 to represent canada on the world stage 
 i train five days a week for basketball and speed skating  
 work with top quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be at my best
  by the way all that is through special olympics  does that change the way you think of me and my accomplishments 
 the world does not see all people like me as champions  
 not long ago  people like me were shunned and hidden away
  there has been lots of change since special olympics began in
  many cases  people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider population 
 people use the r word in front of me and they think it doesn 't matter 
 that 's the word retard or retarded used in a derogatory
  they 're not thinking about how much it hurts me and my friends  
 i don 't want you to think i 'm here because i 'm a charity case  i am here because there is still a big problem with the way
 many people see individuals with intellectual disabilities or
 too often how they don 't see them at all 
 did you know the world games happened this year
  i was one of over six thousand five hundred athletes with intellectual disabilities
 from one hundred and sixty five countries who competed in la 
 there was over sixty two thousand spectators watching opening ceremonies  and there was live coverage on tsn and
  did you even know that happened
  what do you think of when you see someone like me 
 i am here today to challenge you to look at us as equals 
 special olympics transforms the self identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities
 and the perceptions of everyone watching for those of you who aren 't familiar
  special olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities  
 special olympics is separate from the paralympics and olympics we offer 
 year round sports programs for people with intellectual disabilities that changes lives and perceptions 
  has changed my life and those of so many others  and it has changed the way the world sees
 people with intellectual disabilities  i was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability  
 growing up  i played hockey until i was twelve years old  the older i got
 the more i felt it was harder to keep up with everyone else  and i was angry and frustrated 
 for a while  i did not play any sports didn 't have many friends and felt left out and sad 
 there was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were
  hidden away from society  
 no one thought they could participate in sports let alone be a valued member of society  
  frank hayden a scientist at the university of toronto was studying the effects of regular exercise
 on the fitness levels of children
 with intellectual disabilities  
 using rigorous scientific research dr hayden and other researchers came to the conclusion
 that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that caused their fitness levels to suffer 
  lots of people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competition opportunities  
 but pioneers like dr hayden and eunice kennedy shriver  the founder of special olympics  persevered  and special olympics athletes
 have proved them right four and a half
  before i joined special olympics  i was nervous
 because i was young  shy not confident and didn 't have many friends 
 when i got there though everyone was very encouraging  supportive and let me be myself without being judged
  now  i am a basketball player and speed skater who has competed at provincial national games 
 and this year made it all the way to the world summer games in la 
 where i was part of the first ever canadian basketball team to compete at world games
  i am one of more than four and a half million athletes around the globe  and i 've heard so many similar stories 
 being special olympics athletes restores our pride and dignity  
 special olympics also addresses critical
  studies have shown that on average  
 men with intellectual disabilities die thirteen years younger than men without and women with intellectual disabilities
 die twenty years younger than women without 
 special olympics keeps us healthy by getting us active and participating in sport
  our coaches teach us about nutrition and health  
 special olympics also provides free health screening for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing health care 
 at the two thousand and fifteen world summer games my team canada teammates and
 i played the nigerian basketball team 
 the day before our game the nigerian basketball team went to the world games healthy athlete screening  where seven of ten members 
 were given hearing aids for free and got to hear clearly for the first time
  them was amazing they were more excited  happy and confident because their coach could vocally communicate with them 
 and they were emotional
 because they could hear the sounds of the basketball the sounds of the whistle
 and the cheering fans in the stands sounds that we take for granted 
 special olympics
  is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport  special olympics is transforming their lives off the field 
 this year  research findings showed that nearly half of the adults in the us
 don 't know a single person with an intellectual disability 
  percent of americans who don 't have personal contact with intellectual disabilities
 are significantly less accepting and positive  
 then there 's the r word proving that people with intellectual disabilities
 are still invisible to far too many people 
 people use it as a casual term or an insult it was tweeted more than nine million times
  last year  and it is deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes
 around the planet  people don 't think it 's insulting  but it is 
 as my fellow athlete and global messenger john franklin stephens wrote in an open letter to a political pundit who used the
  an insult come join us someday at special olympics see if you walk away with your heart unchanged
 hours to get into the final night of powerlifting competition 
 so it was standing room only when my teammate jackie barrett  the newfoundland moose
 deadlifted six hundred and fifty five pounds
 and lifted six hundred and eleven pounds in the squat
  huge new records for special olympics  jackie is a record holder among all powerlifters in newfoundland
 not just special olympics
  performance 
 fifty years ago  few imagined individuals with intellectual disabilities could do anything like that 
 this year  sixty thousand spectators filled the famous
 la memorial coliseum
 to watch the opening ceremonies of world games and cheer athletes from one hundred and
 sixty five countries around the world  far from being hidden away  we were cheered and celebrated  
 special olympics teaches athletes to be confident and proud of themselves  
 special olympics teaches the world
  i have dreams and achievements in my sport  great coaches 
 respect and dignity  better health  and i am pursuing a career as a personal trainer
 i am no longer hidden  
 bullied and i am here doing a ted talk
  different place because of special olympics  
 but there is still farther to go 
 so the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability  i hope you will see their ability 
 the next time someone uses the r word near you i hope you will tell them how much it hurts  i hope you will think about
  to leave you with one final thought  nelson mandela said sports has the power to change the world 
 special olympics is changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes
 and giving us a place to be
  not be judged and get to feel like and be champions  thank you very much
