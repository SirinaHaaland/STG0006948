  talk to you about the walkable city  what is the walkable city well for want of a better definition it 's a city in which the car
 is an optional
  instrument of freedom  rather than a prosthetic device and i 'd like to talk about why we need the walkable city and i 'd like to talk about
 how to do the walkable city  most of the talks i give these days are about why we need it  but
 you guys are smart  and also i gave that talk exactly a month ago  and you can see it at ted com so today i want to talk about
 how to do it in a lot of time thinking about this i 've come
  with what i call the general theory of walkability a bit of a pretentious term it 's a little tongue in cheek but it 's something i 've thought about for a long time  and
 i 'd like to share what i think i 've figured out 
 in the american city the typical american city the typical american city is not washington dc or new york or san francisco  it 's grand rapids
  or cedar rapids or memphis in the typical american city in which most people own cars and the temptation is to drive them all the time if you 're going to get them to walk then you have to offer
 a walk that 's as good as a drive or better what does that mean it means you need to offer four things simultaneously  there needs to be a proper reason to walk  
 the walk has to be safe and feel safe the walk has to be comfortable and the walk has to be interesting
  you need to do all four of these things simultaneously  and that 's the structure of my talk today to take you through each of those the reason to walk
 is a story i learned from my mentors andrs duany and elizabeth plater zyberk the founders of the new urbanism movement  and i should say half the slides and half of my talk today
 i learned from them  it 's the story of planning the story of the formation of the planning profession when
  century people were
 choking from the soot of the dark satanic mills the planners said hey let 's move the housing away from the mills  and lifespans increased immediately 
 dramatically  and we like to say the planners have been trying to repeat that experience ever since  so there 's the onset of what we call euclidean zoning the separation of the landscape into large areas of single
  and typically when i arrive in a city to do a plan 
 a plan like this already awaits me on the property that i 'm looking at and all a plan like this guarantees is that you will not have a walkable city  because nothing is located near anything 
  else the alternative of course is our most walkable city  and i like to say  you know this is a rothko  and this is a seurat it
  is uses that are mixed vertically  
 so this is the big story of the new urbanists to acknowledge that there are only two ways two ways that have been tested by the thousands to build communities in the world and 
  throughout history one is the traditional neighborhood  you see here several neighborhoods of newburyport massachusetts
  shop  recreate get educated all within walking distance
  and it 's defined as being walkable there are lots of small streets each one is comfortable to walk on  and we contrast that to the other way 
 an invention that happened after the second world war suburban sprawl clearly not compact 
 clearly not diverse  and it 's not walkable because so few of the streets connect that those streets that do connect become
  overburdened  and you wouldn 't let your kid out on them and i want to thank alex maclean the aerial photographer for many of these beautiful pictures that i 'm showing you today  so it 's fun to break 
  sprawl down into its constituent parts it 's so easy to understand the places where you only live  the places where you only work  
  public institutions schools get bigger and bigger and therefore further and further from each other and the ratio of the size of the parking lot to the size of the school tells you all you need to 
  which is that no child has ever walked to this school no child will ever walk to this school
 the seniors and juniors are driving the freshmen and the sophomores and of course we have the crash statistics to prove it and then the
  civic institutions like playing fields it 's wonderful that westin in the ft lauderdale area has eight soccer fields and eight baseball diamonds and
 twenty tennis courts but look at the road that takes you to that location and would you let your child bike on it 
 and this is why we have the soccer mom now when i was young i had one soccer field one baseball diamond and one tennis court but i could walk to it because it was in my neighborhood 
 then the final part of sprawl that everyone forgot to count
 if you 're going to separate everything from everything else and reconnect it only with automotive infrastructure then this is what your landscape begins to to look like the main message here is if you 
  want to have a walkable city you can 't start with the sprawl model you need the bones of an urban model this is the outcome of that form of design
  you 're dreaming for this you 're also going to be dreaming of this  often to absurd extremes 
 when we build our landscape to accommodate cars first and the experience of being in these places this is not photoshopped  
 walter  kulash took this slide  it 's in panama city this is a real place  and being a driver can be a bit of a nuisance
  and being a pedestrian can be a bit of a nuisance in these places  this is a slide that epidemiologists have been showing for some time now 
 laughter the fact that we have a society where you drive to the parking lot to take the escalator to the treadmill shows that we 're doing something wrong but we know how to do it better
 here are the two models contrasted i show this slide which has been a formative document of the new urbanism now for almost thirty years 
  that sprawl and the traditional neighborhood contain the same things  it 's just how big are they how close are they to each other how are they interspersed together and do you have a street network  rather than a cul de sac or a
 collector system of streets so when we look at a downtown area at a place that has a hope of being walkable and mostly that 's our downtowns in america 's cities and towns and villages we look at them and say
 we want the proper balance
  of uses so what is missing or underrepresented and again in the typical american cities in which most americans live  it is housing that is lacking the jobs to housing balance is 
  off and you find that when you bring housing back these other things start to come back too and housing is usually first among those things and of course the thing that shows up last and eventually is the schools because
  schools get pretty good eventually the other part of this
 part  the useful city part is transit and you can have a perfectly walkable neighborhood without it  but perfectly walkable cities 
 require transit because if you don 't have access to the whole city as a pedestrian then you get a
  and if you get a car the city begins to reshape itself around your needs and the streets get wider and the parking lots get bigger and you no longer have a walkable city so transit is essential  but every transit
  experience every transit trip begins or ends as a walk  and so we have to remember to build walkability around our transit stations 
  city the first is block size this is portland oregon  famously 200 foot blocks  famously walkable  this is salt lake city  famously 600 foot blocks 
  famously unwalkable  if you look at the two it 's almost like two different planets but these places were both built by humans and in fact 
  and that 's a problem these are the crash statistics when you double the block size this was a study of twenty four california cities when you double the block size you almost quadruple 
  the number of fatal accidents on non highway streets  so how many lanes do we have this is where i 'm going to tell you what i tell every audience i meet which is
  demand applies both to highways
 and to city streets
 and induced demand tells us that when we widen the streets to accept the congestion that we 're anticipating or the additional trips that we 're anticipating
 in congested systems it is principally that congestion that is constraining demand and so that the widening
  and there are all of these latent trips that are ready to happen people move further from work and make other choices about when they commute and those lanes fill up very quickly with traffic so we widen the street again 
  and they fill up again and we 've learned that in congested systems we cannot satisfy the automobile  this is from newsweek magazine hardly an esoteric publication today 's engineers acknowledge that building new roads usually makes traffic worse
  my response to reading this was may i please meet some of these engineers because these are not the ones that i there are great exceptions that i 'm working with now but these are not the engineers one typically meets working in a 
  city where they say oh that road is too crowded we need to add a lane so you add a lane and the traffic comes and they say see i told you we needed that lane 
 oversized for the congestion they 're currently experiencing this was the case in oklahoma city  when the mayor came running to me 
 very upset because they were named in prevention magazine the worst city for pedestrians in the entire country now that can 't possibly be true  but it certainly is enough to make a mayor
 do something about it we did a walkability study and what
  counts and we know that two lanes can handle ten thousand cars per day  look at these numbers they 're all near or under ten thousand cars and these were 
  the streets that were designated in the new downtown plan to be four lanes to six lanes wide  so you had a fundamental disconnect between the number of lanes and the number of cars that wanted to use them so it was my job
  redesign every street in the downtown from curb face to curb face and we did it for fifty blocks of streets  and we 're rebuilding it now so a typical oversized street to to nowhere
 is being narrowed and now under construction and the project is half done the typical street like this  you know when you do that you find room for medians
  you find room for bike lanes we 've doubled the amount of on street parking we 've added a full bike network where one didn 't exist before  
 but not everyone has the money that oklahoma city has because they have an extraction economy that 's doing quite well  the typical city is more like cedar rapids where they have an all
 four lane system half one way system  and it 's a little hard to see but what we 've done
  and in so doing we 're adding seventy percent more on street parking which the merchants love  and it protects the sidewalk that parking makes the sidewalk safe 
 and we 're adding a much more robust bicycle network  then the the lanes themselves how wide are they that 's really important 
  the standards have changed such that as andrs duany says the typical road to a subdivision in america allows you to see the curvature of the earth 
 this is a subdivision outside of washington from the 1960s look very carefully at the width of the streets this is a subdivision from the 
  the standards have changed to such a degree that my old neighborhood of south beach  when it was time to fix the street that wasn 't draining properly they had to widen it and take away half our sidewalk because the standards were wider
 people go faster on wider streets people know this the engineers deny it  but the citizens know it so that in birmingham michigan they fight for for narrower streets 
 portland oregon  famously walkable instituted its skinny streets program in its residential neighborhood we know that skinny streets are safer  the developer vince
  in his project i 'on which we worked on in south carolina he goes to conferences and he shows his amazing 22 foot
 roads these are two way roads very narrow rights of way and he shows this well known philosopher who said 
 broad is the road that leads to destruction narrow is the road that leads to
  revolution underway in only some american cities but where you build it they come as a planner i hate to say that but the one thing i can say is that bicycle population is a function of bicycle infrastructure 
 i asked my friend tom brennan from nelson \ nygaard in
 portland to send me some pictures of the portland bike commute he sent me this i said was that
  when you do what portland did and spend money on bicycle infrastructure
 new york city has doubled the number of bikers in it several times now by painting these bright green lanes even automotive cities like long beach california 
 vast uptick in the number of bikers based on the infrastructure and of course what really does it  if you know 15th street here in
  please meet rahm emanuel 's new bike lanes in chicago  the buffered lane the parallel parking pulled off the curb the bikes between 
 the parked cars and the curb these mint cyclists if however as in pasadena every lane is a bike lane then no lane is a bike lane  and this is the only bicyclist that i met in pasadena so 
 the parallel parking i mentioned it 's an essential barrier of steel that protects the curb
 and pedestrians from
  moving vehicles 
 this is ft lauderdale one side of the street you can park the other side of the street you can 't this is happy hour on the parking side this is sad hour on the other side 
 and then the trees themselves slow cars down they move slower when trees are next to the road and of course sometimes they slow down very quickly 
  swoopy is that curb to determine how fast the car goes and how much room you have to cross  and then i love this  because this is objective journalism some say the entrance to citycenter 
  is not inviting to pedestrians when every aspect of the landscape is swoopy is aerodynamic is stream form geometrics it says this is a vehicular place so no one detail no one speciality can be allowed to set the stage
  and here you know this street yes it will drain within a minute of the hundred year storm  but this poor woman has to mount the curb every day  so then quickly the comfortable walk has to do 
  with the fact that all animals seek simultaneously  prospect and refuge we want to be able to see our predators  but we also want to feel that our flanks are
  and so we 're drawn to places that have good edges and if you don 't supply the edges people won 't want to be there what 's the proper ratio of height to width is it one to one three to one 
  if you get beyond one to six you 're not very comfortable anymore you don 't feel enclosed now six to one in salzburg can be perfectly delightful the opposite of salzburg is houston
  have a missing corner because of an outdated zoning code then you could have a missing nose in your neighborhood that 's what we had in my neighborhood  this was the zoning code that said i couldn 't build on that site as 
  you may know washington dc is now changing its zoning to allow sites like this to become sites like this we needed a lot of variances to do that triangular houses can be interesting to build but if you get one built people generally like it
  so you 've got to fill those missing noses  and then finally the interesting walk signs of humanity
  we are among the social primates nothing interests us more than other people 
 we want signs of people so the perfect one to one ratio it 's a great thing  this is grand rapids a very walkable city but nobody walks on this street that connects the two best hotels
  if on the left you have an exposed parking deck and on the right you have a conference facility that was apparently
 designed in admiration for that parking deck then you don 't attract that many people 
 mayor joe riley in his 10th term mayor of charleston south carolina taught us it only takes twenty five feet of building to hide two hundred and fifty feet of garage this one i call the chia pet garage 
  it 's in south beach that active ground floor  i want to end with this project that i love to show it 's by
  in columbus ohio to the left
 is the convention center neighborhood full of pedestrians to the right is the short north neighborhood ethnic  great restaurants great shops struggling  it wasn 't doing very well because this was the bridge and no one was walking from the convention center
 into that neighborhood well when they rebuilt the highway they added an extra
  they rebuilt the bridge over the highway  
 the city paid one point nine million dollars they gave the site to a developer the developer built this and now the short north has come back to life  
 and everyone says  the newspapers not the planning magazines the newspapers say it 's because of that bridge  so that 's it that 's the general theory of walkability  
 think about your own cities think about how you can apply it you 've got to do all four things at once  so find those places where you have most of them
  fix what you can fix what still needs fixing in those places i really appreciate your attention and thank thank you for for coming today
