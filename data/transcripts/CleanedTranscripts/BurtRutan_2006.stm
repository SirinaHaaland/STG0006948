  i want to start off by saying houston we have a problem 
 we 're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of
 human flight in space in fact we 've regressed
 we stand a very big chance of losing our
  ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done and that is instinctively we 've gone out and climbed over
 difficult places went to more hostile places  and found out later  
 maybe to our surprise that that 's the reason we survived  and
 i feel very strongly that it 's
  not good enough
 for us to have generations of kids that think that it 's ok to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it they need to look forward to
  exploration they need to look forward to colonization they need to look forward to breakthroughs
  i 'm particularly troubled that what nasa 's doing right now with this new bush doctrine to
 for this next decade and a half
 oh shoot i screwed up we have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics what we 're looking forward to
  what we 're looking forward to
 is not only the inspiration of our children  but the current plan right now is
 is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country the boeing 's and lockheed 's space engineers to go out and take risks and try new stuff
 we 're going to go back to the moon
  do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new  
 i 'm really troubled by that but anyway that 's the basis of the thing that i want to share with you today though is
 that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later that 's the
  what they look at is the most important thing let 's take a snapshot at aviation and there was a wonderful little
 short four year time period when marvelous things happened it started in one thousand nine hundred and eight when the wright brothers flew in paris and everybody said
 there 's only a few people that have flown in early one thousand nine hundred and eight 
 in four years thirty nine countries had hundreds of airplanes thousand of pilots airplanes were invented by natural selection now you can say that intelligent design designs 
  our airplanes of today  but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes  there were probably at least thirty thousand different things tried 
  they crash and kill the pilot don 't try that again  
 the ones that flew and landed ok because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition 
 so we by making a whole bunch of attempts
  thousands of attempts in that four year time period we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today and that 's why they 're so safe as we gave it a lot of
  what 's good that has not happened at all in space flying there 's only been two concepts tried two by the u s and one by the russians
  well who was inspired during that time period aviation week asked me to make a list of who i thought were the movers and shakers of the first one hundred years of aviation and i wrote them down and i found out later that every one of them
 was a little kid
 in that wonderful renaissance of aviation
 well what happened when i was a little kid was
 some pretty heavy stuff too  the jet age started the missile age started
  von braun was on there showing how to go to mars and this was before sputnik and this was at a time when mars was a hell of a lot more interesting
 than it is now we thought there 'd be animals there we knew there were plants there the colors
  nasa screwed that up because they 've sent these robots and they 've landed it only in the deserts 
 if you look at what happened
 this little black line is as fast as man ever flew and the red line is top of the line military fighters and 
 and the blue line is commercial air transport
  you notice here 's a big jump when i was a little kid
 and i think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something
 that other people weren 't having the courage to try well 
 what did i do when i was a kid  i didn 't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and well we didn 't have drugs in those days but i did competition model airplanes 
 i spent about seven years during the vietnam war flight testing airplanes for the air force and then i went in and i had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in
  their garages and some three thousand of those are flying of course one of them is around the world voyager 
 i founded another company in ' eighty two which is my company now  and we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since one thousand nine hundred and eighty two and there 's a lot of them that i actually can 't show you
 on this chart the most impressive airplane ever  i believe
 only a dozen years after the first operational jet 
 stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly taken out of service  we retreated in ' ninety eight back to something that was developed in 
 the most impressive spaceship ever  i believe was a grumman
  lunar lander it was a you know it landed on the moon take off of the moon didn 't need any maintenance guys
 that 's kind of cool we 've lost that capability we abandoned it in ' seventy two this thing was designed three years after gagarin first flew in space in one thousand nine hundred and sixty one three years 
 and we can 't do that now  crazy  talk very briefly about innovation cycles things that
  have a lot of activity they die out when they 're replaced by something else these things tend to happen every twenty five years 
 forty years long with an overlap you can put that that statement on all kinds of different technologies  the interesting thing by the way  the speed here excuse me higher speed travel is the
 is the title of these innovation cycles there is none here  these two new airplanes are
  here 's the biggie  
 and that is you don 't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it  
 you know a good example of course is the darpa net  computers were used for artillery first then irs but when we got it  now you have all the level of activity all the benefit from it  private sector has
  to do it  keep that in mind 
 i put down innovation i 've looked for innovation cycles in space i found none the very first year starting when gagarin went in space and a few weeks 
  later alan shepherd there were five manned space flights in the world the very first year 
 there were only three or four flights in two thousand and three in two thousand and four
  four 
 there were only two flights two russian soyuz flights to the international manned station  and i had to fly three in mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people 
 in order to get to a total of five  which was the number the same year back in one thousand nine hundred and sixty one 
  this is a picture here taken from spaceshipone this is a picture here taken from orbit our goal is to make
 it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that we know how to do it for sub orbital flying now do it safe enough at least as safe as the early airlines so that can be done  and i think
 i want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and and try that
  as a  as a small
 company  
 well first of all what 's going to happen next the first industry will be a high volume a lot of players there 's another one announced just last week
  and
 it will be sub orbital and the reason it has to be
  there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public
 to orbit  
 the governments have been doing this three governments have been doing this for forty five years and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died that 's you don 't
 want to run a business with that kind of a
 safety record it 'll be very high volume we think one hundred thousand people will fly
 by two thousand and twenty  i can 't tell you when this will start because i don 't want my competition to know my schedule
  but i think once it does  
 we will find solutions and very quickly you 'll see those resort hotels in orbit 
 and that real easy thing to do which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view  and
 that will be really cool because the moon doesn 't have an atmosphere you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by ten feet if you want oh it 's going to be so much fun
 my critics say hey rutan 's just spending a lot of these billionaires ' money for joyrides for billionaires  
 what 's this this is not a transportation system  it 's just for fun 
 and i used to be bothered by that and then i got to thinking well wait a minute  i bought my first apple computer in one thousand nine hundred
  i bought it because i could say i got a computer at my house and you don 't 
 ' what do you use it for ' come over it does frogger ok 
 not the bank 's computer or lockheed 's computer but the home computer was for games 
 for a whole decade it was for fun
 we didn 't even know what it was for but what happened the fact that we had this big industry big development big improvement and
  capability and so on and they get out there in enough homes we were ripe
 for a new invention and the inventor is in this audience  al gore invented the internet
 and because of that something that we used for a whole year excuse me a whole decade for fun  became everything our
  our research our communication and if we let the google guys
 think for another couple weekends we can add a dozen more things to the list and it won 't be very long before you won 't be able to convince kids that we didn 't always have computers in our homes 
 so fun is defendable ok  i want to show you kind of a busy chart  
  in it is my prediction with what 's going to happen and in it also brings up another point  right here  
 there 's a group of people that have come forward and you don 't know all of them but the ones that have come forward
 were inspired as young children  this little three to 15 year old age 
 by us going to orbit and going to the moon here right in this time period
  a private space station and carmack  these people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area
  and i think it 's a lot better than they put it
 in an area of a better cell phone or something but they 're putting it in it in very areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability and it will lead us into the next really big thing
 and it will allow us to
 explore  and i think eventually it will allow us to to colonize and to keep us from going extinct they were inspired by big progress but
  look at the progress that 's going on after that there were a couple of examples here the military fighters had a
 highest performance military airplane was the sr71 it went a whole life cycle 
 got too rusty to fly 
 and was taken out of service the concorde doubled the speed for for airline travel it went a whole life cycle without competition took out of service  and we 're stuck 
  back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel
  we had back in the late ' 50s 
 but something is out there to inspire our kids now and i 'm talking about if you 've got a baby now or if you 've got a 10 year old now  what 's out there is there 's something really interesting going to happen here  
 relatively soon you 'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster
  military operational airplane it 's never happened before the fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance
 has been well you know you win the war in twelve minutes why do you need something better  but i think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub orbital flights to space very soon
 wait a minute
 what 's happening here we 'll have military fighters
  interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first ok i look forward to a new
 capitalist 's space race let 's call it  you remember the space race in the ' 60s
 was for national prestige because we lost the first two milestones we didn 't lose them technically  
 the fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let von braun fly it
  you can argue that 's not a technical loss sputnik wasn 't a technical loss but it was a prestige loss  america
 the world saw america as not being the leader in
 technology and that was a very strong thing and then we flew alan shepherd weeks after gagarin not
 months or decades or whatever so we had the capability
  but america lost we lost and because of that we made a big jump to recover it  
 well  again what
 's interesting here is we 've lost to the russians on the first couple of milestones already  you cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in america
 can 't do it you can buy it in russia
  can fly with russian hardware 
 this is available because a russian space program is starving  and it 's nice for them to get twenty million here and there to take one of the seats  
 it 's commercial it can be defined as space tourism they are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon like apollo eight was done one hundred million bucks
 hey i can go to the moon
  moon  but you know would you have thought back in the ' 60s when the space race was going on that the first commercial
  thing to do
 to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in russian hardware  and would you have thought would the russians have thought that when they first go to the moon in
  the guys inside won 't be russians maybe it 'll probably be a japanese or an american billionaire well that 's weird  you know it really is  
 but anyway i think we need to beat them again  i think what we 'll do is we 'll see a successful very successful
  private space flight industry
  whether we 're first or not really doesn 't matter the russians actually flew a a supersonic transport before
  the concorde
 and then they flew a few cargo flights and took it out of service  i think you kind of see the same kind of parallel
 when the commercial stuff is offered 
 ok we 'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight this little thing says here five times what nasa 's
  point seven billion investment in private space flight that is not
 government at all already  worldwide
 if you read if you google it you 'll find about half of that money  but there 's twice
  being committed out there
 not spent yet  but being committed and planned for the next few years hey that 's pretty big  
 i 'm predicting though as profitable as this industry is going to be and it certainly is profitable when you fly
 people at two hundred thousand dollars on something that you can actually operate at at a tenth of that cost or less
 this is going to be very profitable i predict also
  that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the u s taxpayer
 spends for nasa 's manned spacecraft work and every dollar that flows into that will be spent
 more efficiently by a factor of ten to fifteen and what that means is before we know it 
 the progress
 in human space flight with no taxpayer
  dollars will be at a level of about five times
 as much as the current nasa budgets for human space flight  and that is because
 it 's
 us it 's private industry you should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff
  and we 've done it for a long time the naca before nasa never developed an airliner and never ran an airline 
 but nasa is developing the space liner always has and runs the only
 space line  ok  and we 've shied away from it
 because we 're afraid of it  but starting back in june of two thousand
  i showed that a little little group out there actually can do it can get a start with it  everything changed after that time ok
