  a few years ago my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry 
 in two thousand and six young qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps and since then i 've followed the
 the unfolding issue of worker rights in the last six months more than three hundred
  skyscrapers in the uae have been put on hold or canceled behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the  often indentured construction worker 
 one point one million of them 
 mainly indian pakistani sri lankan and nepalese these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home 
 they pay a middle man thousands of dollars to be there and when they arrive they find themselves in labor camps with no
  water no air conditioning and their passports taken away  
 while it 's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities ninety nine percent of these people are hired by the private sector  
 and so therefore we 're equally if not more accountable  
 groups like buildsafe uae have emerged but the numbers are simply
  in august two thousand and eight 
 uae public officials noted that forty percent of the country 's one thousand and ninety eight labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations and last summer  
 more than ten thousand workers protested for the non payment of wages for the poor quality of food  and inadequate housing 
 and then the financial collapse happened 
 when the contractors have gone bust as they 've been overleveraged like everyone else the difference is everything goes
  missing 
 documentation passports and tickets home for these workers 
 currently right now thousands of workers are abandoned there is no way back home  and there is no way and no proof of arrival 
 these are the boom and bust refugees the question is as a building professional  as an
  an engineer as a developer  if you know this is going on as we go to the sights every single week 
 are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations 
 so let 's forget your environmental footprint let 's think about your ethical footprint  what good is it to
 build a 
 energy efficient complex when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best now recently i 've been told i 've been taking the high road
  but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
