  four point six billion years of history in eighteen minutes 
 that 's three hundred million years per minute  let 's start with the first photograph
  the new york times wrote in its editorial 
 mars is uninteresting it 's a dead world nasa should not spend any time or effort studying mars anymore 
  leaders in washington at nasa headquarters knew better
 and we began a very extensive study of the red planet 
 one of the key questions in all of science is there life outside of earth 
 i believe that mars is the most likely target for life outside the earth i 'm going to show you in a few minutes some amazing measurements that suggest there may be life on mars  
 but let me start with
  viking photograph this is a composite taken by viking in 
 viking was developed and managed at the nasa langley research center  we sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of one thousand nine 
 we had four spacecraft two around mars  two on the surface an amazing accomplishment  this is the first photograph taken
  from the surface of any planet this is a viking lander photograph
 of the surface of mars  and yes the red planet is red 
 mars is half the size of the earth but because two thirds of the earth is covered by water  the land area on mars is comparable to the land area on earth so mars is a pretty big place even though it 's
  have obtained topographic measurements of the surface of mars  we understand the elevation differences we know a lot about mars mars has 
 the largest volcano in the solar system  olympus mons mars has the grand canyon of the solar system valles marineris  
  interesting planet mars has the largest
 impact crater in the solar system  hellas basin  this is two thousand miles across  if you happened to be on mars when this impactor hit  it was a really bad day on mars 
 this is olympus mons  this is bigger than the state of arizona  volcanoes are important because volcanoes produce atmospheres and they produce oceans
  looking at valles marineris  the largest canyon in the solar system superimposed on a map of the united states three thousand miles across one of the most 
  intriguing features about mars the national academy of science says one of the ten major mysteries of the
  on mars where for some reason we don 't understand why at this point the surface is very very highly magnetized 
 is there water on mars  the answer is no there is no liquid water on the surface of mars today 
 but there is intriguing evidence that suggests that the early history of mars there may have been rivers and fast flowing water
  today mars is very very dry we believe there 's some water
 in the polar caps there are polar caps of north pole and south pole here are some recent images this is from
 spirit and opportunity these images that show at one time there was very fast flowing water on the surface of mars  why is water important 
 water is important because if you want life you have to have water
  water is the
 key ingredient in the evolution the origin of life on a planet  
 here is some picture of antarctica and a picture of olympus mons  very similar features glaciers  so this is frozen water this is ice water on mars  
 this is my favorite picture this
  just taken a few weeks ago it has not been seen publicly  this is european space agency mars express  image of a crater on mars and in the middle of the crater we have liquid water we have ice very intriguing photograph  
 we now believe that in the early history of mars which is four point six billion years ago 
 four point six billion years ago mars
  mars had rivers mars had lakes but more important mars had
 we believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere  and this area in blue which shows a depression of about four miles was the ancient ocean area on the surface of mars  
 where did the ocean 's worth of water on mars go
  we have an idea  this is a measurement we obtained a few years ago from a mars orbiting satellite called odyssey 
  water on mars  frozen in the form of ice  
 and this shows the percent if it 's a blueish color it means sixteen percent by weight  sixteen percent by weight of the interior contains frozen water or ice 
  a lot of water below the surface  
 the most intriguing and puzzling measurement in my opinion  we 've obtained of mars  was released earlier this year in the
 magazine science and what we 're looking at is the presence of the gas methane
 in the atmosphere of mars  and you can see there are three distinct regions of methane why is methane important
  because on earth  almost all ninety nine point nine percent of the methane is produced by living systems not little green men  
 but microscopic life below the surface or at the surface  we now have evidence that methane is in the atmosphere of mars  a gas that on earth is biogenic in origin  produced by living systems
  these are the three plumes a
 and this is the terrain it appears over and we know from geological studies that these regions are the oldest regions on mars in fact 
 the earth and mars are both four point six billion years old 
 the oldest rock on earth is only three point six billion the reason there
 gap in our geological understanding is because of plate tectonics the crust of the earth has been recycled we have no geological record prior for the first billion years 
 that record exists on mars and this terrain that we 're looking at
 dates back to four point six billion
  this is a map that shows where we 've put our spacecraft on the surface of mars  here is viking i viking ii this is opportunity 
  this is spirit this is mars pathfinder  this is phoenix we just put two years ago  
  hemisphere that 's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient
 ocean basin there aren 't many craters  and that 's because the water protected the the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites
 but look in the southern hemisphere in the southern hemisphere there are impact craters there are volcanic craters  here 's hellas basin
  a very very different place geologically look where the methane is the methane is in a very rough terrain area  
 what is the best way to unravel the mysteries on mars that exist  we asked this question
 ten years ago  we invited ten of the top mars scientists to the langley research center for two
  days we addressed on the board the major questions that have not been answered  
 and we spent two days deciding how to best answer this question and the result of our meeting
 was a robotic
  there 's a model of ares here this is a 20 percent scale model this airplane was designed at the langley research center if any place in the world can build an airplane to fly on mars  it 's the langley research center 
 for almost one hundred years a leading center of aeronautics in the world  
 we fly about a mile above the surface  we cover hundreds of miles
  and we fly about four hundred and fifty miles an hour  
 we can do things that rovers can 't do and landers can 't do we can fly above mountains volcanoes impact craters we fly over valleys 
 we can fly over surface magnetism  the polar caps subsurface water  and we can search for life on mars
  equal importance 
 as we fly through the atmosphere of mars  we transmit that journey the first flight of an airplane outside of the earth  we transmit those images back to earth 
 and our goal is to inspire the american public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars  but more important
 we will inspire the next generation of scientists technologists  engineers and mathematicians
 and that 's a critical area of national security and economic vitality to make sure
 we produce the next generation of scientists  engineers mathematicians and technologists  
 this is what ares looks like as it flies over mars we preprogram it we will fly where the methane is we will have instruments aboard the plane
  that will sample every three minutes the atmosphere of mars  we will look for methane as well as other gasses produced by living systems  we will pinpoint 
 where these gases emanate from because we can measure the gradient where it comes from 
 in two words very carefully  
 the problem is we don 't fly it to mars  we put it in a spacecraft
 and we send it to mars  the problem is the spacecraft 's largest diameter is nine feet
 we fold it  
 and we transport it in a spacecraft 
 and we have it in something called an aeroshell  this is how we do it  and we have a little video that describes the sequence
  taking nine months to get to mars  
  airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time
  we believe that in a one hour flight we can rewrite
 the textbook on mars by making high resolution measurements of the atmosphere looking for gases of biogenic origin  looking for
 gases of volcanic origin  studying the surface  studying the magnetism on the surface which we don 't understand as well as about a dozen other
  areas practice makes perfect how do we know we can do it 
 because we have tested  ares model  several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the nasa langley research center for eight years under mars conditions 
 and of equal importance is we test
  in the earth 's atmosphere 
 at one hundred thousand feet  which is comparable to the density and pressure of the atmosphere on mars where we 'll fly now one hundred thousand feet if you fly cross country to los angeles you fly thirty seven thousand feet 
 we do our tests at one hundred thousand feet and i want to show you one of our tests  this is a half scale model this is a
 put the folded airplane on the balloon it took about three hours to to get up there and then we released it on command at one hundred and three thousand feet  
 and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly and we 've done
  model here but we have a full scale model in storage at the nasa langley research center  we 're ready to go all we need is a check from nasa headquarters 
 to cover the costs i 'm
 prepared to donate my honorarium for today 's talk for this mission 
 there 's actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing  this is the ares team
 we have about one hundred and fifty scientists engineers where we 're working with jet propulsion laboratory goddard space flight center ames research center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this
  the first flight of an airplane outside of the earth
