  i haven 't told many people this but
 in my head i 've got thousands of secret worlds all going on all at the same time i am also autistic 
 people tend to diagnose
  a whole variation as to what we 're like for instance my little brother he 's very severely autistic  he 's nonverbal  he can 't talk at all but i love to talk 
 people often
 associate autism with liking maths and science and nothing else but i know so many autistic people who love being creative 
  the stereotypes of things are often if not always wrong 
 for instance a lot of people think autism and think rain man immediately 
 that 's the common belief that every single autistic person is dustin hoffman and that 's not true  
 but that 's not just with autistic people either i 've seen it with lgbtq people with women with
  people are so afraid of variety
 that they try to fit everything into a tiny little box with really specific labels this is something that actually happened to me in real life  
 i googled autistic people are and it comes up with suggestions as to what you 're going to type  i googled autistic people
  the first thing that people think when they think autism they know 
 one of the things i can do because i 'm autistic it 's an ability rather than a disability
 is i 've got a very very vivid imagination
  let me explain it to you a bit it 's like i 'm walking in two worlds most of the time there 's the real world the world that we all share  
 and there 's the world in my mind and the world in my mind is often so much more real than the real world  
 like it
 's very easy for me to let my mind loose because i don 't try and fit myself into a tiny little box that 's one of the best things about being autistic you don 't have the urge to do that 
 you find what you want to do 
 you find a way to do it and you get on with it
  if i was trying to fit myself into a box i wouldn 't be here i wouldn 't have achieved half the things that i have now  there are problems though there are problems with being autistic  
 and there are problems with having too much imagination  school can be a problem in general but
 having also to explain to a teacher on a daily basis that their lesson is inexplicably dull
 and you are
 secretly taking refuge in a world inside your head in which you are not in that lesson 
 that adds to your list of problems 
 also when my imagination takes hold my body takes on a life of its own when something very
  happens in my inner world i 've just got to run i 've got to rock backwards and forwards or sometimes scream this gives me so much energy  and i 've got to have an outlet for all that energy  
 but i 've done that ever since i was a child ever since i was a tiny little girl and my parents thought it was cute so they didn 't bring it up but when i got into school they didn 't really agree that it was cute 
 it can be that people don 't want to be friends with the girl that starts screaming in an algebra lesson  and
 this doesn 't normally
  happen in this day and age
  but it can be that people don 't want to be friends with the autistic girl 
 it can be that people don 't want to associate with anyone who won 't or can 't fit themselves into a box that 's labeled normal  
 but that 's fine with me
  because it sorts the wheat from the chaff and i can find which people are genuine and true and i can pick these people as my friends 
 but
  think about it what is normal 
 what does it mean  imagine if that was the best compliment you ever received wow you are really normal but
 compliments are you are extraordinary or you step outside the box it 's you 're amazing so if people want
 be these things why are so many people striving to be normal why are people pouring their brilliant individual light
 into a mold people are so afraid of variety
 that they try and force everyone even people who don 't want to or can 't to become normal  
 there are camps for lgbtq people or autistic people to try and make them this normal 
 and that 's terrifying that people would do that in this day and age 
 all in all i wouldn 't trade my autism and
  my imagination for the world because i am autistic i 've presented documentaries to the bbc i 'm in the midst of writing a book i 'm
 doing this this is fantastic
 and one of the best things that i 've achieved that i consider to have achieved 
 is i 've found ways of communicating with my little brother and sister who as i 've said are nonverbal they can 't speak
 people would often write off someone who 's nonverbal  
 but that 's silly because my little brother and sister are the best siblings that you could ever hope for they 're just the best and i love them so much and i care about them more than anything else 
 i 'm going to leave you with one question if
 we can 't get inside the person 's minds no matter if they 're autistic or not instead of punishing anything that strays from normal
  not celebrate uniqueness and cheer every time someone unleashes their imagination thank you
