  what i 'm going to try and do in the next fifteen minutes or so is tell you about an idea of how we 're going to make matter come alive  
 now this may seem a bit ambitious  but when you look at yourself you look at your hands  
  realize that you 're alive  so this is a start 
 now this quest started four billion years ago on planet earth there 's been four billion years of organic biological life 
 and as an inorganic chemist my friends and colleagues make this distinction between the organic living world and the inorganic dead world 
 and what i 'm going to try and do is plant some ideas about how we can transform inorganic dead matter into living matter into inorganic biology
  before we do that i want to kind of put biology in its place  
 and i 'm absolutely enthralled by biology  i love to do synthetic biology i love things that are alive  i love manipulating the infrastructure of biology  
 but within that infrastructure we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from
  and evolution although it was established well over one hundred years ago by charles darwin
 and a vast number of other people evolution still is a little bit intangible 
 and when i talk about darwinian evolution i mean one thing and one thing only and that is survival of the fittest  
 and so forget about evolution in a kind of metaphysical way think about evolution in terms of offspring
 competing and some
  so bearing that in mind as a chemist i wanted to ask myself the question frustrated by biology  what is the minimal unit
 of matter that can undergo darwinian evolution  and this seems quite a profound question  and as a chemist we 're not used to profound questions every day  
 so when i thought about it 
 then suddenly i realized that biology gave us the answer
  and in fact the smallest unit of matter that can evolve independently is in fact a single cell a bacteria  
 so this raises three really important questions what is life is biology special biologists seem to think so 
 is matter evolvable  now if we answer those questions in reverse order the third question is matter evolvable  
 if we can answer that then we 're going to know how special biology is and maybe just maybe
  maybe we 'll have some idea of what life really is 
 so here 's some inorganic life this is a dead crystal and i 'm going to do something to it and it 's going to become alive  
 and you can see it 's kind of pollinating germinating growing 
 this is an inorganic tube  and all these crystals here under the microscope were dead a few minutes ago and they look alive  of course they 're not alive
  experiment where i 've made a crystal garden  but when i saw this i was really fascinated because it seemed lifelike and
 as i pause for a few seconds have a look at the screen  
 you can see there 's architecture growing  filling the void  
 and this is dead so i was positive that if somehow we can make things mimic life  let 's go one step further let 's see if we can actually make life
  but there 's a problem because
 up until maybe a decade ago we were told that life was impossible and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe in fact we were the only people in the universe  
 now that 's a bit boring  so as a chemist  i wanted to say hang on what is going on here is life
  this is really the question  
 i think that perhaps the emergence of the first cells was as probable as the emergence of the stars  and in fact let 's take that one step further  let 
  's say that if the physics of fusion is encoded into the universe maybe the physics of life is as well  
 and in a universe where carbon exists and organic biology  then we have all this wonderful diversity of life in fact  we have such amazing 
  lifeforms that we can manipulate we 're awfully careful in the lab to try and avoid various biohazards  
  a serious question if your pen
 could replicate that would be a bit of a problem  so we have to think differently if we 're going to make stuff come alive and we also have to be aware of the issues  
 but before we can make life let 's think for a second what life really is characterized by 
 and forgive the complicated diagram this is just a collection of pathways in the cell  
  and the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing synthetic biologists are manipulating it 
 chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease and you have all these pathways going on at the same time you have regulation  information is transcribed  catalysts 
  are made stuff is happening  but what does a cell do well it divides it competes it survives  and i think that is where we have to start in terms of thinking about building from our ideas in life  but what else is life
  characterized by well i like think of it as a flame in a bottle  
 and so what we have here is a description of single cells replicating  metabolizing burning through chemistries  and so we have to understand that if we 're going to make 
 artificial life or understand the origin of life we need to power it somehow 
  from and darwin himself mused in a letter to a colleague that he thought that life probably emerged in some warm little pond somewhere maybe not in scotland maybe in africa maybe somewhere else 
 but the real honest answer is we just don 't know  
 because there is a problem with the origin imagine way back four and a half billion years ago  
  vast chemical soup of stuff 
 and from this stuff we came  so when you think about the improbable nature of what i 'm going to tell you in the next few minutes just remember we came from stuff on planet earth  
 and we went through a variety of worlds the rna people would talk about the rna world  we somehow got to proteins and dna  we then got to the last ancestor 
 evolution kicked
  and that 's the cool bit and here we are 
 but there 's a roadblock that you can 't get past you can decode the genome you can look back you can link us all together by a mitochondrial dna  but we can 't get further than the last ancestor 
 the last
 visible cell that we could
 sequence or think back in history  so we don 't know
 how we got here  so there are two
  intelligent design direct and indirect so god or
 my friend  now
 talking about e t putting us there or some other life just pushes the problem further on i 'm not a politician i 'm a scientist 
 the other thing we need to think about is the emergence of chemical complexity this seems most likely  
 so we have some kind of primordial soup  and this one happens to be a good source of all twenty amino acids  and somehow
 these amino acids are combined and life begins  but life begins what does that mean what is life what is this stuff of life  
 so in the 
  did their fantastic chemical frankenstein experiment where they did the equivalent in the chemical world  they took the basic ingredients
  put them in a single jar and ignited them
 and put a lot of voltage through  and they had a look at what was in the soup  and they found amino acids  
 but nothing came out there was no cell  so the whole area 's been stuck for a while  
 and it got reignited in the ' 80s when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on 
 in my own laboratory the way we 're trying to create
 inorganic life is by using many different reaction formats  so what we 're trying to do is
  do reactions not in one flask but in tens of flasks and connect them together as you can see with this flow system all these pipes 
 we can do it microfluidically we can do it lithographically we can do it in a 3d printer we can do it in droplets for colleagues 
 and the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry just bubbling away  
 but
  going to end in failure  so we need to be a bit more focused 
 and the answer of course lies with mice this is how i remember what i need as a chemist i say well i want molecules 
 but i need a metabolism i need some energy  
 i need some information  and i need a container because if i want evolution i need containers to compete  
 so if you have a container
  it 's like getting
  this is my car  and i 'm going to drive around and show off my car and i imagine you have a similar thing in cellular biology with the emergence of life
 so these things together
 give us evolution perhaps  and the way to test it in the laboratory is to make it minimal  
 so what we 're going to try and do is come up with an inorganic lego kit of molecules and so forgive the molecules on the screen  but these are a
 simple kit there 's only maybe three or four different types of building blocks present and we can aggregate them together and make literally thousands and thousands of really big nano molecular molecules 
 the same size of dna and proteins  but there 's no carbon in sight carbon is banned  
  we need to make some containers and just a few months ago in my lab we were able to take these very same molecules and make cells with them and you can see on the screen a
 cell being made and we 're now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell  and all i wanted to show you is we can set up
 molecules in membranes in real cells and then it sets up a kind of molecular darwinism a molecular survival of the
  and this movie here shows this competition between molecules molecules are competing for stuff they
 're all made of the same stuff but they want their shape to win  
 they want their shape to persist  and that is the key 
 if we can somehow encourage these molecules to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete  they will start to form cells that will replicate and compete  
 if we manage to do that forget the molecular detail  let 's zoom out to what that could mean
 so we have this special theory of evolution that applies only to organic biology  to us 
 if we could get evolution into the material world then i propose we should have a general theory of evolution 
 and that 's really worth thinking about 
 does evolution control the sophistication of matter in the universe is there some driving force through evolution that allows matter to compete
  that means we could then start to develop different platforms
 for exploring this evolution so you imagine if we 're able to create a self sustaining artificial life form
 not only will this tell us about the origin of life that it 's possible that the universe doesn 't need carbon to be alive it can use anything
 we can then take [ it ] one step further and develop new technologies because we can then use software control for evolution
  to code in so imagine we make a little cell we want to put it out in the environment and we want it to be powered by the sun 
 what we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on  
 and we don 't use design anymore we find what works we should take our inspiration from biology  biology doesn 't care about the design unless it works
  so this will reorganize the way we design things 
 but not only just that we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology  
 wouldn 't it be great if you could take these artificial biological cells and fuse them with biological ones to correct problems that we couldn 't really deal with 
 the real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand
 everything  because it 's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution evolution cannot be cut apart
 you need to somehow find the fitness function  
 and the profound realization for me is that if this works the concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level  and we really start talking about selfish matter and
 what does that mean in a universe where we are right now the highest form of stuff you 're sitting on chairs
  they 're inanimate  they 're not alive  
 but you are made of stuff and you are using stuff  and you enslave stuff  so using evolution in in biology  and in inorganic biology  for 
  me is quite appealing quite exciting and we 're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive  
  five billion years ago we were not here and there was no life  
 so what will that tell us about the origin of life and the meaning of life  but perhaps for me as a chemist  i want to keep away from
 general terms i want to think about specifics so what does it mean about defining life  
 we really struggle to do this and i think if we can make inorganic biology  and we can make matter become evolvable
  that will in fact define life i propose to you that matter that can evolve is alive  
 and this gives us the idea of making evolvable matter  thank you very much
  millions of years to kick in we 're proposing to do it in just a few hours  once we 've set up the right
 chemistry ca and when do you think that will happen lc hopefully within the next two years ca 
 that would be a big story 
 in your own mind what do you believe the chances are that walking around on some other planet is
  i think it 's one hundred percent  because the thing is we are so chauvinistic to biology  if you take away carbon there 's other things that can happen 
 so the other thing that if we were able to create life that 's not based on carbon maybe we can tell nasa what really to look for don 't go and look for carbon go and look for evolvable stuff
