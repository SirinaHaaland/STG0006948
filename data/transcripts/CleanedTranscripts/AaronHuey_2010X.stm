  'm here today to show my photographs of the lakota many of you may have heard of the lakota or at least the larger group of tribes called the sioux  
 the lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their
  now called reservations 
 the pine ridge reservation  
 the subject of today 's slide show is located about seventy five miles southeast of the black hills in south dakota 
 it is sometimes referred to as prisoner of war camp number three hundred and thirty four and it is where the lakota now live 
 now if any of you have ever heard of aim  the american indian movement  or of
  or leonard peltier  or of the standoff at oglala then you know pine ridge is ground zero for native issues in the us 
 so i 've been asked to talk a little bit today about my relationship with the lakota  
 and that 's a very difficult one for me  because if you haven 't noticed from my skin color  i 'm white  
 and that is a huge barrier on a native reservation 
 you 'll see a lot of people in my photographs today  i 've become very close with them
  've welcomed me like family they 've called me brother and uncle and invited me again and again over five years  but on pine ridge i will always be what is called 
 is a lakota word that means non indian but another version of this word means the one who takes the best meat
  and that 's what i want to focus on the one who takes the best part of the meat it means greedy 
 so take a look around this auditorium today we are at a private school in the american west  sitting in red velvet chairs
 with money in our pockets  
 and if we look at our lives we have indeed taken the best part of the meat so let 's look today at a set of photographs
 of a people who lost so that we could gain
  gain  and know that when you see these people 's faces 
 that these are not just images of the lakota  they stand for all indigenous people 
 on this piece of paper is the history the way i learned it from my lakota friends and family  
 the following is a time line of treaties made treaties broken
 and massacres disguised
  as battles i 'll begin in 
 what is known as the bureau of indian affairs was created within the war department setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the native americans
 the first treaty of fort laramie was made  clearly marking the boundaries of the lakota nation  according to the treaty those lands are a sovereign nation  
 if the boundaries of this treaty had held and there is
  a legal basis that they should then this is what the us would look like today 
 ten years later  the homestead act signed by president lincoln  unleashed a flood of white settlers into native lands
 an uprising of santee sioux in minnesota ends with
  the largest mass execution in us history the execution was ordered by president lincoln  only two days
 after he signed the emancipation proclamation 
 the beginning of the transcontinental railroad a new era we appropriated land for trails and trains to shortcut through the heart of the lakota nation  the treaties were out the
  in response three tribes led by the lakota chief red cloud attacked and defeated the us army many times over i want to repeat that part the lakota defeat the us army one thousand 
 eight hundred and sixty eight the second fort laramie treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the great sioux nation and the lakotas ' ownership of the sacred black hills  
 the government also promises land and hunting rights in the surrounding states
  we promise that the powder river country will henceforth be closed to all whites 
 the treaty seemed to be a complete victory for red cloud and the sioux in fact this is the only war in american history
 in which the government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy 
 the transcontinental railroad was completed it began carrying among other things  large numbers of hunters who began the wholesale killing of buffalo
 eliminating a source of food clothing and shelter for the sioux 
 the indian appropriation act makes all indians wards of the federal government 
 in addition  the military issued orders forbidding western indians from leaving reservations 
 all western indians at that point in time were now prisoners of war
  we ended the time of treaty making the problem with treaties is they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations  and we can 't have that we had plans
 general george custer announced the discovery of gold in lakota territory  specifically the black hills  the news of gold creates a massive influx of white settlers into lakota nation  
 custer recommends that congress find a way to end the treaties with the lakota as soon as possible
  war begins over the violation of the fort laramie treaty
 on july 26th on its way to attack a lakota village  custer 's 7th cavalry was crushed at the battle of little big horn
 the great lakota warrior and chief named crazy horse surrendered at fort robinson he was later killed while in custody
 is also the year we found a way to get around the fort laramie treaties 
 a new agreement was presented to sioux chiefs and their leading men  under a campaign known as sell or starve sign the paper or no food for your tribe 
 only ten percent of the adult male population signed 
 the fort laramie treaty called for at least three quarters of the tribe to sign away land
  that clause was obviously ignored one thousand eight hundred and eighty seven the dawes act  communal ownership of reservation lands ends reservations are cut up into 
  sections  and distributed to individual indians with the surplus disposed of tribes lost millions of acres  
 the american dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was
  left the move destroyed the reservations  making it easier to further subdivide and to sell with every passing generation 
 most of the surplus land and many of the plots within reservation boundaries are now in the hands of white ranchers  
 once again the fat of the land goes to wasichu one thousand eight hundred
 and ninety
  a date i believe to be the most important in this slide show this is the year of the wounded knee massacre 
 on december twenty nine us troops surrounded a sioux encampment at wounded knee creek  and massacred chief big foot and three hundred prisoners of war 
 using a new rapid fire weapon that fired exploding shells called a hotchkiss gun 
 for this so called battle twenty congressional medals of honor for valor were given to the 7th cavalry 
 to this day
  day this is the most medals of honor
 ever awarded for a single battle  
 more medals of honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in world war one  world war two korea 
  vietnam  iraq or afghanistan 
 the wounded knee massacre is considered the end of the indian wars
 whenever i visit the site of the mass grave at wounded knee  
 i see it not just as a grave for the lakota or for the sioux  
 but as a grave for all indigenous peoples 
 the holy man black elk said i did not know then how much was ended 
 when i look back now from this high hill of my old age
  i can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch 
 as plain as when i saw them with eyes still young  
 and i can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard
 a people 's dream died there and it was a beautiful dream 
 with this event a new era in native american history began 
 everything can be measured before wounded knee and after because it was in
  with the fingers on the triggers of the hotchkiss guns that the us government openly declared its position on native rights 
 they were tired of treaties they were tired of sacred hills  they were tired of ghost dances  
 and they were tired of all the inconveniences of the sioux  so they brought out their cannons 
 you want to be an indian now they said  
  the us indian population reached its low point less than two hundred and fifty thousand  compared to an estimated eight million in
 was ruled upon by the us supreme court  
 the court determined that when the sioux were resettled onto reservations and seven million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders 
 the terms of the second fort laramie treaty had been violated  
 the court stated that the black hills were
  and that the initial offering price  plus interest should be paid to the sioux nation  
 as payment for the black hills  the court awarded only one hundred and six million dollars to the sioux nation  
 the sioux refused the money with the rallying cry the black hills are not for sale 
 statistics about native population today  more than a century after the massacre at wounded knee reveal the legacy of colonization  forced migration
 and treaty violations 
 unemployment on the pine ridge indian reservation fluctuates between eighty five and ninety percent  
 the housing office is unable to build new structures and existing structures are falling apart 
 many are homeless  and those with homes are packed into rotting buildings with up to five families
 percent of homes on pine ridge have no electricity at least sixty percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold 
 more than ninety percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line 
 the tuberculosis rate on pine ridge is approximately eight times higher than the us national average  
 the infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent and is about three times higher than the us national
  cervical cancer is five times higher than the us national average  the school dropout rate is up to seventy percent  
 teacher turnover is eight times higher than the us national average  frequently grandparents are raising their grandchildren
 because parents  due to alcoholism  domestic violence and general apathy  cannot raise them  
 fifty percent of the population over the age of forty suffers from diabetes  the life
  expectancy for men is between 
 and forty eight years old
 roughly the same as in afghanistan and somalia  
 the last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say 
 my god what are these people doing to themselves they 're killing each other
 they 're killing themselves while we watch them die 
 this is how we came to own these united states  this is the legacy of manifest destiny 
 prisoners are still born into prisoner of war camps  long after the guards are gone 
  these are the bones left after the best meat has been taken 
 a long time ago a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me by wasichu  
 eager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills  
 those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end as removed as we the dominant society may feel
 from a massacre
 in one thousand eight hundred and ninety  or a series of broken treaties one hundred and fifty years ago  i still have to ask you the question 
 how should you feel about the statistics of today 
 what is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that i just read to you 
 and how much of this history do you need to own even is any of this your responsibility today
 i have been told that there must be something we can do there must be some call to action  
 because for so long i 've been standing on the sidelines  content to be a witness just taking photographs 
 because the solutions seem so far in the past i needed nothing short of a time machine to access them  
 the suffering of indigenous peoples
  not
 a simple issue to fix it
 's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping haiti  or ending aids  or fighting a famine 
 the fix as it 's called may be much more difficult for the dominant society than say a $ fifty check
 or a church trip to paint some graffiti covered
  or a suburban family donating a box of clothes they don 't even want anymore  so where does that leave us shrugging our shoulders in the dark 
 the united states continues on a daily basis to violate the terms of the one thousand eight hundred and fifty one and one thousand eight hundred and sixty eight fort laramie treaties with the lakota  
 the call to action i offer today
 my ted wish is this honor the treaties
  give back the black hills it 's not your business what they do with them
