  i 'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values now it 's generally understood that that questions of morality
 questions of good and evil and right and wrong are questions about which science officially has no opinion it 's thought
  that science can can help us get what we value  but it can never tell us what we ought to value and consequently most people i think most people probably here
 think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life 
 questions like what is worth living for what is worth dying for what constitutes a good life 
  i 'm going to argue that this is an illusion that the separation between science and human values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history 
 now it 's often said that science cannot give us a foundation
 for morality and human values because science deals with facts and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres
 it 's often thought that there 's no description of the way the world is
 that can tell us how the world ought to be
 but i think this is quite clearly untrue values are a certain kind of fact
 they are facts about the well being of conscious creatures  why is it that we don 't have ethical obligations toward rocks why don
 't we feel compassion for rocks it 's because we don 't think rocks can suffer and if we 're more concerned about our fellow primates
 than we are about insects as
  indeed we are it 's because we think they 're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering  now  the crucial thing to
 notice here is that this is a factual claim 
 this is something that we could be right or wrong about and if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience
 well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects and there 's no
  notion no version
 of human morality and human values that i 've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience
 and its possible changes
 even if you get your values from religion even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death
  either to an eternity of happiness with god or an eternity of suffering in hell
 you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes  and to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim  
 which of course may or may not be true  
 now  to speak about the conditions of well being in this life for human beings we know that there is a continuum of such facts 
 we know that it 's possible to live in a failed state 
 where everything that can go wrong
  go wrong where  where mothers cannot feed their children 
 where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration where people are murdered indiscriminately  
 and we know that it 's possible to move along this continuum
 towards something quite a bit more idyllic to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable  and we know
 we know that there are right and wrong answers to
  how to move in this space  would
 adding cholera to the water
 be a good idea  
 probably not
 would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye  so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors  
 probably not there are
  truths to be known
 about how human communities flourish whether or not we understand these truths  and morality relates
 to these truths so in talking about values we are talking about facts now
 of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels from the level of the genome
 on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements  but if we 're going to talk about human well being we are of
  talking about the human brain because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain
 whatever happens after death even if
 the suicide bomber does get seventy two virgins
 in the afterlife in this life  his personality his rather unfortunate personality is the product of his brain
  so the contributions of culture if culture changes us as indeed it does it changes us by changing our brains
  and so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can at least in principle be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind neuroscience psychology etc
  so what i 'm arguing is that
 value 's reduced to facts to facts about the conscious experience of conscious
  we can therefore visualize a space
 of possible changes in the experience of these beings and
 i think of this as kind of a moral landscape with peaks and valleys that that correspond to differences in the well being of conscious creatures both personal and collective  
 and one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well being that we rarely access that few people access and these await our discovery  
 perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual
  perhaps there are other states that we can 't access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them
  now let me be clear about what i 'm not saying i 'm not saying
 that science is guaranteed to map this space or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question 
 i don 't think for instance that you will one day consult a supercomputer
 to learn whether you should have a second child or whether we should bomb iran 's nuclear facilities 
 or whether you can deduct the full cost of ted as a business expense 
 but if questions affect human well being then they do have answers whether or not we can find them and just admitting this
 just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish will change the way we talk about morality and will change our
  expectations of human cooperation in the future for instance  there are twenty one states in our country
 where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board  
 hard  and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin  
 and hundreds of thousands of children
  to this every year  the locations of these enlightened districts i think will fail to surprise you we 're not talking about connecticut 
 and the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious
  the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod lest we spoil the child
 this is in proverbs
  but we can ask the obvious question is it a good idea generally speaking 
 to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation
 as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and and good behavior 
 is there any doubt that this question has an answer  and that it matters
  now  many of you might worry that the notion of well being is truly undefined  and seemingly perpetually open to be 
 how therefore can there be an objective
 notion of well being well  consider by analogy  the concept of physical health  the concept of physical health is undefined as we just heard from michael
  it has changed over the years when this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably thirty  it 's now around eighty in the developed world 
 there may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that that not being able to run a marathon at age two hundred
 will be considered a profound disability people will send you donations when you 're in that condition 
  the fact that the concept of health is open genuinely open for revision does not make it vacuous
  the distinction between a healthy person and a dead one
 is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science
 another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape there may be equivalent ways to thrive
 there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize
  human flourishing now why wouldn 't this undermine
 an objective morality  well think of how we talk about food i would never be tempted to argue to you
 that there must be one right food to eat there is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food but there there 's nevertheless a clear distinction
  the fact that there are many right answers to the question what is food
 does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition 
 many people worry that that a universal morality morality would would require moral precepts that that admit of no exceptions so for instance if it 's really wrong to lie
  it must always be wrong to lie  and if if you can find an exception well then there 's no such thing as moral truth
  why would we think this  
 consider by analogy  the game of chess now  if you 're going to play good chess a principle like don 't lose your queen is very good to follow
 but it clearly admits some exceptions there are moments when losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do there are moments when it is the only good thing you can do 
 and yet chess is a domain of perfect
  the fact that there are exceptions here does not does not change that at all now this brings us
 to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere
  consider the great problem of women 's bodies  what to do about them  
 well this is one thing you can do about them you can cover them up now it is the position generally speaking of our
  intellectual community that
 while we may not like this we might think of this as wrong in boston or palo alto who are we to say
 that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags and who are we to say even that they 're wrong
 beat them with lengths of steel cable or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way 
 well who are we not to say this
 who are we to pretend
 that we know so little
 about human well being that we have to be non judgmental about a practice like this i 'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil
 women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as i 'm concerned but what does voluntary mean in a community
 where when a girl gets raped  
 her father 's first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame
  just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute 
 your daughter gets raped
  and what you want to do is kill her
 what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing  
 now  to say this is not to say that we have got the the perfect solution
 in our own society for instance this is what it 's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized
  world now granted for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images 
 but
 if we are in a reflective mood we can ask is this the perfect expression
 of psychological balance with respect to variables like
  is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children  probably not ok so perhaps there 's some place on the spectrum
 between these two extremes that represents a place of of better balance 
 applause perhaps there are many such places again  given other changes in human culture there may be many
  peaks on the moral landscape  but the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak 
 now the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me
 and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions
 are religious demagogues of one form or another and of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind
 not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of of human and animal well being 
 in fact the endurance of religion as a as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated
 most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering
  this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage
 and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation
 or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue  
 but the demagogues are right about one thing we need a universal conception of human values 
 now what stands in the way of this well one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality
  when talking about morality we value differences of opinion
 in a way that we don 't in any other area of our lives so for instance
 the dalai lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion  and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness 
 on the other hand we have someone like ted bundy ted bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women
 so  we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one 's time
 most western intellectuals
 look at this situation and say well there 's nothing for the dalai lama to be really right about really right about or for ted bundy to be really wrong about
 that admits of a
 of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview
  's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other 
 notice that we don 't do this in science on the left you have edward witten  he 's a string theorist  
 if you ask the smartest physicists around
 who is the smartest physicist around in my experience half of them will say ed witten  the other half will tell you they don 't like the question
 laughter so  what would happen if i showed up at a physics conference
 and said string theory is bogus it
 doesn 't resonate with me it 's not how i chose to view the universe at a small scale  i 'm not a fan well
 nothing would happen because i 'm not a physicist i don 't understand string theory i 'm the ted bundy of string theory
  i wouldn 't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member  but this is just the point whenever we are talking about facts
 certain opinions must be excluded that is what it is to have a domain of expertise that is what it is for knowledge to count  
 how have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise  or moral talent
 or moral genius even how have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count  
 how have we convinced ourselves that that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering 
 does the taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering
  how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well being 
 applause so this i think is what the world needs now  
 it needs people like ourselves
 to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing  and morality relates
  to that domain of facts it is possible
 for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things 
 which is to say that it 's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering  
 just admitting this will transform
  in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they will one day mean nothing 
 we live in a world filled with destructive technology  and this technology cannot be uninvented  it will always be easier to break things than to fix them
 it seems to me therefore patently obvious that we can no more
  than we can respect or tolerate vast differences
 in the notions about how disease spreads or in the in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes  we simply must converge
 on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life  and to do
  we have to admit that these questions have answers  thank you very much
  whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world hearing some of this may well be doing the 
 language seems to be really important here when you 're talking about the veil you 're talking about women dressed in cloth bags
  i 've lived in the muslim world spoken with a lot of muslim women and some of them would say something else they would say no you know this is a celebration of
 female specialness it helps build that and it 's a result of the fact that 
 and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view that male lust is not to be trusted i mean can you engage in a conversation with that kind of
  i tried to broach this in a sentence  watching the clock ticking  but the
 the question is what is voluntary in a context
 where men have certain expectations and you 're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way
 if you don 't veil yourself and so if anyone in this room wanted to
  i think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want but we have to be honest
 about the constraints that these women are placed under and so i think we shouldn 't be so eager to always take their word for it especially when it 's one hundred and twenty degrees out and you 're wearing a full burqa ca 
 a lot of people want to believe in this this concept of moral
  but can you reconcile that i think i understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a with a world that doesn 't become one dimensional where we all have to think the same  paint your picture of what
 rolling the the clock fifty years forward one hundred years forward  how you would like to think of the world balancing moral progress with
 richness sh well i think
 once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some
 important detail then you have to admit that that
 we are going to understand all of the positive and negative
 qualities of ourselves in much greater detail so we 're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion  
 and we 're going to understand the factors that encourage it whether they 're genetic whether they 're
 how people talk to one another whether they 're economic systems and insofar as we begin to shine
  light on that we are inevitably going to converge on on that fact space  so everything is not going to be up for grabs it 's not going to be like
 veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as as
 teaching her to to be confident and and well educated in the context of men who do desire women
  nsf grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea but at a certain point
 we 're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually
 interrogate them do people love their daughters just as much in these in these systems and i think i think there are clearly right answers
  and if the results come out that actually they do are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues sh 
 well yeah  modulo one obvious fact that you can love someone
 in the context of a truly delusional belief system so you can say like because i i knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend i chopped his head off and that was the most compassionate thing i could do if
  yes i think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love but again then we have to talk about well being in a larger context
 it 's all of us in this together not one
 man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus ca sam
 this is a conversation i would actually love to continue for hours  we don 't have that but maybe another time thank you
