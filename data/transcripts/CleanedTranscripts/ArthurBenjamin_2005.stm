  ladies and gentlemen my name is art benjamin and i am a mathemagician 
 what that means is i combine my loves of math and magic to do something i call mathemagics but before i get started i have a quick question for the audience by any chance did anyone happen to bring
  with them this morning a calculator  
 seriously if you have a calculator with you raise your hand  raise your hand did your hand go up now bring bring it out bring it out anybody else
  i see i see one way in the back you sir  that 's three  and anybody on this side here  
 ok over there on the aisle would the four of you please bring out your calculators then join me up on stage let 's give
  nice round of applause that 's right 
 now since i haven 't had the chance to work with these calculators i need to make sure that they are all working properly would somebody get us started by giving us a
 thirty four or the calculators are not working do all of you get one thousand and thirty four one thousand and thirty four volunteer no ab 
 five hundred and ninety four let 's give three of them a nice round of applause there 
 would you like to try a more standard calculator just in case ok great what i 'm going to try and do then i notice it took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer that 's ok i
 'll give you a shortcut for multiplying
 even faster on the calculator 
 there is something called the square of a number which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself for instance five squared would be audience twenty five
 ab twenty five the way we can square on most calculators let me demonstrate with this one is by taking the number such as five  hitting times and then equals
  and on most calculators that will give you the square on some of these ancient rpn calculators you 've got an x squared button on it will allow you to do the calculation even faster what i 'm going to try and do now is to square in my head
  numbers faster than they can do on their calculators even using the shortcut method what i 'll use is the second row this time and i 'll get four of you 
 to each yell out a two digit number and if you would square the first number and if you would square the second the third
  and the fourth i will try and race you to the answer ok so quickly a
  let me try to take this one step further i 'm going to try to square some three digit numbers this time  i won 't even write these down i 'll just call them out as they 're called out to me anyone i point to call out a three digit number
  anyone on our panel verify the answer just give some indication if it 's right a
  's a harder one is that five hundred and thirteen thousand two hundred
  let me try to take this one step further 
 i 'm going to try to square a four digit number this time you can all take your time on this i will not beat you to the answer on this one  but i will try to get the answer right to make this a little bit more
  random let 's take the fourth row this time let 's say one two three four if each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine that will be the four digit number that i 'll square 
 nine  seven  five eight nine thousand seven hundred and fifty eight this will take me a little bit of time so bear with me
  i would attempt to square a five digit number and i can but unfortunately most calculators
  talk to you later in the meanwhile let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier  let 's take the largest
  would you each enter that on your calculator  and instead of squaring it this time i want you to take that number and multiply it by any three digit number that you want but don 't tell me what you 're multiplying by just multiply it by any random three digit number  
 so you should have as an answer either a six digit or probably a seven digit number
 how many digits do you have six or seven 
  then i shall attempt the impossible or at least the improbable  
 what i 'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits any six of them in any order
  one digit at a time  i shall try and determine the digit you 've left out starting with your seven digit number call out any six of them please
  did you leave out the number six same as she did ok  you 've got a seven digit number call out any six of them loud and clear volunteer zero seven nine zero four 
 four i think you left out the number three ab 
 that 's three  the odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in ten thousand ten to the fourth power  ok
  you leave out the number seven  and let 's give all four of these people a nice round of applause  thank you very much
  i have one more question for the audience  by any chance does anybody here happen to know
 the day of the week that they were born on if you think you know your birth day  raise your hand let 's see  starting with let 's
 start with a gentleman first   what year was it first of all that 's
  and the month  october what  fifth was that a wednesday yes i 'll go way to the back right now how about you  yell it out what year
  anybody here who 'd like to know the day of the week they were born we can do it that way
  i could just make up an answer and you wouldn 't know so i come prepared for that i brought with me a book of calendars it
 goes as far back into the past as one thousand eight hundred because you never know 
 i didn 't mean to look at you sir you were just
 sitting there anyway chris you can help me out here if you wouldn 't mind this is a book of
  as long as you have that book in front of you do me a favor turn to a year outside
  be a much greater challenge for me ab what year would you like
  now by
 alluding to something
 from earlier in the presentation there was a gentleman up here who had a 10 digit calculator where is he would you stand up 
 10 digit guy
  ok  stand up for me just for a second  so i can see where you are   
  what i 'm going to try and do is to square in my head a five digit number requiring a 10 digit calculator  but to make my job more interesting for you 
 as well as for me i 'm going to do this problem thinking out loud 
  i have to apologize to our magician friend lennart green i know as a magician we 're not supposed to reveal our secrets but i 'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week
  let me explain to you how i 'm going to attempt this problem i 'm going to break the problem down into three
  parts i 'll do fifty seven thousand squared  plus six hundred and eighty three squared  
 plus fifty seven thousand times six hundred and eighty three times two  
 add all those numbers together and with any luck arrive at the answer now let me recap
  while i do these calculations you might hear certain words as opposed to numbers creep into the calculation let me explain what that is this is a phonetic 
 code a mnemonic device that i use that allows me to convert numbers into words i store them as words and later on retrieve them as numbers i know
  sounds complicated it 's not i don 't want you to think you 're seeing something out of rain man 
 there 's definitely a method to my madness definitely definitely  sorry if you
 want to talk to me about adhd afterwards you can talk to me then by the way  one last
  for my judges with the calculators you know who you are there is at least a fifty percent chance that i will make a mistake here if i do don 
  't tell me what the mistake is just say you 're close or something like that and i 'll try and figure out the answer which
  so  without any more stalling here we go i 'll start the problem in the middle
  but i see a carry coming
  that 's seven hundred times six hundred and sixty six plus seventeen squared is four hundred and sixty six thousand four hundred and eighty nine rev up if i need it rev up take the four
