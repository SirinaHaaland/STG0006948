  the news does not look good this is him on the screen
 he 'd just been diagnosed with als which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years  
 it paralyzes you it starts by killing the motor neurons in your spinal cord
  you go from being a healthy  
 robust 29 year old male to someone that cannot breathe  
 cannot move cannot speak  
 this has actually been 
 to me a gift because we began a journey to learn a
 new way of thinking about life and even though steven
  away three years ago
 we had an amazing journey as a family we did not even
 i
 think adversity is not even the right word we looked at this and we said we 're going to to do something with this in an incredibly positive way and i want to talk today
 about one of the things that we decided to do which was to
  think about a new way of approaching healthcare because as we all know here today it doesn 't work very well  
 i want to talk about it in the context of a story  this is the story of my brother 
 but it 's just a story and i want to go beyond the story and go to something more 
 given my status what is the best outcome i can hope to achieve  and how do i get there is what we are here to do in medicine is what everyone should do and those questions all have variables to them all of our statuses are different
  all of our hopes and dreams  what we want to accomplish is different and our paths will be different they are all stories
  but it 's a story until we convert it to data and so what we do this concept we had was to take steven 's status what is my status and go from
 this concept of walking
 breathing  and then his hands speak
  and ultimately happiness and function 
 so the first set of pathologies they end up in the stick man on his icon  
 but the rest of them are really what 's important here  because steven despite the fact that he was paralyzed as he was in that pool he could not walk 
 he could not use his arms that 's why he had the little floaty things on them did you see those 
 he was happy we were at the beach he was raising his son
  and he was productive  and we took this and we converted it into data
 but it 's not a data point at that one moment in time it is a data point of steven in a context here he is in the pool  but here he is healthy as a builder taller stronger  got all the women amazing guy 
 here he is walking down the aisle but he can barely walk now  so it 's impaired  and he could still hold his wife 's hand but he couldn 't do buttons on his clothes can 't feed
  and here he is paralyzed completely unable to breathe and move over this time journey these stories of his life converted to data he renovated my carriage house
 when he was completely paralyzed and unable to speak and unable to breathe and he won an award for a historic restoration 
 so here 's steven alone sharing this story in the world and this is the insight  the thing that we are excited about because
 we have gone away from the community that we are the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other 
 we need to give to others to be successful so steven is sharing this story  
 but he is not alone  
 there are so many other people sharing their stories not stories in words but stories in data and words  and we convert that information into this structure this understanding 
 this ability to convert those stories into something that is computable to which we can begin to change the way medicine is done and delivered
 we did this for als we can do this for depression parkinson 's disease hiv these are not simple they are not internet scalable they require thought and processes to find the meaningful information about the disease  
 so this is what it looks like when you go to the website  and i 'm going to show you what patients like me  the company that myself my youngest brother and a good friend from mit
  here are the actual patients there are forty five thousand of them now sharing their stories as data here is an m s patient 
 his name is mike  and he is uniformly impaired on cognition vision walking sensation 
 those are things that are different for each m s patient each of them can have a different characteristic  you can see fibromyalgia  hiv als depression 
 look at this hiv patient down here zinny it 's two years of this disease all of the symptoms are not there but he is working to keep his
  count high and his viral level low so he can make his life better  but you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments look at this two thousand people almost on copaxone these are patients currently on drugs sharing data  
 i love some of these physical exercise prayer anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study on prayer against something let 's
 's look at prayer what i love about this just sort of interesting design problems 
 these are why people pray 
 here is the schedule of how frequently they it 's a dose so anyone want to see the thirty two patients that pray for sixty minutes a day and see if they 're doing better they probably are here they are
 it 's an open network  everybody is sharing we can see it all or
 i want to look at anxiety  because people are praying for anxiety and here is data on fifteen thousand people 's current anxiety right now  
 how they treat it
  the drugs  the components of it  their side effects all of it in a rich environment  and you can drill down and see the individuals this amazing data
 allows us to drill down and see what this drug is for one thousand five hundred people on this drug i think yes  
 i want to talk to the fifty eight patients down here who are taking four milligrams a day and
  to the ones of those that have been doing it for more than two years 
 so you can see the duration all open all available i 'm
 going to log in 
 and this is my brother 's profile 
 and this is a new version of our platform we 're launching right now this is the second generation it 's going to be in flash and you can see here as this animates over steven 's
  data against the background of all other patients against this information the blue band is the 50th percentile steven is the 75th percentile that he 
 you scroll down in this profile and you can see all of his prescription drugs  but more than that in the new version i can look at this interactively wait poor spinal capacity doesn 't this remind you of a great
  if the technology we used to take care of ourselves was as good as the technology we use to make money  
 detrol in the side effects for his drug integrated into that the stem cell transplant that he had the first in the world shared openly for anyone who wants to see it  
 i love here the cyberkinetics implant  which was 
 again the only patient 's data that was online and available  you can adjust the time scale you can adjust the symptoms you can look at the interaction
 between how i treat my als so you click down on the als tab there
 i 'm taking three drugs to manage it some of them are experimental i can look at my constipation how to manage it  i can see magnesium citrate and the side effects from that drug all integrated in the time in which they 're meaningful 
 but i want more  i don 't want to just look at this cool device  i want to take this data and make something even better i want my brother 's center of the universe and his symptoms
 and his drugs
  things that interact among those the side effects to be in this beautiful data galaxy that we can look at in any way we want to understand it so that we can take this information and go beyond
 just this simple model of what
 a record is i don 't even know what a medical record is i want to solve a problem i want an application so can i take this data rearrange yourself  put the symptoms in the left
  the drugs across the top tell me everything we know about steven and everyone else and what interacts
 years after he 's had these drugs  i learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva  including some positive side effects that came from other drugs 
 were making his constipation worse and if anyone 's ever had severe constipation and you don 't understand how much of an impact that has on your life yes that was a pun
 you 're trying to manage
  these and this grid is available here and we want to understand it  
 no one 's ever had this kind of information  
 so  patients have this we 're for patients this is all about patient health care there was no doctors on our network this is about the patients so how can we take this and bring them a tool that they can go back and they can engage the medical system  
 and we worked hard and we thought about it and we said what 's something we can use all all the time that we can
  in the medical care system that everyone will understand 
 so the patients print it out  because hospitals usually block us because they believe we are a social network it
 's actually the most used feature on the website  doctors actually love this sheet and they 're actually really engaged so we went from this story
 of steven and his history to data and then back to paper where we went back and engaged the medical care system and here 's another paper
 this is a journal
 it 's the proceedings of the national academy of science of the united states of america you 've seen multiple of these today when everyone 's bragging about the amazing things they 've done  this is a report about a drug called lithium
 lithium that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder that a group in italy found slowed als down in sixteen patients and published it
  skip the critiques of the paper  
 but the short story is if you 're a patient you want to be on the blue line  you don 't want to be on the red line you want to be on the blue line because the blue line is a better line the red line is way downhill the blue line is a good line  
 so  you know we said
 we looked at this and what i love also is that people always accuse these internet sites of of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly so this is what happened when
 pnas published this ten percent
  the people in our system took lithium  ten percent of the patients started taking lithium based on sixteen patients of data in a bad publication  
 and they call the internet irresponsible 
 here 's the implication of what happens there 's this one guy  named humberto from brazil who unfortunately passed away nine months ago  
 who said hey listen can you help us answer this question because i don 't want to wait for the next trial it 's going to be years i want to know now can you help us so we launched some tools  we let them track their blood levels we let them share the data and exchange it
  network  
 and they said you know 
 jamie plm can you guys tell us whether this works or not and we went around and we talked to people and they said you can 't run a clinical trial like this you know  you don 't have the blinding you don 't have data it doesn 't follow the scientific method it 's never going to work you can 't do it
  it works in humberto  i bought a mac about two years ago i converted over and i was so excited about this new feature of the time machine that came in leopard and we said
 because it 's really cool you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer and find everything you 've lost and i loved it and i said what if we built a time machine for patients  except instead of going backwards we go forwards
 can we find out what 's going to happen to you so that you can maybe change it
  so we did we took all the patients like humberto that 's the apple background we stole that because we didn 't have time to build our own this
 is a real app by the way this is not just graphics and you take those data and we find the patients like him and we bring their data together  and we bring their histories into it and then we say 
 well how do we line them all up so we line them all up so they go together around the meaningful points integrated across everything we know about the patient full information
  the entire course of their disease  and that 's what is going to happen to humberto  unless he does something  and he took lithium  
 and he went down the line  and it works almost every time now the ones that it doesn 't work are interesting but almost all the time it works it 's
 actually scary it 's beautiful  
 so  we couldn 't run a clinical trial we couldn 't figure it out but we could see whether it was going to work for
  clinicians in the audience will talk about power and all the standard deviation we 'll do that later but
 here is the answer
 of the mean of the patients that actually decided to take
 lithium these are all the patients that started lithium it 's the intent to treat curve  you can see here the blue dots on the top the light ones those are the people in
  that you wanted to be on and the red ones are the ones the pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn 't want to be and the ones in the middle are all of our patients from the start of lithium at time zero 
 going forward  
 and then going backward so you can see we matched them perfectly  perfectly  terrifyingly accurate matching and going forward
 you  actually don 't want to be a lithium patient this time you 're actually doing slightly worse not significantly
  a lot of people dropped out the trial there is too much drop out can we do the even harder thing can we go to the patients that actually
 decided to stay on lithium because they were so convinced they were getting better we asked our control algorithm are those sixty nine patients by the way you 'll notice that 's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial
 can we look at those patients and say can we match them with our time machine to the other
  patients that are just like them  
 and what happens 
 even the ones that believed they were getting better matched the controls exactly  
 exactly  those little lines that 's the power so we i can 't tell you lithium doesn 't work i can 't tell you that if you did it at a higher dose or if you run the study proper i can tell you
 that for those sixty nine people that took lithium they didn 't do any better than the people that were just like them just like me
  and that we had the power to detect that at about a quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study we did that one year ahead of the time when the first clinical trial funded by the nih for millions of dollars failed for futility last week  
 and announced it so
 remember i told you about my brother 's stem cell transplant i never really knew whether it worked and i put one hundred million
  cells in his cisterna magna in his lumbar cord and
 filled out the  irbs and did all this work and i never really knew
 how did i not know i mean  i didn 't know what was going to happen to him  i actually asked tim
 who is the quant in our group we actually searched for about a year to find someone who could do the sort of math and statistics and modeling in
  couldn 't find anybody 
 so we went to the finance industry and there are these guys who used to model the future of interest rates and all that kind of stuff and some of them were available 
 so we hired one 
 we hired them set them up assisting at lab i i m him things that 's the way i communicate with him is like a little guy in a box 
  can you tell me whether my brother 's stem cell transplant worked or not and he sent me this two
  guy that lived a long time we have to go talk to him  because i 'd like to know what happened because something went different  but
 my brother didn 't my brother went straight down the line  it only works about twelve months it 's the first version of the time machine first time we ever tried it we 'll try to get it better later but
 twelve months so far  and you
 know i look at this
  i get really emotional you look at the patients  you can drill in all the controls you can look at them you can ask them and i found a woman that had
 we found her she was odd because she had data after she died  and
 her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores  because he knew how much she cared  and i am thankful
  help us answer this question
