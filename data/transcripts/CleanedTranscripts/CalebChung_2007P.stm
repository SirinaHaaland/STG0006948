  or kind of am a toy designer  and before i was a toy designer  oh  i was
 a mime a street mime actually  and then i was an entertainer
 i guess and before that i was a silversmith and before that i was
 i was out of the house at about fifteen and a half and i
 never wound up going into college i didn 't really i didn 't see the point at the time i do now 
 after learning about all the quantum stuff laughter
 it 's really cool anyway  i wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design at least from my small aperture of the
  this is a video i made when i first started
 doing toy design i 'm in my garage making weird stuff and then you go to these toy companies
 and there 's some guy across the table and he goes pass pass pass you know you think it 's so cool but they
 anyway i made this little tape that i 'd always show when i go in this is the name of my
 company giving toys  
 so i used to work at mattel actually  and after i left mattel i started all these hamburger makers
 so this is a hamburger maker that you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there and it makes and this is a french fry maker little tiny food you can eat
  she 's beautiful this is how they looked when they came out at the end these are a this is like a fifteen million dollar line and it got me through some
  squishy head for no apparent reason  this is some effects that i did for wig rattle and roll that was a robot eye thing
 controlling it in the back that paid the rent for about a month this is a walking barbie i
  i 'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin it 's how they
  animator i thought this would be so great and you know lego
 don 't take legos to lego  that 's the answer  they know everything about it 
 then i started doing animatronics i loved dinosaurs i used to be in the film business kind of  and actually nicholas negroponte saw this when i was like twelve and
 anyway so then they said no you have to make two and they have to fight
  my first saw blade launcher and we had
  this is a i used to kind of be an actor and i 'm really not very good at it but the this is a guy named  dr yatz who would take toys apart and show
  and you can see the massively parallel processing nintendos there  and over to the left is a view master of the cd rom and a guy named stan reznikov did this as a
  that 's all i wanted to say there i love toys  ok so so that was a that was the first kind of  a
 that was the first batch of products  most of them did not go you get one out of twenty one out of thirty products and every now and then we do something like
  you know  an automated hair wrap machine you know that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out and and we 'd make some money on that you know and we 'd give it out but eventually
 we left l a and we moved to idaho where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet and i started working on this project
  with innovation and art and science there 's some kind of a blend that happens that allows  
 you know  to find innovation and i tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol that that means something to me anyway  
 and so art and science have a kind of dynamic balance that 's where i think innovation happens and actually this is to me how i can come up with great ideas but it 's not how you actually get leverage actually you have to put a circle around that and call
  business and those three together i think give you leverage in the world but moving on  so 
 this is a quick tale i 'm going to tell this is the furby tale
  as he said i was co inventor of the furby i did the body and creature well you 'll see  so by way of showing you this you can kind of get an understanding of of
 what it is to hopefully try to create
 robotic life forms or technology that
 has an emotional connection with the user  
 so this is my family  
 this is my wife christi and abby and melissa and my 17 year old now emily  who was just a pack of trouble all right there 's that robot again i came out of the movie business as i said  and i said let 's make these animatronic robots  let 's make these things 
 and so i
  had a big interest in this this one actually didn 't go anywhere but i got my feet wet doing this this is a smaller one and i have a little moving torso on there a little tiny guy walks along more servo drives 
  lots of servo hacking lots of mechanical stuff there 's another one he actually has skeletor legs i think he 's wearing  there oh this is a little pony little pony very cute little thing the point of showing these is i 've always been interested in little artificial life pieces 
 dinosaur with with kind of bloat wear and you know they had lots just
 lots of stuff in there that you didn 't need i thought and then microsoft can just fill a 
 you know a warehouse full of this stuff and see if they sell so it 's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company but anyway  a friend of mine and i dave hampton decided to see if we could
  what 's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form and that 's our little thirty cent mabuchi motor  and so i have all these design books like i 'm sure many of you have and throughout the books this is the first page on furby
 i have kind of the art and science i have the the why over here and the how over there i try to do a lot of philosophy a lot of thinking about all of these projects because they 're not just bing ideas you have to really dig deep
 in these things so there
  over here and getting the idea of different kind of drives things like that and originally furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom and then we said well you 're going to feed him and he needs to talk and it got more complicated 
 and then i had to figure out how i 'm going to use that one motor to make the eyes move and the ears move  and the body to move and the mouth to move and you know i want to make it blink and and do all that at the same time well i came up with this kind of
  my note to self at the top lots of engineering so
 that turned out to be a little more than true there 's my first exploded view and all the little pieces and the little worm drive and all that stuff 
 and then i 've
 got to start building it so this is the real thing i get up and start cutting my finger and and gluing things together and that 's my little workshop and there 's the first little cam that drove furby  and there 's furby on the half shell you can see the little
 little bb in the box is my tilt sensor i
  basically gnawed all this stuff out of out of plastic
  so there 's the back of his head with a billion holes in it  and there i am i 'm done there 's my little furby no 
 it 's a little robot on heroin or something i think so
 right now you see i love little robots so my wife says well you may like it but nobody else will so she comes to the rescue this is my wife christi who is just you know my muse and my
 partner for eternity
  here and she does drawings right she 's an actual  you know artist and she starts doing all these different drawings and does
 color patterns and coloring books and i like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there he
 didn 't test so well but i like him and then she started doing these other images at that time beanie babies was a big hit and we thought we 'll do a bunch of different ones 
 so here 's a little pink one a little pouf on his head and here 's this didn 't do so well in testing either
  favorite demon furby that was a good one  
 anyway finally settled on kind of this kind of a look little poufy body a little imaginary character  and there he is a little bush baby on caught in the headlights there i actually went to toys r us got a little furry cat ripped it apart and made this 
 and since then every time i come home from toys r us with with dolls or something they disappear from my desk and they get
  have three girls and they just they it 's like a rescue animal thing they 're going there so
 a little tether coming off it 's just a control for the for the fur 's mouth and his eyes it 's just a little server control and i made a little video
  we 're going to hire you guys to do this and so dave and i got working mostly me because it was all mechanics at this point so now i have to really
 figure out all kinds of stuff i don 't know how to do  and i started working with solid works and a whole other group to do that and we started this was way back before there was really much sla going on not a lot of rapid prototyping we certainly didn 't have the money to do this  
  a little bit of money to do this so i had to call a friend of a friend who who was running the gm prototype plant sla plant that was down and they said yeah well we 'll run them so they ran all the shells for us which was nice of them 
 and the cams i got cut at hewlett packard we snuck in on the weekend and so we just had a disc of of the files  but they have a closed system so you couldn 't print the things out on the machine so we actually printed 
  them out on on clear and taped them on the monitors and on the weekend we we ran the parts for that so this is how they come out close to the end  and then they looked like little garfields there
  months later you may remember this  this was a
 total total total chaos for a while they were making two million furbys a month they actually wound up doing about forty million furbys i it 's unbelievable how i don 't know how that can be 
 and hasbro made about you know a billion and a half dollars and i just a little bit on each one  
 so
 full circle why do i do this  why do you you know try to do this stuff and it 's of course for your kids
  's my youngest daughter with with her furbys and she still actually has those  so i kind of retired and we 're already living in paradise up up in boise on a river you know so
  and then i started another company called toy innovation and we did some projects with
 mattel with actually with a lady who 's here ivy ross and we did miracle moves baby made it in wired magazine did a bunch of other stuff and then i started
  but really i kind of slowed down and said ok  i just  after a while i had this old tape of this dinosaur and i gave it to this guy and
 this other guy saw it and then then people started to want to do it and they said they 'd spend all this time so i said ok let 's try to do this dinosaur project the crazy idea is we 're going to try 
  to clone a dinosaur as much as we can with today 's technology and it 's not really but as
  close as we can do and we 're going to try to really
 pull this off  intentfully try to make something that seems like it 's alive not a robot that kind of does but let 's really go for it 
 so i picked a camarasaurus because the camarasaurus was the most abundant of the of the sauropods in north america and you could actually find full fossil evidence of these 
  and so we actually went in there 's a book called walking on eggshells where they found actual sauropod skin in patagonia and the picture from the book so when i i told the sculptor to use this bump pattern whatever you can 
 to copy that very very obsessive there 's a kind of truncated camarasaurus skeleton but the geometry 's correct  and then i went in and measured all the geometry because i figured hey biomimicry if i 
  do it kind of right it might move kind of like the real thing  so there 's the motor and about this time you know all these other people are starting to help here 's an example of
  we did with the skull there 's the skull
 there 's my drawing of a skull there 's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue  there 's the mechanism that would go in there kind of a geneva drive there 's some solid works versions of it here 's some sla
  parts of the same thing and then  these are really crude pieces we were just doing some tests here  there 's the skull pretty much the same shape as as the camarasaurus there 's a
  view  there 's the first sla version and it already kind of has the feel it has kind of a cuteness already 
 and the thing about blending science and art in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot and then you go back and do the
 the shape and then you go back and forth the servos in the front legs we had to shape those like muscles they had to fit within the envelope there was a
 tremendous amount of work to get all that working right all the neck and the tail are cable so it moves smoothly and organically  and then of course
  done yet you have to get the look for the skin the skin 's a whole another thing probably the hardest part so you hire artists and you try to get the look and feel of the character now this is not we 're character designers right  and we 're still trying to keep with the with the real character so 
 now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay now you start doing the sculpture for this and you can see we got a guy from who 's just
 a fanatic about dinosaurs to do the sculpting for us down to the spoon shaped teeth and everything
  then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then more sculpting  and then  four years and ten million dollars later we have a little pleo  john do you want to bring him up
