  a few more jumps and i 'll be
  picture aunt zip at one hundred and five years old in sodom north carolina i 'd go up and learn these old songs from her  
 she couldn 't sing much couldn 't play anymore and i 'd pull her out on the front porch

  santa barbara in the college of creative studies  taking majors in biology and art  he came to the campus this was in one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight 
 i guess it was  and he played his bluegrass style of music but near the end of the concert he played the old timing style of banjo picking that came from africa along with the banjo
 that he had learned from his mother and grandmother  i fell in love with that i went up to him and said how can i learn that he said well you can go back to clinch mountain where i 'm from or
 asheville or mount airy north carolina some place that has a lot of music because there 's a lot of old people
 still living that play that old style  so i went back that very summer  i just fell in love with the culture
  i came back to school i finished my degrees and told my parents i wanted to be a banjo player  you can imagine how excited they were  so i thought
 i would just like to show you some of the pictures i 've taken of some of my mentors just a few of them but maybe you 'll get just a little hint of some of these folks and play a little
 banjo

  those last few pictures were of ray hicks who just passed away last year he was one of the great
 american folk tale tellers the old jack tales that he had learned he talked like this you could
 hardly understand him  but it was really wonderful and he lived in that house that his 
  had built no running water  no electricity a wonderful wonderful guy  and you can look at more pictures i 've actually got a website that 's got a bunch of photos
 that i 've done of some of the other folks i didn 't get a chance to show you  
 this instrument came up in those pictures it 's called the mouth bow 
 it is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world and still played in the southern mountains  
 now  the old timers didn 't take a fancy
 guitar string and make anything like this they would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up  it was hard on the cats
  it made a great little instrument
  wide when the yankees saw them coming
  were driving in the car outside of gatesville texas where i grew up
 in the early part of my life
 outside of gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store my mom was driving my brother and i were in the back seat  we were really mad at my mom we looked out the window
  surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields you see we 'd just been to the grocery store and my mom refused to buy us
 the jar of ovaltine that had the coupon for the captain midnight decoder ring in it 
 and buddy that made us mad well my mom didn 't put up with much either and she was driving and she said you boys  you think you can have anything you want you don 't know how hard it is to earn money your dad works so hard
  you think money grows on trees
  brother and i stepped out of the car we
 were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton there were about a hundred black folks out there picking  my mom grabbed us by the shoulders she marched us out in the field  she went up to the foreman she said i 've got these two little boys never worked a
  to that foreman put these two middle class little white boys out in a cotton field in august in texas it 's hot 
 so he gave us each a cotton sack about ten feet long about that big around and we started picking now 
 cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers and if you don 't know what you 're doing your hands are bleeding in no time  and my brother and i started
  the foreman could see he was in over his head i guess  he kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice he just sang well
 there 's a long white robe in heaven i know  don
 want it to leave me behind there 's a
  by the end of the day  we 'd each picked about a quarter of a bag
  but the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar  but my mother would never let us cash it i 'm fifty seven still have the check 
 now my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work  
 but if you have children you know it doesn 't often work that way no we learned something else the first thing i learned that day was that i never ever wanted to work that
  and pretty much never did  
 but i also learned that some people in this world do have to work that hard every day and that was an eye opener 
 and i also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier  
 and it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can
  boy that day when my mama put me out of the car in that hot texas cotton field i wasn 't even aware of music not even aware of it 
 but that day in the cotton field out there picking when those people started singing i realized i was in the very heart
 of real music  and that 's where i 've wanted to be ever since try this old song with me i sing well there 's a long white
  chariot 's coming good news
 chariot 's coming good news  chariot 's coming and i don 't want it to leave me it 's been a while since you
  there 's a starry crown in heaven i know  don 't want it to leave me behind good news
 chariot 's coming 
  was a few years ago but i sort of remembered this story and i told it at a concert  my mom was in the audience 
 after the she was glad to have a story about herself of course but after the concert she came up and she said david i 've got to tell you
 i set that whole thing up 
  i set it up with the foreman i set it up with the owner of the land  i just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work i didn
 't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though let 's try good news chariot 's coming good news chariot 's coming good
 news chariot 's coming
 and i don 't want it to leave me behind
  originally made by the dopyera brothers who later on made the dobro which is a wood bodied instrument with a metal cone for where the sound comes from
  's usually played flat on your lap it was made to play hawaiian music back in the 1920s before they had electric guitars trying to make a loud guitar  
 and then african american folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck
  just like that a nice merlot works very well  that wine we had yesterday would have been perfect 
 break it off put it on your finger and slide into the notes  
 this instrument pretty much saved my life
  fifteen years ago fourteen years ago i guess this year  my wife and i lost our daughter sarah jane in a car accident  and it was the most
 it almost took me out it almost took me out of this world  
 and i think i learned a lot about what happiness was happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief 
 just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in i had to make lists
 of reasons to stay alive i had to sit down and make lists because i was ready to go i was ready to check out of this world  and
 you know at the top of the list of course were jenny and my son zeb my parents i didn 't want to hurt them 
 but then when i thought about it beyond that it was very simple things  i didn 't care about
  have a radio show on public radio riverwalk i didn 't care about that i didn 't care about awards or money or anything nothing  nothing
 on the list it would be stuff like 
 seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring  the smell of 
 catching a wave and bodysurfing the
 touch of a baby 's hand  the sound of doc watson playing the guitar listening to old records of muddy waters and uncle dave macon
 and for me the sound of a steel guitar  because one of my parents ' neighbors just gave me one of these things  
 and i would sit around with it and i didn 't know how to play it but i would just play stuff
 as sad as i could play and it was the only instrument that of all the ones that i play that would really make
  words no longer say it  let me tell you what i always do
 i just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar
  better just to sink way down in your funky mood
  where you want to get but i got some medicine here that just might shake things
 loose call me in the morning after a dose of these steel
  my dad was an inventor
  he was working on gyroscopes  he has a number of patents for that kind of thing and we moved across the street from michael and john whitney they were about my age john went on and michael did too to become some of the inventors of
 computer animation michael 's dad was working on something called the computer this
  of vacuum tubes as far as you could see just floors and floors of these things and one of the engineers said some day
 you 're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket  i thought damn those are going to be some big pants 
 so that christmas
 maybe i 've got time for this that christmas i got the mister wizard
 i wanted to be an inventor just like my dad so did michael his great granddad had been eli whitney the inventor of the cotton gin  so
 we looked in that this was a commercial chemistry set it had three chemicals we were really surprised to see sulfur potassium nitrate and charcoal 
 man we were only ten but we knew that made gunpowder  we made up a little batch and and we put it on the driveway and we threw a match and phew it flared up
 obviously the next thing to do was
 build a cannon  
 so we went over into michael 's garage his dad had all kinds of stuff and we put a pipe in the vice there and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe drilled a hole 
  in the back of the pipe took some of our firecrackers pulled out the fuses tied them together put them in the back there 
  garage 
 we weren 't stupid we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it we stood back we lit that thing and
 they flew out of there they went through that plywood like it was paper 
 through the garage  two of them landed in the side door of his new citroen 
 we tore everything down and buried it in
  his backyard  
 that was pacific palisades it probably is still there back there  
 well  
 my brother heard that we had made gunpowder he and his buddies they were older and they were pretty mean  they said they were going to beat us up if we didn 't make some gunpowder for them 
 we said well what are you going to do with it  they said we 're going to melt it down and make
  make you a big batch 
 so we made them a big batch and it was in my now we 'd just moved here we 'd just moved to california mom had redone the kitchen 
 mom was gone that day we had a pie tin it became chris berquist 's job to do the melting down 
 michael and i were standing way at the side of the kitchen  
  it just flared up and he turned around and he looked like this 
 no hair no eyelashes no nothing  
 there were big welts all over my mom 's kitchen cabinet the air was the just full of black smoke 
 she came home she took that chemistry set away and we never saw it again
  but we thought of it often because every time she 'd cook tuna surprise it made
 tasted faintly of gunpowder
  so i like to invent things too and i think i 'll close out my set with something i invented a good while back
 when drum machines were new i got to thinking  why couldn 't you take the oldest form of
 of music the hambone rhythms and combine it with the newest technology i call this thunderwear at
 that time drum
  and so i put them all together and sewed twelve of them in this suit  
 i showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday i 'm going to be doing some of the same ones i have a trigger here
  going to really hurt if i don 't take that off okay now  the drum triggers go out my tail here 
 into the drum machine  and they can make various sounds like drums 
 so let me put them all together and also i can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right
  me just close out here by doing you a little hambone solo or something like this
