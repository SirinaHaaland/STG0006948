  i have studied young people that have been pushed out of school so called dropouts 
 as they end up failed by the education system they 're on the streets where they 're vulnerable to violence
  harassment  police brutality and incarceration  
 i follow these young people for years at a time across institutional settings to try to understand what some of us call the 
 when you look at a picture like this of young people who are in my study
  you might see trouble  i mean one of the boys has a bottle of liquor in his hand he 's fourteen years old and it 's a school day  
 other people when they see this picture might see gangs
  thugs  delinquents criminals  but i see it different
  i see these young people
 through a perspective that looks at the assets that they bring to the education system 
 so will you join me in changing the way we label young people from
 and the promise to change  i know this because i am one of them 
 you see i grew up in dire poverty in the inner city without a father he abandoned me before i was even born  
 we were on welfare  sometimes homeless  many times hungry 
 by the time i was fifteen years old i had been incarcerated in juvy three times
 for three felonies my best friend had already been killed 
 and soon after while i 'm standing next to my uncle  he gets shot  
 and as i 'm waiting for the ambulance to arrive for over an hour  
 he bleeds to death on the
  i had lost faith and hope in the world  
 and i had given up on the system because the system had failed me 
 i had nothing to offer and no one had anything to offer me 
 i was fatalistic  i didn 't even think i could make it to my 18th birthday the reason i 'm here today
 is because a teacher
 that cared reached out and managed
  to tap into my soul this teacher ms russ 
 she was the kind of teacher that was always in your business 
 she was the kind of teacher that was like victor i 'm here for you whenever you 're ready
 principle about young people like me  we 're like oysters  
 we 're only going to open up when we 're ready  and if you 're not there when we 're ready  
 we 're going to clam back up 
 ms russ was there for me she was culturally relevant she respected my community my people
  i told her a story
 about my uncle ruben 
 he would take me to work with him because i was broke and he knew i needed some money he collected glass bottles for a living  
 four in the morning on a school day we 'd throw the glass bottles in the back of his van 
 and the bottles would break and my hands and arms would start to bleed and my tennis shoes
 and and pants would get all bloody  and i was terrified and in pain and i would stop
  working  and my uncle he would look me in the eyes and he would say to me me
 we 're searching for a better life  we 're trying to make something out of nothing 
 ms russ listened to my
  welcomed it into the classroom and said victor  this is your power this is your potential 
 your family  your culture your community have taught you a hard work ethic and you will use it to empower yourself
 in the academic world so you can come back and empower your community 
 with ms russ 's help i ended up returning to school i even finished my
  credits on time and graduated with my class 
 but ms russ said to me right before graduation victor i 'm so proud of you 
 i knew you could do it
  what is this teacher smoking thinking i 'm going to college  i applied
 with the mentors and support she provided  
 got a letter of acceptance and one of the paragraphs read you 've been admitted under probationary status
  academic probation not criminal probation  
 but what do teachers like  ms russ do to succeed with young people like the ones i study  
 i propose three strategies the first 
 let 's get rid of our deficit perspective in education these people come from a culture of violence
  a culture of poverty these people are  at risk these people are truant these people are empty containers for us to fill with knowledge 
 they have the problems  we have the solutions 
 number two  let 's value the stories that young people bring
 to the schoolhouse their stories of overcoming
  odds are so powerful and i know you know some of these stories 
 these very same stories and experiences already have grit 
 character and resilience in them 
 so let 's help young people refine those stories let 's help them be proud of who they are because our education system welcomes their
  their cultures their communities and the skill set they 've learned to survive  and of course the third strategy
 being the most important resources  we have to provide adequate resources to young people 
 grit alone isn 't going to cut it 
 you can sit there and tell me all you want hey man pick yourself up by
  but if i was born without any straps on my boots how am i supposed to pick myself up 
 job training  mentoring  
 counseling  
 teaching young people to learn from their mistakes instead of criminalizing them and dragging them out of their classrooms like animals  
 how about
  this  i propose that we implement restorative justice in every high school in america 
 so we went out to test these ideas in the community of watts in la
 with forty young people that had been pushed out of school  
 william was one of
  was the kind of kid that had been given every label  he had dropped out he was a gang member a criminal 
 and when we met him he was very resistant but i remember what  ms russ used to say hey i 'm here for you whenever you 're ready 
 so over time
 over time he began to open up and i remember the day that
  he made the switch  we were in a large group
 and a young lady in our program was crying because she told us her powerful story
 of her dad being killed and then his body being shown in the newspaper the next day 
  and as she 's crying i don 't know what to do so i give her her space  and william had enough he slammed his hands on the desk and he said
 and laughter knowing that her community had her back 
 and william had now learned that he did have a purpose in life 
 to help to heal the souls of people in his own community  
 he told us his story we refined his story to go from being the story of a victim to being the story of a survivor
  that has overcome adversity we placed high value on it william went on
 to finish high school get his security guard certificate
 to become a security guard and is now working at a local school district
  russ 's mantra her mantra was always when you teach to the heart the mind will follow 
 the great writer khalil gibran says 
 out of suffering have emerged the greatest souls 
 the massive characters are
  seared with scars i believe that in this education revolution that we 're talking about
 we need to invite the souls of the young people that we work with 
 and once they 're able to refine identify their grit resilience and character that they 've already
  let 's believe in young people 
 let 's provide them the right kinds of resources i 'll tell you what my teacher did for me she believed in me so much
 that she tricked me into believing in myself
