  i have a strange career  i know it because people come up to me like colleagues and say chris  you have a strange career 
 and i can see their point  because i started my career as a
  theoretical nuclear physicist and i was thinking about quarks and gluons and heavy ion collisions and i was only fourteen years old
 no no i wasn 't fourteen years old but
 after that 
 i actually had my own lab in the computational neuroscience department and i wasn 't doing any neuroscience 
 later i would work on evolutionary genetics and i would work on systems biology
  i 'm going to tell you about something else today i 'm going to tell you about how i learned
 something about life  and i was actually a rocket scientist  i wasn 't really a rocket scientist but i was working at the jet 
  propulsion laboratory in sunny california where it 's warm  whereas now i am in the mid west and it 's cold  
  it was an exciting experience one day a nasa manager comes into my office sits down
 and says can you please tell us how do we look for life outside earth 
 and that came as a surprise to me because i was actually hired to work on quantum computation  yet i had a very good answer i said i have no idea
  have life can 't you apply a definition for example a supreme  court like definition of life and then i thought about it a little bit
  is it really that easy because yes if you see something like this then all right fine i 'm going to call it life no doubt about it but
 here 's something and he goes 
 right that 's life too i know that except  if you think that life is also defined by things that die you 're not in luck with this thing because that 's actually a very strange organism  it grows up into the adult stage like that and
  a benjamin button phase and actually goes backwards and backwards until it
 's like a little
 embryo again and then actually grows back up and back down and back up sort of yo yo and it never dies  so it 's actually life  but it 's actually not as we thought life would be  
 and then you see something like that and he was like my god what kind of a life form is that anyone know it 's
  actually not life  it 's a crystal 
 so once you start looking and looking at smaller and smaller things so this particular person wrote a whole article and said hey these are bacteria except if you look a little bit closer 
 you see in fact that this thing is way too small to be anything like that so he was convinced but in fact  most people aren 't 
  in a martian meteorite  
 except that nowadays  it 's heavily disputed 
 if you take the lesson of all these pictures then you realize well actually maybe it 's not that easy maybe i do need a definition of life in order to make that kind of distinction  so can life be defined 
 well how would you go about it well of course you 'd go to
 encyclopedia britannica and open at
  of course you don 't do that you put it somewhere in google  and then you might get something and what you might get and  anything that actually refers to
 things that we are used to you throw away and then you might come up with something like this and it says something complicated with lots and lots of concepts 
 who on earth would write something as
  's actually a really really important set of concepts so i 'm
 highlighting just a few words and saying
 definitions like that
 rely on things that are not based on amino acids or leaves or anything that we are used to but in fact on processes only 
 and if you take a look at that this was actually in a book that i wrote that deals with artificial life and that explains why that nasa
  manager was actually in my office to begin with because the idea was that with concepts like that  maybe we can actually manufacture a form of life  
 and so if you go and ask yourself what on earth is artificial life 
 let me give you a whirlwind tour of how all this stuff came about  and it started out
 quite a while ago  when someone wrote one of the first successful computer viruses  
 and for those of you who aren 't old enough you have no idea how this infection was working namely through these floppy disks  but the interesting thing about these computer 
  virus infections was that if you look at the rate at which the infection worked they show this spiky behavior that you 're used to from a flu virus  
  it is in fact due to this arms race between hackers and operating system designers that things go back and forth  and the result is kind of a tree of life
 of these viruses a phylogeny that looks very much like the type of life that we 're used to at least on the viral level 
 so is that life not as far as i 'm concerned why  because these things don 't evolve by themselves  in fact they have hackers writing
  but the idea was taken very quickly a little bit further  when a scientist working at the santa fe institute decided why don 't we try to package these little viruses in 
  artificial worlds inside of the computer and let them evolve and this was steen rasmussen  and he designed this system but it really didn 't work  because his viruses were constantly destroying each other  but there was another scientist who had been watching this an ecologist  and he
  i know how to fix this and he wrote the tierra system and in my book is in fact one of the first truly artificial living systems except for the fact that these programs didn 't really grow in complexity  
 so having seen this work worked a little bit on this this is where i came in and i decided to create a system that has all the properties that are necessary to see in fact  the evolution of complexity  more
  and more complex problems constantly evolving  
 and of course since i really don 't know how to write code i had help in this i had two undergraduate students at california institute of technology that worked with me that 's charles ofria on the left titus 
  brown on the right they are now actually respectable professors at michigan state university  but i can assure you back in the day  
  well i can 't really go into the details  but what you see here is some of the entrails but what i wanted to focus on
 is this type of population structure there 's about ten thousand programs sitting here and all different strains are colored in different colors 
 and as you see here there are groups that are growing on top of each other because they are spreading any time there
  a program that 's better at surviving in this world due to whatever mutation it has acquired it is going to spread over the others and drive the others to extinction 
 so i 'm going to show you a movie where you 're going to see that kind of dynamic  and 
  of experiments are started with programs that we wrote ourselves  we write our own stuff replicate it and are very proud of ourselves and we put them in 
 and what you see immediately is that there are waves and waves of innovation by the way this is highly accelerated so it 's like a one thousand generations a second
 but immediately the system goes like what kind of dumb piece of code was this this can be improved upon in so many ways so quickly so you see waves of new types taking over the other types 
 and this type of activity goes on for quite a while until
 the main easy things have been acquired by these programs and then
  you see sort of like a stasis coming on where the system essentially waits for a new type of innovation like this one which is going to spread over 
 all the other innovations that were before and is erasing the genes that it had before until a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved and this process goes on and on and on 
 people had asked me really was do these guys have a biosignature 
 can we measure this type of life because if we can maybe we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else without being biased by things like amino acids 
 so i said well  perhaps we should construct a biosignature based on life as a universal process
  in fact it should perhaps make
 use of the concepts that i developed just in order to sort of capture what a simple living system might be 
 and the thing i came up with i have to first give you
 an introduction about the idea and maybe that would be a meaning detector rather than a life detector  
  and the way we would do that i would like to find out how i can distinguish text that was written by a million monkeys  
 as opposed to text that is in our books and
 i would like to do it in such a way that i don 't actually have to be able to read the language because i 'm sure i won 't be able to as long as i know that there 's some sort of alphabet so here would be a frequency 
 plot of how often you find each of the twenty six letters of the alphabet in a text written by random monkeys 
  roughly equally frequent  but if you now look at the same distribution in english texts  it looks like that  
 and i 'm telling you this is very robust across english texts  and if i look at french texts it looks a little bit different or italian or german they all have their own type of
 frequency distribution  but it 's robust it doesn 't matter whether it writes about politics or about science  it doesn 't matter whether it 's a
  poem or whether it 's a mathematical text it 's a robust signature  
 and it 's very stable as long as our books are written in english because people are rewriting them and recopying them
 it 's going to be there  so that inspired me to think about well what if i try to use this idea in order not to detect
 random texts from texts with meaning but rather
  detect the fact that there is meaning in the biomolecules that make up life  but first i have to ask what are these building blocks like the alphabet elements that i showed you well 
  it turns out we have many different alternatives for such a set of building blocks we could use amino acids  we could use nucleic acids carboxylic acids fatty acids in fact chemistry 's extremely rich and our body uses a lot of them so that we actually to test this
  idea first took a look at amino acids and some other carboxylic acids and here 's the result 
 here is in fact  what you get if you for example look at the distribution of amino acids on a comet
 or in interstellar space or in fact in a laboratory where you made very sure that in your primordial soup there is no living stuff in there what you find is mostly glycine and then alanine and there 's some trace elements of
  other ones that is
 also very robust what you find
 in systems like earth where there are amino acids  but there is no life  but suppose you take some dirt
 and
 dig through it and then put it into these spectrometers because there 's bacteria all over
  you take water anywhere on earth because it 's teaming with life and you make the same analysis the spectrum looks completely different 
 of course there is still glycine and alanine but in fact there are these heavy elements these heavy amino acids  that are being produced because they are valuable to the organism  
 and some other ones that are not used in the set of twenty they will not appear at all in any type of concentration  
 so this also turns out to be extremely robust it doesn 't
  matter what kind of sediment you 're using to grind up whether it 's bacteria or any other plants or animals 
 anywhere there 's life  you 're going to have this distribution as opposed to that distribution  and it is detectable not just in amino acids  
 now you could ask  well  what about these avidians the avidians being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity
 so this is the distribution that you get if in fact there is no life  they have about twenty eight of these instructions and if you have a system where they 're being replaced 
 one by the other it 's like the monkeys writing on a typewriter each of these instructions appears with roughly the equal frequency  
  take a set of replicating guys like in the video that you saw  it looks like this  
 so there are some instructions that are extremely valuable to these organisms and their frequency is going to be high and there 's actually some instructions that you only use once if ever  so they are either poisonous or really
 should be used at less of a level than random in this case
  the frequency is lower  
 and so now we can see is that really a robust signature i can tell you indeed it is because this type of spectrum just like what you 've seen in books  and just like what you 've seen in amino acids  it doesn 
  't really matter how you change the environment it 's very robust it 's going to reflect the environment so i 'm going to show you now a little experiment that we did  and i have to explain to you the top of this graph shows you that frequency distribution
  that 's the lifeless environment where each instruction occurs at an equal frequency  
 and below there  
 i show in fact  the mutation rate in the environment  and i 'm starting this at a mutation rate that is so high that even if you would drop a replicating program that would otherwise happily grow up to fill the entire
  if you drop it in it gets mutated to death immediately  so there is no life possible at that
 type of mutation rate but then i 'm going to slowly turn down the heat so to speak and then there 's this viability threshold where now it would be possible
  for a replicator to actually live  and indeed we 're going to be dropping these guys into that soup
  hot  too hot 
 now the viability threshold is reached  and the frequency distribution has dramatically changed and in fact stabilizes and now what i did there is 
 i was being nasty i just turned up the heat again and again and of course it reaches the viability threshold and i 'm just showing this to you again because it 's so nice you hit the viability threshold the distribution changes to
  once you hit the threshold where the mutation rate is so high that you cannot  self reproduce you cannot
 copy the information forward to your offspring without making so many mistakes that your ability to replicate vanishes and then that signature is lost  
 what do we learn from that well i think we learn a number of things from that
  one of them is if we are able to think about life in abstract terms
 and we 're not talking about things like plants and we 're not talking about amino acids and we 're not talking about bacteria but we think in terms of processes
 then we could start to think about life not as something that is so special
  to earth but that in fact could exist anywhere because it really only has to do with these concepts of information 
 of storing information within physical substrates anything bits nucleic acids anything that 's an alphabet
 and make sure that there 's some process so that this information can be stored for much longer than you would expect
 the time scales for the deterioration of information  and if you can do that  then you have life
  first thing that we learn
 is that it is possible to define life in terms of processes alone without referring at all to the type of things that we hold 
  dear as far as the type of life on earth is and that in a sense removes us again 
  it 's this continuous dethroning of man of how we think we 're special because we 're alive  well  we can make life  we can make life in the computer granted  it 's limited  but we have learned
 what it takes
 in order to actually construct it and once we have that  
 then it is not such a difficult task anymore to say  if we understand the fundamental processes
 that do not refer to any particular substrate then we can go
  out and try other worlds  figure out what kind of chemical alphabets might there be  
 figure enough about the normal chemistry the geochemistry of the planet  
 so that we know what this distribution would look like in the absence of life  and then look for large deviations from this this
 thing sticking
  now we don 't know that there 's life then  but we could say well at least i 'm going to have to take a look
 very precisely at this chemical and see where it comes from and that might be our chance of actually discovering life
 when we cannot visibly see it and so that 's really the only take home message that i have for you life
 can be less mysterious than we make it out to be when we try to think about how it would be on other
  planets  and if we remove the mystery of life  then i think it  it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live  
 and how perhaps we 're not as special as we always think we are  and i 'm going to leave you with that and thank you very much
