  fresh out of college i went to work for a consulting firm 
 during orientation the leaders dished out advice amongst them was one pithy counsel i will never forget  he told us
  nave i really was at the time 
 i took his advice to heart  
 i told myself yes  i will be the ultimate team player  i will do everything i 'm told i will be easy to manage 
 it wasn 't until i arrived in graduate school and witnessed firsthand the criminal actions of scientists and engineers
 in the water crisis in flint michigan
 that i realized how
  dangerous
 and yet surprisingly common this line of thinking really is 
 make no mistake  the flint water crisis is one of the most egregious environmental injustices of our time for over eighteen months one hundred thousand residents  
 including thousands of young children were exposed to contaminated drinking water with high levels of lead 
 lead is a potent neurotoxin
  causes cognitive and developmental disabilities
 and is especially harmful to growing fetuses and young children we 've known about its dangers since the roman empire 
 amongst a whole host of health issues  twelve people died by contracting legionnaires ' disease 
 flint 's water infrastructure the complex network of underground pipes has been
  severely damaged  and while
 the water quality is slowly improving and the pipes are being replaced now 
 more than two years later the water is still not safe to drink 
 so people are still in shock they ask themselves how could this have happened 
 the short answer is the crisis began when an emergency manager
  appointed by michigan 's governor  decided to switch their water source to a local river to save money  
 but it continued for so long because scientists and engineers at government agencies in the state of michigan and in the federal government
 did not follow federal regulations for treating the water right what was more they actively cheated on the law and orchestrated
 they ridiculed residents asking for help  while publicly insisting that the brown smelly water coming out of the tap was safe to drink 
 the system at the local state and federal levels completely failed to protect our most vulnerable 
 and an entire population was left to fend for itself 
 now  amidst this injustice
 flint residents were rallying together amongst them were some amazing women of flint mothers concerned about their kids who came together forming
 many grassroots coalitions  and these groups started protesting and demanding change 
 the group also reached out to outside scientists for help  and a few responded  
 amongst them was a guy named miguel
 del toral a water expert at the us  epa the environmental protection agency who actually wrote this scientific memo
 and sent it to the state of michigan and the federal government to bring their attention to this problem  
 he was characterized a rogue employee and silenced 
 in collaboration with flint residents our research team here at tech
  students and scientists led by professor marc edwards  conducted citywide testing
 to prove that flint 's water was indeed contaminated even toxic in some homes 
 we substantiated what flint had been screaming for months and put it on the internet for the world to see  now  when i was
  getting involved when i said yes to this i had no idea what i was getting into 
 but every second of this journey has been totally worth it 
 this was science in service to the public this is what i came to graduate school for and this is how i would rather spend my life  
 and so this coalition this unlikely coalition of citizens pastors  journalists and scientists came together to uncover the truth using science advocacy and activism 
  pediatrician figured out that the instances of childhood lead poisoning had indeed doubled
 in flint during the crisis 
 and the state of michigan was forced to acknowledge the problem and take steps to correct it 
 this group and many others got flint 's kids protected 
 a few months later  president obama came in and declared a federal emergency  and now
  flint is getting more than six hundred million dollars
 in healthcare nutrition education
 and overhauling their water infrastructure however  the arrogance and the callous disregard for public health
 shown by scientists and engineers at these government agencies is beyond belief these unhealthy cultures that are festering in
  these groups where the focus is on meeting regulations and checking boxes
 as opposed to protecting public health is just appalling just consider this email
 that an epa employee wrote where she goes i 'm not so sure flint is a community we want to go out on a limb for
  the dehumanization of an entire population could not be more obvious now  contrast that to
 the first canon of engineering which  in my opinion should be the first law of humanity 
 to hold paramount the health safety and welfare of the public above all else this is the hippocratic oath we 've rarely acknowledged  let alone
  and so when scientists and engineers very much like medical doctors  screw up people can get hurt
 even die if our professionals and even students fail to get that society pays a huge price  
 buried deep in history lies a character i deeply admire
 an engineer named peter palchinsky he lived in the time of the soviet union and
 palchinsky repeatedly got in trouble for his radical honesty and willingness to point out major flaws in the soviets ' mindless pursuit of rapid industrialization 
 everyone was expected to follow orders coming from the top  anyone asking questions or offering feedback was
  the soviets had created the largest army of engineers the world had ever seen 
 and yet most of them were mere cogs in a gigantic machine heading for doom palchinsky
 on the other hand implored engineers to look at the economic political and social consequences of their actions 
 in other words be more 
 his fearless voice of reason was seen as a threat to the political establishment and
  stalin had him executed in one thousand nine hundred and
 twenty nine palchinsky 's view on technocrats is very different from one that is still very popular still very
 common
 that of a dispassionate researcher working in his ivory tower lab 
 or a nerdy engineer working in his cubicle  
 brilliant no doubt
 yet somehow cut off from the world  shows little emotion
 kind of like spock from star trek you know  this guy 
 let 's try and do the spock salute i don 't think i 'll succeed  see i can 't be spock  thank goodness i can 't be
  i was reminded of this distinction because a recent article came out in a very reputed
 scientific journal  which kind of characterized our flint work as driven by youthful idealism and hollywood 's dramatic sensibilities 
 it
 asks scientists to protect their research funding and institutions at all costs no matter how just the cause  and if you think you have to get
  involved in something even if it 's an emergency  try finding
 an activist group or an ngo and obtain the full support of the academic community whatever that means
 before you get involved 
 not one mention of our moral and professional obligation of preventing harm to the public or the fact that we have all this expertise
 and for some even tenure
 to you know  accomplish this task  
 i 'm not saying every scientist should be an activist there are real and sometimes very painful consequences of speaking up  
 but to denounce this idea this possibility so completely so that you can protect research
  the ideals we would want to pass to our students and so
 you may think ok all this sounds great but you 'll never completely change organizational cultures or
 imbibe mindsets in students and professionals to look at their work as a public good science in service to the public
  could a big reason for that be that we are not training our students right because
 if you look closely our education system today is focused more on creating what
  we fell in love with science when we were kids  and yet we somehow spend most of our time during high school and college just jumping through hoops and doing things
 so that we can polish our  rsum instead of sitting down and reflecting on what we want to do and who we want
  markers of empathy in our college graduates have been dropping dramatically in the past two decades  while those of narcissism are on the rise  
 there is also a growing culture of disengagement between engineering students
 and the public  we are trained to
 build bridges and solve complex problems but not how to think or live or
  a citizen of this world 
 my undergraduate years were explicit job preparation and i cannot tell you how suffocating and painful it was at times  
 and so some people think the solution to great engineers to great scientists is more technical training  maybe so 
  or building character or discerning right from wrong consider
 this project that i deeply love and admire 
 it 's called heroic imagination project a brainchild of dr phil zimbardo  famous for the stanford prison experiment this program seeks to 
  these young minds work over time to develop skills and virtues so that when the opportunity comes no matter what that opportunity be 
 to stand up and do the right thing 
 in other words  anyone can be a hero 
  think about that idea for a second why don 't we teach science and engineering like that
 where heroism and public service are seen as key values because indeed it 's often heroism that is not only the antidote to public 
  indifference  but also to systemic evil like we saw in flint  
  sciences
 so that they can serve society and are also aware of the tremendous power their knowledge and decisions have 
 folks who are developing their moral courage at all times  and who realize that
 conflict and controversy are not necessarily bad things if our ultimate loyalty is to the
  these are the people who will stand up like we did in flint not to be saviors or heroes in the media but
 altruistic and fundamentally good actors that you and i can trust  imagine
 fostering such a public focused mindset in
  on service trips and during activities during college or even high school so that these young minds will hold onto those ideals when they actually enter the real world  
 whether that be consulting academia  policy making
 or even becoming the president of a country 
 some of mankind 's greatest challenges lie ahead of us contaminated drinking water is just one example 
 we could definitely use more nay
 we desperately need more compassionate upstanders and 
 scientists and engineers who will strive to the do right thing  and not be easy to manage  thank you
