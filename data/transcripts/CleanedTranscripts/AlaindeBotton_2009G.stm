  sunday evening just as the sun is starting to set and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life starts to diverge so painfully that i normally end up
 weeping into a pillow  i 'm mentioning all
 i 'm mentioning all this because i think this is not merely a personal problem you may think i 'm wrong in this  but i think we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises 
 by moments when what we thought we knew about our lives about our careers comes into contact with
  free of career anxiety i want to look
 now if i may at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers why we might be victims of these career crises as we 're weeping softly into our pillows 
 one of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by
  've got some bad news particularly to anybody who 's come to oxford from abroad there 's a real problem with snobbery because sometimes people from outside the u k imagine that snobbery is a distinctively u k phenomenon 
 fixated on country houses and titles the bad news is that 's not true snobbery is a global phenomenon  we are a global organization this is a global phenomenon what is a snob a snob is anybody who takes a small part of you 
 snobbery  the dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery you encounter it within minutes at a party when you get asked that famous iconic question of the early 
 what do you do 
 according to how you answer that question people are either incredibly delighted to see you or look at their watch and make their excuses now the opposite of a snob is your mother
 necessarily your mother  or indeed mine but as it were the ideal mother  somebody who doesn 't care about your achievements unfortunately most people are not our mothers  most people make a strict correlation 
  between how much time and if you like love not romantic love though that may be something but love in general respect they are willing to accord us  that will be strictly
  our position in the social hierarchy  and that 's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods you know 
 we 're often told that we live in very materialistic times that we 're all greedy people i don 't think we are particularly materialistic i think we live in a society which has simply pegged 
 certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods  it 's not the material goods we want it 's the rewards we want it 's a new way of looking at luxury goods the next time you see somebody
  driving a ferrari don 't think this is somebody who 's greedy think this is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love 
 laughter feel sympathy  rather than contempt  there are other reasons 
 there are other reasons why it 's perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before one
  and it 's paradoxical because it 's linked to something that 's rather nice is the hope we all have for our careers  never before have expectations been so high about what human beings can achieve with their lifespan we 're told 
 from many sources that anyone can achieve anything  we 've done away with the caste system  we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position
 they please and it 's a beautiful
 idea  along with that is a kind of spirit of equality we 're all
  is one really big problem with this  and that problem is envy 
 envy it 's a real taboo to mention envy but if there 's one dominant emotion in modern society that is envy  and it 's linked to the spirit of equality  let me explain i think it would be very unusual for anyone here or anyone watching 
 to be envious of the queen of england even though
  the reason why we don 't envy her is because she 's too weird she 's simply too strange 
 we can 't relate to her she speaks in a funny way she comes from an odd place so we can 't relate to her  and when you can 't relate to somebody you don 't envy them the closer two people are
  in age in background in the process of identification the more there 's a danger of envy which is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion because there is no
  stronger reference point than people one one was at school with the problem of modern society is it turns the whole world into a school everybody 's wearing jeans everybody 's the same and yet they 're not so 
  there 's a spirit of equality combined with deep inequality  which can make for a very stressful situation it 's probably as unlikely
  as it was unlikely in the 17th century that you would accede to the ranks of the french aristocracy but the point is it doesn 't feel that way  it 's made to feel by magazines and other media outlets that if you 've got energy a few bright ideas about technology a garage
 you too could start a major
 thing laughter
 the consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops when you go to a large bookshop and look at the self help sections as i sometimes do if you analyze self help books produced in the world today there are basically two kinds
  kinds the first kind tells you you can do it you can make it anything 's possible the other kind tells you how to cope with what we politely call low 
 or impolitely call feeling very bad about yourself there 's 
 a real correlation between a society that tells people that they can do anything and the existence of low  self esteem so that 's another way in which something quite positive can have a nasty kickback there is another reason why we
  might be feeling more anxious about our careers about our status in the world today than ever before  and it 's again linked to something nice  and that nice thing is called meritocracy
 everybody all politicians on left and right agree that meritocracy is a great thing  and we should all be trying to make our societies really really meritocratic
  other words what is a meritocratic society a meritocratic society is one in which if you 've got talent and energy and skill  you will get to the top  nothing should hold you back it 's a beautiful idea  the problem is 
  if you really believe in a society where those who merit to get to the top get to the top you 'll also by implication and in a far more nasty way believe in a society where those who 
  deserve to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there  in other words your position in life comes to seem not accidental but merited and deserved
  and that makes failure seem much more crushing you know in the middle ages  
 in england when you met a very poor person 
 that person would be described as an unfortunate literally somebody who had not been blessed by fortune an unfortunate nowadays
 particularly in the united states if you meet someone at the bottom of society they may unkindly be described as a
  there 's a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser and that shows four hundred years of evolution in society and our belief in who is responsible for our lives it 's no longer the gods 
 it 's us  we 're in the driving seat that 's exhilarating if you 're doing well and very crushing if you 're not it leads in the worst cases in the analysis of a sociologist like emil durkheim it leads to increased rates of suicide  
  in developed individualistic countries than in any other part of the world and some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally they own their success but they also own
 their failure 
 is there any relief from some of these pressures that i 've been outlining i think there is  i just want to turn to a few of them  let 's take meritocracy 
 this idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to 
 i think it 's a crazy idea completely crazy i will support any politician of left and right with any
  idea  i am a meritocrat in that sense  but i think it 's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic it 's an impossible dream the idea that we will make a society where literally 
  everybody is graded the good at the top  bad at the bottom exactly done as it should be is impossible there are simply too many random factors  accidents accidents of birth 
 things dropping on people 's heads illnesses etc we will never get to grade them
 never get to grade people as they should i 'm drawn to a lovely quote by st augustine in the city of god where he says it 's a sin to judge any man by his post 
 in modern english that would mean it 's a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to dependent on their business card  it 's not the post that should count
 according to st augustine only god can
  really put everybody in their place he 's going to do that on the day of judgment with angels and trumpets and the skies will open insane idea if you 're a secularist person like me  but something very valuable in that idea 
  nevertheless  in other words  hold your horses when you 're coming to judge people you don 't necessarily know
 a loss of income a loss of status what we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others  and it exists  the number one organ of ridicule  nowadays is the newspaper  
  if you open the newspaper any day of the week it 's full of people who 've messed up their lives they 've slept with the wrong person taken the wrong substance passed the wrong piece of legislation whatever it is and then are fit for for ridicule  in other words they have failed  and they are described as
  now is there any alternative to this i think the western tradition shows us one glorious alternative which is tragedy 
 tragic art  as it developed in the theaters of ancient greece in the fifth century b c was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail 
 and
 also according them a level of sympathy  which ordinary
  would not necessarily
 accord them a few years ago i was thinking about this and i went to the sunday sport a tabloid newspaper i don 't recommend you start reading if you 're not familiar with it already 
 i went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of western art  i wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories if they came in as a news item
 at the news desk on a saturday afternoon i mentioned othello they 'd not heard of it but were fascinated
 immigrant kills senator 's daughter splashed across the headline i gave them the plotline of madame bovary again a book they were enchanted to discover  and they wrote
 shopaholic adulteress swallows arsenic after credit fraud and then my favorite
 they really do have a kind of genius of their own these guys my favorite is sophocles
  in a way if you like at one end of the spectrum of sympathy  
 you 've got the tabloid newspaper at the other end of the spectrum you 've got tragedy and tragic art  and i suppose i 'm arguing that we should learn a little bit about what 's happening in tragic art  it would be insane to call hamlet a loser  he is not a
  though he has lost and i think that is the message of tragedy to us and why it 's so very very
 important i think the other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety is that we have nothing at its center that is non human we are the first society
 to be living in a world where we don 't worship anything other than ourselves we think very highly of ourselves and so we should we 've put people on the moon done all sorts of extraordinary things
 and so we tend to worship ourselves our heroes are human heroes  that 's a very new situation
  most other societies have had right at their center the worship of something transcendent  a god a spirit a natural force the universe whatever it is something else that is being worshiped  
 we 've slightly lost the habit of doing that which is i think why we 're particularly drawn to nature
  not for the sake of our health though it 's often presented that way  but because it 's an escape from the human anthill
 it 's an escape from our own competition and our own dramas
 and that 's why we enjoy looking at
  glaciers and oceans and contemplating the earth from outside its perimeters  etc  we like to feel
 in contact with something that is non human and that is so deeply
 important to us what i think i 've been talking about really is success and failure  and one of the interesting things about success is that we think we know what it
  if i said that there 's somebody behind the screen who 's very very successful certain ideas would immediately come to mind you 'd think that person might have made a lot of money 
 achieved renown in some field 
 my own theory of success i 'm somebody who 's very interested in success i really want to be successful always thinking how can i be more successful  but as i get older i 'm also very nuanced about what that word success might mean 
 here 's an insight that i 've had about success you can 't be successful at everything 
 we hear a lot of talk about
  you can 't have it all you can 't so any vision of success has to admit what it 's losing out on where the element of loss is  
 and i think any wise life will accept as i say
  that there is going to be an element where we 're not succeeding  and the thing about a successful life is that a lot of the time our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully
  sucked in from other people chiefly if you 're a man your father and if you 're a woman your mother  
 psychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about eighty years no one 's quite listening hard enough but i very much believe it 's true
 and we also suck in messages from everything from the television 
 to advertising to marketing  etc  these are hugely powerful forces that define what we want and how we view ourselves
  when we 're told that banking is a very respectable profession a lot of us want to go into banking when banking is no longer so respectable we lose interest in banking  we are highly open
 to suggestion 
 so what i want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success  but we should make sure that they are our own we should focus in on our ideas and
 make sure that we own them that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions because it 's bad enough not getting what you want  but it 's even worse to have an idea
 of what it is you want and find out at the end of the journey that it isn 't in fact what you wanted all along so i 'm going to end it there but
 what i really want to
 to stress is by all means success  yes  but let 's accept the strangeness of some of our ideas let 's probe away at our notions of success let 's make sure our ideas of
  that was fascinating but how do you reconcile this idea of it being bad to think of someone as a
 the idea that a lot of people like of
 seizing control of your life
  and that a society that encourages that perhaps has to have some winners and losers alain de botton 
 yes i think it 's merely the randomness of the winning and losing process that i want to stress because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything and politicians always talk about justice now i 'm a firm believer in justice  i just think that it 's impossible 
 we should do everything we can to pursue it but we should always remember that whoever is facing us 
 whatever has happened in their lives there will be a strong element of the haphazard  that 's what i 'm trying to leave room for otherwise it can get quite claustrophobic ca
 i mean do you believe that you can combine your kind of kinder gentler philosophy of work with a successful economy
  or do you think that you can 't
  but it doesn 't matter that much that we 're putting too much emphasis on that ab the nightmare thought
 is that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them
  and that somehow the crueler the environment the more people will rise to the challenge 
 you want to think who would you like as your ideal dad and your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle and it 's a very hard line to make we need fathers as it were the
  father figures in society  avoiding the two extremes which is the authoritarian disciplinarian on the one hand and on the other the lax
