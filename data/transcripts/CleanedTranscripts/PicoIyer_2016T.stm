  out on the street  i ran into a group of rough men
  standing beside their bicycle rickshaws  and one of them came up and offered to show me around 
 the price he quoted was outrageous 
 it was less than i would pay for a bar of chocolate at home  
 so i clambered into his trishaw and he began pedaling us slowly between palaces and pagodas
 and as he did he told me how he had come to the city from his village 
 he 'd earned a degree in mathematics his dream was to be a teacher  
 but of course life is hard under a military dictatorship  
 and so for now this was the only way he could make a living 
 many nights he told me he actually slept in his
 trishaw so he could catch the first visitors off the  all night train  
 and very soon we found that in certain ways we had so much in common we were both in our 20s we were both fascinated by foreign cultures
 that he invited me
  we turned off the wide crowded streets and we began bumping down rough wild alleyways there were
 broken shacks all around i really lost the sense of where i was  
 and i realized that anything could happen to me now  i could get mugged or drugged
 or something worse  nobody would know  finally he stopped and led me into a hut
  which consisted of just one tiny room  and then he leaned down  and reached under his bed 
 and something in me froze  
 i waited to see what he would pull out  and finally he extracted a box
  inside it
 was every single letter he had ever received from visitors from abroad  
 and on some of them he had pasted little  black and white worn snapshots of his new foreign friends  
 so when we said goodbye that night 
 i realized he had also shown me the secret point of travel which is to take a plunge to go
  inwardly as well as outwardly to places you would never go otherwise to venture into uncertainty  ambiguity  
 even fear 
 at home  it 's dangerously easy to assume we 're on top of things 
 out in the world you are reminded every moment that you 're not and you can 't get to the bottom of things
 everywhere people wish to be settled ralph waldo emerson reminded us but only insofar as we are unsettled is there any hope for us 
 at this conference we 've been lucky enough to hear some exhilarating new ideas and discoveries and really about all the ways in which knowledge is being pushed excitingly forwards  
 but at some point
 knowledge gives out  and that is the moment when your life is truly decided 
 you fall in love you lose a friend 
 the lights go out  and it 's then when you 're lost or uneasy or carried out of yourself 
  that you find out who you are 
 i don 't believe that ignorance is bliss  
 science has unquestionably made our lives brighter and longer and healthier  
 and i am forever grateful to the teachers who showed me the laws of physics and pointed out that three times three makes nine  
 i can count that out on my fingers any time of night or day
  but when a mathematician tells me that minus three times minus three makes nine 
 that 's a kind of logic that almost feels like trust 
 the opposite of knowledge in other words  isn 't always ignorance it can be wonder or mystery  
  in my life  i 've found it 's the things i don 't know that have lifted me up and pushed me forwards much more than the things i do know  
 it 's also the things i don 't know that have often brought me closer to everybody around me 
 for eight straight novembers recently i traveled every year across japan with the dalai lama  
 and the one thing he said every day that most seemed
  to give people reassurance and confidence was i don 't know 
 what 's going to happen to tibet when are we ever going to get world peace what 's the best way to raise children
  kahneman has spent more than sixty years now researching human behavior  
 and his conclusion is that we are always much more confident of what we think we know than we should be
 we have as he memorably puts it
  to win this weekend  and we only remember that knowledge on the rare occasions when we 're right 
 most of the time we 're in the dark  and that 's where real intimacy lies 
 do you know what your lover is going to do tomorrow do you want to know 
 the parents of us
  all as some people call them  adam and eve could never die  so long as they were eating from the tree of life  
 but the minute they began nibbling from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil they fell from their innocence 
 they grew embarrassed and fretful
 and they learned a little too late perhaps that there are certainly some things that we need to know
  there are many many more that are better left unexplored 
 now when i was a kid  i knew it all of course  
 i had been spending twenty years in classrooms collecting facts  and i was actually in the information business  writing articles for time
  every last detail about japan 's temples its fashions its baseball games  its soul 
 but underneath all that something that i couldn 't understand
 so moved me for reasons i couldn 't explain to you yet
  that i decided to go and live in japan 
 and now that i 've been there for twenty eight years  i really couldn 't tell you very much at all about my adopted home  
 which is wonderful because it means every day i 'm making some new discovery  and in the process looking around the corner and seeing the hundred thousand things i 'll
 never know
  knowledge is a priceless gift  but the illusion of knowledge can be more dangerous than ignorance  thinking
 that you know your lover
 or your enemy can be more treacherous than acknowledging you 'll never know them every morning in
  as the sun is flooding into our little apartment  
 i take great pains not to consult the weather forecast because if i do my mind will be overclouded distracted  
 even when the day is bright
  i 've been a full time writer now for thirty four years  and the one thing that i have learned
 is that transformation comes when i 'm not in charge when i don 't know what 's coming
  next when i can 't assume i am bigger than everything around me  and the same is true in love
 or in moments of crisis  
 suddenly we 're back in that trishaw again and we 're bumping off the broad well lit streets  and we 're
  the first law of travel and therefore of life you 're only as strong
 as your readiness to surrender in the end perhaps being human
 is much more important than being fully in the know  thank you
