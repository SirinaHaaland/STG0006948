  during the final six months of kim jong il 's life  i lived undercover in north korea  
 i was born and raised in south korea their enemy  i live in america
  other enemy  
 since two thousand and two i had visited north korea a few times  
 and i had come to realize that to write about it with any meaning 
 or to understand the place beyond the regime 's propaganda  
 the only option
 was total
  so i posed as a teacher and a missionary at an all male university in pyongyang
 the pyongyang university of science and technology was founded by evangelical christians who cooperate with the regime
 to educate the sons of the north korean elite
 without proselytizing which is a capital crime there 
 the students were two hundred and seventy young men  expected to be the future leaders
 of the most isolated and brutal dictatorship in existence when i arrived they became
 my students
 two thousand and eleven was a special year marking the 100th anniversary of the birth of north korea 's
 original great leader kim il sung 
 to celebrate the occasion the regime shut down all universities  and sent students
  as the world 's most powerful and prosperous nation 
 my students were the only ones spared from that fate north korea
 is a gulag posing as a nation everything there is about the great leader  every book  every
  every song every tv program there is just one subject 
 the flowers are named after him the mountains are carved with his slogans  every citizen wears the badge of the great leader at all times 
 even their calendar system begins with the birth
 of kim  il sung the school
 was a heavily guarded prison posing as a campus  teachers could only leave on group outings accompanied
 by an official minder 
 even then our trips were limited to sanctioned national monuments celebrating the great leader  
 the students were not allowed to leave
 the campus  or communicate with their parents 
 their days were meticulously mapped out  and any free time they had
  was devoted to honoring their great leader  
 lesson plans had to meet the approval of north korean staff  
 every class was recorded and reported on every room was bugged and every conversation overheard  
 every blank space was covered with the portraits of kim
 in north korea  
 we were never allowed to discuss the outside world 
 as students of science and technology many of them were computer majors but they did not know the existence of the internet 
 they had never heard of mark zuckerberg or steve jobs  
 facebook
  those things would have meant a thing  and i could not tell them 
 i went there looking for truth  
 but where do you even start when an entire nation 's ideology my students ' day to day realities and even my own position at the universities were all built
 on lies  
 i started with a game
  we played truth and lie a volunteer would write a sentence on the chalkboard and the other students had to guess
 whether it was a truth
 or a lie once a student wrote i visited china last year on vacation and everyone shouted lie 
 they all knew this wasn
  virtually no north korean is allowed to leave the country even traveling within their own country requires a travel pass  
 i had hoped that this game
 would reveal some truth about my students because they lie so often and so easily  
 whether about the mythical accomplishments of their great
  strange claim that they cloned a rabbit as fifth graders  
 the difference between truth and lies seemed at times hazy to them it took me a while to understand the different types
 of lies they lie to shield their system from the world  or they were taught lies  and were just regurgitating them or at moments they lied out of habit
  all they have ever known were lies  how could we expect them to be otherwise  
 next i tried to teach them essay writing 
 but that turned out to be nearly impossible  
 essays are about coming up with one 's own thesis and making an evidence based argument to prove it
  these students however were simply told what to think and they obeyed 
 in their world critical thinking was not allowed  
 i also gave them the weekly assignment of writing a personal letter to anybody 
 it took a long time but eventually some of them
 began to write to their mothers their friends their girlfriends  although those were just homework
 and would never reach their intended recipients my students slowly began
 to reveal their true feelings in them they wrote that they were fed up
 with the sameness of everything  they were worried about their future in those letters  they rarely ever
  i was spending all of my time with these young men we all ate meals together
 played basketball together  i often called them gentlemen which made them giggle
 they blushed at the mention of girls  and i came to adore them
  and watching them open up even in the tiniest of ways was deeply moving 
 but something also felt wrong
  during those months of living in their world i often wondered if the truth would in fact  improve their lives  
 i wanted so much to tell them the truth of their country and of the outside world  where arab youth were turning
  their rotten regime inside out using the power of social media  where everyone except them was connected
 through the world wide web  which wasn 't worldwide after all 
 but for them the truth was dangerous  
 by encouraging them to run after it i was putting them at risk of persecution
 of heartbreak  
 when you 're not allowed to express anything in the open you become good at reading what is unspoken 
 in one of their personal letters to me a student wrote that he understood why i always called them
  it was because i was wishing them to be gentle in life he said 
 on my last day in december of two thousand and eleven  the day kim jong il 's death was announced 
 their world shattered 
 i had to leave without a proper goodbye  
 but i think they knew how sad i was for them once toward the end of my stay
  student said to me 
  never think of you as being different from us  our circumstances are different 
 but you 're the same as us  
 we want you to know that we truly think of you as being the same 
  if i could respond to my students with a letter of my own which is of course impossible  i would tell them this 
 my dear gentlemen
 it 's been a bit over three years since i last saw you and now you must be twenty two maybe even as old as twenty three 
 at our final class i asked you if there was anything you wanted
  the only wish you expressed the only thing you ever asked of me in all those months we spent together 
 was for me to speak to you in korean just once  
 i was there to teach you english you knew it wasn 't allowed  but i understood then you wanted to share that bond
 of our mother tongue
  i called you my gentlemen  
 but i don 't know if being gentle in kim jong un 's merciless north korea is a good thing 
 i don 't want you to lead a revolution let some other young person do it 
 the rest of the world might casually encourage or even expect some sort of north korean
  to do anything risky because i know in your world  someone is always watching 
 i don 't want to imagine what might happen to you if my attempts to reach you have inspired something new
 in you  i would rather you forget me become soldiers of your great leader  and live long  safe lives
  you once asked me if i thought your city of pyongyang was beautiful  and i could not answer truthfully then  
 but i know why you asked 
 i know that it was important for you to hear that i your teacher  the one who has seen the world that you are forbidden from declare
 your city as the most beautiful
  know hearing that would make your lives there a bit more bearable  
 but no i don 't find your capital beautiful 
 not because it 's monotone and concrete  but because of what it symbolizes a monster that feeds off the rest of the country 
 where citizens are soldiers and slaves 
 all i see there is darkness
  it 's your home so i cannot hate it 
 and i hope instead that you my lovely young gentlemen  
 will one day help make it beautiful  
 thank you
