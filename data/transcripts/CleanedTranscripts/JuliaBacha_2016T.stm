  twelve years ago i picked up a camera for the first time
 to film the olive harvest in a palestinian village in the west bank 
 i thought i was there to make a single documentary and would then move on to some other part of the world  
 but something kept bringing me back
  now usually when international audiences hear about that part of the world  they often just want that conflict to go away 
 the israeli palestinian conflict is bad and we wish it could just disappear 
 we feel much the same way about other conflicts around the world  but every time we turn our attention to the news it seems like one
  more country has gone up in flames so i 've been wondering whether we should not start looking at conflict in a different way
 whether instead of simply wishing to end conflict we focus instead
 on how to wage conflict  this has been a big question for me one i 've pursued together with my team at the nonprofit just vision 
 after witnessing several different kinds of struggles in the middle east  i started noticing some patterns
  patterns on the more successful ones i wondered whether these variables held across cases and if they did what lessons we could glean
 for waging constructive conflict in palestine israel and elsewhere  
 there is some science about this in a study of
  major political conflicts from one thousand nine hundred to two thousand and six  maria stephan and erica chenoweth found that nonviolent campaigns were almost one hundred percent more likely to lead to success
 than violent campaigns nonviolent campaigns are also less likely to cause physical harm to those waging the campaign as well as
  typically lead to more peaceful and democratic societies 
 in other words nonviolent resistance is a more effective and constructive way of waging conflict  
 but if that 's such an easy choice  why don 't more groups use it 
 political scientist victor asal and colleagues have looked at several factors that shape a political group 's choice of tactics
  and it turns out
  greatest predictor
 of a movement 's decision to adopt nonviolence or violence
 is not whether that group is more left wing or right wing 
 not whether the group is more or less influenced by religious beliefs 
 not whether it 's up against a democracy or a dictatorship and not even the levels of repression that that group is facing  
 the greatest predictor
 of a movement 's decision to adopt nonviolence
 is its ideology regarding the role of women in public life 
 when a movement includes in its discourse language around gender equality it increases dramatically the chances it will adopt nonviolence and thus the likelihood it will
  succeed  
 the research squared up with my own documentation of political organizing in israel and palestine  
 i 've noticed that movements which welcome women into leadership positions such as the one i documented in a village called budrus 
 were much more likely to achieve their goals  
 this village was under a real threat of being wiped off the map
 when israel started building the separation
  barrier  the proposed route would require the destruction of this community 's olive groves their cemeteries
 and would ultimately enclose the village from all sides  
 through inspired local leadership they launched a nonviolent resistance campaign to stop that from happening  
 the odds were massively stacked against them 
 but they had
  secret weapon 
 a 15 year old girl who courageously jumped in front of a bulldozer which was about to uproot an olive tree  stopping it 
 in that moment the community of budrus realized what was possible if they welcomed and encouraged women to participate in public life  
 and so it was that the women of budrus went to the front lines day after day using their
  creativity and acumen
 to overcome multiple obstacles they faced in a 10 month unarmed struggle  and as you can probably tell at this point  they win at the end 
 the separation barrier was changed completely to the internationally recognized green line  and the women of budrus came to be known across
  want to pause for a second which you helped me do  because i do want to tackle two
 very serious misunderstandings that could happen at this point  the first one
 is that i don 't believe women are inherently or essentially more peaceful than men
 but i do believe
 that in today 's world  women experience power differently  
 having had to navigate being in the less powerful position in multiple aspects of their lives 
 women are often more adept at how to surreptitiously pressure for change
  often charged against women in a derogatory way reflects a reality in which women have often had to find ways other than direct confrontation to achieve their goals  
 and finding alternatives to direct confrontation
 is at the core of nonviolent resistance now to the second
 potential misunderstanding 
 i 've been talking a lot about my experiences in the middle east  and some of you might be thinking now that the solution then is for us to educate muslim and arab societies to be more inclusive of their women 
 if we were to do that they would be more successful 
 they do not need this kind of help 
 women have been part of the most influential movements coming out of the middle east  
 but they tend to be
  invisible
 to the international community 
 our cameras are largely focused on the men who often end up involved in the more confrontational scenes that we find so irresistible
 in our news cycle  and we end up with a narrative that not only erases women from the struggles in the region
 but often
  an uprising started in gaza  and quickly spread to the west bank and east jerusalem it came to be known
 as the first intifada  and people who have any visual memory of it generally conjure up something like this 
 palestinian men
 throwing rocks at israeli tanks the
  news coverage at the time made it seem like stones  molotov cocktails
 and burning tires were the only activities taking place in the intifada  
 this period though was also marked by widespread nonviolent organizing
 in the forms of strikes
  and the creation of parallel institutions  
 during the first intifada  whole sectors of the palestinian civilian population mobilized  cutting across generations  factions and class lines 
 they did this through networks of popular committees  and their use of direct action and communal self help projects challenged israel 's very ability to continue ruling the west bank and gaza  
 according to the israeli army itself
  during the first intifada were unarmed  and here 's another thing
 that is not part of our narrative about that time 
 for eighteen months in the intifada women were the ones calling the shots behind the scenes 
 palestinian women from all walks of life in charge of mobilizing hundreds of thousands of people in a concerted effort to withdraw consent from the occupation
 who strived to build a self sufficient palestinian economy by encouraging women in gaza to grow vegetables in their backyards  
 an activity deemed illegal by the israeli authorities at that time
 who took over decision making authority for the entire uprising when the men who had been running it were deported
  fatima al jaafari  who swallowed leaflets containing the uprising 's directives in order to spread them across the territories without getting caught  
 who ensured the longevity of the uprising by leading an organization that went from twenty five women to three thousand in a single year
  despite their extraordinary achievements  none of these women
 have made it into our narrative
 of the first intifada  
 we do this in other parts of the globe too 
 in our history books for instance and in our collective consciousness men are the public faces and spokespersons
  for racial justice in the united states  
 but women were also a critical driving force  mobilizing organizing taking to the streets 
 how many of us think of septima clark
 when we think of the united states civil rights era  
 remarkably few  but she played a crucial role
 in every phase of the struggle  particularly by emphasizing literacy and
  education  she 's been omitted  
 ignored like so many other women who played critical roles in the united states civil rights movement 
 this is not about getting credit it
 's more profound than that 
 the stories we tell matter deeply to how we see ourselves  and to how we believe movements are run
 and how movements are won  the stories we tell about a movement like the first intifada or the united states civil rights era matter deeply
 and have a critical influence in the choices palestinians  
 americans and people around the world will make next time they encounter an injustice
  and develop the courage to confront it 
 if we do not lift up the women who played critical roles in these struggles we fail to offer up role models to future generations  
 without role models it becomes harder
 for women to take up their rightful space in public life  
 and as we saw earlier one of the most critical variables in determining whether a movement will be successful or not
 is a movement 's ideology regarding the role of women in public life  
 this is a question of whether we 're moving towards more democratic and peaceful societies 
 in a world where so much change is happening and where change is bound to continue at an increasingly faster pace 
 it is not a question
 of whether we will face
  conflict  but rather a question of which stories will shape how we choose to wage conflict
