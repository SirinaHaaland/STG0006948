  few minutes ago  i took this picture
 about ten blocks from here  this is the grand cafe here in oxford  i took this picture because this turns out to be the first coffeehouse to
  that 's its great claim to fame  and i wanted to show it to you not because i want to give you the kind of
 starbucks tour of historic england  but rather because the english coffeehouse was crucial to the development
 and spread of one of the great intellectual flowerings
 of the last five hundred years what we now call the enlightenment
 and the coffeehouse played such a big role in the birth of the enlightenment in part because of what people were drinking there because
  before
 the the spread of coffee and tea through british culture what people drank both elite and mass folks drank day in and day out from dawn until dusk was alcohol 
 alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice  you would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch a little gin particularly around one thousand six hundred and fifty
  safe to drink
 and so effectively
 until the rise of the coffeehouse you had an entire population that was effectively drunk all day  
 and you can imagine what that would be like right in your own life and i know this is true of some of you if you were drinking all day   
 and then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life you would have
  you would be sharper and more alert and so it 's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened
 as england switched to to tea and coffee but the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important is the is the architecture of the space  
 it was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds different fields of expertise and share it was a space as matt ridley talked about where ideas could have sex  this was their conjugal
  in a sense ideas would get together there and an astonishing number of innovations from this period have a coffeehouse somewhere in in their story
  i 've been spending a lot of time thinking about coffeehouses for the last five years  because i 've been
 kind of on this quest
 to investigate this question of where good ideas come from what are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation  
  of creativity what 's the kind of environmental what is the space of creativity  and
 what i 've done is i 've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse i 've looked at media environments like the world wide web that have been extraordinarily innovative i 've gone back to the the history of the first cities 
 i 've even gone to biological environments like coral reefs and rainforests that involve unusual levels of biological innovation 
 and again in all of these environments are there recurring patterns that we can learn from that we can take and kind of apply to our own lives or our own organizations or our own environments to make them more creative and innovative 
 and i think i 've found a few but what you have to do
 to make sense of this and to really understand these principles is you have to do away with a lot of
 the way in which our conventional metaphors and language steers us towards certain
  we have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration  we have the kind of the flash of insight  the stroke of insight  we have 
 we have eureka moments  we have the lightbulb moments right all of these concepts as kind of rhetorically florid as they are 
 share this basic assumption which is that an idea is a single thing
 something that happens often in a wonderful
 illuminating moment  
 but in fact  what i would argue and what you really need to kind of begin with is this idea that an idea is a network on the most elemental level  i mean  this is what is happening inside your brain 
 an idea a new idea is a new network of neurons firing in sync with each other inside your brain it 's a new configuration that has never formed before
  the question is how do you get your brain into environments where these new networks are going to be more likely to form and
 it turns out that in fact the kind of network patterns of the outside world mimic a lot of the network patterns of the internal world of the of the human brain  
 so the metaphor i 'd like the use  i can take from from a story of a great idea
  a wonderful guy named timothy prestero who has a company called an organization called design that matters they decided to tackle this really pressing problem
 of you know 
 the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates in the in the developing world 
 one of the things that 's very frustrating about this is that we know by getting modern neonatal incubators
 into
 any context if we can keep premature babies warm basically it 's very simple
  we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments so the technology is there these are standard in all the industrialized worlds the problem is if you buy a $ forty thousand incubator  
 and you send it off to a mid sized village in africa  it will work great for a year or two years  and then something will go wrong and it will break and it will remain broken forever 
 because you don 't have a whole system of spare parts and you
  have the on the ground expertise to fix this $ forty thousand piece of equipment 
 and so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries and then it ends up being useless so what
 prestero and his team decided to do is to look around and see what are the abundant resources in these developing world contexts 
 and what they noticed was they don 't have a lot of dvrs they don 't have a lot of microwaves  but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars
  on the road  there 's a toyota forerunner on the street in all in all these places they seem to have the expertise to keep cars working 
 so they started to think could we build a neonatal incubator that 's built entirely out of automobile parts 
 and this is what they ended up coming with it 's called a neonurture device from the outside it looks like a normal little thing you 'd find in a modern western hospital in the inside it 's all car parts
  's got a fan  it 's got headlights for warmth  it 's got door chimes for alarm it runs off a car battery  and so all you need is the spare parts from your toyota and the ability to fix a headlight and you can repair this thing 
 now that 's a great idea but what i 'd like to say is that in fact this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen we like to think our breakthrough ideas  you know are like that $ forty thousand
  together from whatever parts that happen to be around nearby we take ideas from other people from people we 've learned from from people we run into in the coffee shop  and we stitch them together into new forms and we create something new that 's really where innovation happens  
 and that means that we have to change some of our models of what
 innovation and deep thinking really looks like right  i mean this is one vision of it another is newton and the apple
 you 're sitting there thinking a deep thought and the apple falls from the tree and you have the theory of gravity  
 in fact  the spaces that have historically led to innovation tend to look like this right this is hogarth 's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern but this is what the coffee 
  shops looked like back then  this is the kind of chaotic environment where ideas were likely to come together where people were likely to have new interesting unpredictable collisions people from different backgrounds
 so if we 're trying to build organizations that are more innovative we have to build spaces that strangely enough look a little bit more like this this is what your office should look like is part of my message here  
 and one of the problems with this is that people are actually when you when you research this field people are notoriously unreliable when they actually kind of self report on where they have their own good ideas or their history
  their best ideas and a few years ago a wonderful researcher named kevin dunbar decided to go around
 and basically do the big brother approach to figuring out where good ideas come from he went to a bunch of science labs around the world
 and videotaped everyone
 as they were doing every little bit of their job so when they were sitting in front of the microscope when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler and all these  things and he recorded all of these conversations and tried to figure out where the most important ideas where they happened 
 and when we think about the
 classic image of
  scientist in the lab we have this image you know they 're pouring over the microscope and they see something
 in the tissue sample and oh eureka they 've got the idea what happened actually when dunbar kind of looked at the tape
 is that in fact  almost all of the important breakthrough ideas did not happen alone in the lab in front of the microscope  they happened at the conference table at the weekly lab meeting when everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and
  findings  oftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having the error the noise in the signal they were they were discovering  and something about that environment and i 've started calling it the liquid 
  network where you have lots of different ideas ideas that are together different backgrounds different interests  jostling with each other bouncing off each other that environment is in fact  the environment that leads to innovation 
 to kind of shorter time frames so they want to tell the story of the eureka moment  they want to say there i was i was standing there and i had it all suddenly clear in my head 
 but in fact  if you go back and look at the historical record it turns out that a lot of important ideas
 have very long incubation periods i call this the slow hunch
  sudden moments of clarity  but in fact a lot of great ideas linger on sometimes for decades 
 in the back of people 's minds they have a feeling that there 's an interesting problem but they don 't quite have the tools yet to discover them  
 they spend all this time
 working on certain problems but there 's another thing lingering there that they 're interested in but they can 't quite solve darwin is a great example of this darwin himself in his autobiography  tells the
  story of coming up with the idea for natural selection as a classic eureka moment he 's in his
 study  it 's october of one thousand eight hundred and thirty eight and he 's reading malthus actually on population and all of a sudden the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head and he says 
 ah at last i had a theory with which to work that 's in his
  about a decade or two ago  a wonderful scholar named howard gruber went back and looked at
 darwin 's notebooks from this period and darwin kept these copious notebooks where he wrote down every little idea he had every little hunch 
 and what gruber found was that darwin had the full theory of natural selection for months and months and months before he had his alleged epiphany 
 reading malthus in october of one thousand eight hundred and thirty eight there are passages where you can read it and you think you 're reading from a darwin textbook
  from the period before he has this epiphany  and so what you realize is that darwin in a sense had the idea he had the concept but was
 unable of fully thinking it yet  
 and that is actually how great ideas often happen they fade into view over long periods of time 
 now the challenge for all of us is how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half life right it 's hard to go to your boss and say i have an excellent idea for our organization
  it will be useful in two thousand and twenty 
 could you just give me some time to do that now a couple of companies like google they have innovation time off twenty percent time where  in a sense those are  hunch cultivating
 mechanisms in an organization  but that 's a key thing and the other thing is to allow those hunches to connect with other people 's hunches that 's what often happens
  you have half of an idea somebody else has the other half and if you 're in the right environment they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts  
 so in a sense  we often talk about the value of protecting intellectual property  you know building barricades having secretive r & d labs 
 patenting everything that we have so that those ideas will remain valuable and people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas and the culture will be more innovative 
 but i think there 's a case to be made that we should spend at least as much time if not more
  the premise of connecting ideas and not just protecting them 
 and i 'll leave you with this story which i think captures a lot of these values
  and it 's just wonderful kind of tale of innovation and how it happens in unlikely ways  
 it 's october of one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven and sputnik has just launched and we
  in laurel maryland at the applied physics lab associated with johns hopkins university  and it 's monday morning  and the news has just broken about this satellite that 's
 now orbiting the planet and of course  this is nerd heaven right there are all these physics geeks who are there thinking oh my gosh this is incredible i can 't believe this has happened 
  researchers at the apl are there at the cafeteria table having an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues and these two guys are named guier and weiffenbach
 and they start talking and one of them says hey  has anybody tried to listen for this thing 
 there 's this you know man made satellite up there in outer space that 's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal we could probably hear it
 if we tune in 
 and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues and everybody 's like no i hadn 't thought of doing that that  that 's an interesting idea 
 and it turns out weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave
 reception and he 's got a little
  antennae set up with an amplifier in his office and so guier and weiffenbach go back to weiffenbach 's office and they start kind of noodling around hacking as we might call it now 
 and after a couple of hours they actually start picking up the signal because the soviets made
 sputnik very easy to track it was right at twenty mhz so you could you could pick it up really easily because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax basically
  so they made it really easy to to find it
 so these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal and people start kind of coming into the office and saying wow that 's pretty cool can i hear wow that 's great 
 and before long they think well jeez this is kind of historic we may be the first people in the united states to be listening to this we should record it and so they bring in this big clunky analog tape recorder
 and they start recording these little bleep bleeps  and they start writing the kind of date stamp time stamps for each for each little bleep that they record  
 and they they start thinking
  noticing small little frequency variations here  we could probably
 calculate the speed
 that the satellite is traveling if we do a little basic math here using the the doppler effect 
 and then they played around with it a little bit more and they talked to a couple of their colleagues who had other kind of specialties and
 they said jeez you know we think we
  look at the slope of the doppler effect
 to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antennae and the points at which it 's farthest away  that 's pretty cool 
 and eventually they get permission this is all a little side project that hadn 't been officially part of their job description
 they get permission to use the new you know univac computer that takes up an entire room that they 'd just gotten at the  apl they run some more of the numbers and at the end of about three or four weeks turns out they have mapped
  the exact trajectory of this satellite
 around the earth just from listening to this one little signal going off on this little side hunch that they 'd been inspired to do over over lunch one morning a
 couple weeks later their boss frank mcclure  pulls them into the room and says hey  you guys i
 have to ask you something about that project you were working on you 've figured out
 an unknown location
 of a satellite orbiting the planet from a known location on the ground  could you go the other way
 could you figure out an unknown location on the ground if you knew the location of the satellite 
 and they thought about it and they said well i guess maybe you could let 's run the numbers here so they went back and they thought about it and they came back and said actually it 'll be easier 
 and he said oh that 's great because
 see i have these new nuclear submarines that i 'm building
  it 's really hard to figure out how to get your missile so that it will land right on top of moscow  if you don 't know where the submarine is in the middle of the pacific ocean  
 so we 're thinking we could throw up a bunch of satellites and use it to track our submarines and figure out their location in the middle of the ocean could you work on that problem 
 and that 's how gps was born  
 thirty years later  ronald reagan actually opened it up and made it an open platform
 that anybody could kind of build upon and anybody could come along
  and build new technology that would
 that would create and innovate on top of this open platform 
 left it open for for anyone to do pretty much anything they wanted with it and now i guarantee you
 certainly half of this room if not more has a device sitting in their pocket right now that is talking to one of these satellites in outer space and i bet you
 one of you if not more has used said device and said satellite
  system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last in the last day or last week right 
 and that i think is a great case study a great lesson
 in in the power the marvelous kind of unplanned emergent  unpredictable power of open innovative systems when you build them right they will be led to
  completely new directions that the creators never even dreamed of i mean here you have these guys
 who basically thought they were just following this hunch this little passion that had developed then they thought they were fighting the cold war  and then it turns out they 're just helping somebody find a soy latte 
 that is how innovation happens  chance favors the connected mind thank you very much
