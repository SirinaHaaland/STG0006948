  this theater is built on copacabana 
 which is the most famous beach in the world but twenty five kilometers away from here in the north zone of rio lies a community called vila cruzeiro
  and roughly sixty thousand people live there now the people here in rio mostly know vila cruzeiro from the news and unfortunately news from vila cruzeiro often
 is not good news  
 but vila cruzeiro is also the place where our story begins jeroen koolhaas 
 ten years ago  we first came to rio to shoot a documentary about life in the favelas 
 now we learned that favelas are informal communities they emerged over the years when immigrants
  from the countryside came to the cities looking for work like cities within the cities 
 known for problems like crime  poverty  and the violent drug war between police and the drug gangs  
 so what struck us was that these were communities that the people who lived there had built with their own hands without a master plan and like a giant work in progress 
 where we 're from in holland
  is planned we even have rules for how to follow the rules du 
 so the last day of filming we ended up in vila cruzeiro and we were sitting down and we had a drink  and we were overlooking this hill with all these houses and most 
  of these houses looked unfinished  and they had walls of bare brick  but we saw some of these
  were plastered and painted  and suddenly we had this idea  what would it look like if all these houses would be plastered and painted  
 and then we imagined one big design
 one big work of art  who would expect something like that in a place like this  
 so we thought would that even be possible so first we started to count the houses but we soon
  we had a friend he ran an ngo in vila cruzeiro his name was nanko and he also liked the idea 
 he said you know everybody here would pretty much love to have their houses plastered and painted it 's when a house is finished 
 so he introduced us to the right people and vitor and  maurinho became our crew  
 we picked three houses in the center of the community and we start here we made a few designs
  and everybody liked this design of a boy flying a kite the best so we started painting and the first thing we did was to paint everything blue  
 and we thought that looked already pretty good 
 but they hated it the people who lived there really hated it they said what did you do you painted our house in exactly the same color as the police station 
 in a favela that is not a good thing also the same color as the prison cell
 so we quickly went ahead and we painted the boy  
 and then we thought we were finished we were really happy  
 but still it wasn 't good because the little kids started coming up to us and they said you know there 's a boy flying the kite but where is his kite 
 we said uh it 's art  you know you have to imagine the kite
  we quickly installed a kite way up high on the hill so that you could see the boy flying the kite and you could actually see a kite  
 so the local news started writing about it which was great  and then even the guardian wrote about it notorious slum becomes 
 so encouraged by this success we went back to rio for a second project  and we stumbled upon this street
  it was covered in concrete to prevent mudslides  and somehow we saw a sort of river in it  and we imagined this river to be a river in japanese style
 with koi carp swimming upstream  so we decided to paint that river  
 and we invited rob admiraal who is a tattoo artist  and he specialized in the japanese style 
 so little did we know that we would spend almost an entire
  year
 painting that river together with geovani and robinho and vitor who lived nearby  
 and we even moved into the neighborhood when
 one of the guys that lived on the street  elias  told us that we could come and live in his house together with his family which was fantastic 
 unfortunately during that time  another war broke out between the police and the drug gangs
 we learned that during those times people in communities really stick together during these times
  but we also learned a very important element the importance of barbecues 
 laughter because when you throw a barbecue it turns you from a guest into a host  
 so we decided to throw one almost every other week  and we got to know everybody in the neighborhood jk 
 we still had this idea of the hill though du yeah yeah we were talking about the scale of this because this painting was incredibly big and it was
  drove us completely insane
 ourselves  
 but we figured that maybe during this process all the time that we had spent in the neighborhood was maybe actually even more important than the painting itself jk 
 so after all that time this hill this idea was still there and we started to make sketches  models  
 and we figured something out we figured that our ideas our designs had to be a little bit more
  simple than that last project so that we could
 paint with more people and cover more houses at the same time  and we had an opportunity to try that out in a community
 in the central part of rio which is called santa marta  and
 we made a design for this place which looked like this  and then we got people to go along with it because turns out that if your idea is ridiculously big it 's easier to get
  people to go along with this and the people of santa marta
 got together and in a little over a month they turned that square into this 
 and this image somehow went all over the
  so then we received an unexpected phone call from the philadelphia mural arts program  and
 they had this question if this idea our approach if this would actually work in north philly  which is one of the poorest neighborhoods in the united states  
 so we immediately said yes we had no idea how but it seemed like a very
  so we did exactly the same as we did in rio  and we moved into the neighborhood and started barbecuing 
 so
 the project took almost two years to complete  and we made individual designs for every single house on the avenue that we painted  and we made these designs together with the local store owners the building owners  and
 a team of
 about a dozen young men and women they were hired
  hired  and then they were trained as painters  
 and together they transformed their own neighborhood the whole street into a giant patchwork of color 
 and at the end the city of philadelphia thanked every single one of them
 and gave them a merit for their
  accomplishment jk so now we had painted a whole street  how about we do this whole hill now 
 we started looking for funding  but instead we just ran into questions  
 like how many houses are you going to paint 
 how many square meters is that how much paint are you going
  how many people are you going to employ  and we we did try for years to write plans for the funding and answer all those questions  
 but then we thought in order to answer all those questions you have to know exactly what you 're going to do before you actually get there and start  
 and maybe it 's a mistake to think like that 
 it would lose some of the magic that we had learned about that if you go somewhere and you spend time there 
 you can let the project grow organically
  and have a life of its own du 
 so what we did is
 we decided to take this plan and strip it away from all the numbers and all the ideas and presumptions and
 just go back to the base idea which was to transform this hill into a giant work of art
 and instead of looking for funding we started a crowdfunding campaign
  and in a little over a month more than one thousand five hundred people put together and donated over one hundred thousand dollars  
 so for us this was an amazing moment because now 
 because now we we finally had the freedom to use all the lessons that we had learned
 and create a project that was built the same way that the favela was built from the ground
 on up bottom up with no master plan jk 
 so we went back and we employed angelo  and he 's a local artist from vila cruzeiro very talented guy and he knows almost everybody there and then we employed elias our former landlord who invited us into his house and he 's a master of construction 
 together with them we decided where to start  we picked this spot in vila cruzeiro  and houses are being plastered as we speak
 good thing about them is that they are deciding which houses go next they 're even printing t shirts they 're putting up banners explaining everything to everybody 
 and talking to the press 
 this article about angelo appeared du so while this is happening we are bringing this idea all over the world  so 
 like the project we did in philadelphia we are also invited to do workshops for instance in curaao and right now we 're planning a
  huge project in haiti jk 
 so the favela was not only the place where this idea started it was also the place that made it possible
 to work without a master plan
 because these communities are informal this was the inspiration and in a communal effort together with the people 
 you can almost work like in an orchestra where you can have a hundred instruments playing together to create a symphony
  so we want to thank everybody who
 wanted to become part of this dream and supported us along the way  and we are looking at continuing jk yeah  and so one day pretty soon when the colors start going up on these walls we hope more people will join us and
 join this big dream and maybe one day the whole of vila cruzeiro will be painted
