  that guy get to sit down that 's because this is radio 
 music i tell
  and i report on all kinds of stories buildings and toothbrushes  mascots and wayfinding and fonts 
 my mission is to get people to engage with the design that they care about so they begin to pay attention to all forms of design 
 when you decode the world with design intent in mind  the world becomes kind of magical  instead of seeing the broken things 
 you see all the little bits of genius that anonymous designers have sweated over
 to make our lives better 
 and that 's essentially the definition of design  making life better and providing joy  and few things give me greater joy than a
  kind of obsessed with flags  sometimes i bring up the topic of flags  and people are like 
 i don 't care about flags and then we start talking about flags and trust me one hundred percent of people care about flags there 's just something about them that works on our emotions 
 my family wrapped my christmas presents as
  including the blue
 gift bag that 's dressed up as the
 as the flag of scotland 
 i put this picture online and sure enough within the first few minutes someone left a comment that said 
 you can take that scottish saltire and shove it up your ass 
 laughter see people are passionate about flags you know that 's the way it is what i love about flags is that once you understand the
  what makes a good flag what makes a bad flag  you can understand the design of almost anything so what i 'm going to do here is i
 cracked open an episode of my radio show ninety nine % invisible and i 'm going to reconstruct it here on stage so when i when i press a button over here
 voice s for sound roman mars it 's going to make a sound  and so whenever you hear a sound or a voice or a piece of music  it 's because i pressed a
  that makes it sound weird narrator number one  keep it simple the
 flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory rm before i moved to chicago in two thousand and five  i didn 't even know cities had their own flags tk most larger cities do have flags rm well i
 didn 't know that that 's ted kaye by the way tk hello rm he 's a flag expert he 's a totally awesome guy tk i 'm ted
  have edited a scholarly journal on flag studies and i am currently involved with the portland flag association and the north american 
 ted literally wrote the book on flag design narrator good flag  bad flag rm it 's more of a pamphlet really it 's about sixteen pages tk yes it 's called good flag bad flag  how to design 
  a great flag rm and that first city flag i discovered in chicago is a beaut
  the blue stripes represent the water  the river and the lake narrator the flag 's images colors or pattern should relate to what it symbolizes tk the red stars represent significant events in chicago 's history rm 
 namely the founding of fort dearborn on the future site of chicago
  the great chicago fire 
 the world columbian exposition which everyone remembers because of the white city
  and the century of progress exposition  which no one remembers at all narrator 
 number three use two to three basic colors tk the basic rule for colors is to use two to three colors from the standard color set  red white blue green yellow and black rm 
 the design of the chicago flag has complete
  municipal building flies the flag whet moser there 's probably at least one store on every block near where i work that sells some sort of chicago flag paraphernalia rm that 's whet moser from chicago 
  magazine wm today just for example i went to get a haircut and when i sat down in the barber 's chair there was a chicago flag on the box that the barber kept all his tools in
  guy passed me who had a chicago flag badge on his backpack rm it 's adaptable and remixable the six pointed stars in particular show up in all kinds of places wm the coffee i bought the other day had a chicago star on it rm it
 's a distinct symbol of chicago pride tk when a police officer or a firefighter dies in chicago
  often it 's not the flag of the united states on his casket
  it can be the flag of the city of chicago  that 's how deeply the flag has gotten into the civic imagery of chicago rm 
 and it isn 't just that people love chicago and therefore love the flag i also think that people love chicago more because the flag is so cool tk 
 a positive feedback loop there between great symbolism
  so when i moved back to san francisco in two thousand and eight i researched its flag because i had never seen it
 in the previous eight years i lived there  and i found it  i am sorry to say sadly lacking
  keeping it simple narrator the flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory tk it 's a relatively complex flag rm 
 ok here we go ok  the main component of the san francisco flag is a phoenix representing the city rising from the ashes after the devastating fires of the 1850s tk 
 a powerful symbol for san francisco rm i
 still don 't really dig
  it manages to both be too crude and have too many details at the same time  which if you were trying for that you wouldn 't be able to do it  
 and it just looks bad at a distance but having deep meaning puts that element in the plus column behind the phoenix  the background is mostly white  
 and then it has a substantial gold border around it tk which is a very attractive design element
  never use writing of any kind 
 rm underneath the phoenix there 's a motto on a ribbon that translates to gold in peace  iron in war plus and this is the big problem it says san francisco across the bottom tk if you need to write the name of what you 're representing on
  in fact country flags they
 tend to behave like hats off to south africa and turkey and israel and somalia and japan and gambia  there 's a bunch of really great country flags  but they 
 obey good design principles because the stakes are high they 're on the international stage
  regional flags are another story 
 there is a scourge of bad flags and they must be stopped 
 that is the truth and that is the dare the first step is to recognize that we have a problem
  people tend to think that good design is just a matter of taste  and quite honestly sometimes it is actually  but sometimes it isn 't all right 
 here 's the full list of nava flag design principles
  four tk no lettering or seals narrator never use writing of any kind tk because you can 't read that at a distance narrator number five tk and be distinctive rm 
 all the best flags tend to stick to these principles and like i said before most country flags are ok but here 's the thing if you showed this list of principles to any designer of almost anything  they would say these principles
  deep meaning having few colors or being thoughtful about colors uniqueness don 't have writing you can 't read all those principles apply to them too 
 but sadly good design principles are rarely invoked in us city flags  our biggest problem seems to be that fourth one we just can 't stop ourselves from putting our names 
 on our flags  or little municipal seals with tiny writing on them here 's the thing about municipal seals they were designed to be on pieces of paper
  where you can read them not on flags one hundred feet away flapping in the breeze so here 's a bunch of flags again
 vexillologists call these sobs seals on a bedsheet and
 if you can 't tell what city they go to yeah  that 's exactly the problem except for anaheim apparently they fixed it 
 these flags are everywhere in the us
  us the european equivalent of the municipal seal is the is the city coat of arms 
 and this is where we can learn a lesson for how to do things right  so this is the city coat of arms of amsterdam  now if this were a united states city the flag would probably look like this you know yeah 
 but instead the flag of amsterdam looks
  rather than plopping the whole coat of arms on a solid background and writing amsterdam below it they
 just take the key elements of the escutcheon the shield  and they turn it into the most badass city flag in the world 
 and because it 's so badass those flags and crosses are found
  flags are particularly painful and offensive to me  nothing can quite prepare you for one of the biggest train wrecks in
  the city ran a contest and gathered a bunch of submissions with all kinds of designs sk and an alderman by the name of fred steffan
 cobbled together parts of the submissions to make what is
  's a kitchen sink flag there 's a gigantic gear representing industry there 's a ship recognizing the port a giant stalk of wheat paying homage to the brewing industry  it 's a hot mess  
 and steve kodis a graphic designer from milwaukee  wants to change it sk it
 's
 really awful  it 's a misstep
 on the city  's behalf to say the least rm but what puts the milwaukee flag over the top
  almost to the point of self parody is on it is a picture of the civil war battle flag of the milwaukee regiment 
 sk so that 's the final element in it that just makes it that much more ridiculous that there is a flag design within
  is a fantastic city  i 've been there i love it the most depressing part of this flag though 
 is that there have been two major redesign contests the last one was held in two thousand and one one hundred and five entries were received tk but in the end the members of the milwaukee arts board decided that none of the new entries were worthy of flying over the city rm 
 they couldn 't agree to change
 that thing
  you think that good design and democracy just simply do not go together 
 but steve kotas is going to try one more time to redesign the milwaukee flag sk 
 i believe milwaukee is a great city every great city deserves a great flag rm steve isn 't ready to reveal his design yet one of the things about
 proposing
  these things is you have to
 get people on board and then you reveal your design  but here 's the trick 
 if you want to design a great flag a kick ass flag like chicago 's or dc 's which also has a great flag  start by drawing 
  a one by one and a half inch rectangle on a piece of paper your design has to fit within that tiny rectangle here 's why  tk a three by five foot flag on a
 pole one hundred feet away
 looks about
  rectangle seen about fifteen inches from your eye you 'd be surprised by how compelling and simple the design can be
 when you hold yourself to that limitation rm meanwhile  back in san francisco is there anything we can do tk 
 i like to say that in every bad flag there 's a good flag trying to get
  the way to make san francisco 's flag a good flag is to take the motto off because you can 't read that at a distance take the name off 
 and the border might even be made thicker  so it 's more a part of the flag  and i would simply take the phoenix and make it a great big element in the middle of the flag rm 
 but the current phoenix that 's got to go tk 
 i would simplify or stylize the phoenix  depict a big wide winged bird coming out of flames  emphasize those flames
  this san francisco flag was designed by frank chimero based on ted kaye 's suggestions i don 't know what he would do if we was completely unfettered and didn
 't follow those guidelines fans of my radio show and podcast heard me complain about bad flags they 've sent me other suggested designs this one 's by neil mussett 
 both
 are so much better 
 and i think if they were adopted  i would see them around the city
  in my crusade to make flags of the world more beautiful 
 many listeners have taken it upon themselves to redesign their flags and look into the feasibility of getting them officially adopted 
 music if you see your city flag and like it  fly it  even if it violates a design rule or two  i don 't care  
 but if you don 't see your city flag  maybe it doesn 't exist  but maybe it does
  and
 i dare you to join the effort to try to change that 
 as we move more and more into cities the city flag will become not just a symbol of that city as a place  but also it could become a symbol of how that city considers design itself
  especially today as the populace is becoming more design aware and i think design awareness is
 all time high a well designed flag could be seen as an indicator of how a city considers all of its design systems its public transit 
 its parks its signage  it might seem frivolous  but it 's not tk 
 often when city leaders say we have more important things to do than worry about a city
  if you had a great city flag you would have a banner for people to rally under to face those more important things rm i 've
 seen firsthand what a good city flag can do in the case of chicago the marriage of good design and civic pride is something that we need in all places  the best part about municipal flags is that we own them  they are an
  when they are done well  they are remixable  adaptable and they are powerful we could control the branding and graphical imagery of our cities with a good flag  but instead 
 by having bad flags we don 't use we cede that territory to sports teams and chambers of commerce and tourism boards sports teams can leave and break our
 don 't really care about sports and tourism campaigns can just be cheesy
  but a great city flag is something that represents a city to its people and its people  to the world at large  and when that flag is a beautiful thing
  that connection is a beautiful thing
  so maybe all the city flags can be as inspiring as hong kong or portland or trondheim  and we can do away with all the bad flags like san francisco milwaukee  
 cedar rapids
  finally when we 're all done we can do something about pocatello idaho considered by the north american vexillological association
 as the worst city flag
 in north america
 that hurts me just to look at thank you so much for listening
