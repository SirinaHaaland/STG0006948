  i come to you today to speak of liars  lawsuits and laughter  
 the first time i heard about holocaust denial  i laughed
  the holocaust which has the dubious distinction of being the  best documented genocide in the world 
 who could believe it didn 't happen 
 think about it  
 for  deniers to be right who would have to be wrong  
 well first of all the victims the survivors who have told us their harrowing stories
  who else would have to be wrong  
 the bystanders  
 the people who lived in the myriads of towns and villages and cities on the eastern front  
 who watched their neighbors be rounded up men women children young  old
 and be marched to the outskirts of the town to be shot and left dead in ditches or the poles who lived
  towns and villages around the death camps 
 who watched day after day as the trains went in filled with people and came out empty 
 but above all who would have to be wrong  the perpetrators  the people who say we
  maybe they add a caveat  they say i didn 't have a choice i was forced to do it but nonetheless they say i did it 
 think about it 
 in not one war crimes trial since the end of world war ii has a perpetrator of any nationality
  it didn 't happen again they may have said i was forced but never that it didn 't happen  having thought that through i decided
 denial was not going to be on my agenda i had bigger things to worry about to write about to research  and i moved on
 a little over a decade  and two senior scholars two of
  most prominent historians of the holocaust approached me and said deborah let 's have coffee  we have a research idea that we think is perfect for you 
 intrigued and flattered that they came to me with an idea and thought me worthy of it i asked what is it 
 and they said holocaust denial 
 and for the second time i laughed holocaust denial  the flat earth folks the
 i should study them  
 and these two guys said yeah we 're intrigued 
 what are they about  what 's their objective how do they manage to get people to believe what they say 
 so thinking if they thought it was worthwhile i would take a momentary diversion
 maybe a year maybe two three maybe even four in academic
  terms that 's momentary we work very slowly 
 and i would look at them 
 so i did i did my research  and i came up with a number of things two of which i 'd like to share with you today 
 one
 are wolves in sheep 's clothing  they are the same nazis
 neo nazis you can decide whether you want to put a neo there or not but when i looked at them  i didn 't see
 any ss like uniforms
  symbols on the wall sieg heil salutes none of that what i found instead
 were people parading as respectable
  academics 
 what did they have they had an institute an institute for historical review 
 they had a journal a slick journal a journal of historical review one filled with papers 
  we are revisionists  we are out to do one thing to revise mistakes in history 
 but all you had to do was go one inch below the surface  
 and what did you find there the same adulation of hitler praise of the third
  third reich  anti semitism racism prejudice this is what intrigued me it was
  racism prejudice parading as rational discourse  
 the other thing i found many of us have been taught to think there are facts and there are opinions
  i think differently  there are facts there are opinions and there are lies  
 and what deniers want to do is take their lies  
 dress them up as opinions maybe edgy opinions maybe sort of out of the box opinions but then if they 're opinions they should be part of the conversation
  and then they encroach on the facts 
 i published my work the book was published denying the holocaust the growing assault on truth and memory it came out in many different countries including here 
 in penguin uk  and i was done with those folks and ready to move on 
  i opened the letter 
 and it informed me that david irving was bringing a libel suit against me in the united kingdom for calling him a holocaust denier 
 david irving suing me who was david irving david irving was a writer of historical works most
  them about world war ii and virtually all of those works
 took the position that the nazis were really not so bad  and the allies were really not so good  
 and the jews whatever happened to them they sort of deserved it  
 he knew the documents he knew the facts  but he somehow twisted them to get this opinion  
 he hadn 't always been a holocaust denier but in the late ' 80s he embraced it with great vigor
 reason i laughed also was this was a man
 who not only was a holocaust denier but seemed quite proud of it  
 here was a man and i quote who said i 'm going to sink the battleship auschwitz 
 here was a man who pointed to the number tattooed on a survivor 's arm and
  how much money have you made from having that number tattooed on your arm 
 here was a man who said more people died in senator kennedy 's car at chappaquiddick than died in gas chambers at auschwitz that 's an american reference but you can look it up 
 this was not a man who seemed at all ashamed or reticent about being a
  lots of my academic colleagues counseled me eh 
 deborah just ignore it when i explained you can 't just ignore a libel suit they said who 's going to believe him anyway 
 but here was the problem  british law put the onus put the burden of proof on me
 to prove the truth of what i said  in
 contrast to as it would have been in the united states and in many other countries on him to prove the falsehood 
 what did that mean that meant if i didn 't fight  
 he would win by default  
 and if he won by default he could then legitimately say my david irving version of the holocaust is a legitimate version 
  was found to have libeled me when she called me a holocaust denier ipso facto i david irving am not a holocaust denier and what is that version 
 there was no plan to murder the jews  
 there were no gas chambers there were no mass shootings hitler had nothing to do with any suffering that went on and the jews have made this all up
 to get money from germany and to get a state  and they 've done
  it with the aid and abettance of the allies they 've planted the documents and planted the evidence  i couldn 't let that stand
 and ever face a survivor
 or a child of survivors i couldn 't let that stand and consider myself a responsible
  so we fought  and for those of you who haven 't seen
  he distorted and most importantly  
 he did it deliberately  we showed a pattern in over twenty five different major instances not small things many of us in this audience write books are writing 
  books we always make mistakes that 's why we 're glad to have second editions  correct the mistakes 
 but these always moved in the same direction
 blame the jews  exonerate the nazis  but how did we win 
 what we did is follow his footnotes back to his sources  
 and what did we find not in most cases and not in the preponderance of cases  but in every
  someone put at a meeting who wasn 't there in other words he didn 't have the evidence his evidence didn 't prove it  
 we didn 't prove what happened 
 we proved that what he said happened and by extension all deniers because he either quotes them or they get
  arguments from him
 is not true what they claim they don 't have the evidence to prove it  
 so why is my story more than just the story of a quirky  long six year difficult lawsuit an american 
 professor being dragged into a courtroom by a man that the court declared in its judgment
 was a neo nazi polemicist  what message does it have 
 i think in the context of the question of truth it has a very significant message  
 because today as we well know truth and facts are under assault  
 social media for all the gifts it has given us has also allowed the difference between
  facts established facts
 and lies to be flattened  third of all extremism
  you may not see ku klux klan robes you may not see burning crosses you may not even hear outright white supremacist
  pick your names  but underneath it 's that same extremism that i found in holocaust denial parading as rational discourse  
 we live in an age where truth is on the defensive  i 'm reminded of a new yorker cartoon a quiz
  the host of the quiz show is saying to one of the contestants yes ma 'am you had the right answer  but your opponent yelled more loudly than you did so he gets the point 
 what can we do first of all we cannot be beguiled by rational
 appearances  we 've got to look underneath and we will find there the extremism second of all
  we must understand that truth
 is not relative 
 number three  we must go on the offensive not the defensive 
 when someone makes an outrageous claim even though they may hold one of the highest offices in the land if not the world
 we must say to them
 where 's the proof 
 where 's the evidence 
 we must hold their feet to the fire  we must not treat it as if their lies are the same as the facts 
 and as i said earlier truth is not relative 
 many of us have grown up in the world of the academy and enlightened liberal thought where we 're taught everything is open to debate
  but that 's not the case there are certain things that are true  there are indisputable facts
 objective truths  galileo taught it to us
 centuries ago even after being forced to recant by the vatican
 that the earth moved around the sun  he came out and what
  is he reported to have said and yet it still moves 
 the earth is not flat  the climate is changing  elvis is not alive
 assault  the job ahead of us the task ahead of us the challenge ahead of us is great 
 the time to fight is short  we must act
 now  later will be too late  thank you very much
