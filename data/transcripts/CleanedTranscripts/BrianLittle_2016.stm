  what an intriguing group of individuals you are to a psychologist 
 i 've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations
 and watching you interact with each other and i think it 's fair to say
  already that there are 
 people
 in this audience at this moment  displaying psychological symptoms i would like to discuss today 
 laughter and i thought you might like to know who you are 
 but instead of pointing at you which would be gratuitous and intrusive
  thought i would tell you a few facts and stories in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself  i 'm in the field of research known
 as personality psychology which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum  from neurons to narratives  
 and what we try to do 
 in our own way is to make sense
  of how each of us
 each of you is in certain respects like all other people like some other people
 and like no other person now already you may be saying of yourself i 'm not intriguing
 in the western hemisphere or you may say of yourself i am intriguing  
 even if i am regarded by most people as a great
 why this is so 
 one of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed and that describe
 universally
 held aspects of difference between
  in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life
  in contrast to those who are more stable 
 all of these dimensions have implications for our well being for how our life goes  
 and so we know that for example  openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors
 of life success  but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and occasionally odd
 the conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines to persevering as well as having some passion
 extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people 
 extroverts for example  i
 find intriguing with my classes i sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality  
 i tell them that it is virtually impossible
 for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow 
 did you know that
 already some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow  but extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried  but they have
  successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them 
 those are the extroverts  
 let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion because it 's consequential and it 's intriguing and it helps us understand
 what i call our three natures first our biogenic nature our neurophysiology 
  or second nature which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives and third what makes you
 individually you
 idiosyncratic what i call your idiogenic nature let me explain 
 one of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation
  and that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting  loud noises  parties and social events here at ted you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core they all gather together and i 've seen you 
 the introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor 
 where they are able to
 reduce stimulation and may be misconstrued as being antisocial  but you 're not
  necessarily antisocial  it may be that you simply realize that you do better
 when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation sometimes it 's an
 internal stimulant  
 from your body  caffeine for example works much better with extroverts than it does introverts when extroverts come into the office at nine o 'clock in the morning and
  say i really need a cup of coffee they 're not kidding they really do 
 introverts do not do as well particularly if the tasks they 're engaged in
 and they 've had some coffee if those tasks are speeded and if they 're quantitative introverts may give the appearance of
  so here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing  we 're not always what seem to be  and that takes me to my next
 point 
 i should say  before getting to this something about sexual intercourse  although i may not have time and so
  if you would like me to yes you would ok 
 there are studies done on the frequency with which
  individuals engage in the conjugal act  
 as broken down by male female introvert extrovert so i ask you how many times per minute
 oh i 'm sorry that was a rat study 
 how many times per month
  extroverted men more or less  yes more five point five almost twice as much 
 introverted women three point one  extroverted women  frankly speaking as an introverted male  which i will explain
  they not only handle all the male extroverts they pick up a few introverts as well 
 we communicate differently  extroverts and introverts extroverts
 when they interact want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness they 'd like to stand close for comfortable communication  
 they like to have a lot of eye contact or mutual gaze
  we found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody  so when an extrovert meets
 a charles it rapidly becomes
  he 's given a pass to be more intimate
 by the person he 's talking to we speak differently  
 extroverts prefer
 concrete simple language introverts prefer and i must again tell you
 that i am as extreme an
  introvert as you could possibly imagine we speak differently we prefer contextually complex contingent
 we sometimes talk past each other  
 i had a consulting contract i shared with a colleague who 's as different from me as two people can possibly be  first his name is tom
  mine isn 't 
 secondly he 's six foot five i have a tendency not to be 
 and thirdly he 's as extroverted a person as you could find i am seriously
 i overload so much i can 't even have a cup of coffee
 after
 three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening we had seconded to this project a fellow called michael 
 and michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt  so the person who seconded him asked tom and me
  what do you make of michael well i 'll tell you what tom said in a minute he spoke in classic 
 and here is how extroverted ears heard what i said which is actually pretty accurate i said well michael
 does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see
 as perhaps more assertive than is normally
  called for 
 tom rolled his eyes and he said brian that 's what i said  
 he 's an asshole 
 now as an introvert i might gently allude to to certain assholic
  in this man 's behavior but i 'm not going to lunge for the a word but
 the extrovert says if he walks like one if he talks like one i call him one and we go past each other  
 now is this something
 that we should be heedful of of course it 's important that we know this is that all we are are we just a bunch of traits
  remember you 're like some other people
 and like no other person how about that idiosyncratic you as elizabeth
 or as george you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism 
 but are there some distinctively elizabethan features of your behavior
  or georgian of yours 
 that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits  that make us love you 
 not just because you 're a certain type of person  i 'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes  
 i don 't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes  so what is it that makes us different
  it 's the doings that we have in our life the personal projects you have a personal project right now but 
 nobody may know it here it relates to your kid you 've been back three times to the hospital and they still don 't know what 's wrong 
 or it could be your mom and you 'd been acting out of character
  these are free traits you
 're very agreeable  but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital to get something for your mom
 or your child  what are these free traits  they 're where we enact a script
 in order to advance a core project in our lives  and they are what matters don 't ask people what type you are ask them
  projects in your life and we enact those free traits  i 'm an introvert  but i have a core project which is
 to profess  i 'm a professor  and i adore my students  
 and i adore my field and i can 't wait
 to tell them about what 's new what 's exciting what i can 't wait to tell
  them about and so i act in an extroverted way because at eight in the morning the students need a little bit of humor a little bit of engagement
 to keep them going in arduous days of study  but we need to be very careful
 when we act
 out of character sometimes we may find that we don 't take care of ourselves
  example after a period of
  behavior  i need to repair somewhere on my own 
 as susan cain said in her quiet book 
 in a chapter that featured the strange canadian professor who was teaching at the time at harvard
  i sometimes go to the men 's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts
  particular day when i was retired to a cubicle  trying to avoid 
 and a real extrovert came in beside me
 not right in my cubicle but in the next cubicle over and i could hear various evacuatory noises which we hate even our own
  if anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert
 for six months it 's talking on the john 
 that 's where i 'm going now  don 't follow me  thank you
