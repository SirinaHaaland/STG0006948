  the way i feel right now is that all of the other
  speakers have said exactly what i wanted to say 
 and it seems that the only thing left for me to say is to thank you all for your kindness
  but maybe in the spirit of appreciating the kindness of you all i could share with you a little story about myself
  from the time i was very young  onward
  i was given a lot of different responsibilities  
 and it always seemed to me when i was young that everything was laid out before me all of the plans for me were already made  
 i was given the clothes that i needed to wear and told where i needed to be 
 given these
 very precious and holy looking
  robes to wear with the understanding that it was something sacred or important
  but before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me
 i was living in eastern tibet with my family  and when i was seven years old all of a sudden a search party arrived at my home 
 they were looking the next
  i noticed they were talking to my mom and dad and the news came to me that they were telling me that i was the karmapa  
 and these days people ask me a lot how did that feel how did that feel when they came and whisked you away  and your lifestyle completely changed 
 and what i mostly say is that at that time it was a pretty interesting idea to me i thought that
  things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with
  but it didn 't turn out to be so fun and entertaining as i thought it would have been i was placed in a pretty strictly controlled environment
  lot of different responsibilities in terms of my education and so forth were heaped upon me 
 i was separated largely from my family including my mother and father  i didn 't have have many personal friends to spend time with but i was expected to perform these
 prescribed duties  so it turned out that my
 fantasy about an entertaining life of being the karmapa wasn 't going to come true it more
 felt to be the case to me that i was being treated like a statue  and i was to sit in one place like a statue would
  i felt that even though i 've been separated from my loved ones and of course now
 i 'm even further away  when i was fourteen i escaped from tibet and became even further removed from my mother and father 
 my relatives my friends and my homeland
 but nevertheless  there 's no real sense of separation from me in my heart in terms of the love that i feel
 for these people i feel still a very strong connection of love for all of these people and for the land
  and i still do get to keep in touch with my mother and father albeit infrequently
 i talk to my mother once in a blue moon on the telephone 
 and my experience is that when i 'm talking to her with every second that passes during our conversation 
 the feeling of love that binds us
 is bringing us closer and closer together
  so those were just a few remarks
 about my personal background and in terms of other things that i wanted to share with you in terms of ideas i think it 's
 wonderful to have a situation like this where so many people from different backgrounds and places can come together  exchange their ideas and form relationships of friendship with each other  
 and i think that 's symbolic of what we 're seeing in the world in general that the world is becoming smaller and smaller and that all of the peoples in the world are enjoying more opportunities for connection
  that 's wonderful but we should also remember
 that we should have a similar process happening on the inside along with outward development and increase of opportunity 
 there should be inward development and deepening of our heart connections as well as our outward connections  
 so
 we spoke and we heard some about design this
  week i think that it 's important for us to remember that we need to keep pushing forward
 on the endeavor of the design of the heart we heard a lot about technology this week and it 's important for us to remember to
 invest a lot of our energy in improving the technology of the heart
  even though i 'm somewhat happy about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world  still i feel a sense of impediment when it comes to
 the ability that we
  have to connect with each other on a heart to heart or a mind to mind level i feel that there are some things that are getting in the way
  is an interesting one because as a spiritual leader i 'm always attempting to open my heart to others and
 offer myself up for heart to heart and mind to mind connections in a genuine way with other people  
 but at the same time i 've always been advised that i need to emphasize intelligence over the heart to heart connections  because 
 being someone in a position like mine
  't rely primarily on intelligence then something dangerous may happen to me  so it 's an interesting paradox at play there  but
 i had
 a really striking experience once when a group from afghanistan came to visit me  and we had a
  really interesting conversation
  so we ended up talking about the bamiyan buddhas  which as you know were destroyed some years ago in afghanistan
 but the basis of our conversation was the different approach to spirituality on the part of the
 muslim and buddhist traditions of course in muslim  
 because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry you don 't find as many physical representations of divinity
 or of
 spiritual liberation as you do in the buddhist tradition where of course there are many statues of the buddha that are
 highly revered  so we were talking about the differences between the traditions and
 what many people perceived as the tragedy of the destruction of the bamiyan buddhas  
 but i offered the suggestion that perhaps we could look at this in a positive way
 what we saw in the destruction of the bamiyan buddhas was
 the depletion of matter 
 some solid substance falling down and disintegrating maybe we could look at that to be more similar to the falling of the berlin wall 
 where a divide that had kept two types of people apart had collapsed and opened up a door for further communication  
 so i think that in this way it
  possible for us to derive something positive that can help us understand one another better
  with regard to the development that we 've been talking about here at this conference  i really feel that
 the development that we make shouldn 't create a further burden for us as human beings but should be used to
 improve our fundamental lifestyle of how we
  of course i rejoice in the development and the growth and the rise of the noble land of india the great country of india  
 but at the same time i think as some of us have acknowledged
  acknowledged we need to be aware that some aspects of this rise are
 coming at the cost of the very
 ground on which we stand so as we are climbing the tree some of the things that we 're
 doing in order to climb the tree are actually undermining the tree 's very root and so
 what i think it comes down to is a question of not only having information of what 's going on 
 but paying attention to that and letting that
 shift our motivation to become more sincere and genuinely positive 
  this week about the horrible sufferings for example that so many women of the world
 are enduring day to day 
 we have that information but what often happens to us is that we don 't really choose to pay attention to it we don 't really choose to allow that to cause there to be a shift in our hearts 
 so i think the way forward for the world
 one that will bring the path of outer development in harmony with
 the real root of happiness is that we
 allow the information that we have to really make a change in our heart
  so i think that sincere motivation is very important for our future well being or deep sense of well being as humans  
 and i think that means sinking in to whatever it is you 're doing now whatever
  work you 're trying to do now to benefit the world  sink into that get a full taste of that
  since we 've been here this week  we 've taken millions of breaths collectively
 we haven 't witnessed any course changes happening in our lives but
 we often miss the very subtle changes  and i think that
 sometimes we develop grand concepts of what happiness might look like for us but that if we
 pay attention we can see that there are little symbols of happiness in every breath that we take
  every one of you who has
 come here is so talented and you have so much to offer to the world
  i think it would be a good note to conclude on then to just take a moment to
 appreciate how fortunate we are to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas
 and really form a strong aspiration and energy within ourselves that we will take the good
 that has come from this conference the momentum the positivity  and we will
  spread that and plant it in all of the corners of the world
  lakshmi has worked incredibly hard  even in inviting me let alone everything else that she has done to make this happen  and i was
 somewhat resistant
  at times  and i was also
 very nervous throughout this week i was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth and people would ask me why  i would tell them it 's because i have to talk tomorrow 
 and
 so lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that  but i very much appreciate the opportunity
  she 's given me to be here
