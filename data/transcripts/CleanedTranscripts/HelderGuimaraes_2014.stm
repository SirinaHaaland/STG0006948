  like to start my performance by saying ninety percent of everything is crap 
 it 's called sturgeon 's law and what that means is that the majority of anything is always bad
  have a giraffe here  i 'm going to throw the giraffe behind my back and whoever catches it is going to help me on this next thing  
 sir  you caught the giraffe  i have a playing card in my hand  
 freely name
 any card in the deck audience member ten of
  you could have named any card in the deck but you said the ten of hearts  ninety percent of everything is crap so there 's this to prove that sturgeon was
 correct
  keep the giraffe for a moment okay  
 jesus 
 crazy people well 
 the truth is 
 why is the majority of everything bad and my answer is i think we stop thinking too soon  
 i 'll give you a clear little example something that
  people used to do around the turn of the century not this century the other one the idea was to take
 a piece of paper and fold it inside out using only your weaker hand in my case the left hand something that would look
 like
  's okay i understand why we stop thinking too soon  but if we give it a little bit more thought like a paper clip a paper clip makes this
 a little bit more interesting not only that if instead of using my hand with the fingers
  use my hand closed into a fist that makes this even a little bit more interesting not only that but i will impose myself a time limit of one second something that would look like
 this 
 now no no no sturgeon may
  but he doesn 't have to be correct forever things can always change sir what was the card the ten of hearts 
 there 's this to prove that things can always
 change the ten of hearts 
 secrets are important 
 and secrets are valuable  and this is the best secret i 've
 ever experienced  it starts with a deck of cards onto the table an old man and a claim i will not
 touch the deck till the end 
 it doesn 't matter who the man was all that matters was that sentence ringing in my head 
 i will not touch the deck till the end now during all this time
  was holding a small notebook that sometimes he would open and flip through the pages and look at something but i was not really paying attention
 to the book because i was paying attention the deck and the claim he had made before i will not
 touch the deck till the end now sir you have the giraffe go ahead  throw it in any direction so that you can find someone else at random
  perfect sir  you 're going to play my role in this story  the old man turned to me and he said you could pick a red card or a black card my answer was
  could be a high spade or a low spade and my answer was audience member two a high spade hg 
 indeed  
 it was a high spade since it 's a high spade it could be a nine a ten a jack king queen or the ace of spades  and my answer was
  selected spade  you selected the high spade  and you selected sorry audience member two king hg king of spades did you feel i influenced you in any decision audience member two 
 no i just felt your energy hg 
 but it was a free choice correct  because if not we could start all over again but it was really fair audience member two absolutely hg now  the old man turned to me and he asked me one more
  it was the seventeen  the old man only said one more thing this is the end 
 and i knew exactly what that meant i knew that he was going to touch the deck  
 everything that you 're about to see
 is exactly
 it looked he took the deck out of the box nothing in the box  he counted
  and on the seventeen instead of the king of spades  something
 appeared in the middle of the deck that later  i would realize
  the old man stood up he left i never saw him again  but he left his notebook
 that was there from the beginning and when i picked it up that was the best secret
 i 've ever
 experienced we are defined
 by the secrets we keep and by the secrets we share
  and this was his way of sharing a secret with me
  all the time i really do and the reason why we don 't see them as often it 's because we don 't place ourselves in a position
 to search for those amazing things  
 but what if what if we decided to search for those amazing things for those small coincidences in life
 that are truly amazing so you have the giraffe
 go ahead throw it in any direction so you find one last person at random  
 sir  
 i 'm going to ask you do you have with you a united states $ one bill audience member three 
 i think so hg yes  you see a coincidence
  i want you to do exactly the same thing i am about to do  i have a dollar bill here to explain i want you to take the dollar bill and fold the washington part
 inside like this so you get this kind of big square okay  now i want you to take the bill and fold it like this lengthwise so it becomes
  really fold it really crease it and when you have it  please fold the bill again into a little square like this and let me know when you have it 
 do you have it perfect now  i 'm going to approach  
 and before we start i want to make sure that we do this in very very serious conditions first of all  i want to ensure that we have a marker and we have a paper
  first of all take the marker and go ahead and sign the bill and this is the reason why later  i 'm going to be doing a bunch of stuff on stage and i don 't want you to think oh 
  while i was distracted by helder someone came onstage and swapped the bill so i want to make sure it 's exactly the same bill now not only that i want you to take the paper clip and put it around 
 the bill  so even if nobody comes onstage and switches the bill i don 't have enough time to go open the bill and close it and see what i don 't want to see is that fair
 now you can give me the marker back and just like that very clearly  i want to make sure that we place this in full view from the beginning
 of this experience
 and to make sure that everyone is going to see it we 're going to actually have a camera man onstage yes  perfect so that you can see that 's your signature  yes  perfect now we 're going to use also
 the deck and
 a glass
 for this and we 're going to put ourselves in a position
 to search for an amazing coincidence do you mind can you help me with this go ahead and take some cards and shuffle and  do you mind can you take some cards and shuffle 
  you can shuffle cards in a variety of ways you can shuffle cards like this 
 you can shuffle cards in a more messed up way something like this you can shuffle cards in the american way as a portuguese i don 't feel entitled to teach you guys how to do it 
 but the important part is after shuffling the cards always remember to cut
 and complete the cards do you mind doing that for me sir  please cut and complete and when you have it place the cards up in the air  and you too cut and complete and up in the air up in the air
  and five people now very clearly i 'm going to gather the deck together  
 and just like that i 'm going to search
 for a coincidence
 in front of everyone i 'm
 going to try
 i have some cards
 that maybe maybe they don 't mean anything 
 but maybe that 's because we are not paying close attention 
 because maybe maybe they mean a lot before we start sir you gave me a dollar bill 
 is that your signature
 audience member three yes it is hg i want you to see very clearly  that i 'm going to open your bill
 and reveal
 a small secret that we created and the secret of this dollar bill is the serial number  
  can you take the dollar bill in the serial number there is a letter what is the first number after the letter
  q like in queen
  's my show thank you very much and have a nice night
