  there 's this quote by activist and punk rock musician jello biafra that i love he says don 't hate the media  be the media 
 i 'm an artist  i
  like working with media and technology because
 a i 'm familiar with them and i like the power they hold  and b  i hate them and i 'm terrified of the power they hold 
 i remember watching in two thousand and three an interview between fox news host tony snow and 
 defense secretary donald rumsfeld 
 they were talking about the recent invasion of iraq  and rumsfeld is asked the question well we 're hear about our body counts
  but we never hear about theirs  why and rumsfeld 's answer is 
 well  we don 't do body counts on other people 
 it 's estimated that between one hundred and fifty thousand to one million iraqis civilians have died as a result of the us led invasion in two thousand and three 
 that number
 is in stark contrast with the four thousand four hundred and eighty six us service members who died during that same window of time  
 i wanted to do more than just bring awareness to this terrifying number  
 i wanted to create a monument for the individual civilians who died as a result of the invasion  
 monuments to war such as maya lin 's vietnam memorial are often enormous in scale
  powerful and very one sided i wanted my monument
 to live in the world and to circulate  i remember when i was a boy
 in school my teacher assigned us this classic civics assignment
 where you take a sheet of paper and you write a member of your government  and we were told if we wrote a really good letter if we really thought about it
  get back more than just a simple formed letter as a reply 
 this is my notepad 
 what looks like an everyday yellow legal tablet of paper is actually a monument to the individual iraqi civilians that died as a result of the us invasion 
  an act of protest and an act of commemoration
 disguised as an everyday tablet of paper 
 the lines of the paper  
 when magnified are revealed to be micro printed text that contains the details the names the dates and locations of individual iraqi civilians that died 
 so for the last five
 i 've been taking pads of this paper tons of this stuff and smuggling it into the
 stationery supplies of the united states and the coalition governments i
 don 't have to tell you guys this is not the place to discuss how i did that
  former members of the so called coalition of the willing who assisted in the invasion  
 and so  whenever i can i meet with one of them and i share the project with them and last summer i had the chance to meet with
 former united states attorney general and torture memo author  alberto gonzales matt kenyon may
  you won 't believe me  but it 's in the collection of the museum of modern art  i 'm an artist mk and all of the lines of the paper are actually ag are they going to disappear
  the way he says thank you really creeps me out 
 laughter ok so i 'd like each of you to look under your chairs there 's an envelope  
 and please open it 
 the paper you 're holding in your hand
 contains the details of iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion 
 i 'd like you to use this paper
 and write a member of government you can help to smuggle this
 civilian body count into government archives
  because every letter that 's sent in to the government and this  this is all across the world of course
 every letter that is sent in
 is archived filed and recorded together we can put this in the mailboxes and under the noses
 of people in power everything that 's sent in eventually becomes
 part of the permanent archive of
  how did this idea come into your head of
  of the war
 and it was a black armband
 that was called the improvised empathetic device which accumulated 
 in real time the names  ranks  cause of death and location of us service members who had died overseas  and
 each time the department of defense or centcom released their data it would stab me in the
  i became aware that there was a spectacle associated with our own people who were dying overseas  but a disproportionate amount of casualties were the civilian casualties tr
 thank you so much
