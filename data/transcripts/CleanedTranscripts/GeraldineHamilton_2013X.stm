  in our hands today and that is that the way we currently discover and develop new drugs
 is too costly  takes far
  and it fails more often than it succeeds 
 it really just isn 't working  
 and that means that patients that badly need new therapies are not getting them and diseases are going
 we seem to be spending more and more money  so for every billion dollars we spend in r & d we 're getting less drugs approved into the market 
 more money  
 less drugs
 so what 's going on here  
 well there 's a multitude of factors at play  but i think one of the key factors is that the tools that we currently have available to test whether a drug 
 is going to work whether it has efficacy or whether it 's going to be safe before we get it into human clinical
  not predicting what 's going to happen in humans  and we have two main tools available at our disposal they are
 cells in dishes and animal testing now let 's talk about the first one 
 cells in dishes so cells are happily functioning in our bodies  
 we take them and rip them out of their native environment  throw them in one of these dishes and expect them to work guess what 
 they don 't
 they don 't like that environment because it 's nothing like what they have in the body what about animal testing  well animals
 do and can provide extremely useful information they teach us about what happens in the complex organism 
 we learn more about the biology itself 
  more often than not animal models fail to predict what will happen in humans when they 're treated with a particular drug 
 so we need better tools 
 we need human cells  but we need to find a way to keep them happy outside the body 
 our  bodies are dynamic environments we 're in constant motion 
 our cells experience that they 're in dynamic environments in our body  they 're under constant
  mechanical forces  so if we want to make cells happy outside our bodies we need to become cell architects we need to
 design  build and engineer a home away from home for the cells 
 and at the wyss institute we 've done just that we call it an
  it but it 's pretty incredible right here in my hand
 is a breathing living
 human lung on a chip  
 and it 's not just beautiful  it can do a tremendous amount of things we have living cells in that little chip 
 cells that are in a dynamic environment interacting with different cell types
  to grow cells in the lab  they 've tried many different approaches  
 they 've even tried to grow little mini organs in the lab  we 're not trying to do that here we 're simply trying to recreate in this tiny chip
 the smallest
 functional
 unit that represents the biochemistry the function and the mechanical strain that the cells experience in our bodies
  how does it work  
 let me show you we use techniques from the computer chip manufacturing industry to make these structures at a scale relevant to both the cells and their environment  we have three  fluidic channels 
 in the center  we have a porous  flexible membrane on which we can add human cells
  they had capillary cells the cells in our blood vessels  
 and we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip that stretch and contract the membrane  so the cells experience the same mechanical forces that they did
 when we breathe
 and they experience them how they did in the body there
 's air flowing through the top channel  and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients through the blood channel
  now the chip is really beautiful  but what can we do with it 
 we can get incredible functionality inside these little chips let me show you  we could for example  mimic infection  where we add bacterial cells into the lung 
 then we can add human white blood cells white
 blood cells are our body 's
 defense against bacterial invaders and when they sense this inflammation due to infection  they will enter from the blood into the lung and engulf the bacteria  
 well now you 're going to see this happening live in an actual human lung on a chip  we 've labeled the white blood cells so you can see them flowing through  and when they detect that infection they begin to stick  they stick  
 and then they try to go into the lung side from blood channel
  and you can see here  we can actually visualize
 a single
 white blood cell 
 it sticks it wiggles its way through between the cell layers through the pore  comes out on the other side of the membrane  
 and right there it 's going to engulf the bacteria labeled in green in
  you just witnessed one of the most fundamental responses
 our body has to an infection it 's the way we respond
 to an immune response it 's pretty exciting  
 now i want to share this picture with you not just because it 's so beautiful  
 but because it tells us an enormous amount of information about what the cells are doing within the chips it tells us that these
 cells from the small airways in our lungs actually have these
 hairlike structures that you would expect to see in the lung these structures are called cilia and they actually move the mucus out of the lung  yeah mucus  yuck  but mucus
  is actually very important mucus traps particulates  viruses potential allergens and these little cilia move and clear the mucus out 
  by cigarette smoke for example  they don 't work properly and they can 't clear that mucus out  and that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis 
 cilia and the clearance of mucus are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis  
 but now with the functionality that we get in these chips we can begin to look
 for potential new treatments we didn 't stop with the lung on a chip  we have a gut on a chip you can see one right
  here  and we 've put intestinal human cells
 in a gut on a chip  and they 're under constant peristaltic motion  this trickling flow through the cells 
 and we can mimic many of the functions that you actually would expect to see in the human intestine  now we can begin to create models of diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome
  this is a disease that affects
 a large number of individuals it 's really debilitating  and there aren 't really many good treatments for it 
 now we have a whole pipeline of different organ chips that we are currently working on in our labs  
 now the true power of this
  really comes from the fact that we can fluidically link them there 's fluid flowing across these cells so we can begin to interconnect multiple different chips together
 to form what we call a virtual human on a chip  now we 're really getting excited
  we 're not going to ever recreate a whole human in these chips but what our goal is is to be able to recreate sufficient functionality
 so that we can make better predictions of what 's going to happen in humans for example now we can begin
 to explore what happens when we put a drug like an aerosol drug those of you like me who have asthma when you take your inhaler  we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs how it enters the body how it might affect
  change the beating of your heart does it have a toxicity 
 does it get cleared by the liver is it metabolized in the liver is it excreted in your kidneys  we can begin to study the dynamic response of the body to a drug 
 this could really revolutionize and be a game changer for not only the pharmaceutical industry 
 but a whole host of different industries  including the cosmetics industry we can
 potentially use the skin on a chip that we 're currently
  developing in the lab to test whether the ingredients in those products that you 're using are actually safe to put on your skin without the need for animal testing  
 we could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment such as chemicals in regular household cleaners  
 we could also use the organs on chips
 for applications in bioterrorism
 or radiation exposure  we could use them to learn more about
  such as ebola or other deadly diseases such as
 sars  organs on chips could also change the way we do clinical trials in the future right now 
 the average participant in a clinical trial is that average
  to be middle aged  tends to be female 
 you won 't find many clinical trials in which children are involved  yet every day we give children medications 
 and the only safety data we have on that drug
 is one that we obtained from adults children are not adults they may not respond in the same way adults do 
 there are other things like genetic differences in
  populations that may lead
 to at risk populations that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction  now imagine if we could take cells from all those different populations put them on chips and create populations on a chip  
 this could really change the way we do clinical trials  
 and this is the team and the people that are doing this we have engineers we have cell biologists
  we have clinicians all working together  
 we 're really seeing something quite incredible at the wyss institute it 's really a convergence of disciplines where biology is influencing the way we design 
 the way we engineer the way we build it 's pretty exciting  
 we 're establishing important industry collaborations such as the one we have with a company that has expertise
 in large scale digital manufacturing  
 they 're going to help us make instead of one of these  millions of these chips so that we can get them into the hands of as many researchers as possible  and this is key to the potential of that technology  
 now let me show you our instrument this is an instrument
  that our engineers are actually prototyping right now in the lab and this instrument is going to give us the engineering controls that we 're going to require in order to link
 ten or more organ chips together it
 does something else that 's very important it creates an easy user interface  so a cell biologist like me can come in 
 take a chip  put it in a cartridge like the prototype you see there put the cartridge into the machine just like you would a c d and away you go  plug and play
  play  easy  now let 's imagine a little bit what the future might look like if i could take your stem cells and put them on a chip
 or your stem cells and put them on a chip  it would be a personalized chip just for you  now all of us in here
 are individuals  and those individual differences mean that we could react very differently
 and sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs i myself a couple of years back had a really bad headache just couldn 't shake it
  fatal  so how do we prevent them well  we could imagine one day
 having geraldine on a chip having danielle on a chip  having you on a chip  personalized medicine  thank you
