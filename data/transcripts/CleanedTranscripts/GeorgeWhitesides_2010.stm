  most of the talks that you 've heard in the last several fabulous days have been from people who have the characteristic that they have thought about something they are
  they know what 's going on 
 all of you know about the topic that i 'm supposed to talk about that is you know what simplicity is you know what complexity is 
 the trouble is i don 't  
 and what i 'm going to do is share with you my ignorance on this subject 
 i want you to read this because we 're going to come back to it in a moment  the
 quote is from the fabled potter stewart
 opinion on
 pornography  
 and let me just read it  the important details here 
 shorthand description [ ' hardcore pornography ' ] and perhaps i could never succeed in intelligibly defining it  but i know it when i see it i 'm going to come back to that in a moment
  so what is
  good to start with some examples  
 a coffee cup we don 't think about coffee cups  but it 's much more interesting than one might think a coffee cup is a device   
 which has a container and a handle  the handle enables you to hold it when the container is filled with hot liquid
 why is that important well it enables you to drink coffee but also by the way the coffee is hot the liquid is sterile you 're not likely to get cholera
 so the coffee cup or the cup with a handle is one of the tools used by society to maintain public health 
 scissors are your clothes  glasses enable you to see things and keep you from being eaten by cheetahs or run down by automobiles 
 and books are after all your education
  but there 's another class of simple things  which are also very important simple in function  but not at all simple in how they 're constructed  
 and the two here are just examples one is the cellphone  which we use every day  and it rests on a complexity  which has some characteristics 
 very different from those that my friend benoit mandelbrot discussed but are very interesting 
  fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices  
 so there are two ways of thinking about this word i think and here i 've corrupted the potter stewart quotation
 by saying that we can think about something which spans all the way from scissors to
 the cell phone internet and birth control pills
 by saying that they 're simple the functions are simple and we recognize what that simplicity is when we see it  or
 there may be another way of doing it  which is to think about the problem in terms of what
 if you associate with
 moral philosophers is called the teapot problem
 the teapot problem i 'll pose this way  suppose you see a teapot  and the teapot is
 filled with hot water 
 and you then ask the question why is the water hot and that 's a simple question  it 's like what is simplicity one answer would
  because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high and they bounce against things rapidly that 's a kind of physical science argument 
 a second argument would be because it was sitting on a stove
 with the flame on that 's an historical argument a third is that i wanted hot water for
 tea that 's an intentional argument  
 and  since this is coming from a moral philosopher the fourth would be that it 's part of god 's plan for the universe all of these are possibilities the point is that you get
  into trouble when you ask a single question with a single box for an answer in which that single question actually is many questions with quite different meanings  but with the same words 
 asking what is simplicity i think falls in that category what is the state of science and
  is very highly evolved we have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is 
 simplicity  for reasons that are a little bit obscure 
 is almost not pursued at least in the academic world 
 we academics i am an academic we love complexity  you can write papers about complexity and the nice thing about complexity is it 's fundamentally intractable in many ways  so you 're not responsible for outcomes
 really would like your waring blender in the morning to make whatever a waring blender does but not explode or play beethoven you 're not interested in the limits of these things  
 so what one is interested in has a lot to do with the rewards of the system and there 's a lot of rewards in thinking about complexity and emergence
  not so much in thinking about simplicity 
 one of the things i want to do is to help you with a very important task which you may not know that you have very often which is to understand 
 how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party and have a conversation 
  all right what is complexity in this view of things and what is emergence  
 we have actually a pretty good working definition of complexity 
 it is a system like traffic  which has components the components interact with one another these are cars and drivers they dissipate energy  it turns out that whenever you have that
  weird stuff happens and you in los angeles probably know this better than anyone 
 here 's another example  which i put up because it 's an example of really important current science  you can 't possibly read that it 's not intended that you read it 
 but that 's a tiny part of the chemical reactions going on in each of your cells at any given moment  
 and
  's like the traffic that you see the amazing thing about the cell is that it actually does maintain a fairly stable working relationship with other cells 
 but we don 't know why anyone who tells you that we understand life 
 walk away
  and let me reduce this to the simplest level  we 've heard from bill gates recently  all of us to some extent study this thing called a bill gates 
  you learn everything you can about that 
 and then there 's another kind of thing that you might study and you study that hard that 's a bono this is a bono
  but then if you know everything you can know about those two things and you put them together 
 what can you say about this combination 
 the answer is not a lot and that 's complexity now imagine building that up to a city or to a society and you 've got obviously an
  so let me give you an example of simplicity of a particular kind  
 and i want to introduce a word that i think is very useful which is stacking  
 and i 'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity that has the characteristic that it is so simple and so reliable that i can build things with it or
 i 'm going to use simple to mean reliable predictable
  and i 'm going to use as an example the internet because it 's a particularly good example of stacked simplicity 
 we call it a complex system which it is but it 's also something else 
 the internet starts with mathematics it starts with binary  
 and if you look at the list of things on the bottom  we are familiar with the arabic numbers one to ten and so
  on in binary one is one seven is one hundred and eleven 
 the question is  why is binary simpler than arabic  and the answer is simply that if i hold up three fingers  you can count that easily  
 but if i hold up this it 's sort of hard to say that i just did seven  
 the virtue of binary is that it 's the simplest possible way of representing numbers
 anything else is more complicated
  you can catch errors with it it 's unambiguous in its reading there are lots of good things about binary  
 so it is very very simple once you learn how to read it
  now  if you like to represent this zero and one of binary  you need a device  and
 think of things in your life that are binary  one of them is light switches  they can be on and off
  that 's binary  
 now wall switches we all know fail  
 but our friends who are condensed matter physicists managed to come up some fifty years ago 
 with a very nice device shown under that bell jar  which is a transistor 
 a transistor is nothing more than a wall switch  it turns things on and off  but it does so without moving parts and it doesn 't fail basically for a very long period of time
  second layer of simplicity was the transistor in the internet  
 so  since the transistor is so simple  you can put lots of them together 
 and you put lots of them together and you come with something called integrated circuits 
 and a current integrated circuit might have in each one of these chips something like a billion transistors all of which have to work perfectly every time  
 so that 's the next layer of
  simplicity and in fact integrated circuits are really simple in the sense that they in general work really well 
 with integrated circuits  you can build cellphones 
 you all are accustomed to having your cellphones work the large majority of the time in boston boston is a little bit like namibia in its cell phone coverage 
 so that we 're not accustomed to that all the time but some of the time
  if you have cell phones  you can now go to this nice lady
 who 's somewhere like namibia  and who is extremely happy with the fact that although she does not have an master 's degree in electrical engineering
 from mit she 's nonetheless able to hack her cell phone to get power in some funny way
  and from that comes the internet and this is a map of bitflows across the continent the two blobs that are
  in the middle there are the united states and europe and then back to simplicity again 
 so here we have what i think is one of the great ideas which is google which in this simple portal
 makes the claim that it makes accessible all of the world 's information  
 but the point is that that extraordinary simple idea rests on layers
 simplicity each compounded into a complexity that is itself simple in the sense that it is completely reliable 
 all right  let me then finish off with four
 general statements an example and two aphorisms  the
 characteristics which i think are useful to think about for simple things
 they are predictable 
 their behavior is predictable  now  one of the nice characteristics of simple things is you know what it 's going to do in general  
 so simplicity and predictability are characteristics of simple things 
 the second is and this is a real world statement  they 're cheap
  if you have things that are cheap enough people will find uses for them even if they seem very primitive 
 so for example stones  you can build cathedrals out of stones  
 you just have to know what it does  you carve them in blocks and then you pile them on top of one another and they support weight
  so there has to be function  the function has to be predictable and the cost has to be low
  what that means is that you have to have a high performance or value
 for cost and then i would propose as this last component
 that they serve or have the potential to serve as building blocks that is  you can stack them 
 and stack can mean this way  or it can mean this way  or it can mean in some arbitrary n dimensional space  
 but if you have something that has a function  and it 's really cheap  people will find
 new ways of putting it together to make new things  cheap functional reliable things unleash the creativity of people who then build stuff that 
  you could not imagine there 's no way of predicting the internet based on the first transistor it just is not possible  
  the example is something that i want to give you from the work that we ourselves do we are very interested in
 delivering health care in the developing world 
 and one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business is to find a way of doing medical diagnosis at as close to zero cost as we can manage 
 so how does one do
  this is a world in which there 's no electricity there 's no money there 's no medical competence  
 and i don 't want to spend your time in going through the details  but in the lower right hand corner you see an example of the kind of thing that we have it 's a little paper chip  
 it has a few things printed on it using the same technology that you use for making comic books which was the inspiration for this particular idea  
  and you put a drop in this case of urine at the bottom  it wicks its way up into these little branches you know
 no power required  it turns colors in this particular case you 're reading
 kidney function  and  since the health care worker of much of this part of the world is an eighteen year old with an 
 who happens to be out of work and is willing to go around and do this sort of thing
  he can take a picture of it with his cellphone  send the picture back to where there is a doctor and the doctor can look at it  
 so what you 've done is to take a technology which is available everywhere make a device  which is extremely cheap  
 and make it in such a fashion that it is very very reliable if we can pull this off if we can build more function  it will be stackable that is to say 
  if we can make the basic technology of one or two things work it will be applicable to
  very very large variety of human conditions  and hence  extendable in both vertical and horizontal directions 
 part of my interest in this i have to say is that i would like to
 how do i put this politely change the way  or maybe eviscerate  the capital structure of the u s health care system which i think is fundamentally broken
  let me close with my two aphorisms one of them is from mr einstein  and he says everything should be made as simple as possible  but not simpler 
 and i think that 's a very good way of thinking about the problem  if you take too much out of something that 's simple you lose function  
 you have to have low cost but you also have to have a function
  you can 't make it too simple 
 and the second is a design issue and it 's not directly relevant but it 's a nice statement this is by de saint exupery 
 and he says you know you 've achieved perfection in design 
 not when you have nothing more to add  but when you have nothing more to take away and that certainly is going in the right direction  
 so what i think one can begin to do with
 this kind of
 cut at the
  word simplicity which doesn 't cover brancusi it doesn 't answer the question of why mondrian is better or worse or simpler or less simpler than van gogh 
 and certainly doesn 't address the question of whether mozart is simpler than bach  
 but it does make a point which is one which in a sense differentiates the real world of people who make things  and the world of people who think about things
 which is  there is an intellectual merit to asking  how do we make things as simple as we can as cheap as we can as functional as we can and as freely interconnectable as we can 
 if we make that kind of simplicity in our technology and then give it to you guys  you can go off and do all kinds of fabulous
  of simplicity might get to the point where you could look out at various systems say a financial system or a legal system health
  that has got to the point of danger or dysfunctionality for the following reasons and this is how we might simplify it george whitesides yes 
 i think you could because if you look at the components from which the system is made and examine their fragility or their stability  you can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that 
  basis ca have you started to do that i mean with the health system you got a sort of radical solution on the cost side but in terms of the system itself 
  that diagnostic
 technology that you 've got where is that and when do you see that maybe getting rolled out to scale gw that 's coming out soon i mean the systems work and we have to find out how to manufacture them and do things 
 of this kind but the basic technology works ca you 've got a company set up to gw a foundation a foundation
