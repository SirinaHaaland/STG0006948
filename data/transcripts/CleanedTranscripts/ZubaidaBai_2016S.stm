  in the next six minutes that you will listen to me the world will have lost three mothers while delivering their babies 
 one because of a severe complication
  because she will be a teenager and her body will not be prepared for birth  
 but the third only because of lack of access to basic clean tools at the time of childbirth 
 she will not be alone 
 over one million mothers and babies die every single year in the developing world 
 only because of lack of access to basic cleanliness while giving birth to their babies
 my journey began on a hot summer afternoon in india in two thousand and eight when after a day of meeting women and listening to their needs  
 i landed in a thatched hut with a midwife 
 as a mother i was very curious on how she delivered babies in her house 
 after a deep and engaging conversation with her on how she considered it a profound calling to do what she was
  doing  i asked her a parting question do you have the tools that you need to deliver the babies 
 i got to see her tool this is what i use to separate the mother and the baby she said  
 unsure of how to react i held this agricultural tool in my hand in shock i took a picture of this hugged her and walked away
  my mind was flooded with reflections of my own infection that i had to struggle with for a year past childbirth despite having access to the best medical care 
 and memories of my conversation with my father who had lost his mom to childbirth 
 on how he thought his life would be so different if she would have been just next to him growing up 
 as a product developer i started my process of research  i was
  very excited to find that there was a product out there called the clean birth kit but i just couldn 't buy one for months 
 they were only assembled based on availability of funding  
 finally when i got my hands on one i was in shock again  
 i would never use these tools to deliver my baby i thought but to confirm my instincts i went back to the women some of whom had the experience
  of using this product  
 lo and behold they had the same reaction and more 
 the women said they would rather deliver on a floor than on a plastic sheet that smeared blood all over they were absolutely right it would cause more infection 
 the thread provided was a highway to bacterial infection through the baby 's umbilical cord and the blade used was the kind that men used for shaving and they did not want it anywhere close to them
  there was no incentive for anybody to redesign this product because it was based on charity the women were never consulted in this process 
 and to my surprise the need was not only in homes but also in institutional settings with  high volume births  
 situations in remote areas were even more daunting 
 this had to change
  i made this my area of focus  i started the design process by collecting feedback 
 developing prototypes and engaging with various stakeholders researching global protocols 
 with every single prototype we went back to the women to ensure that we had a product for them 
 what i learned through this process was that these women despite their extreme poverty placed great value on their health and well being they were absolutely not poor in mind 
 as with all of us they would appreciate a
  developed for their needs  
 after many iterations working with experts medical health professionals and the women themselves  
 i should say it was not an easy process at all but we had a simple and beautiful design 
 for a dollar more
 than what the existing product was offered for at three dollars we were able to deliver janma a clean birth kit in a purse
 janma meaning birth contained a blood absorbing sheet for the woman to give birth on 
 a surgical scalpel a cord clamp a bar of soap a pair of gloves and the first cloth to wipe the baby clean 
 all this came packaged in a beautiful purse that was given to the mother as a gift after all her hard work that she carried home with pride as a symbol of prosperity 
 one woman reacted to this gift
  she said is this really mine can i keep it the other one said will you give me a different color when i have my next baby 
 better yet a woman expressed that this was the first purse that she had ever owned in her life the kit aside from its symbolism and its simplicity is designed to follow 
  globally recommended medical protocol and serves as a behavior change tool to follow steps one after the other
 it can not only be used in homes but also in institutional settings 
 to date our kit has impacted over six hundred thousand mothers and babies around the world it
 's a humbling experience to watch these numbers grow and i cannot
 wait until we reach a hundred million 
 but women 's health issues do not end here  there are thousands of simple issues that require
  low cost interventions we have facts to prove that if we invest in women and girls and provide them with better health and well being 
 they will deliver healthier and wealthier and prosperous communities  
 we have to start by bringing simplicity and dignity to women 's health issues from reducing maternal mortality to breaking taboos to empowering women to take control of their own lives 
 this is my dream
  but it is not possible to achieve it without engaging men and women alike from around the world yes all of you 
 i recently heard this lyric by leonard cohen 
 ring the bells that still can ring forget
 your perfect offering 
  there is a crack in everything that 's how the light gets in 
 this is my bit of light  
 but we need more light in fact we need huge spotlights placed in the world of women 's health if we need a better tomorrow 
 we should never forget that women are at the center of a sustainable world and we do not exist without them
