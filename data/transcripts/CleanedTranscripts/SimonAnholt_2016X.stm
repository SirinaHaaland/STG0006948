  as many of you know the results of the recent election were as follows hillary clinton the democratic candidate won a landslide victory
 with fifty two percent of the overall vote  jill stein the green candidate  came a distant second with nineteen percent
  donald j trump the republic candidate was hot on her heels with fourteen percent  
 and the remainder of the vote were shared between abstainers and gary johnson  the libertarian candidate 
 laughter now  what parallel universe do you suppose i live in well i don 't live in a parallel universe
  in the world and that is how the world voted  
 so let me take you back and explain what i mean by that 
 in june this year i launched something called the global vote 
 and the global vote does exactly what it says on the tin for the first time in history  it lets anybody  anywhere in the world 
  vote in the elections of other people 's countries now why would you do that what
 's the point well let me show you what it looks like you go to a website  
 rather a beautiful website  and then you select
 an election here 's a bunch that we 've already covered we do about one a month or thereabouts so you can see bulgaria
  referendum at the end there you select the election that you 're interested in and
 you pick the candidates these are the candidates from the recent presidential election in the tiny island nation of so tom and prncipe one
 hundred and ninety nine thousand inhabitants off the coast of west africa  
 and then you can look at the
 brief summary of each of those candidates
 which i dearly hope
 is very neutral very informative and very succinct and when you 've found the one you like you vote  
 these were the candidates in the recent icelandic presidential election and that 's the way it goes 
 so
 why on earth would you want to vote
 in another country 's election well  the reason that you wouldn 't want to do it let me reassure you is
  order to interfere in the democratic processes of another country 
 that 's not the purpose at all 
 in fact you can 't 
 because usually what i do is i release the results after the electorate in each individual country has already voted so there 's no way that we could interfere in that process  but more importantly 
  i 'm not particularly interested in the domestic issues of individual countries that 's not what we 're voting on 
  or hillary clinton proposed to do for the americans is frankly none of our business  that 's something that only the americans can vote on 
 no in the global vote you 're only considering one aspect of it which is what are those leaders going to do for the rest of us  
 and that 's so very important because we live as no doubt you 're sick of hearing people tell
  in a globalized hyperconnected  massively interdependent world
 where the political decisions of people in other countries can and will have an impact on our lives no matter who we are no matter where we live 
 like the wings of the butterfly beating on one side of the pacific
 that can apparently create a hurricane on the other side so it is with the world that we live in today
  the world of politics there is no longer a dividing line between domestic and international affairs  
 any country no matter how small even if it 's so tom and prncipe could produce the next nelson mandela
 or the next stalin 
 they could pollute the atmosphere and the oceans which belong to all of us or they could be responsible and they could help all of us  and
  the system is so strange
 because the system hasn 't caught up with this globalized reality 
 only a small number of people are allowed to vote for those leaders even though their impact is gigantic and almost universal 
 what
 number was it one hundred and forty million americans voted for the next president of the united states and yet as all of us knows in a few weeks time somebody is going to hand over the nuclear
  having a potential impact on all of us i don 't know what is 
 similarly the election for the referendum on the brexit vote 
 a small number of millions of british people voted on that 
 but the outcome of the vote  whichever way it went would have had a significant impact on the lives of
 tens hundreds of millions of people around the world and yet only a tiny number could vote  what kind of democracy is
  that 
 huge decisions that affect all of us being decided by relatively very small numbers of people 
 and i don 't know about you  but i don 't think that sounds very democratic  
 so i 'm trying to clear it up but as i say  we don 't ask about domestic questions in fact i only ever ask two questions of all of the candidates  i send them the
 same two questions every single time i say one if you get elected what are you going to do for the rest of us for the remainder of the seven billion who live on this planet  
 second question 
 what is your vision for your country 's future in the world  what role do you see it playing every candidate  i send them those questions they
 don 't all answer don 't get me wrong  i reckon if you 're standing
 to become the
  next president of the united states you 're probably pretty tied up most of the time  so i 'm not altogether surprised that they don 't all answer but many do 
 more every time  
 and some of them do much more than answer some of them answer in the most enthusiastic and most exciting way you could imagine i just want to say a word here for saviour chishimba 
 who was one of the candidates in the recent zambian presidential election 
 his answers to those two questions were basically an
  on his view
 of zambia 's potential role in the world and in the international community i posted it on the website so anybody could read it now saviour
 won the global vote  but he didn 't win the zambian election  
 so i found myself wondering what am i going to do with this extraordinary group of people i 've got some wonderful people here who won the global vote we always get it wrong by the way 
 the one that we elect is never the person who 's elected by the domestic electorate
  may be partly because we always seem to go for the woman  but i think it may also be a sign
 that the domestic electorate is still thinking very nationally they 're still thinking very inwardly they 're still asking themselves  what 's in it for me 
 instead of what they should be asking today which is what 's in it for we 
 but there you go so suggestions please not right now but send me an
  email if you 've got an idea about what we can do with this amazing team of glorious losers 
 laughter we 've got saviour chishimba who i mentioned before we 've got halla tmasdttir who was the runner up in the icelandic presidential election many of you may have seen her amazing
 talk at tedwomen just a few weeks ago where she spoke about the need for more women to get into politics  
 we 've got maria das neves from so tom and prncipe we 've got
  clinton i don 't know if she 's available we 've got jill stein  and we covered also the
 election for the next secretary general of the united nations
 we 've got the ex prime
 minister of new zealand who would be a wonderful member of the team  
 so i think maybe those people the glorious loser 's club could travel around the world wherever there 's an election and remind people
 of the necessity in our modern age of thinking a little bit outwards
 and thinking of the international consequences  
 so what comes next for the global vote well  
 obviously  the donald and hillary show is a bit of a difficult one to follow  
 but there are some other really important elections coming up in fact they seem to be multiplying there 's something going on i 'm sure you 've noticed in the world 
 and the next row of elections are all critically important
  in just a few day 's time we 've got the rerun of the austrian presidential election 
 with the prospect of norbert hofer becoming what is commonly described as the first far right head of state in europe since the second world war 
 next year we 've got germany  we 've got france  we 've got presidential elections in iran
 and a dozen others it doesn 't get less important  it gets more and more important
  clearly the global vote is not a stand alone project it 's not just there on its own it has some background it 's part of a project which i launched
 back in two thousand and fourteen which i call the good country  
 the idea of the good country is basically very simple it 's my simple diagnosis of what 's wrong with the world
 and how we can fix it what 's wrong with the world i 've already
  hinted at basically we face an enormous and growing number of gigantic existential global challenges climate change human rights abuses  
 mass migration terrorism economic chaos  weapons proliferation 
 all of these problems which threaten to wipe us out
 are by their very nature globalized problems no individual country has the capability of tackling them on its own
 and so very obviously we have to cooperate and we have to collaborate as nations if we 're going to solve these problems  
 it 's so obvious  and yet we don 't  
 we don 't do it nearly often enough most of the time countries still persist in behaving
 as if they were warring selfish tribes
 battling against each other much as they have done since the
  invented hundreds of years ago  
 and this has got to change 
 this is not a change in political systems or a change in ideology this is a change in culture we all of us have to understand
 that thinking inwards
 is not the solution to the world 's problems  we have to learn how to cooperate and collaborate a great deal more and compete just a tiny bit less  
 otherwise things are
  going to carry on getting bad and they 're going to get much worse much sooner than we anticipate 
 this change will only happen if we ordinary people tell our politicians that things have changed  
 we have to tell them that the culture has changed  
 we have to tell them that they 've got a new mandate  
 the old mandate was very simple and very single if you 're in a position of power or authority you 're responsible for your own people and your own tiny slice of
  territory and that 's it  and if in order to do the best thing for your own people you screw over everybody else on the planet that 's even better that 's considered to be a bit macho 
 today i think everybody in a position of power and responsibility has got a dual mandate which says if you 're in a position of power and responsibility  you 're responsible for your own people and for every single man woman  child and animal on the planet  
 you 're responsible
  for your own slice of territory and
 for every single square mile of the earth 's surface and the atmosphere above it and if you don 't like that responsibility you should not be in power that for me is the rule of the modern age  and that 's the message that we 've got to get across to our politicians and show them
 that that 's the way things are done these days  otherwise we 're
  i don 't have a problem actually with donald trump 's credo of america first 
 it seems to me that that 's a pretty banal statement of what politicians have always done and probably should always do of course they 're elected to represent the interests of their own people 
 but what i find so boring and so old fashioned and so unimaginative about his take on that
 is that america first means everyone else last that making america great again means making everybody else small again
 and it 's just not true 
 in my job as a policy advisor over the last twenty years or so i 've seen so many hundreds of examples of policies that harmonize the international and the domestic needs and they make better policy 
 i 'm not asking nations to be altruistic or self sacrificing that would be ridiculous no nation would ever do that 
 i 'm asking them to wake up and understand that we need a new form
  of governance which is possible
 and which harmonizes those two needs those good for our own people and those good for everybody else 
 since the us election and since brexit it 's become more and more obvious to me
 that those old distinctions of left wing and right wing no longer make sense they really don 't fit the pattern  what does seem to matter today
 is very simple whether your view of the world
 is that you take comfort from looking inwards and backwards  or whether like me you find hope
 in looking forwards and outwards  that 's the new politics  that 's the new division that is splitting the world right down the middle 
 now that may sound judgmental but it 's not meant to be  i don 't at all misunderstand why so many people find their comfort in looking
  and backwards  
 when times are difficult when you 're short of money when you 're feeling insecure and vulnerable it 's almost a natural human tendency to turn inwards to think of your own needs
 and to discard everybody else 's and perhaps to start to imagine that the past was somehow better than the present or the future could ever be 
 but i happen to believe that that 's a dead end history shows us that it 's a dead end when people
  turn inwards and turn backwards  human progress becomes reversed and things get worse for everybody very quickly indeed 
 if you 're like me and you believe in forwards and outwards 
 and you believe that the best thing about humanity is its diversity  
 and the best thing about globalization
  is the way that it stirs up that diversity  that cultural mixture to make something more creative more exciting more productive than there 's ever been before in human history 
 then my friends we 've got a job on our hands 
 because the inwards and backwards brigade are uniting as never before  and that creed of inwards and backwards that fear  
 that anxiety  playing on the simplest instincts is sweeping across the world those of us
  who believe as i believe in forwards and outwards we have to get ourselves organized 
 because time is running out very very quickly
