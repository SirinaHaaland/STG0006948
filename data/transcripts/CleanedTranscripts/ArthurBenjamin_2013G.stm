  so why do we learn mathematics
 essentially for three reasons calculation application  
 and last and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it inspiration 
 mathematics is the science
  of patterns and we study it to learn how to think logically critically and creatively  
 but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated 
 and when our students ask why are we learning this then they often hear that they 'll need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test  
 but wouldn 't it be great if every once in a while we did mathematics simply
  because it was fun or beautiful or because it excited the mind  
 now i know many people have not had the opportunity to see how this can happen so let me give you a quick example with my favorite collection of numbers the fibonacci numbers 
 yeah i already have fibonacci fans here that 's great now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways  from the standpoint of calculation
 they 're as easy to understand as one plus one which is two 
 then one plus two is three  two plus three is five three plus five is eight  and so on  
 indeed the person we call fibonacci was actually named leonardo of pisa and these numbers appear in his book liber abaci which taught the western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today 
  applications fibonacci numbers appear in nature surprisingly often the number of petals on a flower is typically a fibonacci number or the number of spirals 
 on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a fibonacci number as well 
  about them are the beautiful number patterns they display let me show you one of my favorites  suppose you like to square numbers  and frankly who doesn 't
 let 's look at the squares of the first few fibonacci numbers so one squared is one two squared is four three squared is nine five squared is twenty five and so on
 now it 's no surprise that when you
  add consecutive fibonacci numbers you get the next fibonacci number right that 's how they 're created  but you wouldn 't expect anything special to happen when you add the squares together 
  but check this out one plus one gives us two  and one plus four gives us five 
  numbers  let 's see what we get there so one plus one plus four is six 
 add nine to that we get fifteen add twenty five we get forty add sixty four we get one hundred and four  now look at those numbers  those are not 
  fibonacci numbers  but if you look at them closely you 'll see the fibonacci numbers buried inside of them do
  is two times three  fifteen is three times five forty is five times eight two three five eight  who do we appreciate 
 fibonacci of course  
 now as much fun as it is to discover these patterns it 's even more satisfying to understand why they are true  let 's look at that last equation why should the squares of one one
  five and eight add up to eight times thirteen  i 'll show you by drawing a simple picture 
 we 'll start with a one by one square and next to that put another
  creating one giant rectangle right  now let me ask you a simple question what is the area of the rectangle  
 well on the one hand it 's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it right  just as we created it it 's one squared plus one squared 
 plus two squared plus three squared plus five squared plus eight squared right  that 's the area
 on the other hand because it 's a rectangle the area is equal to its height times its base and the height is clearly eight  and the base is five 
  plus eight which is the next fibonacci number thirteen  right so the area is also eight times thirteen  
  the area two different ways they have to be the same number  and that 's why the squares of one one two three five and eight add up to eight times thirteen  
 now if we continue this process we 'll generate rectangles of the form
 thirteen by 
  by thirty four and so on  
 now check this out if you divide thirteen by eight you get one point six two five 
 and if you divide the larger number by the smaller number then these ratios get
  closer and closer to about one point six one eight known to many people as the golden ratio a number which has fascinated mathematicians scientists and artists for centuries  
 now i show all this to you because like so much of mathematics there 's a beautiful side to it that i fear does not get enough attention in our schools we spend lots of time learning about
  calculation  but let 's not forget about application including perhaps the most important application of all learning how to think 
 if i could summarize this in one sentence it would be this 
 mathematics is not just solving for x it 's also figuring out why 
 thank you very much
