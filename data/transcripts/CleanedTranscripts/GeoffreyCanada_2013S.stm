  and the last time i looked
  our children that we 're going to needlessly lose
 that we could right now 
 we could save them all you saw the quality of the educators who were here 
 do not tell me they could not reach those kids and save them i know they could  it is absolutely possible
  why haven 't we fixed this 
 those of us in education have held on to a business plan that we don 't care how many millions of young people fail  we 're going to continue to do the 
  same thing that didn 't work  and nobody nobody is getting crazy about it
 and there were kids who were failing in schools
 years ago when i first went to school  and those schools are still lousy today
  years later  and you know something about a lousy school
  was like a good year right that 's now how this thing i mean  every single year  it 's still the same approach  right  
 one size fits all if you get it fine and if you don 't tough luck 
 just tough luck 
 why haven 't we allowed innovation to happen do not tell me we can 't do better than this look  you go into a place that 's failed kids
 for fifty years  and you say so what 's the plan and they say we 'll we 're going to do
 what we did last year this year what kind of business model is that banks used to open and operate
 between ten and three
  can bank between ten and three  
 the unemployed  they don 't need banks they got no money in the banks 
 who created that business model right and it went on for decades 
 you know why because they didn 't care
 it wasn 't about the customers it was about bankers  they created something that worked for them how could you go to the bank when you were
  work it didn 't matter and they don 't care whether or not geoff is upset he can 't go to the bank go find another bank they all operate the same way 
 right 
 now one day  some crazy banker had an idea maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work  they might like that what
  what about introducing technology now look i 'm a technology fan but i have to admit to you all i 'm a little old 
 so i was a little slow and i did not trust technology and when they first came out with those new contraptions 
 these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money  i was like there 's no way that machine is going to count that money right  i am never using that
  things have changed  yet not in education why why is it that
 when we had rotary phones 
 when we were having folks being crippled by polio  that we were teaching
 the same way then that we 're doing right now  and if you come up with a plan to change things people consider you radical
  they will say the worst things about you i said one day well look  if the science says this is science not me
 that our poorest children lose ground in the summertime
 you see where they are in june
  because it suggests we should do something 
 every ten years they reproduce the same study it
 says exactly the same thing  poor kids lose ground in the summertime  the system decides you can 't run schools
  years i went to look i went the harvard ed school i thought i knew something  they said it was the agrarian calendar and people had but let me tell you why that doesn 't make sense i never
 got that i never got that because anyone knows if you farm  you don 't plant crops in july and august you
 plant them in the spring  so who came up with this idea who owns it why did we ever do it
  it just turns out in the 1840s we did have schools were open all year  
 they were open all year  because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day they didn 't have any place for their kids to go it was a perfect place to have schools  so this is not something that is ordained from the education gods  
 so why don 't we
 science you have bill gates coming out and saying look  this works  right  we can do this how many places in america are going to change 
 none
  we know that the problem begins
 immediately right this idea zero to three my wife yvonne and i we have four kids
 three grown ones and a 15 year old that 's a longer story 
 with our first kids  we did not know the science about brain development
  we didn 't know how critical those first three years were  we didn 't know what was happening in those young brains  we didn 't know the role that language 
 a stimulus and response  call and response how important that was in developing those children 
 we know that now  
 what are we doing about it 
 nothing  wealthy people know  educated people know and their kids have an advantage  poor people don 't know
  know and we 're not doing anything to help them
 at all but we know this is critical now 
 you take pre kindergarten we know it 's important for kids  poor kids need that experience 
 nope lots of places it doesn 't exist  we know health
  we provide health services and people are always fussing at me about you know because i 'm all into accountability and data and all of that good stuff but
 we do health services and i have to raise a lot of money people used to say when they 'd come fund us geoff why do you provide these health services i used to make stuff up right  i 'd say well you know a child
 who has cavities is not going to uh be able to study as well
  had to because i had to raise the money but now i 'm older  and you know what i tell them you know why i provide kids with those health
 benefits and the sports and the recreation and the arts because i actually like kids i
 actually like
 and you 've never read a study from mit that says
 giving your kid dance instruction is going to help them do algebra better  but you will give that kid dance instruction and you will be thrilled that that kid 
  wants to do dance instruction  and it will make your day  and why shouldn 't poor kids have the same opportunity
  here 's the other thing 
 i 'm a tester guy i believe you need data you need information because you work at something you think it 's working  and you find out it 's not working 
 i mean you 're educators you work you say  you think you 've got it  great no and you find out they didn 't get it 
 but here 's the problem with
  the testing that we do we 're going to have our test in new york next week is in april  you know when we 're going to get the results back  
 maybe july maybe june and the results have great data  they 'll tell you raheem really struggled couldn 't do
 two digit multiplication so great data but you 're getting it back after school is over 
 you come back from vacation now you 've got all of this test data from last year you don 't
 look at it why
 would you look at it you 're going to go and teach this year  so how much money did we just spend on all of that 
 billions and billions of dollars for data that it 's too late to use i need that
  data in september  i need that data in november  i need to know you 're struggling  and i need to know whether or not what i did corrected that i need to know that this week i don 't need to know that at the end of the year when it 's too late 
 because in my older years i 've become somewhat of a clairvoyant
 i can predict school
  you take me to any school  i 'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling  and you tell me last year forty eight percent of those kids
 were on grade level  and i say okay what 's the plan what did we do from last year to this year you say we 're doing the same thing i 'm going to make a prediction 
 this year somewhere between 
  percent of those kids will be on grade level  and i will be right every single time
  we 're spending all of this money  but we 're getting what 
 teachers need real information right now about what 's happening to their kids  the high stakes is today  because you can do something about it  
 so
 here 's the other issue that i just think we 've got to be concerned about we can 't stifle innovation in our
  business we have to innovate and people in our business get mad about innovation  
 they get angry if you do something different if you try something new people are always like ooh charter schools hey
 let 's try some stuff let 's see this stuff hasn 't worked for fifty five years let 's try something different  and here 's the rub some of it 's not going to work 
  of them don 't they should be closed i mean i really believe they should be closed  but we can 't confuse
 figuring out the science and things not working with we shouldn 't therefore do anything right
 because that 's not the way the world works if you think about technology  imagine if that 's how we thought about technology every time something didn 't work we just
  they convinced me i 'm sure some of you were like me
 the latest and greatest thing  the palmpilot 
 they told me geoff if you get this palmpilot you 'll never need another thing that thing lasted all of three weeks it was
 over i was so disgusted i spent my money on this thing did anybody stop inventing
  not a person not a soul the folks went out there they kept inventing  the fact that you have failure  that shouldn 't stop you from from pushing the science forward 
 our job as educators  there 's some stuff we know that we can do 
 and we 've got to do better the evaluation we have to start with kids earlier we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people we 've got to give them all
  that we have to do but this innovation issue this idea that we 've got to keep
 innovating until we really nail this science down is something that is absolutely critical and this is something by the way 
 that i think is going to be a challenge for our entire field america
 cannot wait another fifty years to get this right  we
  have run out of time 
 i don 't know about a fiscal cliff but i know there 's an educational cliff that we are walking over right this very second  and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness
 about saying we can 't afford this
 so bill gates says it 's going to cost five billion dollars what is five billion dollars to the united states  what did we spend in afghanistan this year
 we 'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye 
 when the safety of america is threatened we will spend any amount of money  
 the real safety of our nation is preparing this next generation
 so that they can take our place
 and be the leaders
 of the world when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy
  and all that stuff we care about i dare say
 it 's a pittance  what it would require for us to really begin to solve some of these problems so
 once we do that i 'll no longer be angry
  one hundred percent of our kids graduated high school last year in my school a hundred percent of them went to college this year 's seniors will have one hundred percent graduating high school
  last i heard we had  ninety three percent accepted to college we 'd better get that other seven percent so that 's just how this goes 
 so how do you stick with them after they they leave high school gc well you know one of the bad
 problems we have in this country is these kids the same kids these same
  when you get them in school they drop out in record numbers  and so we 've figured out that you 've got to really design a network of support for these kids that in many ways mimics what a good parent does  
 they harass you  right  
 they call you they say i want to see your grades how 'd you do on that last test 
 what are you talking about that you want to leave school and you 're not coming back here so a bunch of my kids know you can 't come back to harlem because geoff is
  kidding about some of this  and it gets a little bit to the grit issue when kids know that you refuse to let them fail
  it puts a different pressure on them  and they don 't give up as easy so sometimes they don 't have it inside  and they 're like you know i don 't want to do this but i know
 my mother 's going to be mad well that matters
  and it helps get them through  we try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring and help and support but also a set of encouragements that say to them you can do it it is going to be hard but we refuse to let you fail
