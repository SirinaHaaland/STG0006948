  amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today we think of financial and economic primarily the ones that concern me most is the deficit of political dialogue
 our ability to address modern
 conflicts as they are to go to the source of what they 're all about and to understand the key players and to deal with them  
 we who are diplomats we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states and i can tell you our agenda is full 
 there is trade there is disarmament  there is cross border relations  but the picture is changing  
 and we are seeing that there are new key players coming onto the scene  
 we loosely call them
  groups 
 they may represent social religious political economic military realities  and we struggle with how to deal with them  
 the rules of engagement how to talk when to talk  and how to deal with them  
 let me show you a slide here which illustrates
  the character of conflicts since one thousand nine hundred and forty six until today you see the green
 is a traditional interstate conflict  the ones we used to read about 
 the red is modern conflict conflicts within states 
 these are quite different and they are outside the grasp of modern diplomacy 
 and the core of these key actors are groups
 who represent different interests
  countries  and the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries  so in a way it is everybody 's business
 another acknowledgment we 've seen during these years  
 recent years is that very few of these domestic interstate intrastate conflicts can be solved militarily 
  they may have to be dealt with with military means  but they cannot be solved by military means they need political solutions  
 and we therefore have a problem because they escape traditional diplomacy and we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them  
 plus during the last decade we 've been in the mode
 where dealing with with groups was conceptually and politically dangerous
  either you were with us or against us  it was black or white  
 and groups are very often immediately label terrorists  and who would talk to terrorists  
 the west as i would see it comes out of that decade weakened  because we didn 't understand the group  
 so we 've spent more time on focusing on why we should not talk to others than finding out how we talk to others now
 i 'm not naive
  you cannot talk to everybody all the time and there are times you should walk  
 and sometimes military intervention is necessary i happen to believe that libya was necessary
 and that military intervention in afghanistan was also necessary and my country relies on its security
 through military alliance that 's clear  but still we have a large deficit in dealing with and understanding modern conflict
  let us turn to afghanistan 
 ten years after that military intervention that country is far from secure  the situation to be honest is very serious  
 now again the military is necessary but the military is no
 when i first came to afghanistan in two thousand and five as a foreign minister i met the commander of
  the international troops  and he told me that this can be won militarily minister  we just have to persevere 
 now four com isaf 's later  we hear a different message this cannot be won militarily  
 we need military presence but we need to move to politics 
 we can only solve this through a political solution  and it is not us who will solve it afghans have to solve it 
 but then they need a different political process than the one they were given
 in two thousand and one two thousand and two 
 they need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues 
 everybody seems to agree with that it was very controversial to say three four five years ago  now everybody agrees  
 but now as we prepare to talk  we understand how little we know because we didn 't talk  we didn
  grasp what was going on 
 the international committee of the red cross the icrc is talking to everyone  and it is doing so because it is neutral 
 and that 's one reason why that organization probably is the best informed key player to understand modern conflict
 because they talk my point is that you don 't have to be neutral to talk
  and you don 't have to agree when you sit down with the other side  and you can always walk  
 but if you don 't talk  you can 't engage the other side  
 and the other side which you 're going to engage is the one with whom you profoundly disagree  
 prime minister rabin said when he engaged the oslo process you don 't make peace with your
  but it is necessary  
 let me go one step further this is tahrir square there 's a revolution going on 
 the arab spring is heading into fall and is moving into winter  it will last for a long long time 
 and who knows what it will be called in the end that 's not the point 
 the point is that we are probably seeing for the first time in the history of the arab world a revolution
 bottom up people 's revolution  social groups are taking to the streets  
 and we find out in the west that we know very little about what 's happening  
 because we never talk to the people in these countries  
 most governments followed the dictate of the authoritarian leaders to stay away from these different groups because they were terrorists  
 so now
  that they are emerging in the street and we salute the democratic revolution  we find out how little we know 
 right now the discussion goes should we talk to the muslim brotherhood 
 should we talk to hamas  if we talk to them  we may legitimize them i think that is wrong 
 if you talk in the right way you make it very clear that talking is not agreeing  and how can we tell
 the muslim brotherhood  as we should 
 that they must respect minority rights  
 if we don 't accept majority rights  because they may turn out to be a majority how can we escape
 if we at the same time preach democracy and at the same time don 't want to deal with the groups that are representative how will we ever be interlocutors
 now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups  
 but talking can be done in different ways  we make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level 
 now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion there 's a big
  with this so if we refuse to talk to these new groups
 that are going to be dominating the news in years to come  we will further radicalization  
 i believe we will make the road from violent activities into politics harder to travel  
 and if we cannot demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards
  if you move towards taking part in civilized and normal standards among states  there are some rewards on the other side 
 the paradox here is that the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this 
 and the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising
 and for one reason primarily  and the reason is what happened in south
  nelson mandela 
 when mandela came out of prison after twenty seven years of captivity  
 if he had told his people it 's time to take up the arms it 's time to fight he would have been followed  
 and i think the international community would have said fair enough  it 's their right to fight now as you know mandela didn 't do that in his memoirs
  he wrote that
 he survived during those years of captivity captivity
 because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being 
 also being a human being  so he engaged a political process of dialogue 
 not as a strategy
 of the weak
  but as a strategy of the strong  and he engaged talking profoundly
 by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked  
 now south african friends will know that that was very painful  so what can we learn from all of this dialogue is not easy
 not between individuals not between groups not between governments but it is very necessary  if we 're going to deal with political
 of conflicts if we 're going to understand these new
 groups which are coming from bottom up supported by technology which is available to all we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets
 believing that we are doing interstate relations we have to connect with these profound changes
  what is dialogue really about when i enter into dialogue  i really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view 
 that i would impress upon them my opinions and my values  
 i cannot do that unless i send the signals that i will be open to listen to the other side 's signals we need a lot more training on how to do that
 and a lot more practice on how that can
 's easy sometimes just to walk  
 and sometimes you may need to fight  and i wouldn 't say that that is the wrong thing in all circumstances sometimes you have to 
 but that strategy seldom takes you very far the alternative is a strategy of engagement and principled dialogue  
 and i believe we need to strengthen this approach in modern diplomacy not only between states
  but also within states  we are seeing some new signs we could never have done the convention
 against anti personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions
 unless we had done diplomacy differently by engaging with civil society 
 all of a sudden ngos were not only standing in the streets  crying their slogans  but they were taking
  partly because they represented the victims of these weapons  
 and they brought their knowledge  and there was an interaction between diplomacy and the power coming bottom up 
 this is perhaps a first element of a change 
 in the future  i believe we should draw examples from these different
  to have diplomacy which is disconnected from people and civil society 
 and we have to go also beyond traditional diplomacy to the survival issue of our times climate change 
 how are we going to solve climate change through negotiations unless we are able to make civil society and people not part of the problem but part of the solution  
 it is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy very different from the one we are practicing today as we are
  heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations  but when we move toward something which has to be much more along a broad mobilization  
 it 's crucial to understand i believe  because of technology and because of globalization societies from bottom up 
 we as diplomats need to know the social capital
 of communities what is it that makes people trust each other not
  only between states but also within states 
 what is the legitimacy of diplomacy 
 of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups  
 the good thing is that we are not powerless  we have never had
 as many means
 of communication means of being connected means of reaching out means of including  the diplomatic toolbox
 is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication  
 but the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it 
 now i hope
  in the coming years that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples that that fear is receding
 and that we can take courage
 from that alliance with civil society in different countries to support their problem solving among the afghans 
 inside the palestinian population 
 between the peoples of palestine and israel  and as we try to understand this broad movement across the arab world
  we are not powerless we need to improve the necessary skills  and we need the courage to use them in my country i have seen how the
 the council of islamist groups
 and christian groups came together not as a government initiative  but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue
 in times where things were pretty
  tension and when tension increased they already had that dialogue 
 and that was a strength to deal with different issues 
 our modern western societies are more complex than before in this time of migration how are we going to settle and build a bigger we to deal with our issues if we don 't improve our skills of communication  
 so there are many reasons  and for all of these reasons
  this is time and this is why we must talk  thank you for your attention
