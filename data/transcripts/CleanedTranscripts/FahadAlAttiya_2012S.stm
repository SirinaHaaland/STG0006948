  i am in charge of making this country 's food secure that is my job for the next two years to design an entire master plan
  and then for the next ten years
 to implement it
 of course with so many other people but first  i need to talk to you about a story  which is my story 
 about the story of this country that you 're all here in today 
 and of course most of you have had three meals today and probably will continue to have after this event  so
 going in what
  were about eleven thousand people living here
 there was no water  
 there was no energy  no oil no cars  
 none of that most of the people who lived here either lived in coastal villages  fishing or were nomads who
 roamed around with the environment trying to find water  none of the glamour that you see
  today existed no cities like you see today in doha or dubai or abu dhabi
 or kuwait or riyadh it wasn 't that they couldn 't develop cities resources weren 't there to develop them 
 and you can see that life expectancy was also short most people died around the age of fifty so
 let 's move to chapter two the oil era one thousand nine
 hundred and thirty nine that 's when they discovered oil  but unfortunately it wasn 't really fully exploited commercially until after the second world war
 what did it do it changed the face of this country as you can see today and witness it also made all those people who roamed around the desert
 looking for water  looking for food  trying to take care of their livestock
 urbanize you might find this strange  but in my family we have different accents my mother has an accent that
  is so different to my father  and we 're all a population of about three hundred thousand people in the same country  
 there are about five or six accents in this country as i speak
  someone says how so how could this happen because we lived scattered we couldn 't live
 in a concentrated way simply because there was no
  and when the resources came be it oil we started building these fancy technologies and bringing
 people together because we needed the concentration 
 people started to get to know each other  and we realized that there are some differences in accents  so that is the chapter two the oil era  
 let 's look at today this is probably the skyline that most of you know about doha  so what 's the population today it 's one point seven million
  people that is in less than sixty years the average growth of our economy is about fifteen percent
 for the past five years  lifespan has increased to  seventy eight water consumption has increased
 to four hundred and thirty liters and this is amongst the highest worldwide
  from having no water whatsoever
 to consuming water to the highest degree higher than any other nation i don 't know if this was a reaction to lack of water  
 but
 what is interesting
 about the story that i 've just said the interesting part is that we continue to grow fifteen percent every year for the past
  never happened before in history cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water  this is history being made in this region  not only cities that we 're building but cities with
 dreams
 and people who are wishing to be scientists doctors build a nice home bring the architect design my house  
 these people are adamant that this is a livable space
 but of course with the use of technology so brazil has one thousand seven hundred and eighty two
 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain qatar has seventy four and we have that growth rate the
 question is how how could we survive that we have no water whatsoever 
 simply because of this gigantic mammoth machine
  desalination 
 energy is the key factor here it changed everything 
 it is that thing that we pump out of the ground we burn tons of probably most of you used it coming to doha  
 so that is our lake if you can see it that is our river that is how you all
 happen to use
  use and enjoy water  this is the best technology that this region
 could ever have desalination  
 so what are the risks do you worry much  
 i would say  
 perhaps if you look at the global facts you will realize of course i have to worry there is growing demand growing population we 've turned seven billion
 only a few months ago
  and so that number also demands food and there 's predictions that we 'll be nine billion by two thousand and fifty  so a country that
 has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders there 's also changing diets 
 by elevating to a higher  socio economic level they also change their diet they start eating more meat and
 so on and so forth on the other hand there is declining yields because of climate change and because of other factors
 and so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen this is the situation in qatar for those who don 't know 
 we only have two days of water reserve  
 we import ninety percent of our food  
 and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land the limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result
 open market policy and bringing the big competitions etc etc  so we also face risks these risks
 directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity the
 question is is there a solution is there a sustainable solution  
 indeed there is this slide sums up thousands of pages
  of technical documents that we 've been working on over the past two years
 let 's start with the water  so we know very well i showed you earlier that we need this energy  
 so if we 're going to need energy what sort of energy a depletable energy  fossil fuel or should we use something else do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy
 i guess most of you by now realize that we do three hundred days of sun
  so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need  and we will probably put one thousand eight hundred megawatts
 of solar systems to produce three point five million cubic meters of water and that is a lot of water 
 that water will go then to the farmers and the farmers will be able to water their plants 
 and they will be able then to supply society with food  but in order to sustain the horizontal
  line because these are the projects these are the systems that we will deliver
 we need to also develop the vertical line system sustenance
 high level education  research and development  industries technologies to produce these technologies for application and finally markets but what gels all of it what enables it is legislation
  without it we can 't do anything so that 's what we are planning to do within two years we should hopefully
 be done with this plan and taking it to implementation our objective is to be a millennium city  just like
 many millennium cities around istanbul  rome  london  paris  damascus
  we are only sixty years old  but we want to live forever as a city to live in peace  thank you very much
