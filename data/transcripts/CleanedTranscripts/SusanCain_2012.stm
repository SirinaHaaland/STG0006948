  i went off to summer camp for the first time  and my mother packed me a suitcase full of books  
 which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do  because in my family reading was the primary group activity  
 and this might sound antisocial to you
  but for us it was really just a different way of being social 
 you have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland inside your own mind  
 and i had this idea that camp was going to be just like this but better 
 i had a vision of ten girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns
  like a keg party without any alcohol  and on the very first day 
 our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit 
 and it went like this
  that 's the way we spell rowdie rowdie  
  i couldn 't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy or why we had to spell this word incorrectly 
 but i recited a cheer i recited a cheer along with everybody else i did my best  and i just waited for the time that i could go off and read my books
  first time that i took my book out of my suitcase the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me why are you being so mellow mellow of course being the exact opposite of 
 and then the second time i tried it the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be
  and so i put my books away back in their suitcase and
 i put them
 under my bed 
 and there they stayed for the rest of the summer  and i felt kind of guilty about this  i felt as if the books needed me somehow  and they were calling out to me and i was forsaking them  
 but i did forsake them and i didn 't open that suitcase again until i was back home with my family at the end of the
  i tell you this story about summer camp i could have told you fifty others just like it
 all the times that i got the message
 that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go that i should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert  
 and i always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were  but for years i denied
  and so i became a wall street lawyer of all things instead of the writer that i had always longed to be partly because i needed to prove to myself that i could be bold and assertive too  
 and i was always going off to crowded bars when i really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends 
 and i made these self negating choices so reflexively that i wasn 't even aware that i was making them  
 now this is what many introverts do and it 's our loss for sure but it is also
  also our colleagues ' loss and our communities ' loss and at the risk of sounding grandiose it is the world 's loss because when it comes to creativity and to leadership we need introverts doing what they do best 
 a third to a half of the population are introverts a third to a half so that 's one out of every two or three people you know  
 so even if you 're an extrovert yourself i 'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses
  and your children and the person sitting next to you right now all of them subject to this bias
 that is pretty deep and real in our society we all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we 're doing 
 now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is 
 it 's different from being shy shyness is about fear of social judgment introversion is more about how do
  respond to stimulation  including social stimulation  
 so extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation  whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched on and their most capable when they 're in quieter more low key environments 
 not all the time these things aren 't absolute but a lot of the time  so the key then
 to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation
 that is right for us but now here 's where the bias comes in 
 our most important institutions our schools and our workplaces  they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts ' need for lots of stimulation  
 and also 
 we have this belief system right now that i call the new groupthink  which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place
 so if you picture the typical classroom nowadays when i was going to school  we sat in rows
 we sat in rows of desks like this  and we did most of our work pretty autonomously  
 but nowadays your typical classroom has pods of desks four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other  and kids are working in countless group assignments even in subjects like math and creative writing which you think would depend on solo
  flights of thought kids are now expected to act as committee members 
 and for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone those kids are seen as outliers often or worse as problem cases
 and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert even though introverts actually get better grades and are more
  knowledgeable  according to research 
 okay same thing is true in our workplaces now most of us work in open plan offices without walls
  where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers and when it comes to leadership introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions even though introverts tend to be very careful much less likely to take outsize
  risks which is something we might all
 favor nowadays
  and interesting research by adam grant at the wharton school has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do  because when they are managing proactive 
  employees they 're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas  whereas an extrovert can quite unwittingly get so excited about about things that they 're putting their own stamp on things and other people 's ideas
  not as easily then bubble up to the surface  
 now in fact  some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts i 'll give you some examples eleanor roosevelt  rosa parks  gandhi
 all these peopled described themselves as quiet and soft spoken and even shy  
 and they all took the spotlight even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to 
 and this turns out to have a special power
  all its own because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at they were there because they had no choice  because they were driven to do what they thought was right 
 now
 i think at this point it 's important for me to say that i actually love extroverts  i always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts  including
 my beloved husband
 and we all fall at different points of course along the introvert extrovert spectrum
 even carl jung the psychologist who first popularized these terms said that there 's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert he said that such a man would be in a lunatic asylum  if he existed at all  
 and some people fall smack
  the middle of the introvert extrovert spectrum and we call these people ambiverts  and i often think that they have the best of all worlds  
 but many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other and what i 'm saying is that culturally  we need a much better balance we need more of a yin and yang between these two types 
 this is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity  because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people what they find are people who
 are very good at
  exchanging ideas and advancing ideas  but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them 
 and this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity  
 so darwin  he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations  
 theodor geisel  better known as dr seuss he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely bell tower office that he had in the back of his
  house in la jolla california and he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him this kind of jolly santa  claus like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona 
 steve wozniak invented the first apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle in hewlett packard where he was working at the time and he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house
 when he was growing up now 
 of course this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating and case in point is steve wozniak famously coming together with steve jobs to start apple computer
 but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they
  we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude 
 it 's only recently that we 've strangely begun to forget it if you look at most of the world 's major religions you will find seekers
 moses jesus buddha muhammad seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness  where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community so no wilderness no revelations
 this is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology
  it turns out that we can 't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring  mimicking their opinions even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you 're attracted 
  to you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that that 's what you 're doing  
  dominant or charismatic person in the room even though there 's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas i mean zero 
 so 
 you might be following the person with the best ideas  but you might not 
 and do you really want to leave it up to chance much better for everybody to go off by themselves generate their own ideas freed from the
  distortions of group dynamics  and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well managed environment and take it from there 
 now if all this is true then why are we getting it so wrong 
 why are we setting up our schools this way and our workplaces and why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time 
 one answer lies deep in our cultural history
  western societies and in particular the u s have always favored the man of action over the 
  of contemplation
 but in america 's early days  we lived in what historians call a culture of character  where we still at that point valued people
 for their inner selves and their moral rectitude and if you look at the self help books from this era they all had titles with things like character  the grandest thing in the world 
 and they featured role models like abraham lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming  ralph waldo emerson called him a man who does not offend by superiority 
 but then we hit the 20th century  and we entered a new culture that historians call the
  what happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy to a world of big business  and so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities  and instead of working alongside people they 've known all their 
  lives  now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers so quite understandably  qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important  
  they feature as their role models really great salesmen 
 so that 's the world we 're living in today that 's our cultural inheritance  
 now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant  
 and i 'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all 
 the same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us
  love and trust  
 and the problems that we are facing today in fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together  
 but i am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems  
 so now i 'd like to share with you what 's in my suitcase
  today
  guess what books 
 i have a suitcase full of books here 's margaret atwood cat 's eye 
 here 's a novel by milan kundera  and here 's the guide for the perplexed by maimonides 
 but these are not exactly my books
  i brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather 's favorite authors 
 my grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when i was growing up partly because it was filled with his very gentle very courtly presence
 and partly because it was filled with
  i mean literally every table every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books
 just like the rest of my family my grandfather 's favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read  
 but he also loved his congregation 
 and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the sixty two years that he was a rabbi 
 he would takes the fruits of each week 's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and
  humanist thought and people would come from all over to hear him speak 
 but here 's the thing about my grandfather  
 underneath this ceremonial role he was really modest and really introverted so much so that when he delivered these sermons 
 he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for
  even away from the podium  when you called him to say hello he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time  
 but when he died at the age of 
 the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him  
 and so these days i try to learn from my grandfather 's example in my own way so i just published a book
  about introversion and it took me about seven years to write  and for me that seven years was like total bliss  because
 i was reading i was writing i was thinking i was researching it was my version of my grandfather 's hours of the day alone in his library  
 but now all of a sudden my job is very different and my job is to be out here talking about it talking about introversion
 and that 's a lot harder for me because as honored as i am to be here with all of you right now 
 this is not my natural milieu  
 so i prepared for moments like these as best i could i spent the last year
 practicing public speaking every chance i could get and i call this my year of speaking dangerously
 and that actually helped a lot  
 but i 'll tell you what helps even more is my sense my belief my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change i mean we are 
 and so i am going to leave you now with three calls for action
 for those who share this vision
  the madness for constant group work just stop it thank you 
 and i want to be clear about what i 'm saying because i deeply believe our offices should be encouraging
 casual chatty cafe style types of interactions you know the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas that is great it 's great for introverts and
  it 's great for extroverts  but we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work school same thing we need to be teaching kids to work together for sure  
  but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own this is especially important for extroverted children too they need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part  
  go to the wilderness be like buddha have your own revelations  
 i 'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again  
 but i am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often  
 number three take a good look at what 's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there  so extroverts
  maybe your suitcases are also full of books or maybe they 're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment  
 whatever it is i hope you take these things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy and your joy  
 but introverts you being you you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what 's inside your own suitcase and that 's okay  
 but occasionally
  just occasionally i hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry  
 so i wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage
 to speak softly  thank you very much
