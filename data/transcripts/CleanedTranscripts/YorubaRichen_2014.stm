  election night two thousand and eight
 was a night that tore me in half  it was the night that barack obama was elected [ one hundred and forty three ]
  years after the end of slavery and [ forty three ] years after the passage of the voting rights act
  was elected president many of us never thought that this was possible
 until the moment that it happened  
 and in many ways it was the climax of the black civil rights movement in the united states  
 i was in california that night which was ground zero at the time for another movement
  the marriage equality movement  
 gay marriage was on the ballot in the form of proposition eight  
 and as the election returns started to come in it became clear that the right for same sex couples to marry which had recently been granted by the california courts was going to be taken
  on the same night that barack obama won his historic presidency  
 the lesbian and gay community suffered one of our most painful defeats  
 and then it got even worse  pretty much immediately
  started to be blamed for the passage of proposition eight this was largely due to an incorrect poll that said that blacks had voted for the measure by something like
  seventy percent 
 this turned out not to be true but this idea of pervasive black homophobia set in 
 and was grabbed on by the media 
 i couldn 't tear myself away from the coverage i listened to some gay commentator say that the african american
 community was notoriously homophobic 
 and now that civil rights had been achieved for us 
 we wanted to take away other people 's rights there were even reports of racist epithets being thrown at some of the participants of the gay rights rallies that took place after the election 
 and on the other side some 
  dismissed or ignored homophobia that was indeed real in our
  others resented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights and once again the sinking feeling that
 two minority groups of which i 'm both a part of were competing with each other instead of supporting each other
 overwhelmed and frankly pissed me off  now
  i 'm a documentary filmmaker so after going through my pissed off stage and yelling at the television and radio 
 my next instinct was to make a movie  
 and what guided me in making this film was how was this happening how was it that the
 gay rights movement was being pitted against the civil rights movement
  this wasn 't just an abstract question  i 'm a beneficiary of both movements so this was actually personal  
 but then something else happened after that election in two thousand and eight  
 the march towards gay equality accelerated at a pace that surprised and shocked everyone  
 and is still reshaping our laws and our
  our institutions and our entire country  and so
 it started to become increasingly clear to me that this pitting of the two movements against each other actually didn 't make sense  
 and that they were in fact much much more interconnected  
 and that in fact some of the way that the gay rights movement has been able to make such incredible gains so quickly is that it 's used some of the same tactics and strategies
  that were first laid down by the civil rights movement  
 let 's just look at a few of these strategies 
 first off it 's really interesting to see to actually visually see how quick the gay rights movement has made its gains if you look at a few of the major events
 on a timeline of both freedom movements
  there are tons of milestones in the civil rights movement but the first one we 're going to start with is the 
 montgomery bus boycott this was a protest campaign against montgomery alabama 's
 segregation on their public transit system  and it began when a woman named rosa parks
 refused to give up her seat to a white person  the campaign lasted a year and it galvanized the civil rights movement like
  nothing had before it and
 i call this strategy the i 'm tired of your foot on my neck strategy  so
 gays and lesbians have been in society since societies began but up until the mid 20th century  homosexual acts were still illegal in most states  
 so just fourteen
  years after the montgomery bus boycott a group of lgbt folks took that same strategy  
 it 's known as stonewall in one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine 
 and it 's where a group of lgbt patrons fought back against police beatings at a greenwich village bar that sparked three days of rioting
  black and latino lgbt folks were at the forefront of this rebellion  and it 's a really interesting example of the intersection of our struggles against racism homophobia  gender identity and police brutality 
 after stonewall happened gay liberation groups sprang up all over the country  and the modern gay rights movement as we know it took off  
 so the next moment to look at on the timeline is
 hundred and sixty three march on washington this was a seminal event in the civil rights movement
 and it 's where african americans called for both civil and economic justice 
 and it 's of course where martin luther king delivered his famous i have a dream speech but what 's actually less known is that this march was organized by a man named bayard rustin 
 bayard was an out
  gay man and he 's considered one of the most brilliant strategists of the civil rights movement  
 he later in his life became a fierce advocate of lgbt rights as well and his life is testament to the intersection of the struggles 
 the march on washington is one of the high points of the movement and
 it 's where there was a fervent belief that
  african americans too could be a part of american democracy 
 i call this strategy the we are visible and many in numbers strategy 
 some early gay activists were actually directly inspired by the march and some had taken part gay pioneer jack
  we marched with martin luther king seven of us from the  mattachine society which was an early gay rights organization 
 and from that moment on we had our own dream
 about a gay rights march of similar proportions 
 several years later a series of marches took place each one gaining the momentum of the gay freedom struggle the first one was in one thousand 
  a million people showed up 
 and people were so energized and excited by what had taken place they went back to their own communities and started their own political and social organizations  further increasing the visibility of the movement  
 the day of that march october eleven was then declared national
  coming out day  and is still celebrated all over the world 
 these marches set the groundwork for the historic changes that we see happening today in the united states
  and lastly  the loving strategy the name speaks for itself in
  prohibited interracial marriage this is considered one of the supreme court 's landmark civil rights cases 
 president clinton signed the defense of marriage act known as doma  
 and that made the federal government only have to have to recognize marriages between a
  lesbian named edith windsor sued the federal government when she was forced to pay estate taxes on her deceased wife 's property something that heterosexual couples don 't have to do  
 and as the case wound its way through the lower courts  the loving case was repeatedly cited as precedent 
 when it got to the supreme court in two thousand and thirteen the supreme court agreed
  and doma was thrown out it was incredible 
 but the gay marriage movement has been making gains for years now 
 to date seventeen states have passed laws allowing marriage equality it 's become the de facto battle for for gay equality
  it seems like daily laws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts even in places like texas and utah which no one saw coming 
 so a lot has changed since that night in two thousand and eight when i felt torn in half  
 i did go on to make that film  it 's a documentary film  and it 's called the new black and it looks
  community is grappling with the gay rights issue in light of the gay marriage movement and this fight over the meaning of civil rights  
 and i wanted to capture some of this incredible change that was happening  
 and as luck or politics would have it another marriage battle started gearing up this time in maryland
  make up thirty percent of the electorate  so this tension between gay rights and civil
  rights started to bubble up once again  
 and i was lucky enough to capture how some people were making the connection between the movements this time
  this is a clip of
 and samantha masters two characters in the film as they hit the streets of of baltimore
  and try to convince potential voters
  but i know that because a black man like yourself stood up for a woman like me
  always volunteer with us to get
  thank you 
 what 's amazing to me about that clip that we just
 captured as we were filming is it really shows how karess understands the the history of the civil rights movement but she 's not restricted 
  by it she doesn 't just limit it to black people she sees it as a blueprint for expanding
  rights to gays and lesbians  
 maybe because she 's younger she 's like twenty five she 's able to do this a little bit more easily  
 but the fact is that maryland voters did pass that that marriage equality amendment  
 and in fact it was the first time that marriage equality was directly voted on and
  that night in two thousand and eight when
  for dignity and equality  we 've gone from having to hide our sexuality in order to maintain our jobs and our families
 to literally getting a place at the table with the president
 and a shout out at his second inauguration  i just want to read what he said at that inauguration 
 we the people declare today that the most evident of truths
 that all of us are created equal 
 it is the star that guides us still 
 just as it guided our forebears through seneca falls and selma and stonewall 
 now we know that everything is not perfect  especially when you look at what 's happening
  the civil rights movement
  of the civil rights movement
 whereas a lot of us continue to still live in racially segregated spaces lgbt folks we are everywhere  
 we are in urban communities and rural communities communities of color immigrant communities
 churches and mosques and synagogues  we are your mothers and and brothers and sisters and sons
 and when someone that you love or a family member comes out it may be easier to support their quest for equality  
 and in fact the gay rights movement asks us to support justice and equality from a space of love 
 that may be the biggest  greatest gift that the movement has given us it calls on us to access that which is most universal
  universal and most intimate a love of our brother and our sister and our neighbor  i just want to end
 with a quote by one of our greatest freedom fighters who 's no longer with us nelson mandela
 of south africa  nelson mandela led south africa after the dark and brutal days of apartheid and out of the ashes of that
  legalized racial discrimination 
 he led south africa to become the first country in the world to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation within its constitution  
 mandela said 
 for to be free is not merely to cast off one 's chains  
 but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom
  of others so
 as these movements continue on and as freedom struggles around the world continue on  let 's remember that not only are they interconnected but they must support
 and enhance each other for us to be truly victorious  thank you
