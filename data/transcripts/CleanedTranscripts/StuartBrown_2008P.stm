  here we go a flyby of play  
 it 's got to be serious if the new york times puts a cover story of their february  17th sunday magazine about play 
 at the bottom of this it says it 's deeper than gender
 seriously but dangerously fun 
 and a sandbox for new ideas about evolution 
 not bad  except if you look at that cover what 's missing 
 you see any adults  
 well lets go back to the  15th century  this is a courtyard in europe and a mixture of one hundred
  and twenty four different kinds of play  all ages solo play  body play  
 games  taunting  and there it is and i think
 this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then i think we may have lost something in our
  so i 'm gonna take you through
 what i think is a remarkable sequence  
 north of churchill manitoba in october and november there 's no ice on hudson bay and this polar bear that you see
  male he 's wild
 and fairly hungry 
 and norbert rosing a german photographer is there on scene making a series of photos of these huskies who are tethered
 and from out of stage left comes this wild male polar bear with a predatory gaze  any of you who 've been to africa or
 had a junkyard dog come after you there is a fixed
 kind of predatory gaze that you know you 're in trouble  but on the other side of that predatory gaze is a female husky
 in a play bow  wagging her
  tail  and something very unusual happens that fixed behavior
 which is rigid and stereotyped and ends up with a meal changes  
 and this polar bear stands over the husky 
 no claws extended no fangs
 taking a look and they begin an incredible ballet
  a play ballet  this is in nature it overrides a carnivorous nature and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death  
 and if you 'll begin to look closely at the husky that 's bearing her throat to the polar bear and look a little more closely
  state
 that allows these two creatures to explore the possible  they are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals  
 and it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden
 by a process of nature that 's within all of us now how did i get
  involved in this  john mentioned that i 've done some work with murderers and i have the texas tower murderer opened my eyes in retrospect when we studied his
 tragic mass murder to the importance of play in that
 that individual by deep study was found to have severe play deprivation charles whitman was his name 
 and our committee which consisted of a lot of hard scientists did feel at
  end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play
 led him to be more vulnerable to the to the tragedy that he perpetrated 
 and that finding has stood the test of time unfortunately even into
 more recent times at virginia tech
  and other studies of populations at risk
 sensitized me to the importance of play  but i didn 't really understand what it was and it was many years
 in taking play histories of individuals
 before i really began to to recognize that
 i didn 't really have a full understanding of it and i don 't think any of us has a full understanding of it  by any means but
 there are ways of looking at it that i think can give you give us all a taxonomy a way of
  thinking about it  and this image is for humans the beginning point of play  
 when that mother and infant lock eyes  and the infant 's old enough to have a social smile 
 what happens spontaneously is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother and she begins to babble and coo and smile  and so does the baby  
 if we 've got them wired up with
 an electroencephalogram  the right
  brain of each of them becomes attuned  so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes
 and the physiology of that is something we 're beginning to get a handle on 
 and i 'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play builds on this base for us humans  
 and so now i 'm going to take you through sort of a way of
  at play but it 's never just singularly
 one thing we 're going to look at at body play  which is a spontaneous desire to to
 get ourselves out of gravity  this is a mountain goat if you 're having a bad day try this jump up and down wiggle around you 're going to feel better
  and you may feel like this character who is also just doing it for its own sake it doesn 't have a particular purpose and that 's what 's great about play  
 if its purpose is more important
 than the act of doing it it 's probably not play  and there 's a whole other type of play which is object play  and this japanese macaque has made a snowball and he or she 
  's going to roll down a hill  and they don 't throw it at each other but this is a fundamental part of being playful
  the human hand in manipulation of objects is the hand in search of a brain the brain is in search of a hand and play is the medium
 by which those two are linked in the best way jpl
 we heard heard this morning jpl is an incredible place they have located two consultants  frank wilson and nate johnson who
 frank wilson is a neurologist nate johnson is a mechanic  he taught
 mechanics in a high school in long beach  and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems  
 and he tried to figure out why and he came to the conclusion quite on his own that the students who could no longer solve problems such as fixing cars
  with their hands  
 frank wilson had written a book called the hand they got together jpl hired them now jpl nasa and boeing  before they will hire a research and development problem solver even if they 're summa cum laude from
 harvard or cal tech if they haven 't fixed cars haven 't done stuff with their hands early in life played with their hands  they can 't problem solve as well  so
  very important now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity
 and exploration 
 but it has to be safe exploration this happens to be ok he 's an anatomically interested little boy and that 's his mom other situations wouldn 't be quite so good but curiosity 
 exploration are part of the play scene  if you want to belong you need social play
  and social play is part of what we 're about here today and is a byproduct of the play scene  
 rough and tumble play  these lionesses seen from a distance looked like they were fighting  
 but if you look closely they 're kind of like the polar bear and husky no claws flat fur  soft eyes  
 open mouth with no fangs  balletic movements curvilinear movements all specific to play
  is a great learning medium for all of us preschool kids for example should be allowed to dive hit  whistle  scream be chaotic  and develop 
 through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts cognitive emotional and physical that come as a part of rough and tumble play 
  spectator play  ritual play we 're involved in some of that those of you who are from boston know that this was the moment
 where the
 red sox won the world series
  but take a look at the face and the body language of everybody in this fuzzy picture and you can get a sense that they 're all at play  imaginative play  
 i love this picture because
 my daughter who 's now almost forty is in this picture  
 but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination her ability to spin yarns
  at this age preschool a really important part of being a player is imaginative
 solo play  
 and i love this one because it 's also what we 're about we all have an internal narrative that 's our own inner story  the unit of intelligibility
 of most of our brains is the story i 'm telling you a story today about play
  bushman i think is talking about the fish that got away that was that long but it
 's a fundamental part of the play scene  so what does play do for the brain  
 well a lot we don 't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain because
 funding has not been
 exactly
 heavy for research on play
  i walked into the carnegie asking for a grant they 'd given me a large grant when i was an academician
 for the study of felony drunken drivers  and i thought i had a pretty good track record and by the time i had spent half an hour talking about play it was obvious that they were not did not feel that play was serious 
 i think that that 's a few years back i think that wave is past and the play wave is cresting
  there is some good science nothing lights up the brain like play three dimensional play fires up the cerebellum
  puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe the executive portion helps contextual memory be developed 
 and and and and so it 's for me its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure to look at the neuroscience that
  's associated with play and to bring together people who
 in their individual disciplines hadn 't really thought of it that way  and that 's part of what the national institute for play is all about and this is one of the ways you can study play is to get a 
 electroencephalogram  i 'm sorry i don 't have a playful looking subject  but it allows mobility which has limited the actual study of play
  and we 've got a mother infant play scenario that we 're hoping to to complete underway at the moment the reason i put this here is also to queue up my thoughts about objectifying what play does 
 the animal world has objectified it in the animal world if you take rats
  who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years
 and you suppress play they squeak they wrestle they pin each other that 's part of their play  if you stop that behavior
 on one
 group that you 're experimenting with and you allow it in another group that you 're experimenting with and then you present those rats with a cat  odor saturated collar
  hardwired to flee and hide pretty smart
 they don 't want to get killed by a cat  so what happens  they both hide out the non players never come out
 they die  the players
 slowly explore the environment and begin again to test things out that says to me at least in rats and i think
 they have the same neurotransmitters that we do and a similar cortical architecture
  that play may be pretty important for our survival and and and there are a lot more animal studies that i could talk about now  
 this is a consequence of play deprivation laughter
 this took a long time i had to get homer down and put him through the fmri and the spect and
 multiple eegs but as a couch potato his brain has shrunk  and we do know that
  domestic animals and others when they 're play deprived they don 't and rats also they don 't develop a brain that is normal 
 now the program says that the opposite of play is not work 
 it 's depression  
 and i think if you think about life without play
 no humor no flirtation no movies no games
  fantasy and and and try and imagine a culture or a life adult or otherwise
 without play  and the thing that 's so unique about our species
 is that we 're really designed to play through our whole lifetime  
 and we all have capacity to play signal  nobody misses that dog i took a picture of on a carmel beach a couple of weeks ago
  what 's going to follow from that behavior
 is play  and you can trust it  the basis of human trust is established through play signals  and we begin to lose those signals  culturally and otherwise as adults 
 that 's a shame  i think we 've got a a lot of learning to do now jane goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps  so part of the signaling system
  of play
 has to do with vocal facial  body  gestural 
 you know you can tell and i think when we 're getting into collective play its really important for groups
 to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals  
 you may not know this word  but it should be your biological first name and last name
  because neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood  and we are by physical anthropologists 
 by many many studies the most neotenous the most youthful the most flexible the most
 plastic of all creatures and therefore  the most playful  and this gives us a leg up on adaptability
  of looking at play that i also want to emphasize here which is the play history your own personal play history is unique 
 and often is not something we think about particularly  this is a book written by a consummate player by the name of kevin carroll 
 kevin carroll came from
  had to take care of a younger brother 
 found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined 
 he felt something different  
 and so he followed up on it 
 and his life the transformation of his life from from deprivation and what one would expect potentially prison or death
  linguist a trainer for the 76ers and now is a motivational speaker  and he gives play as a as a transformative
 force over his entire life now there 's another play history that i think is a work in progress
  those of you who remember al gore  during the
  term and then during his successful but unelected run for the presidency 
 may remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person at least in public
 and looking at his history which is is common in the press
   it seems to me at least looking at it from a shrink 's point of view
 that a lot of his life
  was programmed  
 summers were hard hard work in the heat of tennessee summers 
 he had the expectations of his senatorial father
 and washington d c and although i think he certainly had the capacity for play because i do know something about that
 he wasn 't as empowered  i think as he now is
  by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive which i think has its basis in all of us
 in our play history so
 what i would encourage on an individual level to do 
 is to explore backwards as far as you can go to the most clear joyful playful image that you have whether it 's with a toy on a birthday or on a
  vacation  and begin to build to build from the emotion of that
 into how that connects with your life now  
 and you 'll find you may change jobs which has happened to a number people when i 've had them do this in order to be more empowered through their play 
 or you 'll be able to enrich your life by by prioritizing
  and paying attention to it 
 most of us work with groups and i put this up because the d school the design school at stanford  thanks to david kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment 
 has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called from play to innovation and you 'll see this course is to investigate the human state of play  which is kind of like the polar bear husky state
 and its importance to creative thinking
  development and its biological basis to apply those principles through design thinking to promote innovation in the corporate world and the students will work with real world partners on 
  design projects with widespread application this is our maiden voyage in this we 're about two and a half three months into it and it 's really been fun there is our star pupil this labrador who taught a lot of us what a state of play
  is and an extremely aged and decrepit professor in in charge there and brendan boyle  rich crandall
 and on the far right is i think a person who will be in cahoots with george
 smoot for a nobel prize stuart thompson in neuroscience so we 've had brendan who 's from ideo and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students
 as they put play principles into
  practice in the classroom  and one of their projects was to
 see what makes meetings boring  and to try and do something about it  
 so what will follow is a student made film
 about just
  is the mental state of apparition in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing  
 characterized by a feeling of energized focus full involvement and success in the process of the activity 
 an important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in
 one after another  disruptive to the day  attendees at meetings don 't know when they 'll get back to the task that they left at their desk
  but it doesn 't have to be that way
  can come back to me  because when you need it again the meeting is literally hanging in
  your closet  
 the wearable meeting 
 because when you put it on you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting  
 but when you take it off
 that 's when the real action happens
  where you set aside time to play but where your life becomes infused
  minute by minute hour by hour with body
 object social fantasy transformational kinds of play  
 and i think you 'll have a a better and more empowered life  thank you john hockenberry
  it sounds to me like what you 're saying is that
 there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work and go i think i 've heard this 
 in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play
  that somehow  the way animals and humans deal with play is that it 's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity 
 your work seems to suggest that that is powerfully
  i don 't think that 's accurate and i think probably because animals have taught us that if you
 stop a cat from playing which you can do and we 've all seen how cats
 bat around stuff they 're just as good predators
 as they would be if they hadn  't played and if you imagine a kid pretending to be king kong or a race car
  there 's a disconnect between
 preparation for the future which is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as and thinking of it as a separate biological entity  and
 this is where my chasing animals for four five years really changed my perspective from a clinician
 to what i am now
 play has a biological place just like sleep and dreams do and if you look at sleep and dreams
 biologically 
 animals sleep and dream and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and and that are a very very important part of sleep and dreams  the next step of evolution in mammals
  creatures with divinely superfluous neurons
 will be to play  
 and the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear or you and i and our dogs can crossover and have that experience
 sets play aside as something separate and its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain so it 's not just something you do in your spare time jh 
 how do you keep and i know you 're part of the scientific
  research community and you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else
 how do you prevent and some of the data that you 've produced the good science that you 're talking about you 've produced is
 hot to handle how do you prevent either the media 's interpretation of your work or the scientific community 's
  that play enhances your intelligence  well let 's round these kids up put them in pens and make them play for months at a time they 'll all be geniuses and go to harvard how do you prevent people from taking that sort of action on the data that you 're developing sb well 
 i think the only way i know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that that i have who go from
  practitioners
 who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever
 a state of play  so people know that it 's there and then you get an fmri specialist and you get frank wilson and you get
 other other kinds of hard scientists including neuroendocrinologists  and you get them into
 a group together focused on play
  pretty hard not to
 take it seriously  
 unfortunately that hasn 't been done sufficiently for the national science foundation national institute of mental health or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously i mean you don 't hear about 
 anything that 's like cancer or heart disease associated with play  and yet i see it as something that 's just as basic for survival long term
 as learning some of the basic things about public health
