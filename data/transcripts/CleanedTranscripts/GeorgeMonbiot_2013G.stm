  when i was a young man i spent six years of wild adventure in the tropics working as an investigative journalist
 in some of the most bewitching parts of the world i was as reckless and foolish as only young men can
  this is why wars get fought  but i also felt more alive than i 've ever done since  
 and when i came home i found the scope of my existence gradually diminishing
 until loading the dishwasher seemed like an interesting challenge  
 and i found myself sort of scratching at the walls of life as if i was trying to find a way out into a wider space beyond i
  we evolved in rather more challenging times than these in a world
 of horns and tusks and fangs and claws 
 and we still possess the fear and the courage and the aggression required to navigate those times but
 in our comfortable safe crowded lands  we have few opportunities to exercise them without harming other people
  and
 this was the sort of constraint that i found myself
 bumping up against
  to conquer uncertainty
 to know what comes next that 's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies 
 and having got there or almost got there 
 we have just encountered a new set of unmet needs we 've privileged safety
  safety over experience and we 've gained a lot in doing so  but i think we 've lost something too  
 now  i don 't romanticize evolutionary time  i 'm already beyond the lifespan of most 
 the outcome of a mortal combat between me myopically stumbling around with a stone tipped spear and an enraged giant aurochs isn 't very hard to predict
  was it authenticity that i was looking for i don 't find that a useful or even intelligible concept i just wanted a richer and rawer life
 than i 've been able to lead in britain or indeed that we can lead in most parts of the industrialized world and it was only when i stumbled across
 an unfamiliar word
 that i began to understand what i was looking for and as
  soon as i found that word  i realized that i wanted to devote much of the rest of my life to it 
 the word is rewilding 
 and even though rewilding is a young word it already has several definitions but there are two in particular that fascinate me
  the first one
 is the mass restoration of ecosystems  
 one of the most exciting scientific findings of the past half century has been the discovery of widespread trophic cascades 
 a trophic cascade is an ecological process which starts at the top of the food chain and tumbles
 all the way down to the bottom
  and the classic example is what happened in the yellowstone national park in the united states when wolves were reintroduced in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five 
 now  we all know that wolves kill various species of animals  but perhaps we 're slightly less aware
 that they give life to many others it sounds strange but just just follow me for a while  before the wolves turned up
 been absent for seventy years the numbers of deer  because there was nothing to hunt them had built up and built up in the yellowstone park and despite efforts by humans to control 
  them they 'd managed to reduce much of the vegetation there to almost nothing they 'd just grazed it away  
  they killed some of the deer but that wasn 't the major thing 
 much more significantly  they radically changed the behavior of the deer 
 the deer started avoiding certain parts of the park  the places where they could be trapped most easily particularly the valleys and the gorges  
 and immediately those places started to regenerate in some areas the height of the trees quintupled in just six years
  bare valley sides quickly became forests of aspen and willow and cottonwood  
 and as soon as that happened  the birds started moving in 
 the number of songbirds of migratory birds started to increase greatly  the number of beavers started to increase because beavers like to eat the trees  
 and beavers like wolves are ecosystem engineers they create niches for other
  and the dams they built in the rivers
 provided habitats for otters and muskrats and ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians 
 the wolves killed coyotes  and as a result of that the number of rabbits and mice began to rise which meant more hawks more weasels more foxes more badgers  ravens and bald eagles came down to feed on the
 carrion that the wolves had left bears fed on it too and their population began to rise as well  partly also because there were more berries growing on the regenerating shrubs 
  and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves by killing some of the calves of the deer  
  the channels narrowed more pools formed more riffle sections all of which were great for wildlife habitats the rivers changed
 in response to the wolves 
 and the reason was that the regenerating forests stabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often so that the rivers became more fixed in their course  
 similarly by driving the deer out of some
  places and the vegetation recovering on the on the valley sides there was less soil erosion because the vegetation stabilized that as well  
 so the wolves small in number
  transformed not just the ecosystem of the yellowstone national park this huge area of land but also
 its physical geography whales in the southern oceans
 have similarly wide ranging effects  one of the many post rational excuses made by the japanese government for killing whales
 is that they said well  the number of fish and krill will rise and then there 'll be more for people to eat 
 well it 's a stupid excuse but it sort of kind of makes sense doesn 't it because you 'd think that whales eat huge amounts of fish and
  so obviously take the whales away there 'll be more fish and krill  
 but the opposite happened 
 you take the whales away  and the number of krill collapses  
 why would that possibly have happened  well  it now turns out that the whales are crucial to sustaining that entire ecosystem 
 and one of the reasons for this is that they often feed at depth and then they come up to the surface and produce what biologists politely call large fecal plumes 
 huge explosions
  of poop right across the surface waters 
 up in the photic zone where there 's enough light to to allow photosynthesis to take place 
 and those great plumes of fertilizer stimulate the growth of phytoplankton the plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain which stimulate the growth of zooplankton which feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it 
 the other thing that whales do is that as they 're plunging up and down through the
  water column they 're kicking the phytoplankton back up towards the surface where it where it can continue to survive and reproduce and
 interestingly well  we know that
 plant plankton in in the oceans absorb carbon from the atmosphere the more plant plankton there are the more carbon they absorb and eventually they filter down into the abyss and remove that carbon from the atmospheric system
  well  it seems that when whales were at their historic populations  
 they were probably responsible for sequestering some tens of millions of tons of carbon every year from the atmosphere  
 and
 when you look at it like that you think wait a minute here are the wolves changing the physical geography
  the yellowstone national park here are the whales changing the composition of the atmosphere
  you begin to see that possibly the evidence supporting james lovelock 's gaia hypothesis which conceives of the world as a coherent 
  organism is beginning at the ecosystem level to accumulate trophic cascades
 tell us that the natural world is even more fascinating and complex than we thought it was
  was
 they tell us that when you take away the large animals  
 you are left with a radically different ecosystem to one which retains its large animals  
 and they make in my view a powerful case for the reintroduction of missing species 
 rewilding to
  means bringing back some of the missing plants and animals  it means taking down the fences it means blocking the drainage ditches  it means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea  but otherwise stepping back 
 it has
 no view as to what a right ecosystem or a right assemblage of species looks like it doesn 't try to produce a heath or a meadow or a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef  
 it lets nature
  nature decide and nature by and large is pretty good at deciding 
 now  i mentioned that there are two definitions of rewilding that interest me  the other one
 is the rewilding of human life  
 and i don 't see this as an alternative to civilization  i believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology as we 're doing now  but at the same time if we choose
  have access to a richer and wilder life of adventure when we want to because there would be wonderful  rewilded habitats 
 and the opportunities for this
 are are developing more rapidly than you might think possible there 's one estimate which suggests that in the united
  two thirds of the land which was once forested and then cleared has become reforested as loggers and farmers have retreated particularly from the eastern half of the country 
 there 's another one which suggests that thirty million hectares of land in europe an area the size of poland 
 will be vacated by farmers between two thousand and two thousand and thirty  
 now  faced with
  does it not seem a little unambitious to be thinking
 only of bringing back wolves lynx bears beavers bison  boar  moose and all the other species which are already beginning to move quite rapidly across europe  
 perhaps we should also start thinking
 about the return of some of our lost megafauna what megafauna you say  
  every continent had one apart from antarctica when trafalgar square in london was excavated the river gravels there were found to be stuffed with the bones 
  of hippopotamus  rhinos  elephants  hyenas lions  yes ladies and gentlemen there were lions in trafalgar square long before nelson 's column was built 
  similar to our own it 's not climate  largely  which has got rid of the world 's megafaunas  it 's pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so  
 and even so you can still see the shadows of these great beasts in our current ecosystems
  why is it that so many deciduous trees are able to sprout
  whatever point the trunk is broken  why is it that they can withstand the loss of so much of their bark why do understory trees which
 are subject to to
 lower sheer forces from the wind and have to carry less weight than the big canopy trees  why are they so much tougher and
  in europe for example they evolved to resist the straight tusked elephant elephas antiquus which was a great beast it was related to the asian elephant but 
  it was a temperate animal a temperate forest creature it was a lot bigger than the asian elephant  
 over engineered to resist browsing by deer  perhaps because they evolved
 to resist browsing by rhinoceros isn 't it an amazing thought
 that every time you wander into a park or down an avenue or through a leafy street you can see the shadows of these great beasts 
  the study of past ecosystems  crucial to an understanding of our own  feels like a portal through which you may pass
 into an enchanted kingdom and if we really are looking at areas of land
 of the sort of sizes i 've been talking about becoming available why not reintroduce some of our lost megafauna or at least
 species closely related to those which have become extinct everywhere why shouldn 't all of us
 have a serengeti on our doorsteps  and perhaps this is the most important thing
 that rewilding offers us the most important thing that 's missing from our lives hope 
 in motivating people to love and defend the natural world 
 an ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair 
 the story
  rewilding tells us is that ecological change need not always proceed in one direction  it offers us the hope
 that our silent spring could be replaced by a raucous summer
