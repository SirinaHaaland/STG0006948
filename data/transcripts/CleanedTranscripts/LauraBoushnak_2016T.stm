  standing in the middle of a deserted field full of land mines in real life i love to hike  but every time i want to go on a hike  it makes me
  i have this thought in the back of my mind that i might lose a limb 
 this underlying fear started ten years ago after i met mohammed a cluster bomb survivor of the summer two thousand and six 
  war in lebanon mohammed like so many other survivors all around the world had to live through
 the horrifying repercussions of cluster munitions on a daily basis  when the one month conflict started
  in lebanon i was still working at  agence france presse in paris  
 i remember how i was glued to the screens  anxiously following the news  
 i wanted to reassure myself that the falling bombs missed my parents ' home 
 when i arrived in beirut on assignment to cover that war i was relieved to be united with my family  after they had finally managed to escape southern lebanon
 the day the war was over  i remember seeing this image one of blocked roads of displaced people eagerly rushing south back to their homes  regardless of what they would find 
 an estimated four million cluster submunitions were spread in lebanon during the 34 day conflict
  lost both legs during the last week of the conflict 
 the fact that he lives a five minute drive from my parents ' home made it easier to follow him through the years it was now almost ten years since we first met  
 i saw the young boy who had to endure physical and emotional trauma  i saw the teenager who tried to offer his friends
  in return for a set fee of five dollars  
 and i know the young jobless man who spends hours surfing the internet trying to meet a girl who might become his girlfriend 
 his fate and the effects of losing his legs
 are now his daily reality survivors of bomb trauma like mohammed have to deal with so many details that never occur to us who
  have imagined that so many daily tasks we do or take for granted such as going to the beach or even picking up something from the floor 
 would become sources of stress and anxiety  
 well that 's what eventually became of mohammed due to his inflexible prosthetic legs 
 ten years ago  i had no clue what a cluster bomb was nor its horrifying implications  
 i learned that this indiscriminate weapon was used in so many parts of the world and continues to kill
  on a regular basis  without distinguishing between a military target
 or a child  
 i naively asked myself but seriously who made those weapons  and what for 
 let me explain to you what a cluster bomb is it 's a large canister filled with bomblets 
 when it 's dropped from the air it opens up in midair to release hundreds of bomblets
 they scatter around wide areas and on impact many fail to explode  
 those unexploded ones end up just like landmines sitting on the ground  waiting for their next target  
 if someone steps on them by accident or picks them up they can explode  
 these weapons are extremely unpredictable which makes the threat even bigger one day
  can work his land without a problem the next day  he can make fire and burn some branches and the submunitions close by could be set off because of the heat 
 the problem is children mistake those bomblets for toys  because they can look like bouncy balls or soda cans  
 being a documentary
  i decided to go back to lebanon a few months after the conflict ended to meet cluster bomb survivors  and i met a few hussein and rasha who both lost a leg to submunitions 
 their stories are similar to so many other kids ' stories across the world and are a testimony to the horrifying implications of the continuous use of such weapons 
 that 's when i met mohammed  in january two thousand and seven  he was eleven years old and i met him exactly
  four months after his accident 
 when i first saw him he was going through painful physiotherapy to recover from his fresh wounds 
 still in shock at such a young age mohammed was struggling to get used to his new body  
 he would even wake up sometimes at night wanting to scratch his lost feet 
 what drew me closer to his story was my instant realization of the difficulties
  mohammed was likely to face in the future
 that what he has been suffering while adjusting to his injury at the age of eleven would increase manyfold 
 even before his disability mohammed 's life wasn 't easy  
 he was born in the rashidieh camp for palestinian refugees  and this is where he still lives 
 lebanon holds some four hundred thousand palestinian refugees  and they suffer from
  discriminatory laws they 're not allowed to work in the public sector or practice certain professions and are denied the right to own property 
 this is one of the reasons why mohammed doesn 't really regret dropping out of school right after his injury  he said 
 what 's the point of a university degree when i can 't find a job
  cluster bomb use creates a vicious circle of impact on communities and not only the lives of their victims 
 many who get injured by this weapon drop out of school can 't find jobs or even lose their jobs therefore losing the ability to provide for their families  
 this is not to mention the continuous physical pain and the experience of feeling
  these weapons affect the poorest of the poor the high medical cost is a burden to the families  they end up relying on humanitarian agencies  which is insufficient 
 and unsustainable especially when injuries require lifelong support to the injured 
 's very cautious with his steps as a couple of falls over the years brought him embarrassment among his friends 
 he joked that since he doesn 't have legs some days he tries to walk on his hands 
 one of the worst yet invisible impacts of the weapon is the psychological scars it leaves 
 in one of mohammed 's early medical reports he was diagnosed with signs of ptsd  he
  sleep disturbance and showed signs of anger 
 the reality is mohammed never received proper help to fully recover his current obsession is to leave lebanon at any cost
 even if it meant embarking on a hazardous journey along with refugees drifting towards europe today through the mediterranean  
 knowing how risky such a journey would be he said if i were
  to die on the way it doesn 't matter to mohammed  he is dead here anyway 
 cluster bombs are a world problem 
 as this munition keeps destroying and hurting whole communities for generations to come 
 in an online interview with the director of the
  the us forces dropped over two million tons of munitions over laos 
 if they couldn 't find their targets in vietnam  there were free drop areas in laos where planes would drop their loads before going back to base  because it 's dangerous to land with loaded planes 
 according to the international committee of the red cross in laos alone one of the poorest countries in the world
 nine to
  unexploded submunitions remain some eleven thousand people have been killed or injured since one thousand nine hundred and seventy three 
 this lethal weapon has been used by over twenty states during armed conflicts in over thirty five countries such as ukraine  iraq and sudan
  so far one hundred and nineteen states have joined an international treaty banning cluster bombs  which is officially called the convention on cluster munitions  
 but some of the biggest producers of cluster munitions namely the united states russia and china
 remain outside of this lifesaving treaty and continue to produce them reserve the right to produce them in the future
  keep those harmful weapons in their stockpiles
 and even possibly use them in the future 
 cluster bombs have reportedly been used most recently in the ongoing conflicts in yemen
 and syria  according to research on the worldwide investments in cluster munitions producers by pax
 financial institutions invested billions of us dollars into companies that make cluster munitions
 the majority of these institutions are based in countries that have not yet signed the convention on cluster munitions  
 getting back to mohammed  one of the few jobs he was able to find was picking lemons 
 when i ask him if it 's safe to work in the field he said
 areas where agriculture is the main source of income  
 according to handicap international 's research ninety eight percent of those killed or injured by cluster munitions
 are civilians
 eighty four percent of casualties are males 
 in countries where these people have no choice but to work in those fields they simply do it and risk
 mohammed is the only male to three sisters  culturally he 's expected to provide for his family  but he simply can 't 
 he tried to have so many different jobs but he couldn 't keep any due to his physical disability and the less than friendly environment to people with disabilities to say the least 
 it hurts him a lot when he goes out looking for a
  he 's turned away with a small amount of money paid to him out of pity  he said i 'm not here to beg for money i just want to earn it 
 mohammed today is twenty one years old he 's illiterate  and he communicates with voice messages here is one of his messages
  my dream is to run  and i 'm pretty sure once i start running  i would never stop
