  a few years ago with my colleague emmanuelle charpentier i invented a new technology for editing genomes  it 's called
 the  crispr technology allows scientists to make changes to the dna in cells that could
  allow us to cure genetic disease 
 you might be interested to know that the  crispr technology came about through a basic research project that was aimed at discovering how bacteria fight viral infections 
 bacteria have to deal with viruses in their environment and we can think about a viral infection like a ticking time bomb
 a bacterium has only a few minutes to defuse the bomb before it gets destroyed
  so many bacteria have in their cells an adaptive immune system called crispr that allows them to detect viral dna and destroy it 
 part of the crispr system is a protein called cas9 
 that 's able to seek out cut and eventually degrade viral dna in a specific way  
 and it was through our research to understand the activity
  of this protein cas9 that we realized that we could harness its function
 as a genetic engineering technology a way for scientists to delete or insert specific bits of dna into cells with incredible precision
 that would offer opportunities to do things that really haven 't been possible in the past the crispr technology has already been
  used to change the dna
 in the cells of mice and monkeys other organisms as well
  chinese scientists showed recently that they could even use the crispr technology to change genes in human embryos  
 and scientists in philadelphia showed they could use crispr to remove the dna of an integrated hiv virus from infected human cells
  the opportunity to do this kind of genome editing also raises various ethical issues that we have to consider because this technology can be employed not only in adult cells but also in the embryos of organisms including
 our own
 species  and so together with my colleagues i 've called for a global conversation about the technology that i co invented so that we can consider all of the
 ethical and societal implications of a technology like this what i want to do now is tell you
 what the  crispr technology is what it can do 
 where we are today and why i think we need to take a prudent path forward in the way that we employ this technology 
 when viruses infect a cell they inject their dna and in a
  bacterium the crispr system allows that dna to be plucked out of the virus  and inserted in little bits into the chromosome the dna of the bacterium  
 and these integrated bits of viral dna get inserted at a site called
 you can see why we use the acronym  crispr 
 it 's a mechanism that allows cells to record over time the viruses they they have been exposed to and importantly those bits of dna 
  are passed on to the cells  ' progeny so cells are protected from viruses not only in one generation but over many generations of cells 
  record of infection and as my colleague blake wiedenheft likes to say the crispr locus is effectively a genetic vaccination card in cells  
 once those bits of dna have been inserted into the bacterial chromosome the cell then makes a little copy of a molecule called rna which is orange
  a chemical cousin of dna and it allows interaction with dna molecules that have a matching sequence 
 so those little bits of rna from the crispr locus associate they bind to protein called cas9 which is white in the picture  
 and form a complex that functions like a sentinel in the cell it searches through
  all of the dna in the cell to find sites that match the sequences in the bound rnas and when those sites are found as you can see here  the blue 
  molecule is dna this complex associates with that dna and allows
  sentinel complex like a pair of scissors
 that can cut dna it makes a double stranded break in the dna helix 
 and importantly  this complex is programmable 
 so it can be programmed to recognize particular dna sequences  and make a break in the dna at that site 
 as i 'm going to tell you now we
  recognized that that activity could be harnessed for genome engineering 
 to allow cells to make a very precise change to the dna at the site where this break was introduced 
 that 's sort of analogous to the way that we use a word processing program to fix a typo in a document 
 the reason we envisioned using the crispr system for genome engineering
 is because
  cells have the ability to detect broken dna and repair it 
 so when a plant or an animal cell detects a double stranded break in its dna it can fix that break either by pasting together the ends of the broken dna with a little tiny change in the sequence of that position 
 or it can repair the break by integrating a new piece of dna at the site of the cut
 so if we have a way to introduce 
  double stranded breaks into dna at precise places  we can trigger cells to repair those breaks 
 by either the disruption or incorporation of new genetic information  
 so if we were able to program the  crispr technology to make a break in dna at the position
 at or near a mutation
  causing cystic fibrosis for example  we could trigger cells to repair
 that mutation genome engineering is actually not new it 's been in development since the
 we 've had technologies for sequencing dna for copying dna and even for manipulating dna 
  these technologies were very promising but the problem was that they were either
 inefficient or they were difficult enough to use that most scientists had not adopted them for use in their own laboratories or certainly for
 many clinical applications so the opportunity to take a technology like crispr and utilize it
 has appeal because of its relative simplicity
  we can think of older genome engineering technologies
 as similar to having to rewire your computer each time you want to run a new piece of software 
 whereas the  crispr technology is like software for the genome we can program it easily using these little bits of rna 
  break is made in dna we can induce repair 
 and thereby potentially achieve astounding things like being able to correct mutations that cause sickle cell anemia or cause huntington 's disease  
 i actually think that the first applications of the  crispr technology are going to happen in the blood where it 's relatively easier to
 deliver this tool into
  compared to solid tissues  
 right now a lot of the work that 's going on applies to animal models of human disease such as mice 
 the technology is being used to make very precise changes that allow us to to study the way that these changes in the cell 's dna affect either a tissue or in this case an entire organism 
 now in this example the  crispr technology was used to disrupt a gene by making a tiny change
  in the dna
 in a gene that is responsible for the black coat color of these mice  imagine that these white mice
 differ from their pigmented litter mates by just a tiny change at one gene in the entire genome 
 and they 're otherwise completely normal  and when we sequence the dna from these animals we find that the change in the dna has occurred at exactly the place
  place where we induced it using the crispr technology additional experiments are going on in other animals that are useful for creating
 models for human disease 
 such as monkeys  
 and here we find that we can use these systems to test the application of this technology in particular tissues for example  figuring out how to deliver the
 we also want to understand better how to control the way that dna is repaired after it 's cut and also to figure out how to
 control and limit any kind of off target or unintended
 effects of using the technology  i think that we will see clinical application
  certainly in adults within the next ten years i think that it 's likely that we will see
 clinical trials and possibly even approved therapies within that time
  which is a very exciting thing to think about and because of the excitement around this technology there 's a lot of interest in
 start up companies that have been
 founded to commercialize the crispr technology  and lots of venture capitalists that have been investing in these companies
 but we have to also consider that the  crispr technology can be used for things like enhancement  imagine that we could try to
 engineer humans that have
 enhanced properties such as stronger bones or less susceptibility to cardiovascular disease
 or even to have properties that we would consider maybe to be desirable like a different eye color or to be taller things
  like that 
 designer humans if you will  right now  the genetic information to
 understand what types of genes would give rise to these traits is mostly not known but it 's important to know that the  crispr technology gives us
 a tool to make such changes once that knowledge becomes available this raises a number of ethical
  questions that we have to to carefully consider and
 this is why i and my colleagues have called for a global pause in any clinical application of the crispr technology in human embryos to give us time to really consider all of the various implications of of doing so 
 and actually there is an important precedent for such a pause from the
  to call for a moratorium on the use of molecular cloning  until the safety of that technology could be tested carefully and and validated 
 so
 genome engineered humans are not with us yet  but this is no longer science fiction
  animals and plants are happening
 right now  
 and this puts in front of all of us a huge responsibility 
 to consider carefully both the unintended consequences as well as the intended impacts of a scientific breakthrough  
 huge consequences as you pointed out your attitude about asking for a pause or a moratorium or
 a quarantine is
 incredibly responsible there are of course the therapeutic results of this but then there are
 the un therapeutic ones and they seem to be the ones gaining traction particularly in the media this is one of the latest latest issues of the economist
  enhancement it 's not about therapeutics  
 what kind of reactions did you get back in march from your colleagues in the science world when you asked or suggested that we should actually pause
 this for a moment and think about it jennifer doudna my colleagues were actually i think delighted to have the opportunity to discuss this openly  it 's interesting that as i talk
  to people my scientific colleagues as well as others there 's a wide variety of viewpoints about this so clearly it 's a topic that needs careful consideration and discussion bg there 's a big meeting happening in december that you and your colleagues are calling together with the national academy of sciences and others 
 what do 
  you hope
 will come out of of the meeting practically jd well i hope that we can air the views of many different individuals and and
 stakeholders who want to think about how to use this technology responsibly
  may not be possible to come up with a consensus point of view but i think we should at least understand what all the issues are as we go forward bg now colleagues of yours
 like george church for example at harvard 
 they say yeah ethical issues basically are just a question of safety we test and test and test again in animals and in labs and then
 once we feel it 's safe enough we move on to
  kind of the other school of thought that we should actually use this opportunity and really go for it is there
 a possible split happening in the science community about this i mean are we going to see some people holding back because they have ethical concerns concerns and some others just
 going forward because some countries under regulate or don 't regulate at all jd well i think with any new technology especially something like this  there are going to be a variety
  that 's perfectly understandable i think that in the end this technology will be used for for human genome engineering
  but i think to do that without careful consideration and discussion of the risks and and potential complications would not be responsible
  no one seems aside from
 autonomous warfare robots nobody seems to have launched a similar discussion in those in those fields in calling for a moratorium do you think that your discussion may serve as a blueprint for other fields jd 
 well i think it 's hard for scientists to get out of the laboratory  speaking for myself  it 's a little bit uncomfortable to do that but i do think that being involved in the genesis of
 really puts me and my colleagues in a position of responsibility  and i would say that i certainly hope that other technologies will be considered in the same way 
 just as we would want to consider something that could have implications in other fields besides biology
