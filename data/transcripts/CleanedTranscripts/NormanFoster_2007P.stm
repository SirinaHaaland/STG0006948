  as an architect you design for
 the present with an awareness of the past  for a future which is essentially
  the green agenda is probably
 the most important agenda and issue of the day  and i 'd like to share some experience
 over the last forty years we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year and and to explore and to touch on some
 observations about the nature of sustainability
  how far you can anticipate what follows from it  what are the threats what are the possibilities the challenges the opportunities i think that
 i 've said in the past  many many years ago before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda 
 that it wasn 't about fashion
 it was about survival  but what i never
  said  and what i 'm
 really going to make the point is that really green is cool  i mean  all the projects which have 
 in some way been inspired by that agenda
 are about a celebratory lifestyle in a way celebrating
 the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life
 i rarely actually quote anything so i 'm going to try and find a piece of paper if i
 can [ in ] which somebody at the end of last year  ventured the thought
 about what for that individual as a kind of important observer  analyst
  writer a guy called thomas friedman who wrote
 in the herald tribune about two thousand and six he said 
 i think the most important thing to happen in two thousand and six was that living and thinking green hit main street  
 we reached a tipping point this year
 where living acting designing
  and manufacturing green
 came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic  capitalistic
 and competitive thing they could do hence my motto green is the new red white and blue 
 and i asked myself in a way  looking back when did that
 kind of awareness of the planet
 and its fragility first appear and i think it was july twenty 
 when for the first time man could look back at planet earth and in a way  it was
 buckminster fuller who coined that phrase  and before the kind of collapse of the communist
  system i was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts in space city and other places in russia and interestingly as i think back 
 they were the first true environmentalists they were filled with a kind of pioneering passion
  fired about the problems of the
  at that period it was in a way a number of things were happening buckminster fuller
 was the kind of green guru again a word that had not been coined he was
 a design scientist if you like a poet but he foresaw all the things that are happening now it
 's another subject it 's another conversation you can go back to his writings it 's quite extraordinary 
 it was at that time
  time  with an awareness fired by bucky 's prophecies his concerns
 as a citizen as a kind of citizen of the planet 
 that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time and it 's
 a number of projects i select this one because it was
 seventy three and it was a master plan for one of the canary islands  and
 this probably coincided with the time when you had the planet earth 's sourcebook  and you had the hippie movement 
 and there are some of those qualities in this drawing which seeks to sum up the recommendations and all the components are there which are now in common parlance
  our vocabulary you know 30 odd years later wind energy recycling biomass solar cells  
 and
 in parallel at that time there was a very kind of exclusive
 design club people who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of dieter rams
  objects that he would create for the company called braun this is going back the
 and
 despite bucky 's prophecies that
 that everything would be miniaturized and technology would make an incredible style access to
 to comfort to amenities it was very very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in
  this image would be very very stylishly packaged  and that and more besides would be in the palm of your hand and i think that
 that digital revolution now is coming to the point
 where as the virtual world which brings so many people together here  finally connects with the physical world there is the
  that that that has become humanized so that digital world has all the friendliness all the immediacy the orientation of the analog world probably summed up
 in a way by the stylish or
 alternative available here as we generously had
 gifted at lunchtime
  which is a further kind of development and again  inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel a very very beautiful object so 
 something which in 
 was very exclusive has now become interestingly  quite inclusive and the reference to the ipod as iconic  and
 in a way evocative of
  the beginning of the year two thousand and seven the financial times
 commented that the detroit companies envy the halo effect that toyota has gained from the prius as the hybrid
  vehicle which rivals the ipod as an iconic product  and i think it 's very tempting to in a way seduce ourselves as architects
  anybody involved with the design process that
 the answer to our problems lies with buildings buildings are important but they 're
 only a component of a much bigger picture  in other words  as i might seek to demonstrate if you could achieve the impossible the equivalent of perpetual motion you could design a 
  house  for example that would be the answer unfortunately it 's not the answer it 's only the beginning of the problem you cannot separate the buildings out from the
  infrastructure of  cites and the mobility of transit for example if in that 
  phrase we
 draw back and we look at planet earth and we take a kind of typical industrialized society  then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings forty four percent
  but again that only shows part of the picture  if you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport  in other words the transport of people which is twenty six percent 
 then seventy percent of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our  cites and infrastructure work together 
 so the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the
  cities of which the buildings are a part 
 for example if you take  and you make a comparison between a recent kind of
 city  what i 'll call simplistically a north american city and detroit is not a bad example it is very car dependent  the city goes out in annular rings consuming more and more green space and more
 and more roads  and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center
 which again the city center as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial again becomes dead if you compared detroit
 with a city of a northern european example and munich is not a bad example of that
  with the greater dependence on walking and cycling then a city which is
 really only twice as dense is only using  one tenth of the energy  
 in other words you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous  
 so basically if you wanted to generalize
  can demonstrate
 that as the density increases along the bottom there that the
 energy consumed reduces dramatically of course you can 't separate this out from issues like social diversity mass transit 
 the ability to be able to walk a convenient
  of civic spaces but
 again you can see detroit in yellow at the top extraordinary consumption down below copenhagen and copenhagen although it 's a dense city is not dense compared
 with the really dense cities  in the year two thousand a rather interesting thing happened you had for the first time mega cities
  five million or more which were occurring in the developing world 
 and now out of typically forty six cities thirty three of those mega cities are in the developing world  so you have to ask yourself the environmental 
  impact of for example china or india if you take china  and you just take beijing 
  you can see on that traffic system  and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the
 at the price of the bicycles  in other words
  if you put onto the roads  as is currently happening one thousand new cars every day
  in the world and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing reducing  and
 that urbanization is extraordinary accelerated pace so 
 if we think of the transition in our society
 of the movement from the
  land to the cities which took two hundred years  then that same process
 is happening in twenty years in other words it is accelerating by a factor
 of ten and quite interestingly
  that period where the urbanization has has trebled  
 if i pull back from that global picture  and i look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology
  which as a tool is a tool for designers  and i cite
  selection of projects then how how do you measure that change of technology how does it affect the design of of buildings 
 and particularly how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy create less pollution and are more socially
  the one example i take is a corporate headquarters for a company called willis and faber  in a small market town
 in the northeast of england  commuting distance with with london  
 and here the first thing you can see is that this building the roof is a very
  kind of overcoat blanket a kind of insulating garden which is also about the celebration of public space in other words for this community they have this garden in the sky so
 the humanistic ideal is very very strong in all this work encapsulated perhaps by
 one of my early sketches here where you can see greenery you can see sunlight
  you have a connection with nature  and nature is part of the generator the driver for this building and symbolically the colors
 of the interior are green and yellow  it has facilities like swimming pools it has flextime  
 it has a social heart a space you have contact with nature now this was
  building received
 an award and the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time 
 and the people who 'd created it came back the project managers the company chairmen then 
 and they were saying you know the architects norman was always going on
  didn 't seem to cost us any more so
 we humored him we kept him happy 
 the image at the top what it doesn 't if you look at it in detail really what it is saying is you can wire this building  
 this building was wired for change 
 so in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five the image there is of typewriters 
 and when the photograph was taken  it 's word processors  and what they were saying
  this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology 
 we were fortunate  because in a way our building was future proofed it anticipated change  even though those changes were not known 
 round about that
 design period leading up to this building  i did a sketch which we pulled out of the archive
 and i was saying and i wrote 
 but we don 't have the time and we really don 't have the immediate expertise at a technical level in other words we didn 't have the technology
 to do what would be really interesting on that building and that would be to create a kind of 
  bubble a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate
 breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads notwithstanding the fact that the building as a green building is very much a pioneering building and
 if i fast forward in time what is interesting is that the technology is now available
 and celebratory the library of the free university which opened last year
  that and again  the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality 
 and a combination of devices here the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks  and the way in which that is enclosed by this
 by this skin
  enables the building to be ventilated to consume dramatically less energy 
 and where it 's really working with the forces of nature and what is interesting is that
 this is
 is hugely popular by the people who use it again coming back to that thing about the lifestyle
  and in a way   the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit
  so it 's not a kind of sacrifice quite the reverse i think it 's a great it 's a celebration  and you can measure
 the
 the performance in terms of energy consumption of that building against a typical
 library  if i show another aspect of that technology
  in a completely different context this apartment building in the alps in switzerland 
 prefabricated from the most traditional of materials but that material
 because of the technology the computing ability the ability to prefabricate make high performance components out of timber
 very much at the cutting edge and just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology the ability to plot
  points in the
 sky and
 and to transmit to transfer that information now directly
 into the factory  
 so if you cross the border just across the border a small factory in germany  and here you can see the guy with his
  computer screen 
 and those points in space are communicated and on the left are the cutting machines which then in the factory  enable those individual pieces to be fabricated
 and plus or minus very very few millimeters to be slotted together on site
  to then be clad in the oldest technology which is the kind of hand cut shingles one quarter of a million of them applied by hand
 as the final the final finish  and again  the way in which that works as a building  for those of us
  if i made the leap into these new technologies then how did we
 what happened before that  i mean you know what was life like before the mobile phone
  the things that you take for granted  well obviously the building still happened i mean this is a glimpse
  the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of of this space here  and
 in the absence of computers you have to physically model so for example 
 we would put models under an artificial sky  
 for wind tunnels we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air
  and the many kilometers of of cable and so on and the turning point was probably in our terms  when we had
 the first computer  and that was at the time that we
 sought to redesign  reinvent the airport
  this is terminal four at heathrow typical of any terminal big heavy roof blocking out the sunlight lots of machinery big pipes 
 whirring machinery
  and stansted  the green alternative which uses natural light is a friendly place you know where you are you can relate to the outside
  and for a large part of its cycle not needing electric light electric light which in turn creates more heat
  creates more cooling loads and so on  and at that particular point in time
  this was one of the few solitary computers  and that 's a little image of the tree of stansted  
 not going back very far in time 
 that 's our office  and if you looked very closely you 'd see that people were drawing
  with pencils and they were pushing you know big rulers and triangles it 's not that long ago seventeen years  and here we are now
 i mean  major transformation going back in time  there was a lady called valerie larkin  and in
  which record our archival information on past  current and future projects  
 that reaches twenty one kilometers into the sky this is the view you would get if you looked down on that
  wonderful protagonists like al gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature  
 set in the context of that  interestingly those buildings which are celebratory and very very relevant to this place 
 our reichstag project which
 has a very familiar agenda i 'm sure  as a public
  place where we sought to in a way  through a process of advocacy
  reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians public space
  and maybe its hidden agenda an energy manifesto something that would be free completely
  fuel as we know it  so it would be totally renewable  and again  the humanistic sketch the translation into the public space but this very very much a 
  part of the ecology but here  not having to model it for real  obviously the wind tunnel had a place  
  how that would work in terms of the forces of nature natural ventilation to be able to model the chamber below and to look at
 biomass a combination of biomass  aquifers  burning vegetable oil
 a process that  
 quite interestingly was developed in eastern germany at the time of its dependence on the soviet bloc so really retranslating that technology
  and developing something which was so clean  it was virtually
 you can measure it again you can compare how that building in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year at the time that we took that project over seven thousand tons
 what it would have been with natural gas and finally with the vegetable oil four hundred and fifty
  percent reduction virtually clean  we can see the same processes at work in terms of the commerce bank its dependence on natural ventilation the way that you can model those gardens the way 
  they spiral around  but again  very much about the lifestyle the quality something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work and again  we can measure the reduction in terms of energy consumption 
  swiss re again develops that a little bit further the project in the city in london  
 and this sequence shows the buildup of that model but what it shows first which i think is quite interesting 
 is that here you see the circle you see the public space around it  
 what are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site if for example you
 you seek to do a building which
 goes right to the edge of the pavement it 's the same amount of space  
 and finally you profile this you cut grooves into it 
 the grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views which give light  ventilation 
 make the building fresher  and you enclose
  that with something that also is central to its appearance which is a mesh of
 of triangulated structures again  in a long connection evocative of some of those works of buckminster fuller  and the way in which triangulation 
  can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity
  if we look at a detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria  
 the way in which now with a computer  we can model the forces we can see the high pressure the low pressure the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing  so it also has the ability all the time 
  regardless of the direction of the wind to be able to
 to make the building fresh and efficient  and
 unlike conventional buildings the top of the building is celebratory it 's a viewing place for people not machinery  
 and the base of the building is again about public space  
 comparing it with a typical building  what happens if we seek to use such
  and i 'm just going to give two images out of a kind of
 company research project it 's been well known that the dead sea is dying
  the level is dropping rather like the aral sea  and the dead sea is obviously much lower than the
 oceans and seas
  around it  so there has been a project which rescues the dead sea by creating a pipeline a pipe
  sometimes above the surface sometimes buried that will redress that and will feed from the gulf of aqaba into the dead sea 
  and our translation of that  using a lot of the thinking built up over the forty years
 is to say  what if that  instead of being just a pipe  what if it is a lifeline  what if it is the equivalent depending on where you are of the grand canal 
 in terms of tourists habitation desalination
 agriculture in other words water is the lifeblood  and if you just go back to the previous image and you look at this area of volatility
 and hostility 
 that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause in terms of something that that would be
 genuinely green and productive in the widest sense infrastructure at that large scale is also inseparable from
 from communication and whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world then it 's absolutely central to society and how do we make more legible
 in this growing world especially in some of the places that i 'm talking about china for example
  which in the next ten years will create four hundred new airports  now what form do they take how do you make them more friendly at that scale hong kong i refer to as a kind of
 analog experience in a digital age because you always have a point of reference so what happens when
 we take that and you expand expand that further into the
  interesting is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate
  is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment two hundred and fifty
 excuse me fifty thousand people working twenty four hours seven days larger by seventeen percent than every terminal put together at heathrow
  terminal five and the challenge here is a building that will be green that is compact despite its size
 and is about the human experience of travel is about friendly is coming back to that starting point is very 
 very much about the lifestyle  and perhaps these in the end as celebratory spaces  as hubert was
 talking over lunch as we sort of engaged in conversation talked about this talked about cities 
 hubert was saying  absolutely correctly these are the new cathedrals 
 and in a way  one aspect of this conversation
 was triggered on new year 's eve when i was talking about
  in china
 in terms of its
 green ambitions and aspirations and i was voicing the thought
 that it just crossed my mind that new year 's eve a sort of symbolic
 turning point as we move from two thousand and six to two thousand and seven that maybe you know  the future was the most
  innovative sort of nation the way in which somebody like kennedy inspirationally could say we put a man on the moon you know 
 who is going to say that we cracked this thing of the dependence on on fossil fuels with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes 
 and so on and that 's a concerted platform it 's more than one device you know it 's renewable  and i voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year  i thought that the inspiration 
  was more likely to come from those other larger countries out there the chinas the indias
