  my name is lovegrove i only know nine lovegroves two of which are my parents  they are first cousins and you know what happens when you know 
 so there 's a terribly weird
 freaky side to me which i 'm fighting with all the time so to try and
 get through today i 've kind of disciplined myself with an 18 minute talk i was hanging on to have a pee i thought perhaps if i was hanging on long enough that would guide me through the eighteen minutes 
 ok  i am known as captain organic and that 's a philosophical
  position as well as an aesthetic position
 but today what i 'd like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people 's soul and emotion
  not very long ago  not many
 thousands of years ago  we actually lived in caves  and i don 't think we 've lost that coding system 
 we respond so well to form  
 but i 'm interested in creating
  intelligent form i 'm not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design  this artificially induced consumerism i think it 's atrocious 
 my world is the world of people like amory lovins  
 janine benyus  james watson  i 'm in that world but i work
 purely instinctively  i 'm not a scientist i could have been perhaps
  but i work in this world where i trust my instincts so i am a 
 translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with and we should be developing things we should be developing packaging for ideas
 which elevate people 's perceptions and respect for the things that we dig
  of the earth and translate into products for everyday use so 
 the water bottle i 'll
 begin with this concept of what i call dna  dna design nature art these are the three things that condition my world here is
 a drawing by leonardo da vinci five hundred years ago  before photography  it shows how
  and instinct work to create amazing art industrial design is the art form of the 21st century people like leonardo there
 have not been many
 had this amazingly instinctive curiosity 
 i work from a similar position i don 't want to sound pretentious saying that but this is my drawing made on a digital pad
 a couple of years ago well into the
  five hundred years later it 's my impression of water impressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it one hundred million dollars easily for a monet  
 i use now a whole new process a few years ago i reinvented my process to keep up with people like greg lynn 
 thom mayne zaha hadid  rem koolhaas all these people that i think are persevering
 and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create
  this is all created digitally here you see the machining the milling of a block of acrylic  this is what i show to the client to say that 's what i want to do at that point i don 't know if that 's possible at all   it 's a seductor  
 but i just feel in my bones that that 's possible
  so we go  we look at the tooling we look at how that is produced these are the invisible things that you never see in your life  this is the background
  that is like an anish kapoor flowing through a richard serra it is more valuable than the product in my eyes  i don 't have one when i do make some money i 'll have one machined for myself  
 this is the final product when they
 sent it to me i thought i 'd failed it felt like nothing it has to feel like nothing  it was when i put the water in that i realized that i 'd put a skin on water itself it 's an icon of water itself 
  it elevates people 's perception
 of contemporary design each bottle is different  meaning the water level will give you a different shape  it 's mass individualism from a single product  
 it fits the hand it fits arthritic hands it fits children 's hands it makes the product strong the tessellation  it 's a millefiori of ideas 
 in the future  
 they will look like that because we need to move away from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things perhaps in life
  for materials will come into play in probably a decade it
 doesn 't look as cool does it but i can live up to that i don 't have a problem with that i design for that condition biopolymers  it 's the future  
 i took this video in cape town last year  this is the freaky side coming out  i have this special interest in things
  which once existed and that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking when i look at these things 
 they look pretty normal to me  but these things evolved over many years and what we 're trying to do i get three weeks to design a telephone how the hell do i do
  when you get these things
 that take hundreds of millions of years to evolve how do you condense that it
 comes back to instinct i 'm not talking about designing telephones that look like that and i 'm not looking at designing architecture like that 
 i 'm just interested in natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms that only nature really creates 
 how that flows through me and how that comes out
 is what i 'm trying to understand  this is a scan through the
  human forearm  it 's then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure i have these in my office my office is a
 mixture of the natural history museum and
 a nasa space lab it 's a weird kind of freaky place  this is one of my specimens  this is made bone is made from a mixture of
  i studied cooking in school for four years and in that in that experience which was called domestic science it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science
 qualification 
 actually i put marijuana in everything i cooked and
 i had access to all the best girls it was fabulous all the guys in the rugby team couldn 't understand anyway
 this is a meringue  this is another sample i have a meringue is made exactly the
  way in my estimation as a bone  
 it 's made from polysaccharides and proteins if you pour water on that it dissolves could we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future  
 not a bad idea  i don 't know  i need to talk to janine and a few other people about that  but i believe instinctively that that meringue can become something
  i 'm also interested in growth patterns the unbridled way that nature grows things
 so you 're not restricted by form at all these interrelated forms they do inspire everything i do although i might end up making something incredibly simple  
 this is a detail of a chair that i 've designed in magnesium  it shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of kind of engineering and biological thinking  shown pretty much
  a bone structure any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object  
 it 's the world 's first chair made in magnesium it cost one point seven million dollars to develop it 's called go 
 by bernhardt usa  it went into time magazine
 in two thousand and one as the new language of the 21st century  boy for somebody growing up in wales in a little village that 's
  make one holistic form like the car industry  and then you break up what you need this is an absolutely beautiful way of working it 's a godly way of working
  it 's organic and it 's essential it 's an absolutely fat free design and when you look at it you see human beings  
 when that moves into polymers you can change the elasticity
  polymer chair what nature does is it drills holes in things  it liberates form it takes away anything extraneous  
 that 's what i do i make organic things which are essential  and they look funky too
 but i don 't set out to make funky things because i think that 's an absolute disgrace i set out to look at natural forms if you took the idea of
  take a membrane shrinking it down constantly like nature does that could be a seat for a chair  it could be a sole for a sports shoe it could be a car blending into seats wow 
 let 's go for it that 's the kind of stuff this is what exists in nature observation now allows us to
 bring that natural process
 into the design process every day that 's what i do  this is a show that 's currently on in tokyo  it 's called superliquidity it 's my sculptural investigation
 it 's like 21st century henry moore  when you see a henry moore  still 
 your hair stands up there 's some amazing spiritual connect if he was a car designer 
 phew we 'd all be driving one in his day he was the highest taxpayer in britain  that is the power of organic design  it
 contributes immensely to our
 sense of being
 our sense of relationships with things our sensuality and you know the sort of even the
 sort of   socio erotic side which is very important  this is my artwork this is all my process these actually are sold as artwork they 're very big prints  
 but this is how i get to that object  ironically that object was made by the killarney
  which is a brand new process here for the 21st century and i can hear greg lynn laughing his socks off as i say that i 'll tell you about that later  when i look into these these
 data images i see new things it 
 diatomic structures radiolaria the things that we couldn 't see but we can do now these again are cored out they 're made virtually from nothing they 're made from silica  
 why not structures from cars like that  coral all these natural forces
 take away what they don 't need and they deliver
 maximum beauty  we need to be
 in that realm i want to do stuff like that  
 this is a new chair which should come on the market in september it 's for a company called moroso in italy  it 's a  gas injected polymer chair 
 those holes you see there are very filtered down
  versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures 
 it goes with the flow of the polymer and you 'll see there 's an image coming up right now that shows the full thing  it 's great to have companies in italy who support this way of dreaming 
 if you see the shadows that come through that  they 're actually probably more important than the product  but it 's the minimum it takes the coring out of the back lets you breathe  it takes away any material you don 't need and it actually
  break into a dance then 
 this is some current work i 'm doing i 'm looking at single surface structures and how they stretch and flow  
 it 's based on furniture typologies but that 's not the
 end motivation motivation  it 's made from aluminum  as opposed to aluminium and it
 's grown it 's grown in my mind and then it 's grown in terms of the the whole process that i
  through this is two weeks ago in ccp in coventry  who build parts for bentleys and so on it 's being built as we speak
 and it will be on show in phillips next year in new york i have a big show with phillips auctioneers
 when i see these animations oh jesus i 'm blown away  this is what goes on in my studio everyday i walk i 'm traveling i come back
  some guy 's got that on a computer there 's this like oh my goodness  so i try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio this kind of effervescent
 fully charged
 sense of soup that
 delivers ideas single surface products furniture 's a good one 
 how you grow legs out of a surface  i would love to build this one day and perhaps i 'd like to build it also out of
  that 's the weird side coming out again
  a lot of companies don 't understand that three weeks ago i was with sony in in tokyo  they said give us the dream what is our dream how do we beat apple i said you don 't copy apple that 's for sure  you get into biopolymers 
 they looked straight through me 
  i 'm delivering  they 're not taking 
 i 've had this image twenty years i 've had this image of a water droplet for twenty years sitting on a hot bed 
 that is an image of a car for me that 's the car of the future  it 's a water droplet  i 've been banging on about this  like i can 't believe 
 cars are all wrong  i 'm going to show you something a bit weird now they laughed everywhere over the world i showed this the only place that didn 't laugh was moscow
  cars are made from thirty thousand components how ridiculous is that couldn 't you make that from three hundred it 's got a 
  pan everything 's holistically integrated it opens and closes like a bread bin there is no engine there 's a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels they 're fitted like formula one you take them
  so you can see the people in there you drive different  you see that thing  you do you do  and not anesthetized  separated from life there 's a hole at the front
 and there 's a reason for that  it 's a city car  you drive along you get out  you drive on to a proboscis  you get out 
 it lifts you up it presents the solar panel to the sun and at night  it 's a street lamp
 that 's what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first and do the car second i can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages 
 floating around
 on the ground  driven by ai  when i showed this in south africa everybody afterwards was going hey car on a stick 
  can you imagine a car on a stick 
 if you put it next to contemporary architecture it feels totally natural to me and that 's what i do with my furniture i 'm not putting charles eames ' furniture in buildings anymore
 i 'm trying to build furniture which fits architecture  i 'm trying to build transportation systems i work on aircraft for airbus i do all this sort of stuff
 trying to force these natural inspired by nature dreams home  i 'm going to finish on two things  this is the stereolithography of a staircase  it 's a little bit of a
  dedication to james  james watson  
 i built this thing for my studio it cost me two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to build this  
 most people go and buy the aston martin  i built this  this is the data that goes with that  incredibly complex took about two years  because i 'm looking for
  composites it 's a single element which
 rotates around to create a holistic element and this is a  carbon fiber handrail which is only supported in two places modern materials allow us to do modern things  
 this is a shot in the studio this is how it looks pretty much every day  you wouldn 't want to have a fear of heights coming down it there is
  and it has an internal handrail which gives it its strength it 's this holistic integration that 's my studio  it 's subterranean it 's in notting hill  next to all the crap
 the prostitutes and all that stuff it 's next to david hockney 's original studio  it has a lighting system that changes throughout the day my guys go out for lunch the door 's open they come back in because it 's normally raining and they prefer to stay in 
 this is my studio
  elephant skull from oxford university one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight i bought that last year they 're very difficult to find if anybody 's got a whale skeleton they want to sell me i 'll put it in the studio 
 so i 'm just going to interject interject a little bit with some of the things
 that you 'll see in the video it 's a homemade video made it myself at three o 'clock in the morning just to show you
 how my real world is you never see that you never see architects or designers showing you their real world this is called
  a new bio polycarbonate chair i 'm doing in italy world 's first bamboo bike with folding handlebars  we should all be riding one of these as china buys all these crappy cars we should be
 riding things like this counterbalance  
 like i say it 's a cross between natural history museum and a nasa laboratory  it 's full of prototypes and objects
  the rare times when i 'm there i do enjoy it  and i get lots and lots of kids coming i 'm a contaminator
 for all those children of investment bankers wankers sorry 
 that 's a solar seed it 's a concept for new architecture that thing on the top is the world 's first
  garden lamp
 the first produced  giles revell should be talking here today amazing photography of things you can 't see the first sculptural
 model i made for that thing in tokyo  
 lots of stuff there 's a little leaf chair that golden looking thing is called leaf it 's made from kevlar 
 on the wall is my book called supernatural which allows me to remember what i 've done because i forget there 's an aerated brick i did in limoges last year in concepts for new ceramics in architecture
  gernot oberfell working at three o 'clock in the morning
 and i don 't pay overtime  overtime is the passion of design so
 join the club or don
 't no it 's true people like tom and greg we 're traveling like you can 't we fit it
  next week i 'm at
 electrolux in sweden  then i 'm in beijing on friday  you work that one out  and when i see ed 's photographs i think why the hell am i going to china it 's true
 's true because there 's a soul in this whole thing  we need to have a new instinct for the 21st century  we need to combine all this stuff  if all the people who were talking over this period
  so there 's a new x light system i 'm doing in japan
 there 's
 tuareg shoes from north africa there 's a kifwebe mask these are my sculptures  a copper jelly mold laughter
 it sounds like some quiz show or something
 thank you very much
