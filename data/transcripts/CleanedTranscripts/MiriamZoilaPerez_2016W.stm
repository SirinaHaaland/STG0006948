  most of you can probably relate to what i 'm feeling right now  
 my heart is racing in my chest my palms are a little bit clammy i 'm sweating  
 and my breath is a little bit shallow now these familiar sensations are obviously the
  result of standing up in front of a thousand of you
 and giving a talk that might be streamed online to perhaps a million more 
 but the physical sensations i 'm experiencing right now are actually the result of a much more basic mind body mechanism 
 my nervous system is sending a flood of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline into my bloodstream
  it 's a very old and very necessary response
 that sends blood and oxygen to the organs and muscles that i might need to respond quickly to a potential threat  
 but there 's a problem with this response and that is it can get
 if i face these kinds of stressors on a daily basis particularly over an extended period of time
 my system can get overloaded  so basically if this response happens infrequently
 and survival  but if it happens too much it can actually make me sick  
 there 's a growing body of research examining the relationship between chronic stress and illness 
 things like heart disease and even cancer are being shown to have a relationship to stress 
 and that 's because over time too much activation from stress can interfere with my body 's processes that keep me healthy
 let 's imagine for a moment that i was pregnant 
 what might this kind of stress particularly over the length of my pregnancy what kind of impact might that have on the health of my developing fetus
 you probably won 't be surprised when i tell you that this kind of stress during pregnancy is not good 
 it can even cause the body to initiate labor too early  because in a basic sense the stress communicates
 that the womb is no longer a safe place for the child  
 stress during pregnancy is linked with things like high blood pressure and low infant birth weight  
 and it can begin a cascade of health challenges that make birth much more dangerous for both parent and child  
 now of course stress particularly in our modern lifestyle
  a somewhat universal experience right  maybe you 've never stood up to give a ted talk but you 've faced a big presentation at work a sudden job loss 
 a big test a heated conflict with a family member or friend  
 but it turns out that the kind of stress we experience and whether we 're able to stay in a relaxed state long enough to keep our bodies working properly depends a lot on who we are 
 there 's also a growing body of research showing that people who experience more
  discrimination are more likely to have poor health 
 even the threat of discrimination like worrying you might be stopped by police while driving your car 
 can have a negative impact on your health  
 harvard professor dr david williams  the person who pioneered the tools that have proven these
  says that the more marginalized groups in our society
 experience more discrimination and more impacts on their health 
 i 've been interested in these issues for over a decade
  i became interested in maternal health when a failed premed trajectory instead sent me down a path looking for other ways to help pregnant people 
 i became a doula a lay person trained to provide support to people during pregnancy
  and because i 'm latina and a spanish speaker in my first volunteer doula gig at a public hospital in north carolina i saw clearly how race and class impacted the experiences of the women that i supported
 if we take a look at the statistics about the rates of illness during pregnancy and childbirth we see clearly the pattern outlined by dr williams 
 african american women in particular have an entirely different experience than white women when it comes to whether their babies are born healthy
 in certain parts of the country  particularly the deep south  the rates of mother and infant death for black women actually approximate those rates in sub saharan african 
 in those same communities the rates for white women are near zero  
 even nationally black women are four times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than white women
  four times more likely to die 
 they 're also twice as likely for their infants to die before the first year of life than white infants and two to three times more likely to give birth too early or too skinny a sign of insufficient development  
 native women are also
 more likely to have higher rates of these problems than white women as are some groups of latinas
  for the last decade as a doula turned journalist and blogger i 've been trying to raise the alarm about just how different the experiences of women of color  but particularly black women are when it comes to pregnancy and birth in the us  
 but when i tell people about these appalling statistics i 'm usually met with an assumption that it 's about either poverty or lack of access to
  but it turns out neither of these things tell the whole story  
 even middle class black women still have much worse outcomes than their middle class white counterparts 
 the gap actually widens among this group  
 and while access to care is definitely still a problem  
 even women of color who receive the recommended prenatal care still suffer from these high rates 
  and so we come back to the path from discrimination
 to stress to poor health  and it begins to paint a picture that many people of color know to be true 
 racism is actually making us sick  
 still sound like a stretch  consider this immigrants  particularly black and latina immigrants actually have better health when they first arrive in the united states  
 but the longer they stay
  the worse their health becomes 
 people like me born in the united states to cuban immigrant parents are actually more likely to have worse health than my grandparents did 
 it 's what researchers call the immigrant paradox and it further illustrates that there 's something in the us environment that is making us sick  
 but here 's the thing this problem that racism is making people of color but especially black women and babies sick is vast 
 i could spend all of my time with you talking about it but i
  because i want to make sure to tell you about one solution 
 and the good news is it 's a solution that isn 't particularly expensive and doesn 't require any fancy drug treatments or new technologies  the solution is called the jj way 
 meet jennie joseph  she 's a midwife in the orlando florida area who has been serving pregnant women for over a decade in what she calls her
  and her team provide prenatal care to over six hundred women per year 
 her clients most of whom are black  haitian and latina deliver at the local hospital 
 but by providing accessible and respectful prenatal care jennie has achieved something remarkable 
 almost all of her clients give birth
  her method is deceptively simple 
 jennie says that all of her appointments start at the front desk every member of her team and every moment a a women is at her clinic is as supportive as possible 
 no one is turned away due to lack of funds  the jj way is to make the finances work no matter what the hurdles 
 no one is chastised for showing up late to their appointments no one is talked down to or belittled 
 jennie 's waiting room feels more like your aunt 's
  room than a clinic  she calls this space a classroom in disguise 
 with the plush chairs arranged in a circle women wait for their appointments in one on one chats with a staff educator or in group prenatal classes 
 when you finally are called back to your appointment you are greeted by alexis or trina two of jennie 's medical
  and moms themselves their approach is casual and friendly during one visit i observed trina chatted with a young soon to be mom
 while she took her blood pressure this latina mom was having trouble keeping food down due to nausea 
 as trina deflated the blood pressure cuff she said we 'll see about changing your prescription ok we can 't have you not eating
  is actually a really crucial aspect of jennie 's model  
 she sees her staff as part of a team that alongside the woman and her family has one goal get mom to term with a healthy baby 
 jennie says that trina and alexis are actually the center of her care model  and that her role as a provider is just to support their work 
 trina spends a lot of her day on her cell phone texting with clients about all sorts of things one woman texted to ask if a medication she was
  prescribed at the hospital was ok to take while pregnant the answer was no another woman texted with pictures of an infant born under jennie 's care 
 lastly when you finally are called back to see the provider you 've already taken your own weight in the waiting room and done your own pee test in the bathroom 
 this is a big departure from the traditional medical
  because it places responsibility and information back in the woman 's hands  
 so rather than a medical setting where you might be chastised for not keeping up with provider recommendations the kind of settings often available to low income women
 jennie 's model is to be as supportive as possible  
 and that support provides a crucial buffer to the stress of racism and discrimination facing these women every day  
 but here 's the best thing about jennie 's model
 it 's been incredibly successful  
 remember those statistics i told you that black women are more likely to give birth too early 
 to give birth to low birth weight babies to even die due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth  well the jj way has almost entirely eliminated those problems 
 starting with what jennie calls skinny babies 
 she 's been able to get almost all her clients to term with healthy chunky babies like
  a baby girl born to a client of jennie 's this past june 
 a similar demographic of women in jennie 's area who gave birth at the same hospital her clients did were three times more likely to give birth to a baby below a healthy weight
  jennie is making headway into what has been seen for decades as an almost intractable problem  
 some of you might be thinking all this one on one attention that the jj way requires must be too expensive to scale well you 'd be wrong
 the visit with the provider is not the center of jennie 's model  and for good reason those visits are expensive and in order to maintain her model she 's got to see a lot of clients to cover costs 
 but jennie doesn 't have to spend a ton of time with each woman if all of the members
  her team can provide the support information and care that her clients need
 the beauty of jennie 's model is that she actually believes it can be implemented in pretty much any health care setting 
 it 's a revolution in care just waiting to happen
 these problems i 've been sharing with you are big they come from long histories of racism classism a society based on race and class
  stratification they involve elaborate physiological mechanisms meant to protect us that when overstimulated actually make us sick  
 but if there 's one thing i 've learned from my work as a doula it 's that a little bit of unconditional support can go a really long way  
 history has shown that people are incredibly resilient  
 and while we can 't eradicate racism or the stress that results from it overnight we might just be able to create environments that provide a buffer to what
  of color experience on a daily basis  and during pregnancy that buffer can be an incredible tool towards shifting the impact of racism for generations to come 
 thank you
