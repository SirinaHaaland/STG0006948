  the national portrait gallery is the place dedicated to presenting great american lives amazing people and
 that 's what it 's about we use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives
  but that 's it and so i 'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today  i 'm going to talk about a program i started there which 
 from my point of view is the the proudest thing i did
 i started to worry about the fact that a lot of people don 't get their portraits painted anymore and they 're amazing people and we want to deliver them to future 
  generations so how do we do that and so i came up with the idea of the living self portrait series  and the living
 self portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and i would interview  
 and so what i 'm going to do is not so much give you the great hits of that program as to give you this whole notion
 of how you encounter people in that kind of situation what you try to find out about them and when people deliver and when they don 't
 and why
 now i had
 two preconditions one was that they be american that 's just because in the nature of the national portrait gallery it 's created to look at american lives
 that was easy but then i made the decision maybe arbitrary that they needed to be
 people of a certain age  which at that point when i created this program seemed really old sixties
  seventies  eighties and nineties for obvious reasons it doesn 't seem that old anymore to me and why did i do that well for one thing we 're a youth obsessed culture  
 and i thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk  
 but the second part of it and the older i get the more
  it 's amazing what people will say when they know how the story turned out that 's the one advantage
 that older people have well they have other little bit of advantage but
 they also have some disadvantages but the one thing they or we have is that we 've reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out 
 so we can then go back in our lives
  if we 've got an interviewer who gets that 
 and begin to reflect on how we got there all of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited 
 so i thought okay  now what is it going to take to make this work 
 there are many kinds of interviews  we know them there are the journalist interviews which are the interrogation that is expected
 this is somewhat against resistance and caginess on the part of the interviewee then
 the celebrity interview where it 's more important who 's asking the question than who answers that 's barbara walters and others like that and we we like that that 's 
  where frost seems to be as important as nixon in that process fair enough  but i wanted interviews that were different i wanted to be 
 as i later thought of it empathic
  which is to say to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their
 by the way this was always done in public this was not an oral history program this was all about
 three hundred people sitting at the feet of this individual and having me be the
  it turns out that i was pretty good at that i didn 't know it coming into it and the only reason i really know that is because of one interview i did with senator william fulbright and that was six months after he 'd had a stroke  
 and he had never appeared in public since that point this was not a devastating stroke but it did affect his speaking and so forth  
 and i thought it was worth a chance he thought it was worth a chance and so we got up on the
  on the stage and we had an hour conversation about his life  and after that
 a woman rushed up to me essentially did and she said  where did you train as a doctor 
 and i said i have no training as a doctor  i never claimed that and she said well something very weird was happening 
 when he started a sentence particularly in the early parts of the interview
  and paused you gave him the word the bridge to get to the end of the sentence  and by the end of it  he was speaking complete sentences on his own i didn 't know what was going on but i was so
 part of the process of getting that out so i thought okay  
 fine i 've got empathy or empathy at any rate is what 's critical to this kind of interview  but then i began to think of other things
 who makes a great interview in this context it had nothing to do with their intellect  the quality of their intellect  
 some of them were very brilliant some of them were 
 you know ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals but it was never about that  it was about their energy
  it 's energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary lives i 'm convinced of it and it had nothing to do with the energy of being young  these 
  were people through their 90s in fact the first person i interviewed was george abbott who was ninety seven 
  the room and we had an extraordinary conversation he was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do because he was famous for being silent for never ever saying anything
 except maybe a word or two and in fact he did wind up opening up by the way his energy is evidenced in other ways he subsequently got married again at one hundred and two 
 so he you know he had a lot of the life force in him  but
 after the interview i got a call
  gruff voice  from a woman i didn 't know who she was and she said  did you get george abbott to talk 
 and i said yeah  apparently i did and she said i
 'm his old girlfriend maureen stapleton  
 and i could never do it and then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that george abbott actually could talk
 you know you want energy you want the life force but
 you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing  
 the worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are modest 
 never ever get up on a stage with somebody who 's modest because all of these people have been assembled
 to listen to them and they
  sit there and they say aw shucks it was an accident there 's nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking
 good hours of the day to be with them  
 the worst interview i ever did william l shirer 
 the journalist who did the rise and fall of the third reich this guy had met hitler
  and gandhi within six months and every time i 'd ask him about it he 'd say oh i just happened to be there 
 didn 't matter whatever awful  i never would ever agree to interview a modest person they have to think that they did something and that they want to share it with you 
 but it comes down in the end to
 how do you get through
  all the barriers we have 
 all of us are public and private beings 
 and if all you 're going to get from the interviewee is their public self there 's no point in it it 's pre programmed it 's infomercial
  and we all have infomercials about our lives  we know the great lines  we know the
  mike wallace 's old interviews tough aggressive and so forth they have their place i was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say 
 to break out of their own
 cocoon of of the public self  and the more public they had been the more entrenched
  that outer person was and let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment that happened in this interview series it all has to do with that shell
 that most of us have and particularly certain people 
 there 's an extraordinary woman named clare boothe luce it 'll be your generational determinant as to whether
 her name means much to you
  she did so much she was a playwright she did an extraordinary play called the women she was
 a congresswoman when there weren 't very many congresswomen  she was
 editor of vanity fair one of the great phenomenal women of her day and incidentally  
 i call her the eleanor roosevelt of the right  she was sort of adored
 on the right the way eleanor roosevelt was on the left
  and in fact when we did the interview i did the the living self portrait with her
 there were three former directors of the cia basically sitting at her feet just enjoying
 her presence and i thought this is going to be a piece of cake because i always have
 preliminary talks with these people for just maybe ten or fifteen minutes we never talk before that because if you talk before you don 't get it on the
  stage so she and i had a delightful conversation we were on the stage and then
 by the way spectacular it was all part of clare boothe luce 's look she was in a great evening gown she was eighty 
 almost that day of the interview and there she was
  and there i was and i just proceeded into the questions and she
 stonewalled me it was unbelievable anything that i would ask she would turn around dismiss and i was basically up there any of you in the 
  entertainment world know what it is to die onstage  and i was dying  she was absolutely not giving me a thing  
 and i began to wonder what was going on and you think while you talk
  i thought i got it  
 when we were alone i was her audience now i 'm her competitor for the audience that 's the problem here and she 's fighting me  for that and so then i asked her a question i didn 't know how i was going to get out of it
 i asked her a question about
 her days as a playwright  and again characteristically instead of saying
  was a playwright and this is what blah blah blah she said oh playwright everybody knows i was a playwright most people think that i was an actress i was never an actress 
 but i hadn 't asked that  and then she went off on a tear  and she said oh well there was that one time that i was an actress
 it was for a charity in connecticut when i was a congresswoman and i got up
  and she went on and on and then i got on the stage and then she turned to me and said and you know what those young actors did 
 they upstaged me and she said do you know what that is just withering in her contempt and i said i 'm learning 
 and she looked at me and it was like the successful arm wrestle 
 and then after that she delivered an extraordinary account of what her
  life force i 'm attracted to her  and the way she died
 she had toward the end a brain tumor that 's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine and very few of us
 were invited to a dinner party
  she was in horrible pain  we all knew that she stayed in
 her room  everybody came the butler passed around canapes  the usual sort of thing then at a certain moment the door opened
 and she walked out perfectly dressed  
 completely composed the public self  the beauty  the intellect  and she walked around and
 talked to every person there
 and then went back into the room
  never seen again  
 she wanted the control of her final moment and she did it amazingly  
 now there are other ways that you get somebody to open up
 and this is just
 a brief reference it wasn 't this arm wrestle but it was a little surprising for the person involved i interviewed steve
  all that long ago  and
 we were sitting there and almost toward the beginning of the interview i turned to him and i said 
 steve or mr martin it is said that all comedians have unhappy
 was yours unhappy 
 and he looked at me you know as if to say this is how you 're going to start this thing right off and then he turned to me not stupidly
 what was your childhood like 
 and i said these are all arm wrestles but they 're affectionate and i said my father was loving and supportive which is why i 'm not funny 
 and
 he looked at me and then we heard the big sad story his father was an sob and in
  interview i did with one of the great american biographers again some of you will know him most of you won 't dumas malone  he did  a five volume biography of thomas jefferson spent
 virtually his whole life with thomas jefferson and by the way at one point i asked him would you like to have met him and he said
 but actually i know him better than anyone who ever met him because i got to read all of his letters 
 so he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over fifty years  
 and i asked him
 one question i said did jefferson ever disappoint you 
 and here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering jefferson and connecting with
  i 'm going to do a bad southern accent dumas malone was from mississippi originally  but he said  well he said i 'm afraid so 
 he said you know i 've read everything  and
 sometimes mr jefferson would smooth the truth a bit 
 and he basically was saying that this was a man who lied more than he
  he had because he saw the letters  he said but i understand that he said i understand that he said we southerners do like
 a smooth surface  so that there were times when he just didn 't want the confrontation and he said now john adams
 was too honest and he started to talk about that and later on he invited me to his house and i met his wife who was from massachusetts and he and
  she had exactly the relationship of thomas jefferson and john adams  
 she was the new englander and abrasive and he was this courtly fellow  
 but really the most important question i ever asked  and most of the times when i talk about it
 people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity or cruelty
  it was the right question this was to agnes de mille agnes de mille is one of the great choreographers
 in our history she basically created the dances in oklahoma transforming the american theater 
 an amazing woman at the time that i
 proposed to her that
 by the way i would have proposed to her she was extraordinary but proposed to her that she come on she said
  to my apartment she lived in new york come to my apartment and we 'll talk for those fifteen minutes
  and then we 'll decide whether we proceed and so i showed up in this
 dark rambling new york apartment and she called out to me and she was in bed  i had known that she had had a stroke  
 and that was some ten years before  and so she spent almost all of her life in bed
  but i speak of the life force
 her hair was askew  she wasn 't about to to make up for this occasion  and she was sitting there surrounded by books and her most
 interesting possession she felt at that moment was her will which she had by her side
  i keep this will by my bed  memento mori  and i change it all the time
 just because i want to and she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life  i thought this is somebody i 've got to get in this series  she agreed
  she came on of course she was wheelchaired on half of her body was stricken the other half not 
 she was of course  done up for the occasion but this was a woman in great physical
 distress  and we had a conversation and then i asked her this unthinkable question i said
 was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful
 the audience just you know they 're always on the side of the interviewee  and they felt that this was a kind of assault but this was the question she had wanted somebody to ask her whole life  
 and she began to talk about her childhood when she was beautiful  and she literally turned here she
  in this broken body and she turned to the audience and described herself as the fair demoiselle with her
 red hair and
 her light steps and so forth  and then she said and then puberty hit 
 and she began to talk about things that had happened to her body and her face 
 and how she could no longer count on her beauty and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one
  whom all the ballet lessons were given and she had to go along
 just to be with her sister for company and in that process she made a number of decisions 
 first of all was that dance even though it hadn 't been offered to her was her life and secondly she had better be although she did dance for a while a choreographer because then her looks didn 't
  was thrilled to get that out as a real real fact in her life it was an amazing privilege to do this
 series  there were other moments like that  very few moments of silence  the key point
 was empathy because everybody in their lives
 is really waiting for people to ask them questions
  that they can be truthful
 about who they are and how they became what they are 
 and i commend that to you even if you 're not doing interviews just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family
