  i grew up in orlando florida  i was the son of an aerospace engineer  
 i lived and breathed the apollo program  we either saw the launches from our backyard or we saw it by
 driving in the hour over to the cape  i was impressed by obviously space and everything about it but i was most impressed by the engineering that went into it  
 behind me you see an amazing view a picture that was taken from the
 international space station  and it shows a portion of our planet that 's rarely seen and rarely studied and almost never explored 
 that place is called the stratosphere
  if you start on the planet and you go up and up and up  it gets colder and colder and colder 
 until you reach the beginning of the stratosphere and then an amazing thing happens
 it gets colder at a much slower rate and then it starts warming up and then it gets warmer and warmer until the point where you can almost survive without any protection 
 about zero degrees  and then you end up getting colder and colder and that 's the top of the stratosphere 
  one of the least accessible places on our planet most often when it 's visited it 's by astronauts who are blazing up at it
 at probably several times the speed of sound and they get a few seconds on the way up and then they get this blazing ball of fire coming back in 
  but the question i asked is is it possible to linger in the stratosphere  
 is it possible to experience the stratosphere is it possible to explore the stratosphere
 i studied this using my favorite search engine for
 quite a while about a year  and then i made a scary phone call it was a reference from a friend of mine
 to call taber maccallum from paragon space development corporation
  and i asked him the question is it possible
 to build
 a system to go into the stratosphere  and he said it was 
 and after a period of about three years we proceeded to do just that 
 and on october twenty four of last year 
  i went up in a balloon to one hundred and
  eight hundred and ninety feet but who 's counting 
 came back to earth at speeds of up to eight hundred and twenty two miles an hour it was a four minute and
  descent  and when i got to ten thousand feet i opened a parachute and i landed
 but this is really a science talk and it 's really an engineering talk  
 and what was amazing to me about that experience is that taber said yes  i think we can build a stratospheric suit  
 and more than that come down tomorrow and let 's talk to the team that formed the core of the group that actually built it 
 they did something which i think is important  which is they took the analogy of scuba diving  so in scuba diving  you have a
 self contained system you have everything that you could ever need  you have a scuba tank  
  three years later this is what we have we 've got an amazing suit
 that was made by ilc dover ilc dover was the company that made all of the apollo suits and all of the extravehicular activity suits they had never sold a suit commercially 
 only to the government  but they sold one to me which i am very grateful for 
 up here we have a parachute this
  all about safety
  everyone on the team knew
 that i have a wife and two small children ten and fifteen
 and i wanted to come back safely  so there 's a main parachute and a reserve parachute and if i do nothing 
 the reserve parachute is going to open because of an automatic opening device the suit itself can protect me from the
  cold this area in the front here has thermal protection it will actually heat water that will wrap around my body  it has two redundant oxygen tanks even if i was to get a quarter inch hole in this suit which is extremely unlikely 
 this system would still protect me from the
 from the low pressure of space the main advantage of this system is weight and complexity  so the system weighs about
  five hundred pounds and if you compare it to the other attempt recently to go up in the stratosphere  they used a capsule  
 and to do a capsule there 's an amazing amount of complexity that goes into it  and it weighed about three thousand pounds and to raise three thousand pounds
 to an altitude of one hundred and thirty five thousand feet which was my target altitude it would have taken a
  to fifty million cubic feet 
 because i only weighed five hundred pounds in this system 
 we could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler
 than what needs to be done for a much larger balloon  
 so with that i want to take you to roswell new mexico on october twenty four we had an amazing team that got up in the middle of the night and
  here 's the suit  again  this is using the front loader that you 'll see in a second and i want to play you a video
 of the actual launch roswell 's a great place to launch balloons but it 's a fantastic place to land under a parachute  especially when you 're going to land seventy miles away
 from the place you started that 's a helium truck in the background  it 's darkness  i 've already spent about an hour and a half
 a half pre breathing and then here you see the suit going on it takes about an hour to get the suit on
  astronauts get this really nice
  van to go to the launch pad but i got a front loader 
 you can see the top you can see the balloon
  that 's where the helium is 
 this is dave clearing the airspace with the faa for fifteen miles 
 and there we go that
 's me waving with my left hand the reason i 'm waving with my left hand is because on the right hand is the emergency cutaway 
 my team forbade me from using my right hand
 so the trip up is beautiful it 's kind of like google earth in reverse 
 it took two hours and seven minutes to go up and it was the most peaceful two hours and seven minutes i was mostly trying to relax 
 my heart rate was very low
 and i was trying not to use very much oxygen
  you can see how the the fields in the background are relatively big at this point and you can see me going up and up  it 's interesting here because if you look i 'm right over the airport and i 'm probably at fifty thousand feet 
 but immediately i 'm about to go into a stratospheric wind of over one hundred and twenty miles an hour 
 this is my flight director telling me that i had just gone higher than anybody else had ever gone in a balloon  and i was about four thousand feet from
 release this is what it looks like 
 you can see the darkness of space the curvature of the earth the
 fragile planet below  
 i 'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now
  goes wrong i want to be ready and the main thing that i want to do here is to have a release and fall and stay completely stable
  there 's the balloon going by  fully inflated at this point  
 and there you can see a drogue parachute which i 'll demonstrate in just a second because that 's really important there 's the balloon going by a second time
 right now i 'm about at the speed of sound  
 there 's nothing for me to tell it 's the speed of sound  and very soon i will actually be as fast as i ever get eight hundred and twenty two miles an hour
  down low right now and you can basically see the parachute come out right there at this point i 'm very happy that there 's a parachute out
 i thought i was the only one happy but it turns out mission control was really happy as well 
 the really nice thing about this is the moment i opened i had a close of friend of mine blikkies my parachute guy he flew in another airplane  and he actually jumped out and landed right next to me 
 he was my wingman on the descent
  this is my landing but it 's probably more properly called a crash 
 i hate to admit it but this wasn 't even close to my worst landing
  you one thing that you might not have seen in that video  but one
  the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release and what happens right after you release and
 what we tried to do was use something called a drogue parachute and a drogue parachute was there to stabilize me 
 and i 'll show you one of those right now  if any of you have ever gone tandem skydiving  
 you probably used one of these  
 but the problem with one of these things
  right when you release you 're in zero gravity  
 so it 's very easy for this to just turn right around you and before you know it you can be tangled up or spinning  
 or you can release this drogue late 
 in which case what happens is you 're going down at eight hundred miles an hour and this thing is going to destroy itself and not be very useful  
 but the guys at united parachute
  came up with this idea and it was a roll that looks like that but watch what happens when i pull it out  
 it 's forming a pipe  
 this pipe is so solid
 that you can take this drogue parachute and wrap it around and there 's no way it will ever tangle with you  
 and that prevented a very serious
  so nothing is possible without an amazing team of people the core of this was about twenty people
 that worked on this for the three years  and they were incredible people asked me what the best part of this whole thing was  and it was a chance to work with the best experts in meteorology and ballooning and parachute technology and
 environmental systems and high altitude medicine
  it was fantastic it 's an engineer 's dream to work with that group of people and i also at the same time wanted to thank my friends at google both
 for supporting me during this effort and also covering for me in the times that i was away but there 's one other group i wanted to thank and that 's my family yay 
 i would constantly give them speeches about the safety of technology and they weren 't hearing any
  of it it was super hard on them and the only reason that my wife
 put up with it was because i came back incredibly happy after each of the two hundred and fifty tests
 and she didn 't want to take that away from me  so i want to close with a story my daughter katelyn  my 15 year old she and i were in the car
  and we were driving down
 the road and she was sitting there  and she had this idea and she goes dad i 've got this idea 
 and so i listened to her idea and i said katelyn that 's impossible 
 and she looks at me and she goes dad after what you just did how can you call anything impossible 
 and i laughed  and i said ok it 's not impossible it 's just very very hard and then i paused for a second and i said
  katelyn  it may not be impossible it may not even be very very hard  it 's just that i don 't know how to do it
