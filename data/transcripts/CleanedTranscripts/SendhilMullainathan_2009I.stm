  as a researcher every once in a while you encounter something
 a little disconcerting and this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you and teaches you that you 're very wrong about something
  really believed firmly in and these are unfortunate moments  because
 you go to sleep that night dumber
 than when you woke up so that 's really the goal of my talk is to a communicate that moment to you
 and b have you leave this session a little dumber than when you entered so i hope i can really accomplish that  so  this
 incident that i 'm going to describe really began with some diarrhea now we 've known for a long time the
  of diarrhea
 that 's why there 's a glass of water up there 
 for us it 's a problem the people in this room for babies  it 's deadly they lack nutrients and
 diarrhea dehydrates them and so as a result there is a lot of death a lot of death in india
 in one thousand nine hundred and sixty there was a twenty four percent child mortality rate lots of people didn 't
  is incredibly unfortunate one of the big reasons this happened was because of diarrhea  now
 there was a big effort to solve this problem  and there was actually a big solution
 this solution has been called by some potentially the most important medical
 advance this century now  the solution turned out to be simple and what it was was
  rehydration salts many of you have probably used this it 's brilliant  it 's a way to get sodium
 and glucose together so that when you add it to water the child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea  remarkable impact on mortality 
 massive solution to the problem  
 flash forward one thousand nine hundred and sixty twenty four percent child mortality has dropped to six point five percent today still a big number  but a big drop
 it looks like the technological problem is solved 
 but if you look even today there are about four hundred thousand diarrhea related deaths in india alone 
 what 's going on here well the easy answer is we just haven 't gotten those salts to those people 
 that 's actually not true if you look in areas where these salts are completely
  the price is low or zero these deaths still continue abated 
 maybe there 's a biological answer maybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration alone doesn 't solve that 's not true either 
 many of these deaths were completely preventable 
 and this what i want to think of as the disconcerting thing what i want to call the last mile problem  
 see we spent a lot of energy in many domains
  hard work creativity human ingenuity to crack important social problems with technology solutions  that 's been the discoveries of the last two thousand years that 's mankind moving forward 
 but in this case we cracked it  
 but a big part of the problem still remains nine hundred and ninety nine miles went well the last mile 's proving incredibly stubborn  now  
 that 's for oral rehydration
  maybe this is something unique about diarrhea well it turns out and this is where things get really disconcerting it 's not unique to diarrhea it 's not even unique to poor people in india here 's an example from
 a variety of contexts i 've put a bunch of examples up here i 'll start with insulin diabetes
 medication in the  u s ok the american population on medicaid if you 're fairly poor you get medicaid or if you have health insurance insulin is pretty
  either in pill form or you get it as an injection you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels massive technological advance took an incredibly deadly disease made it solvable adherence rates  how many people are taking their insulin every day 
 about on average a typical person is taking it  seventy five percent of the time as a result twenty five thousand people a year go blind  
 hundreds of thousands lose limbs every year for something
  here i have a bunch of other examples all suffer from the last mile problem it 's not just medicine
 here 's another example from technology agriculture  
 we think there 's a food problem  so we create new seeds  we think there 's an income problem  so we create new new ways of farming that increase income well look at some old ways some ways that we 'd already cracked 
  intercropping  intercropping really increases income sometimes in rice we found incredible increases in yield when you mix different varieties of rice side by side some people are doing that
  many are not what 's going on this is the last mile the last mile is everywhere problematic
 alright what 's the problem  the problem is this little three pound machine that 's behind your eyes and between your ears 
 this machine is really strange  and one of the consequences is that people
 are weird they do lots of inconsistent things
 applause they do lots of inconsistent things  and the inconsistencies
 create 
 fundamentally this last mile problem  see when we were dealing with our biology bacteria the genes the things inside here the blood 
 that 's complex  but it 's manageable when we 're dealing with
  the mind is more complex  that 's not as manageable and that 's what we 're struggling with let me go back to diarrhea for a second  
 here 's a question that was asked in the national sample survey  which is a survey asked of many indian women your child has diarrhea  
 should you increase maintain or decrease the number of fluids just so you don 't embarrass yourselves i 'll give you the right answer it 's increase
  now diarrhea 's interesting because it 's been around for thousands of years ever since
  humankind really
 lived side by side enough to have really polluted water 
 one roman strategy that was very interesting was that and it really gave them a comparative advantage they made sure their soldiers didn 't drink even remotely muddied waters because if some of your troops get diarrhea they 're not that effective on the battlefield 
 so if you think of roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields the breastplates but part of it was drinking the right water
  here are these women they 've seen their parents have struggled with diarrhea they 've struggled with diarrhea they 've seen lots of deaths 
 how do they answer this question in india thirty five to fifty percent say reduce 
 think about what that means for a second  thirty five to fifty percent of women
 forget oral rehydration therapy  they are increasing they are actually making their child more likely to die through their actions
  how is that possible well one possibility i think that 's how most people respond to this is to say that 's just stupid 
 i don 't think that 's stupid i think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing and that is you don 't put water into a leaky bucket  
 so think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake 
 just doesn 't make sense now
 the model is intuitively right  it just doesn 't happen to be right about the world  but it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level  
 and that to me is the fundamental challenge
 of
 the last mile  this first challenge is what i refer to as the persuasion challenge 
  to do something take oral rehydration therapy intercrop whatever it might be is not an act of information let 's give them the data 
 and when they have data they 'll do the right thing it 's more complex than that 
 and if you want to understand how it 's more complex let me start with something
 kind of interesting i 'm going to give you a little math problem  and i want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible a bat and
  the bat costs a dollar more than the ball how much does the ball cost quick  
 so somebody out there says five a lot of you said ten let 's think about ten for a second 
 if the ball costs ten the bat costs  
 this is easy $ one point one yeah 
 so  together they would cost $ one point two so here you all are ostensibly educated people 
 most of you look smart
  of that produces
 something that is actually you got this thing wrong how is that possible  let 's go to something else  i know algebra can be complicated  so let 's
 dial this back  that 's what fifth grade  fourth grade  let 's go back to kindergarten 
 ok there 's a great show on american television that you have to watch it 's called are you smarter than a fifth grader i think we 've learned the answer to that here  let 's
 move to kindergarten  let 's see if we can
 beat five year olds here 's what i 'm going to do i 'm going to put objects on the screen 
 i just want you to name the color of the object  that 's all it is ok i want you to do it fast
  and say it out loud with me and do it quickly i 'll make the first one easy for you ready  
 black now the next ones i want you to do quickly and say it out loud ready
  that 's
 pretty good 
 almost out of kindergarten
  what is all this telling us  
 you see what 's going on here and in the bat and ball problem is that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world some models that you use to understand the world 
 these models like the leaky bucket work well in most situations i suspect
  you i hope that 's true for the rest of you actually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world i found a problem  a specific problem that actually
 found an error with that diarrhea  and many last mile problems are like that they are situations where the mental model doesn 't match the reality  
 same thing here you had an intuitive response to this that was very quick you read blue and you wanted to say blue even though you knew your task was red
  this stuff because it 's fun  but
 it 's more profound than fun i 'll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion bmw
 is a pretty safe car  and they are trying to figure out safety is good i want to advertise safety  how am i going to advertise safety 
 i could give people numbers we do well on crash tests but the truth of the matter is you look at that car it doesn 't look like a volvo 
 and it doesn 't look like a hummer so what i want you to think
  about for a few minutes is how would you convey safety of the bmw okay so now  while you 're thinking about that let 's move to a second task the second task is
 fuel efficiency okay here 's another puzzle for all of you one person walks into a car lot and they 're thinking about buying this toyota yaris
  they are saying this is thirty five miles per gallon i 'm going to do the environmentally right
  'm going to buy the prius fifty miles per gallon 
 another person walks into the lot  and they 're about to buy a hummer nine miles per gallon  fully loaded luxury  and they say you know what 
 do i need turbo do i need this heavyweight car i 'm going to do something good for the environment i 'm going to take off some of that weight and i 'm going to buy a hummer that 's eleven miles per gallon 
 which one of these people has done more for the environment see you have a mental model 
  that 's a big move eleven versus nine come on
 turns out go home and do the math the nine to eleven is a bigger change that person has saved more gallons why because we don 't care about miles per gallon we care about gallons per mile 
 think about how powerful that is if you 're trying to encourage fuel efficiency miles per gallon is the way we present things
 if we want to encourage change of behavior gallons per mile would have far more effectiveness researchers have found these type
  back to bmw what should they do 
 the problem bmw faces is this car looks safe this car which is my mini doesn 't look that safe 
 here was bmw 's brilliant insight which they embodied into an ad campaign  they showed a bmw driving down the street there 's a truck on the right  boxes fall out of the truck the car swerves to avoid it  
 and therefore doesn 't get into an accident bwm
  in people 's minds has two components you can be safe because when you 're hit  
 you survive or you can be safe because you avoid accidents  remarkably successful campaign but notice the power of it  it harnesses something you already believe 
 now even if i persuaded you to do something it 's hard sometimes to actually
 get action as a result  you all probably intended to wake up i don 't
  is a battle we all fight every day along with trying to get to the gym  
 now  this is an example of that battle  
 and makes us realize intentions don 't always translate into action and so one of the fundamental challenges is how we would actually do that 
 ok so
 let me now talk about the last mile problem  
 so far  i 've been pretty negative  i 've been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior  and i think maybe i 'm being too
  maybe it 's the diarrhea  maybe the last mile problem really should be thought of as the last mile opportunity  
 let 's go back to diabetes  this is a typical insulin injection  
 now carrying this thing around is complicated  you gotta carry
 the bottle you gotta carry the syringe it 's also painful  now  you may think to yourself well if my eyes depended on it
  obviously use it every day but the pain the discomfort you know paying attention remembering to put it in your purse when you go on a long trip  these are the day to day of life  and they do
 pose problems  here is an innovation a design innovation
 this is a pen it 's called an insulin pen preloaded  the needle is particularly sharp  you just gotta carry this thing
  's much easier to use much less painful  
 anywhere between five and ten percent increase in adherence just as a result of this 
 that 's what i 'm talking about as a last mile opportunity  
 you see we tend to think the problem is solved when we solve the technology problem  but the human innovation the human problem still remains and that 's a
 great frontier that we have left  this isn 't about the biology of people this is now about the brains the psychology of people and innovation needs to
  continue all the way through the last mile  here 's another example of this  this is from a company called positive energy  
 this is about energy efficiency we 're spending a lot of time on fuel cells right now  
 what this company does is they send a letter to households that say here 's your energy use  here 's your neighbor 's energy use you 're doing well smiley face
  and what they find is just this letter nothing else has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use  and you want to think about the social value of that in terms of carbon offsets reduced electricity nine hundred million dollars per year  why because for free  this isn 't a new technology this is a letter
 we 're getting a big bang in behavior  so  how do we tackle the last mile  i think this tells us there is an opportunity
  and i think to tackle it we need to combine
 psychology 
 marketing 
 art we 've seen that but you know what we need to combine it with we need to
 combine this with the scientific method  
 see what 's really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile to me is that the first nine hundred and ninety nine miles are all about science no one would say hey i think this medicine works  go 
  ahead and use it we have testing we go to the lab we try it again we have refinement but you know what we do on the last mile 
  idea people will like this let 's put it out there 
 the amount of resources we put in are disparate we put billions of dollars into fuel efficient technologies how much are we putting into energy behavior change
 in a credible  systematic testing way  
 now  i think that we 're on the verge of something big we 're on the verge of a whole new social science  it 's a social science that recognizes much like science recognizes the complexity of the body
  biology recognizes the complexity of the body we 'll recognize the complexity of the human mind the careful testing retesting design are going to open up vistas of understanding complexities difficult things and those vistas will both create new science 
 and fundamental change in the world as we see it in the next
 hundred years all right thank you very much
  it sometimes feels listening to behavioral economists that they are kind of
 putting into place academically what great marketers have sort of intuitively known for a long time  how much is your field talking to
 great marketers about their insights into human psychology because they 've seen
  a lot of time talking to marketers and i think sixty percent of it is exactly what you say  there are insights to be gleaned there 
 forty percent of it is about what marketing is marketing is selling
 an ad to a firm 
 so in some sense a lot of marketing is about convincing a ceo this is a good ad campaign  so there is a little bit of slippage there  that 's just a caveat  that 's different from actually having an
  effective ad campaign and one of the new movements in marketing is how do we actually measure effectiveness are we effective ca how you take
 your insights here and actually get them integrated into
 working business models on the ground in indian villages for example sm so the scientific method i alluded to is pretty important we work closely with companies that have operational capacity or nonprofits that have operational capacity  and then we say well you
  get this behavior change let 's come up with a few ideas test them see which is working go back synthesize and try to come up with a thing that works and then we 're able to scale with partners it 's kind of 
  the model that has worked in other contexts if you have biological problems we try and fix it see if it works and then work the scale
