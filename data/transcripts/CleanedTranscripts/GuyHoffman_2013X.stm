  my job is to design build and study robots that communicate with people but this story doesn 't start with robotics at all it starts with animation 
 when i first saw pixar 's luxo jr i was amazed by how much emotion they could put into something as trivial as a desk lamp
  them at the end of this movie you actually feel something for two pieces of furniture 
 and i said i have to learn how to do this so i made a really bad career decision 
 and that 's what my mom was like when i did  it i left a very cozy tech job in israel at a nice software company and i moved to new
  to study animation and there i lived
 in a collapsing apartment building in harlem with roommates i 'm not using this phrase metaphorically the ceiling actually collapsed one day in our living room
 whenever they did news stories about building violations in new york they would put the report in front of our building 
 as kind of like a backdrop to show how bad things are 
 anyway during the day i went to school and at night i would sit and draw frame by frame of pencil animation  and i learned two surprising lessons one of them
 was that when you want to
  arouse emotions it doesn 't matter so much how something looks it 's all in the motion in the timing of how the thing moves  
 and the second was something one of our teachers told us  he actually did the the weasel in ice age 
 and he said as an animator you 're not a director you 're an actor 
 so if you want to find the right motion for a character 
 don 't think about it go use your body to find it stand in front of a mirror act it out in front of a camera whatever
  you need and then put it back in your character 
 a year later i found myself at mit in the robotic life group it was one of the first groups researching the relationships between humans and robots and i still had this dream to make
 an actual physical luxo jr lamp  but i found that robots didn 't move at all in this engaging way that i was used to from my animation studies  instead  they were all
 how should i put it they were all kind of robotic
 i thought what if i took whatever i learned in animation school and used that to design my robotic desk lamp  
 so i went and designed frame by frame to try to make this
 robot as graceful and engaging as possible  and here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop
 and i 'm actually redesigning the robot 
  unbeknownst to itself it 's kind of digging its own grave by helping me 
 i wanted it to be less of a mechanical structure giving me light and more of a helpful kind of quiet apprentice that 's always there when you need it and doesn 't really interfere  
 and when for example i 'm looking for a battery that i can 't find in a subtle way it 'll show me where the battery is so you
 can see my confusion here  i 'm not an actor
  and i want you to notice how the same mechanical structure can at one point just by the way it moves  seem gentle and caring and in the other case seem violent and confrontational 
 and it 's the same structure just the motion is different
  a graceful way is just one building block of this whole structure called human robot interaction  
 i was at the time doing my phd  i was working on on human robot teamwork teams of humans and robots working together  i was studying the engineering  the psychology the
  of teamwork and at the same time i found myself in my own kind of teamwork situation with a good friend of mine who 's actually here 
 and in that situation we can easily imagine robots in the near future being there with us
 it was after a passover seder  we were folding up a lot of folding chairs and i was amazed at how quickly we found our own rhythm everybody did their own part  we didn 't have to to divide our tasks we didn 't have to communicate verbally about this
 it all just happened and
  humans and robots don 't look at all like this when humans and robots interact it 's much more like a chess game the human does a thing the robot analyzes whatever the human did
 the robot decides what to do next plans it and does it then the human waits until it 's their turn again so it 's much more like a chess game and that makes sense 
 because chess is great for mathematicians and computer scientists it 's all about information analysis decision making
 and planning  
 but i wanted
  to be less of a chess player and more like a
 doer that just clicks and works together  so i made my second horrible career choice  
 i decided to study acting for a semester  i took off from the phd i went to acting classes  
 i actually participated in a play i hope theres no video of that around still 
 and i got every book i could find about acting including one from the 19th century
  that i got from the library and i was really amazed because my name was the second name on the list the previous name was in one thousand eight hundred and eighty nine 
 and this book was kind of waiting for one hundred years to be rediscovered for
 for robotics  and this book shows actors how to move every muscle in the body to match every kind of emotion that they want to express 
 but the real revelation was when i learned about method acting it became very popular in the 20th century  and method acting said
  have to plan every muscle in your body instead you have to use your body to find the right movement you have to use your sense memory
 to reconstruct the emotions and kind of think with your body to find the right expression improvise play off your scene partner  and this came at the same time as i was reading about this
 trend in cognitive psychology called embodied cognition  
 which also talks about the same ideas we use our bodies to think we don 't just think with our brains and use our bodies to move but our bodies feed back into our brain
 to generate the way that we behave
  and it was like a lightning bolt i went back to my office i wrote this paper  which i never really published called acting lessons for artificial intelligence and i even took another month to do
 what was then the first theater play with a human and a robot acting together that 's what you saw before with with the actors and i thought how can we make an
  intelligence model
 a computer computational model that will model some of these ideas of improvisation of taking risks of taking chances even of making mistakes maybe it can make for better robotic teammates  
 so i worked for quite a long time on these models and i implemented them on a number of robots here you can see a very early
 example with the robots trying to use this embodied artificial intelligence
 to try to match my movements as closely
  sort of like a game  let 's look at it 
 you can see when i psych it out 
 it gets fooled  
 and it 's a little bit like what you might see actors do when they try to mirror each other to find the right synchrony between them 
 and then  i did another experiment   and i got people off the street to use the robotic desk lamp  and try out this idea of embodied artificial intelligence
  actually used two kinds of brains for the same robot the robot is the same lamp that you saw and i put two brains in it for one half of the people i put in a brain that 's kind of the traditional 
 calculated robotic brain it waits for its turn it analyzes everything it plans let 's call it the calculated brain the other got more the stage actor 
  let 's call it the adventurous brain  it sometimes acts without knowing everything it
  makes mistakes and corrects them  and i had them do this very tedious task that took almost twenty minutes and they had to
 work together somehow simulating like a factory job of repetitively doing the same thing
 what i found is that people actually loved the adventurous robot they thought it was more intelligent more committed a better member of the team contributed to
  when they talked about it after the task with the adventurous brain they said by the end we were good friends and high fived mentally 
 whatever that means sounds painful  whereas the people with the calculated brain said it was just like a lazy
  it only did what it was supposed to do and nothing more which is
 almost what people expect robots to do so i was surprised that people had higher expectations of robots than what anybody in robotics thought robots should be doing 
 and in a way i thought maybe it 's time just like method acting
 changed the way people thought about acting in the 19th century from going from the very calculated planned way of behaving to a more intuitive
  embodied way of behaving maybe it 's time for robots to have the same kind of revolution 
 a few years later i was at my next research job at georgia tech in atlanta  and i was working in a group dealing with robotic musicians and i thought music that 's the perfect place
 to look at teamwork coordination timing improvisation and we just got this robot playing marimba and the marimba for everybody like me it was this
  when i was looking at this i looked at other works in human robot improvisation yes there are other works in human robot improvisation and they were also a little bit like a chess game  the human would play the robot analyzed what was played and
 would improvise their own part 
 so this is what musicians called a call and response interaction and it also fits very well robots and artificial intelligence
  but i thought if i use the same ideas i used in the in the theater play and in the teamwork studies  maybe i can make the the robots jam together like a like
 a band everybody 's riffing off each other nobody is stopping for a moment  
 and so i tried to do the same things this time with music  where the robot doesn 't really know what it 's about to play it just sort of moves its body and uses opportunities to play 
 and does what my jazz teacher when i was seventeen taught me she said when you improvise  sometimes you don 't know what you 're doing and you still do it so i tried to make a robot
  know what it 's doing but is still doing it so let 's look at a few seconds from this performance  where the robot listens to the human musician
 and improvises  and then look how the human musician also responds to what the robot is doing and picking up from its
 from its behavior  and at some point can even be surprised by what the robot came up with
  about making notes otherwise nobody would
  ever go see a live show musicians also communicate with their bodies with other band members with the audience they use their bodies to express the music  
 and i thought we already have a robot musician on stage why not make it be a full fledged musician 
 and i started designing a socially expressive head for the robot  the head doesnt actually touch the marimba  it just expresses what the
  these are some napkin sketches from a bar in atlanta that was dangerously located exactly halfway between my lab and my home  so i spent i would say on average three to four hours a day there
 i think and
 i went back to my animation tools and tried to figure out not just what a robotic musician would look like but especially what a robotic musician would move like to sort of show that it doesn 't like what the other person is playing
 and maybe show whatever whatever beat it 's feeling at the
  so we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot which was nice i 'm going to show you now the same kind of performance this time with a socially expressive head 
 and notice one thing how the robot is really showing us the beat it 's picking up from the human while also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it 's doing 
 and also how it changes the way
  moves as soon as it starts its own solo
  now look at the final chord of the of the piece again and this time the robot
 communicates with its body when it 's busy doing its own thing and when it 's ready to coordinate the final chord with me
  part of the body that doesn 't touch the instrument actually helps with the musical performance  and at some point we are in atlanta
 so obviously some rapper will come into our lab at some point and we had we had this rapper come in and do a little jam with the with the robot  here you can see
 the robot
 basically responding to the beat notice two things one how irresistible it is to join the robot while it 's moving its head you kind of want to move your own head when it does it
 and second even though the rapper is really focused on his iphone 
 as soon as the robot turns to him he turns back so even though it 's just in the periphery of his vision in the corner of his eye
  it 's very powerful and the reason is that we can 't ignore physical things moving in our environment  we are wired for that so if you have a problem maybe your partner is
 looking at their iphone or smartphone too much
 you might want to have a robot there to get their attention
  to introduce the last robot that that we 've worked on it came out of something surprising that we found some point people didn 't care
 about the robot being intelligent able to improvise and listen and do all these embodied intelligence things that i spent years developing they really liked that the robot was enjoying the music 
 and they didn 't say the robot was moving to the music they said enjoying the music and
 we thought why don 't we take this idea  and i designed a new piece of furniture this time it wasn 't a desk lamp it was a speaker dock one of those things you plug your
  smartphone in  
 and i thought  what would happen if your speaker dock didn 't just play the music for you but would actually enjoy it too and so again here are some animation tests from from an early stage
 and this is what the final product looked like
  a lot of bobbing heads in the audience so we can still see robots influence people and it 's not just fun and games i think
 one of the reasons i care so much about robots that use their body to communicate and use their body
  let you in on a little secret we roboticists are hiding is that every one of you is going to be living with a robot at some point in your
 life somewhere in your future there will be a robot in your life if not in yours your children 's lives 
 and i want these robots to be to be more fluent more engaging more graceful than currently they seem to be 
 and for that i think maybe robots need to be less like chess players and more like stage actors and more like musicians maybe they should be able to take chances and improvise
  they should be able to anticipate what you 're about to do maybe they even need to be able to make mistakes and correct them  
 because in the end we are human and maybe as humans robots that are a little less than perfect are just perfect for us  thank you
