  'm here to spread the word about the magnificence of spiders
 and how much we can learn from them 
 spiders are truly global citizens  you can find spiders in nearly every terrestrial habitat  this red dot marks the great basin of north america
  'm involved with an alpine biodiversity project there with some collaborators 
 here 's one of our field sites  and just to give you a sense of perspective  this little blue smudge here that 's one of my collaborators  
 this is a rugged and barren landscape  
 yet there are quite a few spiders here  turning rocks over revealed this crab spider grappling with a beetle 
 spiders are not just
  everywhere  but they 're extremely diverse  there are over forty thousand described species of spiders to put that number into perspective  here 's a graph
  comparing the forty thousand species of spiders to the four hundred species of primates  there are two orders of magnitude more spiders than primates  
  the geologic timescale  and the numbers on it indicate millions of years from the present  so the zero here that would be today  
 so what this figure shows is that spiders date back to almost three hundred and eighty million years 
 to put that into perspective  this red vertical bar here marks the divergence time of humans from chimpanzees a mere seven million years ago
 all spiders make silk at some point in their life  
 most spiders use copious amounts of silk and silk is essential to their survival and reproduction
  even fossil spiders can make silk  as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider  
 so this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for three hundred
  million years  
 it doesn 't take long from working with spiders to start noticing how essential silk is to just about every aspect of their life 
 spiders use silk for many purposes  including the trailing safety dragline  wrapping eggs for reproduction  protective
  there are many kinds of spider silk for example this garden spider can make seven different kinds of silks when you look at this orb web you 're actually seeing many types of silk fibers 
 the frame and radii of this web is made up of one type of silk  while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks 
 the filament
 and the sticky droplet how does an
  spider make so many kinds of silk  
 to answer that you have to look a lot closer at the spinneret region of a spider  so silk comes out of the spinnerets  and for those of us spider silk biologists this is what we call the 
 business end of the spider we spend long days  hey don 't laugh  that 's my life 
 we spend long days and nights staring at this part of the spider
  and this is what we see 
 you can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets  because each spinneret has many spigots on it each of these silk fibers exits from 
  the spigot  and if you were to trace the fiber back into the spider  what you would find is that each spigot connects to its own individual silk gland a silk gland kind of looks like a sac with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside
  so if you ever have the opportunity to dissect an orb web weaving spider  and i hope you do what you would find is a bounty
 of beautiful  translucent silk glands  
 inside each spider  there are hundreds of silk glands  sometimes thousands these can be grouped into seven
  you can find seven types of silk glands  and what i have depicted here in this picture let 's start at the one o 'clock position there 's tubuliform silk glands which are used to make the outer silk 
  of an egg sac  there 's the aggregate and flagelliform silk glands which combine to make the sticky capture spiral of an orb web  
 silk lines to a substrate  
 there 's also aciniform silk  which is used to wrap prey  minor ampullate silk is used in web construction  and the most studied silk line of them all major 
  ampullate silk  this is the silk that 's used to make the frame and radii of an orb web  and also the safety trailing dragline  
  spider silk is almost entirely protein  
 nearly all of these proteins can be explained by a single gene family  so this means that the diversity of silk types we see today is encoded by one gene 
  family  so presumably the original spider ancestor made one kind of silk 
  has duplicated
 and then diverged specialized over and over and over again to get the large variety of flavors of spider silks that we have today
 there are several features
 that all these silks have in common they all have a common design such as they 're all very long they 're sort of outlandishly long compared to other proteins 
 they 're very repetitive
 and they 're very rich in the amino acids glycine and alanine 
 to give you an idea of what a spider silk protein looks like this is a dragline silk protein it 's just a portion of it from the black widow spider  
 this is the kind of sequence that i love looking at day and night 
 so what you 're seeing here is the one letter abbreviation for amino acids  and i 've colored in the glycines with
  green and the alanines in red  and so you can see it 's just a lot of g 's and a 's you can also see that there 's
 a lot of short sequence motifs that repeat over and over and over again  so for example there 's a lot of what we call polyalanines or iterated a 's 
 there 's ggq  there 's ggy you can think of these short motifs that repeat over and over again as words
  and these words occur in sentences  
 so for example this would be one sentence  
 and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine  that repeats over and over and over again  and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule 
 silks made by the same spider
 can have dramatically different repeat sequences at the top of the screen
  you 're seeing the repeat unit from the dragline silk of a garden argiope spider  
 it 's short and on the bottom  
 this is the repeat sequence for the egg case or tubuliform silk protein for the exact same spider  and you can see how dramatically different these silk proteins are so this is
 sort of the beauty of the diversification of the spider silk gene family  you can see that the repeat units differ in length  
 they also differ in sequence so i 've colored in the glycines again in green alanine in red  and the serines the letter s in purple  and you can 
  see that the top repeat unit can be explained almost entirely by green and red  and the bottom repeat unit has a substantial amount of purple
  what silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences these amino acid sequences  to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers  
 now  it 's really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body this makes
 testing spider silk really really easy to do in the laboratory  because we 're actually you know testing it in air that 's exactly the environment that spiders are are using
  so this makes quantifying silk properties by methods such as tensile testing which is basically you know tugging on one end of the fiber very amenable 
 here are stress strain curves generated by tensile testing five fibers made by the same spider  
 so what you can see here is that the five fibers have different behaviors  specifically
  if you look on the vertical axis that 's stress 
 if you look at the maximum stress value for each of these fibers  you can see that there 's a lot of variation and in fact dragline or major ampullate silk is the strongest of these fibers 
 we think that 's because the dragline silk which is used to make the frame and radii for a web  needs to be very strong 
 on the other hand if you were to look at strain this is how much a fiber can be extended if you look at the maximum value here again
  there 's a lot of variation and the clear winner is flagelliform or the capture spiral filament in fact  this flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length  
 so silk fibers vary
 in their strength
 and also their extensibility in the case of the capture spiral it needs to be so stretchy to absorb the impact of flying prey  if it wasn 't able to stretch so much then basically when an insect hit the web
  it would just trampoline right off of it  so if the web was made entirely out of dragline silk 
 an insect is very likely to just bounce right off but by having really really stretchy capture spiral silk the web is actually able to absorb the impact of that intercepted prey  
 there 's quite a bit of variation within the fibers that an individual spider can make we call that the tool kit of a spider
  that 's what the spider has to interact with their environment 
 but how about variation among spider species so looking at one type of silk and looking at different species of spiders  this is an area that 's largely unexplored but here 's a little bit of data i can show you  
 this is the comparison of the toughness of the
  like this argiope here should have the toughest dragline silks because they must intercept flying prey  
 what you see here on this toughness graph is the higher the black dot is on the graph the higher the toughness
  species are indicated here by this phylogeny  this evolutionary tree  that shows their genetic relationships  and i 've colored in yellow the orb web weaving spiders 
 if you look right here at the two red arrows they point to the toughness values for the  draglines of nephila clavipes and araneus diadematus 
 these are the two species of spiders for which the vast majority of time and money on synthetic spider silk research has been to replicate
  their dragline silk proteins  yet their draglines are not the toughest 
 in fact the toughest dragline in this survey is this one right here in this white region a non orb web weaving spider  
 this is the dragline spun by scytodes the spitting spider  
 scytodes doesn 't use
 a web at all to catch prey  instead scytodes sort of lurks
 around and waits for prey to get close to it and then immobilizes prey by spraying a silk like venom onto that insect think of hunting with silly string  
 that 's how scytodes forages we don 't really know why scytodes needs such a tough dragline 
 but it 's unexpected results like this
  and worthwhile  it frees us from the constraints of our imagination  
 now i 'm going to mark on the toughness values for nylon fiber bombyx or domesticated silkworm silk
 wool  kevlar  and carbon fibers  and what you can see is that nearly all the spider draglines surpass them  it 's the combination
 of strength
  and toughness that makes spider silk so special  and that has attracted the attention of biomimeticists  so people that turn to nature to try to find new solutions  
 and the strength  extensibility and toughness of spider silks combined with the fact that silks do not elicit an immune response 
 have attracted a lot of interest in the use of spider silks in biomedical applications
  for example as a component of artificial tendons
  for serving as guides to regrow nerves  and for scaffolds for tissue growth 
 spider silks also have a lot of potential for their anti ballistic capabilities 
 silks could be incorporated into body and equipment armor that would be more lightweight and flexible than any armor available
  today 
 in addition to these biomimetic applications of spider silks 
 personally i find studying spider silks just
 fascinating in and of itself i love
 when i 'm in the laboratory a new spider silk sequence
 the spiders are sharing an ancient secret with me  and that 's why i 'm going to spend the rest of my life studying spider silk 
 the next time you see a spider web  please  pause and look a little closer 
 you 'll be seeing
 one of the most high performance materials known to man to borrow from the writings of a spider named charlotte silk is terrific
