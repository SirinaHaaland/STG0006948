  lives a secret life all around us we utter about six metaphors a minute  metaphorical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves
 and others
  but metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words 
 now to assist me in explaining this i 've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers  
 the reigning king of the metaphorians a man whose contributions to the field are so great
 that he himself
 has become a metaphor i am of course  referring to none other
 than elvis presley 
 now all shook up is a great love song it 's also a great example of how whenever we deal with anything abstract
 ideas emotions feelings concepts thoughts
 we inevitably resort to metaphor in all shook up a touch is not a
  but a chill 
 lips are not lips but volcanoes she is not she  but a buttercup 
 and love is not love but being all shook up 
 in this elvis is following aristotle 's classic definition of metaphor
 as the process of giving the thing a name that belongs to something else  
 this is the mathematics of metaphor and fortunately it 's very simple x equals
 laughter this formula works wherever metaphor is present  elvis uses it  but so does shakespeare
 in this famous line from romeo and juliet juliet is the sun
 now  here shakespeare gives the thing juliet a name that belongs to
  whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else we give it a whole network of analogies too 
 we mix and match what we know about the metaphor 's source in this case the sun with what we know about its target  juliet  
 and metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of juliet than if shakespeare had literally described what she looks like 
 so how do we make and understand metaphors this might look familiar  the first step is
  pattern recognition look at this image what do you see 
 three wayward pac men and three pointy brackets are actually present what we see however are two overlapping triangles 
 metaphor is not just the detection of patterns it is the creation of patterns  second step conceptual
  synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ in another sense organ as well  such as colored hearing 
 people with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters 
 we all have synesthetic abilities this is the bouba kiki test what you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called
  percent of other people you will identify the round amoeboid shape as bouba  and the sharp spiky one as kiki 
 can we do a quick show of hands does that correspond okay i think ninety nine point nine would about cover it 
 why do we do that because we instinctively
  or create a pattern between the round shape and the round sound of bouba  and the spiky shape
 and the spiky sound of kiki  
 and many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic silence is sweet 
 neckties are loud  sexually attractive people are hot  sexually unattractive people leave
  metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia in which we understand one concept in the context of another 
 third step is cognitive dissonance this is the stroop test what you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the ink in which these words are printed you
 can take the test now  
 if you 're like most
  you will experience a moment of cognitive dissonance when the name of the color is printed in a differently colored ink 
 the test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well the
 participants had to identify as quickly as possible the literally false sentences 
 they took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences
  we cannot ignore the metaphorical meaning of words either one of the sentences was some jobs are jails 
 now  unless you 're a prison guard  the sentence some jobs are jails is literally false  sadly it 's metaphorically true  
 and the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability to identify it as literally false 
 metaphor matters because it 's around us every day
  the time 
 metaphor matters because it creates expectations pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news 
 agent metaphors describe price movements as the deliberate action of a living thing as in the nasdaq climbed higher 
 object metaphors describe price movements as non living
  the dow fell like a brick researchers asked a group of
 people to read a clutch of market commentaries and then predict the next day 's price trend 
 those exposed to agent metaphors had higher expectations that price trends would continue  
 and they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal 
 if for example
  house prices are routinely described as climbing and climbing higher and higher people might naturally assume that that rise is unstoppable they may feel confident  say in taking out mortgages they really can 't afford that
 's a hypothetical example of course  but this is how metaphor misleads 
 metaphor also matters because it influences decisions
 by activating analogies
  a group of students was told that a small democratic country had been invaded and had asked the u s for help  
 and they had to make a decision what should they do intervene appeal to the u n or do nothing 
 they were each then given one of three descriptions of this hypothetical crisis each of which was designed to trigger a different historical analogy 
 world war ii vietnam  and the third was historically neutral 
 those exposed to the world war ii scenario made more
  interventionist recommendations than the others 
 just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words we cannot ignore the analogies that are triggered by metaphor 
 metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery whenever we solve a problem  or make a discovery 
 we compare what we know with what we don 't know 
 and the only way to find out about the latter is to investigate the ways it might be like
  like the former einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play he famously used thought experiments which are essentially
 elaborate analogies to come up with some of his greatest discoveries 
 by bringing together what we know and what we don 't know through analogy metaphorical thinking strikes
  the spark that ignites discovery
 now
 metaphor is ubiquitous  yet it 's hidden  but you just have to look at the words around you and you 'll find it 
 ralph waldo emerson described language as fossil poetry but before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor 
 and these fossils still breathe  
 take the three most famous words in all of western philosophy
  cogito ergo sum that 's routinely translated as i think  therefore i am 
 but there is a better translation the latin word cogito is derived from the prefix
  shake things up  therefore i am
