  the idea behind the stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple 
 we don 't want iran to get the bomb 
 their major asset for developing nuclear weapons is the natanz uranium enrichment facility  
 the gray boxes that you see
  are real time control systems  now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves 
 we can actually cause a lot of problems with 
 the gray boxes don 't run windows software they are a completely different technology  but if we manage to
  a good windows virus on a
 notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure
 this gray box  then we are in business  
 and this is the plot behind stuxnet so we start with a windows dropper  
 the payload goes onto the gray box  damages the centrifuge and the iranian nuclear program is delayed mission accomplished
 that 's easy huh 
 i want to tell you how we found that out  when we started our research on stuxnet six months ago  it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was the only thing that 
  was known is it 's very very complex on the windows part the dropper part used multiple zero day vulnerabilities and it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes these real time control systems  so that got our attention
  and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stuxnet and checked this thing out 
 and then some very funny things happened 
 stuxnet behaved like a lab rat that didn 't like our cheese
 sniffed but didn 't want to eat didn
 didn 't make sense to me and after we experimented with different flavors of cheese i realized well this is a directed attack it 's completely directed
  the dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found and even if the actual program code that 
 it 's trying to infect is actually running on on that target and if not stuxnet does nothing  
  on this nearly around the clock  because i thought well  we don 't know what the target is it could be let 's say for example a u s power plant or a chemical plant in germany  so we better find out what the target is soon 
 so we extracted and decompiled the attack code and we discovered that it 's structured in two digital bombs a smaller one and a bigger one and we
  also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information they knew all the bits and bites that 
  they had to attack they probably even know the shoe size of the operator so they know everything  and if you have heard that the dropper of stuxnet is complex
  the payload is rocket science it 's way above everything that we have ever seen before 
 here you see a sample of this actual attack code we are talking about around about fifteen thousand lines of code  looks pretty much like old style assembly 
  language  and i want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code  so
 and then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world to potential real world targets  so we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove 
 in order to get target theories we remember that it 's definitely hardcore sabotage
  it must be a high value target and it is most likely located in iran because that 's where most of the infections had been reported now you don 't find 
  several thousand targets in that area it basically boils down to the bushehr nuclear power plant and to the natanz fuel enrichment plant so i told my assistant get me a list of all centrifuge 
  and power plant experts from our client base and i phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data
 and that worked pretty well  so we were able to associate the small digital warhead with the rotor control the rotor is that moving part within 
  the centrifuge that black object that you see  and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode 
  the goal of the attack was really to to do it slowly and creepy obviously in an effort to
 drive maintenance engineers crazy that they would not be able to figure this out quickly the big digital warhead
 we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures so for
  really stands out in that code you can 't overlook it 
 i started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in natanz and found  they are structured in what is called a cascade 
 and each cascade holds one hundred and sixty four centrifuges  so that made sense that was a match and it even got better these centrifuges in iran
  are subdivided into fifteen what is called stages  
 and guess what we found in the attack code an almost identical structure so again that was a real good match and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking 
  at now don 't get me wrong here it didn 't go like this these results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor and we often
  a dead end and had to recover  
 anyway so we figured out that both digital warheads were actually aiming at one and the same target  but from different angles the small warhead is taking 
  one cascade  and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down and the big warhead is talking to six cascades and manipulating valves  so in all we are very confident that
 we have actually determined what the target is it is natanz and it is only natanz so we don 't have to worry that other targets might be
 hit by by stuxnet here 's some very cool stuff that we saw
 really knocked my socks off 
 down there is the gray box and on the top you see the centrifuges  now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors so for example from pressure sensors and vibration sensors
 and it provides
 legitimate program code which is still running during the attack with fake input data 
 and as a matter of fact this fake input data is actually prerecorded by stuxnet  so it 's just like from the hollywood movies where during the heist the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video 
 that 's cool
  idea here is obviously not only to fool the operators in the control room 
 it actually is much more dangerous and aggressive the idea is to circumvent a digital safety system 
 we need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough so for example in a power plant when your big
 steam turbine gets too over speed you must open relief valves within a millisecond 
 obviously this cannot be done by a human operator  so this is where we need digital safety systems and when they are compromised then real bad things can happen your plant 
  can blow up and neither your operators nor nor your safety system will notice it 
 is generic  it doesn 't have anything to do in specifics with
 centrifuges with
 uranium enrichment  so it would work as well for example  in a power plant or in an automobile factory  
  you don 't have as an attacker you don 't have to deliver this payload by a usb stick as we saw it in the case of stuxnet you could also use conventional worm technology for spreading just spread it as wide as possible  
 and if you do that what you end up with is
 a cyber weapon of mass destruction 
 that 's the consequence that we have to face
  face 
 so unfortunately  
 the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the middle east they 're in the united states and europe and in japan  
 so all of the green areas  these are your  target rich environments 
 we have to face the
 quite widely reported that people assume that mossad is is the main entity behind this is that your opinion ralph langner okay you really want to hear that
 is involved but
 that the leading force is not israel  so
 the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower there is only one and that 's the united states
 fortunately  fortunately  because otherwise our problems would even be bigger ca 
 thank you for scaring the living daylights out
