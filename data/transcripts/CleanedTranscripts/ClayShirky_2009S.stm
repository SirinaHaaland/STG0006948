  transformed media landscape and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world  
 and i want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories
  'll start here last november there was a presidential election you probably read something about it in the papers  
 and there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression  
 and so a plan came up to video the vote  
 and the idea was that individual citizens with with phones capable of taking photos or making video would document their polling places on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques
  and would upload this to a central place and that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes  
  but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall  so this is a pattern that assumes we 're all in this together 
 it isn 't when the shiny new tools show up that their uses start permeating society  
 it 's when everybody is able to take them for granted  
 because now that media is increasingly social 
 innovation can happen anywhere that people can take for granted the idea that we 're all in this together  
 and so we 're starting to see a media landscape in which innovation
  is happening everywhere  and moving from one spot to another that is a huge transformation 
 not to put too fine a point on it the moment we 're living through the moment our historical generation is living through
 is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history now that 's a big
  going to try to back it up 
 there are only four periods in the last five hundred years where media has changed enough to qualify for the label revolution 
 the first one is the famous one the printing press  movable type  oil based inks that whole complex of innovations that made printing possible and turned europe upside down starting in the middle of the 1400s 
 then a couple of hundred years ago  there was innovation in two way communication conversational media
  about one hundred and fifty years ago there was
 a revolution in recorded media other than print first photos 
 then recorded sound then movies all encoded onto physical objects  
 and finally about one hundred years ago  the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum to send sound and images through the air radio and television 
 this is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century this is what
 those of us of a certain age grew up with and are used to 
 but there is a curious asymmetry here  
 the media that is good at creating conversations is no good at creating groups 
 and the media that 's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations if
 you want to have a conversation in this world you have it with one other person if you want to address a group you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group whether
  you 're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press  that was the media landscape as we had it in the twentieth century and
 this is what changed this thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen is bill cheswick 's map of the internet
 he traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes them 
 the internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time
 whereas the phone gave us the one to one pattern and television radio magazines books gave us the one to many pattern the internet gives us the many to many pattern 
 for the first time media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations  that 's one of the big changes 
 the second big change
 is that as all media gets digitized the internet also becomes the mode of carriage for
 all other media  meaning that phone calls migrate to the internet magazines migrate to the internet movies migrate to the internet 
 and that means that every medium is right next door to every other
 put another way media is increasingly less just a source of information and it is
 increasingly more a site of coordination because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well  
 and the third big change
 is that members of the former audience as dan gilmore calls them can now also be producers and not consumers every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well because the same equipment
 phones  computers let you consume and
  produce it 's as if when you bought a book they threw in the printing press for free it 's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right buttons
  that is a huge change
 in the media landscape we 're used to and it 's not just internet or no internet
  we 've had the internet in its public form for almost twenty years now and it 's still changing as the media becomes more social  it 's still changing
 even among groups who know how to deal with the internet well  
 second story  
 last may china in the sichuan province had a terrible earthquake seven point nine magnitude  massive destruction in a wide area as the richter scale has it 
 and
 the earthquake was reported as it was happening
  people were texting from their phones  they were taking photos of buildings they were taking videos of buildings shaking 
 they were uploading it to qq china 's largest internet service they were twittering it
 and so as the quake was happening the news was reported  
 and because of the social connections  chinese students coming coming elsewhere and going to school or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in
  were people listening all over the world hearing this news the bbc
 got their first wind of the chinese quake from twitter twitter announced the existence of the quake several minutes before the us geological survey had anything up online for anybody to read 
 the last time china had a quake of that magnitude
 it took them three months to admit that it had
  now they might have liked to have done that here  rather than seeing these pictures go up online 
 but they weren 't given that choice because their own citizens beat them to the punch  even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens  rather than from the xinhua news agency  
 and this stuff rippled like wildfire for a while there
 the top ten most clicked links on twitter the global short messaging service nine of the top ten
  links were about the quake people collating information  pointing people to news sources pointing people to the us geological survey 
 the 10th one was kittens on a treadmill but that 's the internet for you but nine of the ten
 in those first hours  and within half a day donation sites
  and donations were pouring in from all around the world this was an incredible coordinated global response and the chinese then in one of their periods of media openness  decided 
  that they were going to let it go that they were going to let this this citizen reporting fly  
  that corrupt officials had taken bribes to allow those building to be built to less than code  
 and so they started the citizen journalists started reporting that as well  and there was an incredible picture you may have seen in on the front page of the new york times a local official literally prostrated himself in the street 
 in front of these protesters in order to get them to go away  essentially to say we will do anything to placate
  you just please stop protesting in public 
 but these are people who have been radicalized because thanks to the one child policy they have lost everyone in their next generation someone who has seen the death of a single child
 now has nothing to lose  and so the protest kept going and finally
 the chinese cracked down  that was enough of
  and so they began to arrest the protesters they began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on china is probably the most successful
 manager of internet censorship
 in the world  using something that is widely described as the great firewall of china and the great firewall of china is a set of observation points
 that assume that media is produced by professionals  it mostly comes in from the outside world
 it comes in in relatively sparse chunks  and it comes in relatively slowly  and because of those four characteristics they are able to filter it
 as it comes into the country  
 but like the maginot line the great firewall of china was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge  because not one of those four things was true in this environment 
  produced locally it was produced by amateurs it was produced quickly and it was produced at such an incredible abundance
 that there was no way to filter it as it appeared  
 and so now the chinese government who for a dozen years has quite successfully filtered the web 
 is now in the position of having to decide whether to allow or shut down entire services
  transformation to amateur media
 is so enormous that they can 't deal with it any other way and
 in fact that is happening this week on the 20th anniversary of tiananmen they just two days ago announced that they were simply shutting down access to twitter  
 because there was no way to filter it
 other than that they had to turn the spigot entirely off now these changes don
  just affect people who want to censor messages  they also affect people who want to send messages
  because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole not just a particular strategy 
 the classic
 media problem 
 from the 20th century is how does an organization have a message that they want to get out to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network and here is the twentieth century answer  
 bundle up the message
  send the same message to everybody 
 national message targeted individuals  relatively sparse number of producers very expensive to do so there is not a lot of competition this is how you reach people 
 all of that is over  we are increasingly in a landscape where media is global social  ubiquitous
  now most organizations that are trying to send messages
 to the outside world to the distributed distributed collection of the audience are now used to this change the audience can talk back
 and that 's a little freaky but you can get used to it after a while  as people do  but that 's not the really crazy change that we 're living in the middle of 
 the really crazy change is here it 's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other
 the fact that former consumers are now producers the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another  
 because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals  
 and because the size of the network  the complexity of the network is actually the square of the number of participants  meaning that the network when it grows large grows
  as recently at last decade most of the media that was available for public consumption was produced by professionals 
 those days are over never to return  it is the green lines now that are the source of the free content which brings me to
 my last story  
 we saw some of the most imaginative use of social media during the obama campaign and i don 't mean most imaginative
  in politics i mean most imaginative use ever and one of the things obama did was they famously the obama campaign did was they famously put up 
 and millions of citizens rushed in to participate and to try and figure out how to help  an incredible conversation sprung up
 there and then this time last year obama announced that he was going to change his vote on fisa the foreign intelligence surveillance act
 he had said in january that he would not sign a bill that granted
  immunity for possibly warrantless spying on american persons 
 by the summer in the middle of the general campaign he said i 've thought about the issue more i 've changed my mind i 'm going to vote for this bill and many of his own supporters
 on his own site went very
 publicly berserk  it was senator obama when they created it they changed the name later please get fisa right
  days of this group being created it was the fastest growing group on mybo com within weeks of its being created it was the largest group
 obama had to issue a press release he had to issue a reply  and he said essentially i have considered the issue  
 i understand where you are coming from but having considered it all i 'm still going to vote the way i 'm going to
  but i wanted to reach out to you and say  i understand that you disagree with me  and i 'm going to take my lumps on this one 
 this didn 't please anybody but then a funny thing happened in the conversation people in that group realized
 that obama had never shut them down  
 nobody in the obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join to deny its existence to delete it to take
  to convene their supporters but not to control their supporters  and that is the kind of discipline
 that it takes to make really mature use of this media 
 media 
 the media landscape that we knew as familiar as it was as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast
  messages to amateurs is increasingly slipping away 
 in a world where media is global social  ubiquitous and cheap 
 in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants
  in that world media is less and less often about
 crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals
 it is more and more often a way of creating an environment for convening and supporting groups 
 and the choice we face i mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world  
 isn 't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in that 's the media environment we 've got  
 the question we all face now is how can we make best use of this media  even though it means changing the way we 've always done it thank you very much
