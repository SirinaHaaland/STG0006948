  open the doors to a building dedicated to building  yet only breaks me down i march
 down hallways cleaned up after me every day by
  regular janitors but i never have the decency to honor their names 
 lockers left open like teenage boys ' mouths when teenage girls wear clothes that covers their insecurities but exposes everything else 
 masculinity mimicked by men who grew up with no
  worn by bullies who are dangerously armed but need hugs  teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here oceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons
 but never learn to swim  part like the red sea when the bell rings this
 is a training ground my high school is chicago  diverse and segregated on purpose
  am an honors but go home with regular students who are soldiers in territory that owns them  
 this is a training ground to sort out the regulars from the honors a reoccurring cycle built to recycle the trash of this system  
 trained
 at a young age to capitalize letters
  taught now that capitalism raises you but you have to step on someone else to get there  this is a training ground
 where one group is taught to lead and the other is made to follow no wonder so many of my people spit bars  because the truth is hard to swallow the need for degrees has left so many
  but when you go home every day and your home is work you don 't want to pick up any assignments reading textbooks is stressful but reading does not matter when you feel your story is already 
  written  either dead or getting booked  taking tests is stressful  
  at what they 're built to do to train you to keep you on track to track down an american dream that has failed so many of us all
