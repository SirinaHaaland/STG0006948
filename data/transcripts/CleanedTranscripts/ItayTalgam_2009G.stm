  the magical moment of conducting which is you go onto a stage there is an orchestra sitting they are all you know warming up and doing stuff  and
 i go on the
  this little office of the conductor  or rather a cubicle
 an open space cubicle with a lot of space 
 and in front of all that noise you do a very small gesture something like this not very pomp not very sophisticated this  
 and suddenly out of the chaos order noise becomes music  
 and this is fantastic and it 's so tempting to think that it 's all about me 
 all those great people here
  noise they need me to do that  not really if it were that i would just
 save you the talk and teach you the gesture  so you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want and you have perfect harmony it doesn 't work
  let 's look at the first video i hope you 'll think it 's a good example of harmony and then speak a
  little bit about how it comes about
  was that nice  so that was
 a sort of a success now who should we thank for the success i mean obviously the
 orchestra musicians playing beautifully  the vienna philharmonic orchestra they don
 't often even look at the conductor  then you have the clapping audience
  actually taking part in doing the music you know viennese audiences usually don 't interfere with the music   this is the closest to an oriental bellydancing feast that you will ever get in vienna 
 unlike for example israel where audiences cough all the time you
 know arthur rubinstein the pianist used to say that anywhere in the world people that have the flu they go to the doctor in tel aviv they come to my concerts
 's a sort of a tradition  but viennese audiences do not do that
  here they go out of their regular  just to be part of that to become part of the orchestra and that 's great you know 
 audiences like you  yeah  make the event 
 but what about the conductor what can you say the conductor was
  he was
 happy 
 and i often show this to senior management  people get annoyed 
 you come to work how come you 're so happy 
 something must be wrong there  yeah  but he 's spreading happiness and i think the happiness the important thing is this happiness does not come from
 only his own story and his joy of the music  the joy is about enabling other people 's stories to be heard at the same time
 you have the story of the orchestra as a professional body  you have the story of the audience as a community  
 yeah  you have the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and in the audience  
 and then you have other stories unseen people who build this wonderful concert hall people who made those
 stradivarius 
  all those beautiful instruments and all those stories are being heard
 at the same time this is the true experience of a live concert that 's a reason to go out of home yeah
 and not all conductors do just that  let 's see somebody else a great conductor riccardo muti
  have a little demonstration would you be my orchestra for a second can you sing please the first note of don giovanni  you have to
  feel even more redundant than i already feel so please  wait for the conductor  now look at me
  so not only the instruction is clear but also the sanction what will happen if you don
  i 'm responsible for mozart this is going to be the only story to be told  it 's mozart as i
  riccardo muti  understand it and you know what happened to muti
  three years ago he got a letter signed by all seven hundred employees of la scala  
 musical employees i mean the musicians  saying you 're a great conductor we don 't want to work with you  please resign 
 why because you don 't let us develop  you 're using us as
  can you do it with less control or with a different kind of control  let 's look at the next conductor
  not true when he was a young man of about about thirty he wrote what he called the ten commandments for conductors the first one was  if you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong 
 that 's the first one the fourth one you 'll like better it says  never look at the trombones it only encourages them so 
 the whole idea is really to let it happen
  by itself do not not interfere  but how does it happen 
 did you see him turning pages in the score now either he is senile  and doesn 't remember his own music because he wrote the music or
 he is actually transferring a very strong message to them saying come on guys you have to play by the book 
 so it 's not about my story it 's not about your story it 's only the execution of
  written music  no interpretation interpretation is the real story of the performer so no he doesn 't want that that 's a different kind of control  let 's see another
  the hands did you see this kind of movement let me conduct you  twice once like a muti  and you
  know when to play  now i can tell you  even the berlin philharmonic doesn 't know when to play 
 but i 'll tell you how they do it no cynicism this is a german orchestra yes they look at karajan  
  after doing that  they really look at each other and the first players of the orchestra lead the whole ensemble in playing together  and when karajan is asked about it he actually says yes the worst
 damage i can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear
 instruction because that would
 prevent the ensemble the listening
 to each other that is needed for an orchestra now that 's great what about the eyes  why are the eyes closed
 there is a wonderful story about karajan conducting in london and he cues in a flute player
 like this the guy has no idea what to do
  start when you can 't stand it anymore 
 meaning
 that
 you know you have no authority to change anything  it 's my music the real music is only in karajan 's head  and you have to guess my mind  so you are
 under tremendous pressure because i don 't give you instruction and yet you have to guess my
  so it 's a different kind of a very spiritual but yet
 very firm control can we do it in another way of course we can let 's go back to the first conductor we 've seen carlos kleiber his name next video
 the
  not telling them what to do when he does this it 's not
 take your stradivarius and like jimi hendrix  smash it on the floor it 's not that  he says this is the gesture of the music i 'm
 opening a space for you to put in another layer of interpretation that is another story  
 but how does it really work together if it doesn 't give them instructions  it 's like being on a
  you 're not really given any instructions but the forces of the process itself keep you in place that 's what he does
 the interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist it 's not a physical thing it 's in the players ' heads  and that 's what makes them into partners 
  you have the plan in your head  you know what to do even though kleiber is not conducting you but here and there and that 
  with sound as you actually take the ride this is very exciting for those players they do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks later
 it is very tiring  yeah  but it 's the best
 the best music making 
 like this  but of course it 's not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy you also have to be very professional and look again at this
  kleiber can we have the next video  quickly you 'll see what happens when there is a mistake again you see the
 beautiful body language 
 and now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way
  second time for the same player 
 and now the third time for the same player 
 wait for me after the concert i have a
 short notice to give you you know when it 's needed  the authority is there it 's very important but authority is not enough to make people your partners
  's see the next video  please see what happens here you might be surprised having seen kleiber as such a hyperactive guy
  is there one hundred percent but not commanding not telling what to do rather enjoying what the soloist is doing 
 another solo now see what you can pick up from this
  comes from here  so that 's a good thing  and the second thing is it 's about actually being in control but in a very
  you know what happens gravitation is no more kleiber not only creates a process but also creates the conditions in the world
 in which this process
 takes place  so again the oboe player is completely autonomous and therefore happy and proud of his work and creative and all of that  and
 the level in which kleiber is in control
  is in a different level so control is no longer a zero sum game  you have this control you have this control  and all you put together in partnership  brings about the best music  
 so kleiber is about process kleiber is about
 conditions in the world  but you need to have process and content to create the meaning lenny bernstein my own personal maestro since he was a great teacher
  bernstein always started from the meaning look at
 the
  the face of muti at the beginning  well he had a wonderful expression but only one did you see
  you know why because the meaning of the music is pain  and you 're playing a painful sound and you look at lenny and
 he 's suffering  but not in a way that you want to stop it 's suffering like enjoying himself in a jewish way as they say
 but you can see the music on his face you can see the baton left his hand
  no more baton  now it 's about you the player telling the story  
 now it 's a reversed thing you 're telling the story and you 're telling the story and even briefly you become the storyteller to which the community the whole community  listens to and bernstein enables that isn 't that wonderful 
 now if you are doing all the things we talked about together  and maybe some others you can get to this wonderful point of doing
  and for the last video i think this is simply the the best title my friend peter says if you love something give it away
