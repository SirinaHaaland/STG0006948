  you have heard that phrase uttered by your friends  family schools and the media for decades it 's a norm  it 's a social norm  
 but it 's a special kind of social norm  because it 's a social norm that wants to tell
  us who we can relate to and who we shouldn 't relate to don 't talk to strangers says
 from anyone who 's not familiar to you  stick with the people you know  stick with people like you 
 how appealing is that it
 's not really
  're at our best 
 when we 're at our best we reach out to people who are not like us  because when we do that we learn from people who are not like us 
 my phrase for this value of being with not like us is strangeness 
 and my point is that in today 's digitally intensive world strangers are quite frankly not the point 
 the point that we should be worried about is how much strangeness are we getting
 why strangeness  because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data 
 and data turns our social relations into digital relations  
 and that means that our digital relations now depend
 extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness a sense of discovery a sense of surprise and unpredictability  
  strangers  
 because strangers are part of a world of really rigid boundaries 
 they belong to a world of people i know versus people i don 't know 
 and in the context of my digital relations i 'm already doing things with people i don 't know  
 the question isn 't whether or not i know
  the question is what can i do with you  what can i learn with you  what can we do together that benefits us both 
 i spend a lot of time thinking about how the social landscape is changing  how new technologies create new constraints
 and new opportunities for people the most important changes facing us today have to do with data
 and what data is doing to shape the kinds of digital relations that will be possible for us in the future
 economies of the future depend on that our social lives in the future depend on that the threat to worry about
 isn 't strangers  the threat to worry about is whether or not we 're getting our fair share of strangeness 
 now 20th century psychologists and sociologists were thinking about strangers  but they weren 't thinking so dynamically about human relations 
 and they were thinking about strangers in the context of influencing practices
 stanley milgram from the ' 60s and ' 70s the creator of the small world experiments which became later popularized as six degrees of separation  made the point that any two 
  arbitrarily selected people were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps 
  in his seminal essay the strength of weak ties made the point that these weak ties that are a part of our networks these strangers are actually more effective at diffusing information to us
 than are our strong ties the people closest to us 
 he makes an additional indictment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us these strong ties
  lives actually have a homogenizing effect on us they produce sameness my colleagues and i at intel have spent the last few years
 looking at the ways in which digital platforms are reshaping our everyday lives what kinds of new routines are possible 
 we 've been looking specifically at the kinds of digital platforms
 that have enabled us to take our possessions those things that used to be very restricted
  to us and to our friends in our houses and to make them available to people we don 't know  
 whether it 's our clothes whether it 's our cars whether it 's our bikes  whether it 's our books or music 
 we are able to take our possessions now and make them available to people we 've never met  
 and we concluded a very important insight which was that as people 's relationships to the things in their lives change
  so do their relations with other people 
 and yet recommendation system after recommendation system continues to miss the boat it continues to try to predict what i need
 based on some past characterization of who i am of what i 've already done security technology after security technology continues
  to design data protection in terms of threats and attacks 
 keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations  
 categories like friends and family and contacts and colleagues don 't tell me anything about my actual relations 
 a more effective way to think about my relations might be in terms of closeness and distance where at any given point in time with any single person
  i am both close and distant from that individual  all as a function of what i need to do right now 
 people aren 't close or distant 
 people are always a combination of the two and that combination is constantly changing  
 what if technologies could intervene
 to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships what if technologies could intervene to help me find the person that i need right now
  strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance
 that enables me to find the people that i need right now 
 that enables me to find the sources of intimacy of discovery  and of inspiration that i need right now  strangeness is not about meeting strangers  
 it simply makes the point
 that we need to disrupt our zones of familiarity so
  jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness and it 's a problem faced not just by individuals today  but also by organizations 
 organizations that are trying to embrace
 massively new opportunities  whether you 're a political party
 insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion of who belongs and who does not whether you 're the government protecting social institutions like marriage
 and restricting
  access of those institutions to the few 
 whether you 're a teenager in her bedroom who 's trying to jostle her relations with her parents strangeness is a way to think about
 how we pave the way to new kinds of relations we have to change the norms we have to change the norms
 in order to enable new kinds of technologies as a basis for new kinds of businesses
 what interesting questions
 lie ahead for us in this world of no strangers  
 how might we think differently about our relations with people 
 how might we think differently about our relations with distributed groups of people 
 how might we think differently about our relations with technologies things that effectively become social participants in their own right
 the range of digital relations
 is extraordinary in the context
 of this broad range of digital relations  safely seeking strangeness might very well be a new basis for that innovation  thank you
