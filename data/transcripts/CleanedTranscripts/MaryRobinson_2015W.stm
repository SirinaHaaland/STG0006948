  a question i 'm often asked is where did i get my passion for human rights
  i grew up in the west of ireland  wedged between four brothers two older than me and two younger than me 
 so of course i had to be interested in human rights and equality
 and justice and using my elbows and
 those issues stayed with me and guided me and in particular when
  i dedicated my presidency to
 having a space for those who felt marginalized on the island of ireland and bringing together communities from northern ireland with those from the republic trying to build
 peace and i went as the first irish president to the united kingdom and met with queen elizabeth
 and
 also welcomed to my official residence which we call ras an uachtarin the house of the president
 members of the royal family including  notably the prince of wales  and i
 was aware that at the time of my presidency
  was a country beginning a rapid
 economic progress we were
 a country that was benefiting from the solidarity of the european union indeed when ireland first joined the european union 
  were parts of the country that were considered developing including my own beloved native county county mayo
  trade delegations here to the united states  to
 japan to india  to encourage investment  to help to create jobs to build up our economy to build up our health system our education our development  
 what i didn 't have to do as president
 was buy land on mainland europe
  so that irish citizens could go there
 because our island was going underwater 
 what i didn 't have to think about either as president or as a constitutional lawyer was the implications for the sovereignty of the territory
 because of the impact of climate change  
 but that is what president tong of the republic of kiribati  has to wake up every morning thinking about 
 he has bought land in fiji
  as an insurance policy what he calls migration with dignity 
 because he knows that his people may have to leave their islands 
 as i listened to
 president tong describing the situation i really felt
 that this was a problem that no leader should have to face and
 as i
 heard him speak about the pain of his problems  i thought about eleanor roosevelt  
 i thought about her and
 those who worked with her on the commission on human rights which she chaired in 
 and drew up the universal declaration of human rights for them it would have been
  unimaginable that a whole country could go out of existence because of 
 climate change  
 i came to climate change not as a scientist or an environmental lawyer  and i wasn 't really impressed by the images of polar bears or melting glaciers  it was because of the impact on people 
 and
 the impact on their rights their rights to food and safe water health  education and shelter  and
 i say this with
 humility  because i came late to the issue of climate change  when i served as un high commissioner for human rights from
  remember making a single speech on climate change  i knew that there was another part of the united nations the un
 convention on climate change that was dealing with the issue of climate change  it was later
 when i started to work in african countries on issues of development and human rights  and i kept hearing this pervasive sentence
  much worse now things are so much worse and then i explored
 what was behind that it was about changes in the climate climate shocks changes in the weather  
 i met constance okollet who had formed a women 's group in eastern uganda  and she told me that
  she was growing up
 she had a very normal life in her village and they didn 't go hungry they knew that the seasons would come as they
 were predicted to come they knew when to sow and they knew when to harvest and so they had enough food 
 but in recent years at the time of this conversation they had nothing but long periods of drought  and then flash flooding  
 and then more drought  
 the school had been destroyed
  livelihoods had been destroyed  their harvest had been destroyed  she forms this women 's group to try to keep her community together  
 and this was a reality that really struck me  because of course 
 constance okollet wasn 't responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions that were
  i was very struck
 about the situation in malawi in january of this year 
 there was an unprecedented flooding in the country  it covered about a third of the country 
 over three hundred people were killed  and hundreds of thousands lost their livelihoods  
 and the average person in malawi emits about eighty kg
  emits about seventeen point five metric tons  so those who are suffering disproportionately
 don 't drive cars don 't have electricity don 't consume
 very significantly  and yet they are feeling more and more the impacts of
  the changes that are preventing them from knowing how to grow food properly and knowing how to look after their future  
 i think it was really the importance of the injustice that really struck me very forcibly  
 and
 i know that we 're not
 able to address some of that injustice because we 're not on course for
  for a safe world governments around the world agreed at the
 conference in copenhagen and have repeated it at every conference on climate that we have to stay below two degrees celsius of warming 
  above pre industrial standards  but we 're on course for about four degrees  so we face an existential threat to the
  future of our planet  and that made me realize that climate change is the greatest threat to human rights in the 21st century  
 and that brought me then to climate justice 
 climate justice responds to the moral argument both sides of the moral argument to address
  climate change first of all to be on the side of those who are suffering most and are most effected  
 and secondly  to make sure that they 're not left behind again when we start to move and start to address climate change with climate action as we are doing
 in our very unequal world today  it 's very striking how many people are
  in our world of seven point two billion people about three billion
 are left behind one point three billion don 't have access to electricity  
 and they light their homes with kerosene and candles both of which are dangerous  and in fact they spend a lot of their tiny income on
 that form of lighting two point six billion people cook on open fires on coal
  wood and animal dung  and
 this causes about four million deaths a year from indoor smoke inhalation and of course most of those who die are women  
 so we have a very
 unequal world and
 we
  scale and the transformative nature of the change which will be needed because we have to go to zero carbon emissions by about two thousand and fifty  
 if we 're going to stay below two degrees celsius of warming  
 and that means we have
  of the known resources of fossil fuels in the ground  
 it 's a very big change  and it means that obviously industrialized countries must cut their emissions must become much more energy efficient and must move as quickly as possible to renewable energy 
 for developing countries and emerging economies  
 the problem and the challenge is to grow without emissions because they must
 they have very poor populations so they must develop
 without emissions  and that is a different kind of problem 
 indeed  no country in the world has actually grown without emissions 
 all the countries have developed with fossil fuels and then may be moving to renewable energy  so it is a
  a very big challenge and it requires the total support of the international community with the necessary finance and technology and systems and support 
 because no country
 can make itself safe from the dangers of climate change this is an issue that requires complete human solidarity 
 human solidarity if you like 
  we are all in this together  and we have to work together to ensure that we reach zero carbon
 by
 two thousand and fifty  
 the good news is that change is happening  and it 's happening very fast 
 here in california there 's a very ambitious emissions target to cut emissions  in hawaii they 're passing
  are very ambitious around the world  in costa rica they have committed to
  on at the moment to convert electricity from tidal and wave power  in order that we can leave the coal in the ground  
 and that change is both welcome and is happening very rapidly  but it 's still not enough and the political will is still not enough 
 let me come back to president
  to live on their island and have a solution but it would take a lot of political will president tong told me about his ambitious idea
 to either
 build up or even float the little islands where his people live 
  of course is beyond the resources of kiribati itself 
 it would require great solidarity and support from other countries and it would require the kind of imaginative
 idea
 that we bring together when we want to have a space station in the air  but
 wouldn 't it be wonderful to have this engineering wonder and to allow a people to remain in their sovereign
  be part of the community of nations that is the kind of
 idea that we should be thinking about  
 yes  the challenges of the transformation we need are big  
 but they can be solved  we are actually as a people very capable of coming together to solve problems  
 i was very conscious of this as i took
  was an extraordinary year  it was a year when the world faced what must have seemed almost insoluble problems
 the devastation of the world wars particularly the second world war the fragile peace that had been brought about the need for a whole economic
 regeneration  but
 the leaders of that time didn 't flinch from this they had the capacity they had a sense of being driven
 by never again must the world have this kind of problem and they had to build structures for peace and security  and what did we get what
  the charter of the united nations 
 the bretton woods institutions as they 're called  the world bank  and the international monetary fund 
 a marshall plan for europe a devastated europe  to
 reconstruct it and indeed a few years later the universal declaration of human rights two thousand and fifteen
 is a year that is similar in its importance to
 and similar potential 
 there will be two big summits this year 
 the first one  in september in new york is the summit for the sustainable development goals  
 and then the summit in paris in december to give us a climate agreement 
 the
 sustainable development goals are intended to help countries to
  live sustainably  in tune with mother earth not to
 take out of mother earth and destroy ecosystems  but rather to live in harmony with mother earth  by living
 under sustainable development and the sustainable development goals will come into operation for all countries on
  climate agreement a binding climate agreement is needed
 because of the scientific evidence that we 're on a trajectory for about a four degree world  and we have to change course to stay below two degrees  
 so we need to take steps that will be monitored and reviewed  so that we can keep increasing the ambition of how we cut emissions  and how we move more rapidly to
 energy  so that we have a safe world 
 the reality is that this issue is much too important to be 
  left to politicians and to the united nations it 's an issue for all of us  
  indeed  the face of the environmentalist has changed because of the justice dimension  
 it 's now an issue for faith based organizations  under very good leadership from pope francis  and indeed  the church of england which is divesting from fossil fuels  
 it 's an issue for the for the business
 community  and the good news is that the business community is changing very rapidly except for
  the fossil fuel industries 
 laughter even they are beginning to slightly change their language but only slightly but business is not only moving rapidly to the benefits of renewable 
  energy  but is urging politicians to give them more signals  so that they can move even more rapidly 
 that
 one of the greensboro
 four who had taken part in the woolworth sit ins said quite recently that climate change is the
 lunch counter moment for young people so lunch counter moment for young people of
  sort of real human rights issue of the 21st century because he said it is the greatest challenge to humanity and justice in our world 
 i recall very much the climate march last september and that was a huge momentum not just in new york  but all around the  world and we have to build on that 
 i was marching with some of the elders family  and
 i saw
  a placard a little bit away from me  but we were wedged so closely together because after all there were four hundred thousand people out in the streets of new york so i couldn 't quite get to that placard i would have just liked to have been able to step behind it because it said
  to have five grandchildren  and i think
 about their world and what it will be like when they will share that world with about nine billion other people in two thousand and fifty  
 we know that inevitably it will be a climate constrained world because of the emissions we 've already put up there but it could be
 a world that is much more
  equal and much fairer and much better for health  and better for jobs and better for energy security  than the world we have now  
 if we have
 switched sufficiently and early enough to renewable energy  and no one is left behind  no one is left behind
  looking back seventy years i would like to think that they will look back that world will look back
  the decisions that made a difference  and that put the world on the right pathway  and we benefit now from that pathway that they will feel that somehow we took our responsibilities  we did what was done 
  in similar terms  we didn 't miss the opportunity  we lived up to
  is about 
 and somehow for me  it 's captured in words of somebody that i admired very much she was a mentor of mine she was a friend  she died much too young 
  she was an extraordinary personality a great champion of the environment  wangari maathai  
  there comes a time when humanity is called upon to shift to a new level of consciousness  to reach a
 higher moral ground 
 and that 's what we have to do we have to reach a new level of consciousness a higher moral ground  
 and we have to do it this year
 in those two big
  and that won 't happen unless we have the momentum
 from people around the world who say we want action now  we want to change course  we want a safe world a safe world for future generations a safe world for our children and our grandchildren and we 're all in this together
