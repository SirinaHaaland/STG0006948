  and inspiring father he had a passion for flight as you can kind of sense from that
 small group of us got together
 to have a a go a run at the whole challenge of flight that inspired
 inspired people for years  and do it in a very different kind of way  and that 's the journey i 'd like to share with you now the starting hypothesis was one of
 the human mind and body which as you 've seen for the last few days here is an amazing
  what if you augmented that wonderful machine
 with just the right technology  if you approach flight in that kind of real way where could you get to so my training partner here
 back in london denton is doing a much better job of that kind of stuff than than me
  guess what it 's london  the idea was that you augment that and so how do you augment that well  we bought one of these
  this was ground zero so that little piece of kit proved really quite impressive  so we got two in a field 
 the real hero here by the way is right in the background there 's a lady tending some vegetables 
 who does a brilliant job of trying to ignore us for a while 
 i think the only thing less happy is the grass
  that we did
 probably damage quite badly you get an idea of the thrust here when i try to hold them horizontally and somewhat fail  that 's around fifty kilos of thrust there 
 we were quite impressed with that we thought we were getting somewhere so there  there 's only one sensible way to go from there 
 you get four 
 i have to say i still like watching these back so then we thought well  let 's try and spread the load a bit the legs are designed to take the load so
  don 't we spread it out a bit that bit was good the harness
 a nice idea but it didn 't really work  as you 'll see now  this whole journey was very much about trying things 
 yeah it really didn 't work did it trying things and learning by failing at them most of the time  and
 that included
 failing by falling over
  if you notice we 've got five engines here not to be put off by the fact one was in maintenance still had a go  and
 then i pinched a fuel line so again good learning we learned not to do that again  
 this was a blind alley this was three on each arm that was ridiculous that was seventy kilos on each arm again  struck
  we were starting to make some really
 quite convincing progress just enough to make you believe that maybe maybe we could get there you can see look tantalizing the model of
 one on each leg and two on each arm on paper that was enough thrust and then then we did what i 'm about to show you now and i still love watching this one
  that was the point where this this endeavor went from 
 i 'm really not sure this is going to work to oh my god it does work from there on we then refined it but we carried on falling over a lot 
 falling over like i say is definitely the best way to learn
  after a while we starting really refining the layout of all of this and you 'll see that 's stability and control there 's no wires there or anything that 's
 a combination of us refining the technology including with a tupperware box on the back for the electronics
 and and actually learning the balance and control i
 'm now going to save your ears for the next short piece and talk over it after a while the jet engine noise is a bit annoying
  this is only a few weeks ago  
 you can see the stability and control is really quite nice  and i 'd like to think this somewhat validates that starting hypothesis 
 that the human mind and body  if properly
 augmented in that way can achieve some pretty cool stuff i mean like  i said i 'm not thinking about where i 'm moving my arms at that stage 
 i 'm looking at the objective of where i want to get to and a bit like riding a bike 
 my arms are just doing their thing it 's a very strange experience  
 so where is all this headed
  over this landing i think i land in this one 
 well  i don 't think anybody 's going to go down to walmart or take the kids to school in any of this stuff for a while  
 but the team at gravity are building some awesome technology that 's going to make this look like child 's play  we 're working on some things that will
 seek to bring this unusual experience of flight to a wider audience beyond the events and displays we 're doing
 we 're even starting to look for pilots two and three if there 's any volunteers
 i 've got this vision 
 it sounds audacious but let 's just stick it out there that one day maybe we can rise up above a beach fly up and down the coastline of it rise up a bit higher with some of the safety kit we 're working on to make this achievable
 then over the horizon comes a hercules with the ramp down  as it comes past you start picking up speed and see if we can intercept from the rear not the front that would be a mistake
 and then try and land in the back
  but
 this this is also  if i take a big step back from this this is also a very personal journey for me
  back to that lovely photo or photo in a picture  sadly my father
 took his own life when i was fifteen and left an awful lot of
 unfulfilled ambition  he was a wonderful
  if he was looking down  he would be
 he 'd certainly be smiling at some of the things we 've done here i think so it 's a tribute to him  thank you very much richard browning 
 i 'm probably more nervous about doing the demo after this 
  got a lot of things to get done today  worst case scenario we don 't get a clean start or we get an unplanned failure while i 'm actually flying around this is why we keep it very low
  the worst is i just look like an idiot and fall on my rear as i said  so you can all enjoy
  day
