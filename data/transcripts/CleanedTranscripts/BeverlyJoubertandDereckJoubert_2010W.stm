  the african wilderness and protecting the african wilderness and so what we 've done is we 've focused on iconic cats  and i know 
 in the light of
 human suffering and poverty and even climate change
  would wonder  why worry about a few cats 
 well today we 're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character
 this leopard dereck joubert well our lives have basically been like
 a super long episode of csi something like twenty eight years in essence what we 've done is we 've studied the science we 've looked
  the behavior we 've seen over two thousand kills by these amazing animals  
 but one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality that individual personality that these animals have 
 and here 's a prime example we found this leopard in a 
  baobab tree in africa 
  the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother  and she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us
 her own daughter  eight days old  
 and the minute we found this leopard we realized that we needed to move in and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four and a half years
 following her every day getting to know her  that individual personality
  of hers and really coming to know her now i 'm destined
 to spend a lot of time with some unique very very special individualistic
 and often seductive female characters 
 beverly 's clearly one of them  and
 this little leopard legadema is another and she changed our lives bj well we certainly did spend a lot of time with
  in fact more time than even her mother did when her mother would go off hunting  we would stay and film 
 and early on 
 a lightning bolt hit a tree twenty paces away from us  it was frightening  and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell  and of course we were stunned for a while  but when we managed to get our wits about us  
 we looked at it and said my gosh what 's going to happen with that little cub
  's probably going to forever associate that deafening crash with us 
 well we needn 't have worried she came charging out of the thicket straight towards us  sat next to us  shivering 
 with her back towards dereck and looking out and actually from that day on she 's been comfortable with us  
 so we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name  we called
  her legadema which means light from the sky dj 
 now we 've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals in particular in the cats this particular one is called 
 he who greets with fire and you can just see that about him you know that 's his character  
 but only by getting up close to these animals and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that they have
 but through our investigation we have to seek the wildest places in africa and right now this is in the okavango delta in botswana  
 yes it is swamp we live in the swamp in a tent  but i must tell you every day is exhilarating 
 but also our hearts are in our throats a huge amount of the time  because we 're driving through water
  and searching and filming the iconic cats dj now one of the big things of course everybody knows that cats hate water
  and so this was a real revelation for us and we could only find this by pushing ourselves by going where no sane person should go
 not without some prompting by the way from beverly and just pushing the envelope going out there pushing our
  pushing ourselves but we 've managed to find that these lions are fifteen percent bigger than any others  and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water bj 
 and then of course the challenge is
 knowing when to turn around we don 't always get that right 
 and on this particular day we seriously underestimated the depth  we got deeper and deeper until it was at dereck 's
 well then we hit a deep depression  
 and we seriously submerged the vehicle we actually managed to drown two million dollars ' worth of camera gear
  we drowned our pride i must tell you which was really serious  and we seized the engine dj 
 and of course one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles
  you will notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by beverly the dry top angle by the way 
 but all the places we get stuck in really have great views and it wasn 't a moment and these lions came back towards us and beverly was able to get a great photograph bj 
 but we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage
 twenty years ago  we did a film called eternal enemies where we managed to capture this unusual disturbing behavior across two species lions and hyenas 
 and surprisingly it became a cult film 
 and we can only work that out as
 people were seeing parallels between the thuggish side of nature
  it was amazing because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name eetwidomayloh represents he 's focused on this hyena  and he is going to get it animal
 but that 's i think what this is all about is that these individuals have these personalities and characters 
 but for us to get them not only do we push ourselves  but we live by certain rules of engagement
  which mean we can 't interfere this sort of behavior has been going on for three four five million years  and we can 't step in and say that 's wrong and that 's right 
 but that 's not always easy for us bj so 
 as dereck says we have to work through extremes extreme temperatures  push ourselves at night sleep deprivation is extreme
  on the edge through a large part of the time but for ten years we tried to capture lions and elephants together and never ever managed until this particular night  
 and i have to tell you
 that it was a disturbing night for me i had tears rolling down my cheeks i was shaking with anxiety  but i knew
  to capture something that had never been seen before had never been documented  and i do believe you should stay with us dj the
 amazing thing about these moments and this is probably a highlight of our career is that you never know how it 's going to end
  many people believe in fact that death begins in the eyes not in the heart  not in the lungs
  and that 's when people give up hope
 any life form gives up hope  and you can see the start of it
 here 
 this elephant 
 against overwhelming odds simply gives up hope  
 but by the same token
 you can get your hope back again  
 so just when you think it 's all over something else happens some spark gets into you some sort of will to fight that that iron will that we all have that this elephant has 
 that conservation has that big cats
  everything has that will to survive to fight to push through that mental barrier and to keep going and for us in many ways 
  this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us  a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work 
 now back to the leopard
 were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism her personal character  that maybe we were taking it a little bit far  we were perhaps taking her for granted and maybe she didn 't like that that much 
 this is about couples working together and so i do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories
 beverly and i 
 beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is and i 'm on the other side where my space is 
 these are precious to us  
 these divides bj 
 but when this little cub saw that i had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear  she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate  
 it was phenomenal and we felt grateful that she trusted us to
  but at the same time we were concerned that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else 's car  it might not turn out the same way she might get shot for that 
 so we knew we had to react quickly  and the only way we thought we could without scaring her is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make a hiss and a sound  so dereck turned on the heater
  only way for me to save the marriage because beverly felt she was being replaced you see 
 but really and truly this was how this little leopard was displaying her individual personality  but nothing prepared 
  us for what happened next in our relationship with her when she started hunting bj 
  that she was going to survive  
 but only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother 's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here
 with legadema  and of course the baby baboon was so innocent it didn 't turn and run  
 so what we watched over the next couple of hours
 was very unique it was
 absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety protecting it from the hyena  and
 over the next five hours she took care of it we realized that we actually don 't know everything and that
 nature is so unpredictable we have to be open at all times dj okay so she was a little bit rough
 but in fact  
 what we were seeing here was
 interesting because she is a cub
 wanting to play  but she was also a predator needing to kill  
 and yet conflicted in some way because she was also an emerging mother she had this maternal instinct much like a young girl on her way to
  womanhood  and so this really took us to this new level of understanding that personality bj 
 and of course through the night they lay together they ended up sleeping for hours  but i have to tell you everybody always asks what happened to the baby baboon 
 it did die  and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights
 so at this stage i guess we had very very firm ideas on what conservation meant  
 we had to deal with these individual personalities we had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them  
 and so we with the national geographic formed the big cats initiative to march forward into conservation taking care of the big cats that we loved
 and then had an opportunity to look back over the last fifty years to
  how well we had all collectively been doing  so when beverly and i were born there were four hundred and fifty thousand lions and today there are twenty thousand
  tigers haven 't fared any better
 down to maybe three thousand bj and then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to twelve thousand 
  have plummeted from seven hundred thousand down to a mere fifty thousand now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with legadema which is really over a five year period
 ten thousand leopards were legally shot by safari hunters  
 and that 's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period there 's an immense amount of poaching as well  and so possibly the same amount it 's simply not sustainable  
 we admire them  and we fear them
 yet as man we want to steal their power  
 it used to be the time where only kings
 wore a leopard skin  but now throughout rituals and ceremonies  traditional healers and ministers  
 and of course  looking at this lion paw that has been skinned it eerily reminds me of a human hand
  and that 's ironic because their fate is in our hands dj 
 there 's a burgeoning bone trade south africa just released some lion bones onto the market lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same  and so in a stroke the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers 
 so we have a real problem here 
 no more so than the lions do the male lions so the twenty thousand lion figure that you
  just saw is actually a red herring  because there may be three thousand or four thousand male lions and they all are actually infected with the same disease 
 i call it complacency
 our complacency because there 's a sport there 's an activity going on that we 're all aware of  that we condone  
  and that 's probably because we haven 't seen it like we are today bj 
 and you have to know that when a male lion is killed it completely disrupts
 the whole pride 
 a new male comes into the area and takes over the pride  and of course first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs so we 've estimated that between twenty
  killed when one lion is hanging on a wall somewhere in a far off place dj 
 so what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential they 're essential to the habitat  if they disappear whole ecosystems in africa disappear  
 ecotourism revenue stream into africa so this is not just a concern about lions it 's a concern about
  communities in africa as well  
 if they disappear all of that goes away  
 but what i 'm more concerned about in many ways is that as we  de link ourselves from nature as we de link ourselves spiritually from these animals
 we lose hope  we lose
  that thing within us that keeps us connected to the planet bj 
 so you have to know  looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now 
 it is all about critical awareness  and so what we are doing in february we 're bringing out a film called the last lion 
 and the last lion is exactly what is happening right now that is the situation we 're in the last lions that is if we don 't take action and do something these
  plains will be completely devoid of big cats  and then in turn everything else will disappear  and simply if we can 't protect them we 're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well dj
 and in fact that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by that conservation was all about respect and celebration
 is probably true that 's really what it needs we
  and celebrate each other as a man and a woman as a community and as part of this planet  and we need to continue that 
 and legadema  well we can report in fact that
 we 're grandparents
