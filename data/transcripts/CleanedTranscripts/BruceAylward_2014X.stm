  to give this talk a couple of months ago  we discussed a number of titles with the organizers and a lot of different items were kicked around and were discussed 
 but nobody suggested this one and the reason for that was two months ago
 was escalating exponentially and spreading over wider geographic areas than we had ever seen 
 and the world was terrified concerned and alarmed by this disease in a way we 've not seen in recent history  
 but today i can stand here and i can talk to you about beating ebola
 because of people whom you 've never heard of
  people like peter clement 
 a liberian doctor who 's working in lofa county a place that many of you have never heard of probably in liberia  
 the reason that lofa county is so important
 is because about five months ago  when the epidemic was just starting to escalate lofa county was right at the center the epicenter
  of this epidemic 
 at that time  msf and the treatment center there  they were seeing dozens of patients every single day  and these patients these communities were becoming more and 
  more terrified as time went by with this disease and what it was doing to their families to their communities  to their children to their relatives 
  road from monrovia the capital up to lofa county to try and help bring control to the escalating epidemic there 
 and what peter found when he arrived
 was the terror that i just mentioned to you so he sat down with the local chiefs  and he listened  and what he heard
 was heartbreaking he heard about the devastation
  and the desperation of people affected by this disease  
 he heard the heartbreaking stories about not just the damage that ebola did to people  but what it did to families and what it did to communities 
 and he listened to 
 the local chiefs there and what they told him they said when
 when our children are sick when our children are dying we can 't hold them at a time when we want to be closest to them  
 when our relatives die  we can 't take care of them as our tradition demands we are not allowed to wash the bodies to bury them the way our communities and our rituals demand  
 and for this reason  they were deeply disturbed deeply alarmed and the entire epidemic was unraveling in front of them 
 people were turning on the healthcare workers who had come the heroes who had come to try and help save
  community to help work with the community and they were unable to access them  
 and what happened then was peter explained to the leaders  the leaders listened  they turned the tables  and peter explained what 
  ebola was he explained what the disease was he explained what it did to their communities and he explained that ebola threatened everything that made us human 
  means you can 't hold your children the way you would in this situation you can 't bury your dead the way that you would you have to trust these people in these space suits to do that for you 
 and ladies and gentlemen what happened then was rather extraordinary  the community and the health workers peter they sat down together and they put together a new plan for controlling ebola in lofa county 
 and the reason that this is such an
  important story ladies and gentlemen  is because today 
 this county  which is right at the center of this epidemic you 've been watching you 've been seeing in the newspapers 
 you 've been seeing on the television screens today lofa county is nearly eight weeks without seeing a single case of ebola
  this doesn 't mean that the job is done obviously there 's still a huge risk that there will be additional cases there  but what it does teach us is that ebola can be beaten that 's the key thing 
  even on this scale  even with the rapid kind of growth that we saw in this environment here we now know ebola
  when communities come together with health care workers work together that 's when this disease can be stopped  
 but how did ebola end up in lofa county in the first place 
 well for that we have to go back twelve months to the start of this epidemic  and as many of you know this virus went undetected it evaded
 detection for three or four months when it began that 's because this is not a disease of west africa it 's a disease of central africa half a continent away
  people hadn 't seen the disease before health workers hadn 't seen the disease before they didn 't know what they were dealing with and to make it even more complicated the virus itself was causing 
  a symptom a type of a presentation that wasn 't classical of the disease  so people didn 't even recognize the disease  people who knew ebola 
  belief sometimes these days  once the virus was detected there was a rapid surge in of support msf rapidly set up an
 ebola treatment center as many of you know in the area the world health organization and the partners that it works with deployed
 eventually hundreds of people over the next two months to be able to help
  track the virus  the problem ladies and gentlemen  is by then this virus well known now as ebola  had spread too far it had already outstripped 
 what was one of the largest responses that had been mounted so far to an ebola outbreak 
  the numbers were increasing
 and at this time not only were hundreds of people infected and dying of the disease  but as importantly  the front line responders the people who had gone to try and help
 the health care workers the other responders were also sick and dying by the dozens  
 the presidents of these countries recognized the emergencies they met right
  they agreed on common action and they put together an emergency joint operation center in conakry to try and work together to finish this disease and get it stopped 
 to implement the strategies we talked about  but what happened then was something we had never seen before with ebola  
  and for the first time  we saw in another distant country the virus pop up again  this time it was in nigeria in the teeming metropolis of lagos twenty one million people 
 now the virus was in that environment  
 and as you can anticipate  there was international alarm international concern on a scale that we hadn 't seen in recent years caused by a disease like
  the world health organization immediately called together an expert panel looked at the situation declared an international emergency and in doing so the expectation 
 would be that there would be a huge outpouring of international assistance to help these countries which were in so much trouble and concern at that time  
  a number of countries came to assist many many ngos and others as you know  but at the same time the opposite happened in many places alarm escalated  and very soon 
  these countries found themselves not receiving the support they needed but increasingly isolated 
  only problems obviously for the countries themselves  but also for the response 
 those organizations that were trying to bring people in to try and help them respond to the outbreak they could not get people on airplanes they could not get them into the countries to be able to respond  
 in that situation ladies and gentleman a virus like ebola takes
  and what we saw then was something also we hadn 't seen before  not only did this virus continue in the places where they 'd already become infected but then it started 
  to escalate and we saw the case numbers that you see here something we 'd never seen before on such a scale an exponential increase of ebola cases not just in these countries
  but also spreading further and deeper into these countries  ladies and gentleman this was one of the most concerning international
 emergencies in public health we 've ever seen 
 and what happened in these countries then many of you saw again on the television read about in the newspapers  
 we saw the health system start to collapse under the weight of this epidemic  we saw the schools begin to close  markets no longer started no longer functioned
  the way that they should in these countries  we saw that misinformation and misperceptions started to spread even faster through the communities  which became even more alarmed about 
  the situation they started to recoil from those people that you saw in those space suits as they call them who had come to help them  
  the countries had to declare a state of emergency large populations needed to be quarantined in some areas and then riots broke out it was a very very terrifying situation  
 around the world many people began to ask can we ever stop ebola when it starts to spread like this and they started to ask how well do we really know this virus 
 the reality is we don 't know ebola extremely well it 's a relatively modern disease in terms of what we
  know about it we 've known the disease only for forty years since it first popped up in central africa 
 but despite that we do know many things  we know that this virus probably survives in a type of a bat 
 we know that it probably enters a human population when we come in contact with a wild animal that has been infected with the virus and probably sickened by it 
 then we know that the virus
  spreads from person to person through contaminated body fluids  and as you 've all seen we know the horrific disease that it then causes in humans where we see this 
 disease cause severe fevers diarrhea vomiting and then unfortunately  in seventy percent of the cases or often more death 
  but despite the fact that we 've not known this disease for a particularly long time  and we don 't know everything about it  we do know how to stop this disease  
 there are four things that are critical to stopping ebola  
 first and foremost the communities have got to understand this disease  they 've got to understand how it spreads and how to stop it
  and then we 've got to be able to have systems that can find every single case every contact of those cases and begin to track the transmission chains so that you can stop transmission  
 we have to have treatment centers specialized ebola treatment centers where the workers can be protected as they try to provide support to the people who are infected  so that they might survive the disease  
 and then for those who do die  we have to ensure there is a safe  but at the same time
 dignified burial process so that there is no spread at that time as well  
 so we do know how to stop ebola  and these strategies work ladies and gentlemen  the virus was stopped in nigeria by these four strategies and the people implementing them obviously  it was stopped in senegal where it had spread
  also in the other countries that were affected by this virus in this outbreak  so there 's no question that these strategies actually work  
 the big question ladies and gentlemen  was whether these strategies could work on this scale in this situation with so many countries affected with the kind of 
 exponential growth that you saw that was the big question that we were facing just two or three months ago  
 and we know that answer because of the extraordinary work of an incredible group of ngos of governments  of local leaders of u n agencies and 
  many humanitarian and other organizations that came and joined the fight to try and stop ebola in west africa  
  engagement the case finding contact tracing etc and they turned them on their head there was so much disease they approached it differently what they decided to do 
 was they would first try and slow down this epidemic by rapidly building as many beds as possible in specialized treatment centers so that
  they could prevent the disease from spreading from those were infected they would rapidly build out many many burial teams so that they could safely deal with the dead and with that they would try and slow this outbreak 
 to see if it could actually then be controlled using the classic approach of case finding and contact tracing  
  they could personally coordinate and oversee and champion this surge of international support to try and stop this disease  
 we saw militaries from within those countries and from far beyond coming in to help build ebola treatment centers that could be used to isolate those who were sick we saw 
  the red cross movement working with its partner agencies on the ground there to help train the communities so that they could actually
  safely bury their dead in a dignified manner themselves and we saw the u n agencies the world food program build a tremendous air bridge that could get responders 
  to every single corner of these countries rapidly to be able to implement the strategies that we just talked about what we saw ladies and gentlemen which was probably most impressive was this incredible work by the governments by the leaders in these countries
  communities to try to ensure people understood this disease  understood the extraordinary things they would have to do to try and stop ebola  
 and as a result ladies and gentlemen  we saw something that we did not know only two or three months earlier whether or not it would be possible  what we saw was what you see now in this graph when we took stock on
  was we could bend that curve so to speak change this exponential growth and bring some hope back to the ability to control this outbreak  and for this reason 
 ladies and gentlemen  there 's absolutely no question now that we can catch up with this outbreak in west africa and we can beat ebola  
  on a minute that 's great you can slow it down but can you actually drive it down to zero we already answered that question back at the beginning of this talk when i spoke about lofa county in
 in liberia  we told you the story how lofa county got to a situation where they have not seen ebola for eight weeks but there are similar stories
  the first area where the first case was actually diagnosed we 've seen very very few cases in the last couple of months 
 and here in kenema in sierra leone another area in the epicenter  we have not seen the virus for more than a couple of weeks way too early to declare victory 
 obviously  but evidence ladies and gentlemen not only can the response catch up to the disease  but this disease can be
  driven to zero  the challenge now of course  is doing this on the scale needed right across these three countries and that is a huge challenge 
 because when you 've been at something for this long on this scale  two other big threats come in to join the virus
  the first of those is complacency 
 the risk that as this disease curve starts to bend  the media look elsewhere  the world looks elsewhere  complacency always a risk and the other risk of course is when you 've been working so hard for so long and slept so few hours
 over the past months people are tired people become fatigued  and these new risks start to creep into the response
  ladies and gentlemen i can tell you today i 've just come back from west africa 
 the people of these countries  the leaders of these countries  they are not complacent  they want to drive ebola to zero in their countries and these people yes 
 they 're tired  but they are not fatigued  they have an energy  they have a courage  they have the strength to get this finished what they need ladies and gentlemen at this point is the unwavering support of the international community  to stand with them
  to bolster and bring even more support at this time  to get the job finished because finishing ebola right now means turning the tables on this virus and beginning to hunt it 
 remember  this virus  this whole crisis rather started with one case and is going to finish with one case  
 but it will only finish if those countries have got enough epidemiologists enough health workers
  enough logisticians and enough other people working with them to be able to find every one of those cases 
 track their contacts and make sure that this disease stops once and for all 
 ladies and gentleman ebola can be beaten  now we need you to take this story out to tell it to the people who will listen and educate
  on what it means to beat ebola and more importantly we need you to advocate with the people who can help us bring the resources we need to these countries to beat this 
 disease  there are a lot of people out there who will survive and will thrive  in part because of what you do to help us beat ebola
