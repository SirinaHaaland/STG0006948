  i 've been thinking a lot about the world recently
 and how it 's changed over the last twenty thirty forty years 
 twenty or thirty years ago if a chicken caught a cold and sneezed and died in a remote village in east asia it would have been a tragedy for the chicken and its closest
  relatives but
 i don 't think there was much possibility of us fearing
 a global pandemic and the deaths of millions  
 twenty or thirty years ago  if a bank in north america lent too much money to some people who couldn 't afford to pay it back
 and the bank went bust
 that was bad for the lender and bad for the borrower but we didn 't imagine it would bring the global economic system to its knees for nearly a decade
  this is globalization  
 this is the miracle that has enabled us to transship our bodies and our minds and our words and our pictures and our ideas and our teaching and our learning around the planet
 ever faster
 and ever cheaper 
 it 's brought a lot of bad stuff like the stuff that i just described but it 's also brought a lot of good stuff a lot of us are not aware of the extraordinary successes
  of the millennium development goals  several of which have achieved their targets long before the due date that proves
 that this species of humanity is capable of achieving extraordinary progress if it really acts together and it really tries hard  
 but if i had to put it in a nutshell these days i sort of feel that globalization has taken us by surprise and we 've been slow to respond
 if you look at the downside of globalization it really does seem to be sometimes overwhelming all of the grand challenges that we face today like climate change
 and human rights and demographics and terrorism and pandemics
 and narco trafficking and human slavery and species loss i could go
  not making an awful lot of progress against an awful lot of those challenges so in a nutshell that 's the challenge that we all face today at this interesting point in history
 that 's clearly what we 've got to do next we 've somehow got to get our act together
 and we 've got to figure out how to globalize the solutions better so that we don 't simply become a species which is the victim of the globalization
  why are we so slow at achieving these advances what 's the reason for it 
 well  there are of course a number of reasons but perhaps the primary reason is because we 're still organized
 as a species in the same way that we were organized two hundred or three hundred years ago there
 's one superpower left on the planet and that is the seven billion people the seven billion of us who cause all these problems the same seven billion by the way who will resolve them all
 but how are those seven billion organized they 're still organized in two hundred or so 
 and the nations have governments
 that make rules
 and cause us to behave in certain ways  
 and that 's a pretty efficient system  but the problem is that the way that those laws are made and the way those governments think
 is absolutely wrong for the solution of global problems because it all looks
  inwards  
 the politicians that we elect and the politicians we don 't elect on the whole have minds that microscope  they don 't have minds that telescope  
 they look in 
 they pretend  they behave as if they believed that every country was an island
 that existed quite happily independently of all the others on its own little planet in its own little solar system
  this is the problem 
 countries competing against each other countries fighting against each other this week as any week you care to look at you 'll find people actually trying to kill each other from country to country  but even 
  when that 's not going on there 's competition between countries  each one trying to shaft the next  
  we clearly need to find ways of encouraging countries to start working together a little bit better and why won 't they do that 
 why is it that our leaders still persist in looking inwards  
 well  the first and most obvious reason is because that 's what we ask them to do that 's what we tell them to do  
 when we elect governments or when we tolerate unelected governments 
 we 're effectively telling them that what we want is for them to deliver us in our country a certain number of things
  want them to deliver prosperity  growth  competitiveness  
 transparency  justice and all of those things 
 so unless we start asking our governments to think outside a little bit to consider the global problems that will finish us all if we don 't start considering them 
 then we can hardly blame them if what they carry on doing is looking inwards  if they still have minds that microscope
 rather than minds that telescope that 's the first reason why things tend not to change the second reason is that
 these governments just like all the rest of us are cultural psychopaths  
 i don 't mean to be rude but you know what a psychopath is a psychopath is a person who unfortunately for him or her  lacks the ability to really empathize with other human beings 
 when they look around  they don 't see other human
  beings with deep rich three dimensional personal lives and aims and ambitions what they see is
 cardboard cutouts and it 's very sad and it 's very lonely  and it 's very rare  fortunately  
 but actually aren 't most of us
 not really so very good at empathy oh sure we 're very good at empathy when it 's a question of dealing with people who kind of look like us and kind of walk and talk and eat and pray
  and wear like us  but when it comes to people who don 't do that who don 't quite dress like us and don 't quite pray like us and don 't quite talk like us 
 do we not also have a tendency to see them ever so slightly as cardboard cutouts too  
 and this is a question we need to ask ourselves i think constantly we have to monitor it are we and our politicians to a degree cultural psychopaths  
 the third reason is
  worth mentioning because it 's so silly  but there 's a belief amongst governments that the domestic agenda and the international agenda are incompatible and always will be  
 this is just nonsense in
 my day job i 'm a policy adviser i 've spent the last fifteen years or so advising governments around the world and in all of that time i have never once seen a single domestic policy issue that could not be more
  imaginatively effectively and rapidly resolved
 than by treating it as an international problem looking at the international context  comparing what others have done  bringing in others working externally
 instead of working internally  
 and so you may say well  given all of that why then doesn 't it work why can we not make our politicians change why can 't we demand them
  well i like a lot of us spend a lot of time complaining about how hard it is to make people change and i don 't think we should fuss about it  i think we should just accept that we are an inherently conservative species we don 't like to change 
 it exists for very sensible evolutionary reasons  we probably wouldn 't still be here today if we weren 't so resistant to change it 's very simple many thousands of years ago we discovered
  that if we carried on doing the same things we wouldn 't die  
 because the things that we 've done before by definition didn 't kill us and therefore as long as we carry on doing them we 'll be okay  and it 's very sensible not to do anything new because it might kill you 
 but of course  there are exceptions to that otherwise we 'd never get anywhere  
 and one of the exceptions the interesting exception is when you can show to people that there might be some
  making that leap of faith
 and changing a little bit 
 so i 've spent a lot of the last ten or fifteen years trying to find out what could be that self interest that would encourage not just politicians but also businesses and general populations 
 all of us to start to think a little more outwardly to think in a bigger picture not always to look
  sometimes to look outwards  and this is where i discovered something quite important 
  two thousand and five i launched a study called the nation brands index 
 what it is it 's a very large scale study that polls a very large sample of the world 's population a sample that represents about seventy percent
 of the planet 's population  and i started asking them a series of questions about how they perceive other countries 
 and the nation brands index over the
  years has grown to be a very very large database it 's about two hundred billion data points tracking what ordinary people think about other countries and why 
 why did i do this well because the governments that i advise are very very keen on knowing how they are regarded 
 they 've known  partly because i 've encouraged them to realize it that countries depend enormously on their reputations in order to survive and prosper in the world
  if a country has a great positive image like germany has or sweden or switzerland everything is easy and everything is cheap you get more tourists you get more investors you sell your products more expensively 
 if on the other hand you have a country with a very weak or a very negative image  everything is difficult and everything is expensive so governments care desperately about the image of their country because it makes a direct difference to how much money they can make and that 's what they
  've promised their populations they 're going to deliver 
 so a couple of years ago i thought i would take some time out and speak to that gigantic database and ask it  
 why do some people prefer one country more than another and the answer that the database gave me completely staggered me it
 was six point eight i haven
 't got time to explain in detail  basically what it told me was
 the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries 
 we don 't admire countries primarily because they 're rich because they 're powerful because they 're successful  because they 're modern because they 're technologically
 technologically advanced we primarily admire countries that are good  what do we mean by good
  we mean countries that seem to contribute something to the world in which we live 
 countries that actually make the world safer or better or richer or fairer 
 those are the countries we like this is a discovery of significant importance you see where i 'm going because it squares the circle i can now say and often do to any government in order to do well you need to do good  
 if you want to sell more products if you want to get more
  if you want to become more competitive 
 then you need to start behaving because that 's why people will respect you and do business with you 
 and therefore  the more you collaborate  the more competitive you become  
 this is quite an important discovery and as soon as i discovered this i felt another index coming on  i swear that as i get older my ideas become simpler and more and more childish this one is called the good
  it does exactly what it says on the tin it measures or at least it tries to measure exactly how much each country on earth contributes not to its own population but to the rest of humanity bizarrely  nobody had ever thought of measuring this before 
 so my colleague dr robert govers and i have spent the best part of the last two years with the help of a large number of very serious and clever people
  cramming together all the reliable data in the world we could find about what countries
  give to the world and you 're waiting for me to tell you which one comes top and i 'm going to tell you  but first of all i want to tell you precisely
 what i mean
 when i say a good country  i do not mean morally good  
 when i say that country x is the goodest country on earth  and i mean goodest i don 't mean best best is something different  when you 're talking about a good country you can be good  gooder and
  it 's not the same thing as good better and best  this is a country which simply gives more to humanity than
 any any other country  i don 't talk about how they behave at home because that 's measured elsewhere and the winner is
 ireland 
 according to the data here  no country on
  earth  per head of population  per dollar of gdp 
 contributes more to the world that we live in than ireland what does this mean this means that as we go to sleep at night all of us in the last fifteen seconds before we drift off to sleep our final thought should be
 godammit i 'm glad that ireland exists
  in the depths of a very severe economic recession i think that there 's a really important lesson there that if you can remember your international obligations whilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy  that 's really something 
 finland ranks pretty much the same the only reason why it 's below ireland is because its lowest score is lower than ireland 's lowest score 
  of course they 're all apart from new zealand  western european nations they 're also all rich  this depressed me 
 because one of the things that i did not want to discover with this index is that it 's purely the province of rich countries to help poor countries this is not what it 's all about 
 and indeed if you look further down the list i don 't have the slide here you will see something that made me very happy indeed  that kenya is in the top thirty  
 and that demonstrates one very very important thing this is not about money this is
  about attitude  
 this is about culture  
 this is about a government and a people that care about the rest of the world and have the imagination and the courage to think outwards instead of only thinking selfishly  
 i 'm going to whip through the other slides
 just so you can see some of the lower lying countries there 's germany at 13th the u s comes
  and then we have some of the big developing countries like russia at 95th china at 107th 
 countries like china and russia and india which is down in the same part of the index  
 well  in some ways it 's not surprising they 've spent a great deal of time over the last decades building their own economy  building their own society and their own polity  
 but it is to be hoped that the second phase of their growth
  than the first phase has been so far  
 and then you can break down each country in terms of the actual datasets that build into it i 'll allow you to do that from midnight tonight it 's going to be on goodcountry org and you can look at the country you can look right down to the level of the individual datasets  
 now that 's the good country index what 's it there for well  it 's there really because i want to try to
  or reintroduce this word  into the discourse
  i 've had enough hearing about competitive countries i 've had enough hearing about prosperous  wealthy fast growing countries  
 i 've even had enough hearing about happy countries
 because in the end that 's still selfish  that 's still about us and if we carry on thinking about us we are in deep deep trouble  
 i think we all know what it is that we want to hear about we want to hear about good countries
 and so i want to ask you all a favor  
 i 'm not asking a lot it
 's something that you might find easy to do and you might even find enjoyable and even helpful to do 
 and that 's simply to start using the word good in this context  
 when you think about your own country  when you think about other people 's countries  when you think about companies  when you talk about the world that we live in today start using that word
 in the
 in the way that i 've talked about this evening not good the opposite of bad because that 's an argument that never finishes good  the opposite of selfish 
 good being a country that thinks about all of us 
 that 's what i would like you to do and i 'd like you to use it as a stick with which to beat your politicians 
 when you elect them  when you reelect them when you vote for them when you listen to what they 're offering you
  that word good and ask yourself is that what a good country would do and if the answer is no be very suspicious 
 ask yourself is that the behavior of my country do i want to come from a country where the government in my name is doing things like that 
 or do i on the other hand prefer the
 idea of walking around the world with my head held high thinking yeah  i 'm proud to come from a good country and everybody will welcome you 
 and everybody in the last fifteen seconds before they drift off to sleep at night will say gosh  i 'm glad that person 's country exists ultimately that i think is what will make the change 
 that word good and the number six point eight
 and the discovery that 's behind it have
  i think they can change your life  and i think we can use it to change the way that our politicians and our companies behave and in doing so we can change the world 
 i 've started thinking very differently about my own country since i 've been thinking about these things 
 i used to think that i wanted to live in a rich country and then i started thinking i wanted to live in a happy country but i began to realize it 's not enough i don 't want to live in a rich country  i
  i want to live in a good country  and i so so hope that you do too  thank you
