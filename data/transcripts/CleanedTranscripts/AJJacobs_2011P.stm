  last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation  hopefully for a good cause which is
 and i 've done this in three parts  so first
  i decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire encyclopedia britannica from a to z or more precisely from a ak to 
 zywiec and here 's a little image of that and this was an amazing year it was really a fascinating journey
 so it had its downsides  but
 after that i decided to work on the spirit as i mentioned last year i grew up with no religion at all 
 i 'm jewish but i 'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian not
 really but i decided to learn about the bible and my heritage
  by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it  so i decided to follow all the rules of the bible and
 from the ten commandments to growing my beard because leviticus says you cannot shave so this is what i looked like by the end
 thank you for that reaction 
  i got both of them  so there was the the topiary there and
 there 's the sheep now
 the final part of the trilogy was i wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person i could be the healthiest person alive so that 's what i 've been doing the last couple of years  and i just finished a couple
  and i have to say thank god because living so healthily was killing me 
 it was so overwhelming because the amount of things you have to do it 's just
 mind boggling i was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers and they were telling me
 all the things i had to do  i had to eat right 
  because that lowers the blood pressure  i wrote the book on a treadmill and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book  i had to put on sunscreen this 
  was no small feat because if you listen to dermatologists they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen  and you have to reapply it every two to four hours so i think half of my 
  book advance went into sunscreen  i was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year
  there was the washing of hands i had to do that properly  and my immunologist told me that i should also wipe down all of the remote controls and 
 iphones in my house because those are just orgies of germs  so that took a lot of time  
  because that 's a part of health
 i was inspired by the danish safety council they started a public campaign that says 
 a walking helmet is a good helmet so they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking but also for walking around  
 and
 you can see there they 're shopping with their helmets laughter
  i tried that 
 now it 's a little extreme i admit but if you think about this this is actually the freakonomics authors wrote about this that more 
  people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving  so
 my cholesterol went down i lost weight my wife stopped telling me that i looked pregnant  so that was nice  and
 it was successful overall but i also learned that i was too healthy and that was unhealthy  i was so focused on doing all these things that i was neglecting my friends and family and as dan buettner can tell you
  having a strong social network is so crucial to our health  so i finished  and i
 i kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over i went to the dark side
 and i just indulged myself it was like something out of caligula without the sex part because
 i have three young kids so that wasn 't happening
  definitely  and i finally
 have stabilized so now i 'm back to adopting many not all i don 't wear a helmet anymore but
 dozens of healthy behaviors that i adopted during
  of course don 't have time to go into all of them let me just tell you two really quickly 
 the first is and this was surprising to me i didn 't expect this to come out but i live a much quieter life now 
 because we live in such a noisy world
 there 's trains and planes and cars and bill o
  health hazard not just because it harms our hearing  which it obviously does but it actually
 initiates the fight or flight response a loud noise will get your
  fight or flight response going and this  over the years can cause real damage
  cardiovascular damage the world health organization just did a big study that they published this year  
 and  it was done in europe and they estimated that one point six million years of healthy living are lost
 every year in europe
 because of noise pollution  so they think it 's actually very deadly
  impairs cognition and our founding fathers knew about this  when they wrote the constitution they put
 dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate so
 without noise reduction technology our country would not exist so as a patriot
  i felt it was important to i wear all the earplugs and the earphones and it 's really improved my life in
 in a surprising and unexpected way and the second point i want to make the final point is
 that 
 and it 's actually been a theme of tedmed that
 that joy is so important to your health that
  there 's some sense of pleasure and joy in them  and just to give you one instance of this food 
 the
 junk food industry is really great at at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what 's the most pleasurable
 but i think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food to give just one example we
  love crunchiness  mouthfeel  so
 i basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes throw in some sunflower seeds  
 and you can almost trick yourself into thinking you 're eating doritos and
 it has made me a healthier person  so that is it the book about it comes out in april it 's called drop dead healthy and i hope that i don 't get sick during the book tour that 's my greatest hope so thank you very much
