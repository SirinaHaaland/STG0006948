  i wrote a letter
 last week talking about the work of the foundation  sharing some of the problems 
 and warren buffet had recommended i do that being honest about what was going well what wasn 't and making it kind of an annual thing
  a goal i had there was to draw more people in
 to work on those problems because i think there are some very important problems that don 't get worked on naturally that is the market does not drive
 the scientists the communicators the thinkers the governments
 to do the right things and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care
 and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to 
 so this morning i 'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand  
 but before i dive into those i i want to admit that i am an optimist any tough problem i think it it can be solved  
 and part of the reason i i feel that way is looking at the past over the
  average lifespan has more than doubled  
 another statistic  perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths 
 as recently as one thousand nine hundred and sixty  
 one hundred and and ten million children were born  and twenty million of those died before the age of five 
 five years ago  one hundred
  million children were born so more and less than ten million of them died before the age of five 
 so that 's a factor of two reduction
 of the childhood death rate it 's a phenomenal thing each one of those lives matters a lot  
 and the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs  vaccines that were used more widely  for example measles was four
  million of the deaths
 back as recently as one thousand nine hundred and ninety and now is under four hundred thousand  so we really can make changes the next breakthrough
 is to cut that ten million in half again  and i think that 's doable in
 well under twenty years  why well there 's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths
 diarrhea  pneumonia
 and malaria  so that brings us to the the first problem
 that i 'll raise this morning which is how do we stop a deadly disease that 's spread by mosquitos well 
 what 's the history of this disease it 's been a severe disease for thousands of years in fact if we look at the genetic code
  only disease we can see that people who lived in africa actually evolved several things
 to avoid malarial deaths deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 
 so it was absolutely gigantic  and the disease was all over the world
  terrible disease it was in the united states it was in europe people didn 't know what caused it until
 the early 1900s when a british military man figured out that it was mosquitos  so it was everywhere
  and
 two tools helped bring the death rate down one was killing the mosquitos with ddt the other was treating the patients
 with quinine or quinine derivatives  
 and so that 's why the death rate did come down  now ironically what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones which is where the rich countries are so we can see one thousand nine hundred it 's everywhere one thousand nine
 hundred and forty five it 's still most places one thousand nine
 hundred and seventy the u s and most of europe have gotten rid of it one thousand nine hundred and ninety you 've gotten most of the northern areas and more recently you can see it 's just around the equator
  and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease
 is only in the poorer countries it doesn 't get much investment for example there 's more money
 put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria now baldness it 's a terrible thing
  are afflicted  and so that 's why that priority
 has been set  
 but malaria even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact 
 over two hundred million people at any one time are suffering from it it
 means that you can 't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so
  much now malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos  i brought some here just so you could
 experience this we 'll let those roam around the
 auditorium a little bit there 's no reason only poor people should have
  come up with a few new things 
 we 've got bed nets  and bed nets are a great tool what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night
 so the mosquitos that bite late at night
 can 't get at them and when you use indoor spraying
  with ddt and those nets you can cut deaths by over fifty percent  and that 's happened now in a number of countries  
 it 's great to see but we have to be careful because malaria the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves so every tool that we 've ever had in the past
 has eventually become ineffective  and so you end up with two
  choices  if you go into a country with the right tools and the right way you do it vigorously  you can actually get a local eradication  and that 's where we saw the malaria map shrinking  
 or if you go in kind of 
 for a period of time you 'll reduce the disease burden  
 but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again
  and the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn 't pay attention now we 're on the upswing  
 bed net funding is up 
 there 's new drug discovery going on our foundation has backed a vaccine that 's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months  
 and that should save over two thirds of the lives
  're going to have these new tools but that alone doesn 't give us the road map 
 because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things it involves communicators to keep
 the funding high to keep the visibility high to tell the success stories  it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just seventy percent of the people to use the bed nets  but ninety
  we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to do monte carlo things to understand how these tools combine
 and work together of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise 
 we need rich world governments to be very generous in in providing aid for these things and so as these elements come together i 'm
 quite optimistic that we will be able
  now let me turn
 to a second question a fairly different question  but i 'd say equally important  
 and this is how do you make a teacher great it seems like the kind of question that
 people would spend a lot of time on and we 'd understand very well  and the answer is really that we don 't 
 let 's start with why this is important  well all of us here
 'll bet had some great teachers  we all had a wonderful education that 's part of the reason we 're here today part of the reason we 're successful 
 i can say that even though i 'm a college drop out i had great teachers
 in fact in the united states  the teaching system has worked fairly well there are fairly effective teachers
 in a narrow
  set of places so the top twenty percent of students have gotten a good education and those top twenty percent
 have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top twenty percent  and they 've gone on to create the revolutions in software and and biotechnology and keep the u s at the forefront 
  strength for those top twenty percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning
 is the education that the balance of people are getting 
 not only has that been weak it 's getting weaker  and if you look at the economy 
 it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education  
 and we have to change this we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity
  have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are are driven by advanced education like
 science and mathematics  
 when i first learned the statistics i was pretty stunned at how bad things are over thirty percent of kids never finish high school  
 and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in
  senior year
 and and compared it to the number who finished senior year because they weren 't tracking where the kids were before that but most of the dropouts had taken place before that they had to raise
 the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over thirty percent for minority kids  it 's over fifty percent  
 and even if you graduate
 from high school
 if you 
 you have less than a twenty five percent chance of ever completing a college degree  
 if you 're low income in the united states  you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four year degree  
 and that doesn 't seem entirely fair so how do you make education better
  for the last nine years has invested in this there 's many people working on it  we 've worked on small schools  we 've funded scholarships we 've done things in libraries 
 a lot of these things had a good effect  but the more we looked at it the more we realized
 that having great teachers was the very key thing  and we hooked up with some people studying
 how much variation is there between teachers
  between say the top quartile the very best and the bottom quartile 
 how much variation is there within a school or between schools and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable 
 a top quartile teacher
 will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over ten percent in a single year  what does that mean
  that means that if the entire u s for two years had top quartile teachers 
 the entire difference between us and asia would go away
 within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away  
 so it 's simple all you need are those top quartile teachers 
  should retain those people we should find out what they 're doing and transfer that skill to other people but i can tell you that absolutely
 is not happening today  
 what are the characteristics of this top quartile what do they they look like you might think these must be very senior teachers  
 and the answer is no once somebody has taught for three years
  their teaching quality does not change thereafter  the variation is very very small
 you might think these are people with master 's degrees they 've gone back and they 've gotten their master 's of education 
 this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality that bottom thing  which says there 's no effect at all is a master 's degree
 now  the way the pay system works
 is there 's two things that are rewarded one is seniority  because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension the second is
 giving extra money to people who get their master 's degree  but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher teach for america
  for math teachers majoring in math there 's a a measurable effect but overwhelmingly  
 it 's your past performance there are some people who are very good at this  and we 've done almost nothing
 to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it
 to stay in the system  you might say do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher 's leave
 the answer is on average the slightly better teachers leave the system  and it 's a system with
 very high turnover  now there are a few places very few where great teachers are being made a
 good example of one is a set of charter schools called kipp kipp means knowledge is power  it 's an unbelievable thing they have
 sixty six schools mostly middle schools some high schools
 and
 what goes on is great teaching they take the poorest kids 
 and over ninety six percent of their high school graduates go to four year colleges  
 and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different
  they 're team teaching they 're constantly improving their teachers they 're taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher hey you caused this amount of increase 
 they 're deeply engaged in making teaching better  
 when you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms at first it 's very bizarre  i sat down and i thought what is going on the teacher was running around and the energy energy
  the sports rally or something what 's going on 
 and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren 't paying attention which kids were bored and calling kids rapidly putting things up on the board 
 it was a very dynamic environment  because particularly in those middle school years fifth through eighth grade
 keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention
  nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who
 who doesn 't want to be there everybody needs to be involved and so kipp is doing it 
 how does that compare to a normal school well 
 in a normal school teachers aren 't told how good they are the data isn 't gathered
  in the teacher 's contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom sometimes to once per year and they
  need advanced notice to do that so imagine running a factory where you 've got these workers some of them just making
 crap
 and the management is told hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually fool you and try and do a good job in that one
 brief moment even a teacher who wants to improve doesn 't have the tools to do it they don 't have the test scores
  and there 's a whole thing of of trying to block the data for example new york passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data
 could not be made available and used in the tenure decision
 for the teachers  
 and so that 's sort of working in the the opposite direction  but i 'm optimistic about this i think there are some clear things
 we can do
  first of all there 's a lot more testing going on  and that 's given us the picture of where we are  
 and that allows us to understand who 's doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques are 
 of course digital video is cheap now putting a few cameras in the classroom
 and saying that things are are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all
  public schools and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say ok here 's a little clip of something i thought i did well 
 here 's a little clip of something i think i did poorly  advise me when this kid acted up how should i have dealt with that and they could all sit and work together
 on those problems  you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff
 you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics
 course learn from that if you have a kid who 's behind  you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept  
 and in fact these free courses could not only be available just on the internet  but you could make it so that dvds were
  and so anybody who has access to a dvd player can have the very best teachers  
 and so by thinking of this as a a personnel system  we can do it much better  
 now there 's a book actually about kipp the the place that this is going on
 that jay matthews a news reporter wrote called work hard be nice and i thought it was so fantastic it gave you a sense
 of what a good teacher does i 'm going
  send everyone here a free copy of this book 
 now we put a lot of money into education  
 and
 i really think that education is the most important thing to get right
 for the country to have as strong a future as it should have in fact we have in the stimulus bill it 's interesting the house version
  actually had money in it for these data systems and it was taken out in the senate because there are people who are threatened by these things but i i 'm optimistic i think
 people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can make a difference
 for millions of lives if we get it right i only had time to frame those two problems  there 's a lot more problems like that
 aids  pneumonia
 i can just see you 're getting excited just at the the very name of these things and the skill sets required
 to tackle these things are very broad you know the system doesn 't naturally make it happen  governments don 't naturally
 pick these things in the right way the private sector doesn 't naturally put its its resources into these things  so it 's going
  to take brilliant people like you to study these things get other people involved
 and you 're helping to come up with solutions  and with that i think there 's some great things that will come out of it
