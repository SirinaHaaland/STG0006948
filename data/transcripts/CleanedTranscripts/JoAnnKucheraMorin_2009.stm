  the allosphere it 's a three story metal sphere in an echo free chamber  think of the allosphere as a large dynamically varying digital microscope
 that 's connected to a supercomputer  twenty researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere and be completely immersed in
  their data  imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin  
 imagine
 if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material  imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain
  as though it was a world  and see tissues as landscapes and hear blood density levels as music this is some of the research that you 're going to see that we 're undertaking at the allosphere 
 but first a little bit about this group of artists scientists and engineers that are working together i 'm a composer 
  the inventor of the allosphere with my visual artist colleagues we map complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space visually and sonically  
 our scientist colleagues are finding new
  patterns in the information and our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest
 dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration 
 i 'm going to fly you into five research projects in the allosphere that are going to take you from biological macroscopic data all the way down to electron spin  
 this first project is called the allobrain and it 's our attempt to quantify
  beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful you 're flying through the cortex of my colleague 's brain 
 our narrative here is real fmri data that 's mapped visually and sonically the brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with you see twelve 
 intelligent computer agents the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you
  mining blood density levels  and they 're reporting them back to you sonically  higher density levels mean more activity in that point of the brain they 're actually singing these densities to you with higher pitches mapped to higher densities  
 we 're now going to move from real biological data to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature in our next
 artistic and scientific installation
  in this artistic and scientific installation  biogenerative algorithms are helping us to
 understand self generation and growth very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences for artists  we 're making new worlds that we can uncover 
  and explore these generative algorithms grow over time and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects  our researchers are interacting with this data by
  injecting bacterial code which are computer programs that allow these creatures to grow over time we 're
 going to move now from the biological and the macroscopic world down into the atomic world as we fly into a lattice of atoms  this is 
  real afm atomic force microscope data from my colleagues in the solid state lighting and energy center they 've discovered a new bond a new material
  for transparent solar cells  we 're flying through two thousand lattice of atoms oxygen  hydrogen and zinc you view the bond in the triangle 
 it 's four blue zinc atoms bonding with one white hydrogen atom you see the electron flow with the streamlines we as artists have generated for the scientists  this is
  allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms  we think it makes a beautiful structural art the sound that you 're hearing are the actual emission spectrums of these atoms 
  we 've mapped them into the audio domain so they 're singing to you oxygen  hydrogen and zinc have their own signature we
 single hydrogen atom  we 're working with our physicist colleagues that have given us the mathematical calculations of the
 equation in time
  what you 're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom you 're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines 
 the white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular
 in a minute we 're going to move to a two orbital configuration  and you 're going to notice a pulsing  and you 're going to hear an undulation between the sound this is actually 
  a light emitter  as the sound starts to pulse and contract our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted they 're starting to find new mathematical
  in these calculations and they 're understanding more about quantum mathematics we
 're going to move even further down 
 and go to one single electron spin this will be the final project that i show you  
 our colleagues in the center for quantum computation and spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers decoherence in a single electron spin
  we 've taken this information and we 've made a mathematical model out of it you 're actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow this is very important for the next step in simulating quantum computers and information technology
