  i have a friend in portugal whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle and a washing machine so he could transport his family 
 he did it because he couldn 't afford a car  but also because he knew how to build
  a time when we understood how things worked and how they were made so we could build and repair them or at the very least make informed decisions about what to buy 
 many of these do it yourself practices were lost in the second half of the 20th century  
 but now the maker community and  the open source model are bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work and what they 're made of
 back into our lives and i believe we need to take them
  to the next level to the components things are made of 
 for the most part we still know what traditional materials like paper and textiles are made of and how they are produced  
 but now we have these amazing  futuristic composites plastics that change shape  paints that conduct electricity pigments that change color fabrics that light up
  me show you some examples
 so conductive ink allows us to paint circuits instead of using the traditional
 printed circuit boards or wires in the case of this little example i 'm holding we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin by turning on this little light 
 conductive ink has
  been used by artists  but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able to use it in laser printers and pens  
 and this is a sheet of acrylic infused with colorless light diffusing particles what this means is that while regular acrylic only diffuses light around 
  the edges this one illuminates across the entire surface when i turn on the lights around it
 two of the known applications for this material include interior design and multi touch systems  
 and thermochromic pigments change color at a given temperature  
 so i 'm going to place this on a hot plate that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient
 and you can see what happens
  one of the principle applications for this material is amongst other things in baby bottles  so it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink  
 so these are just a few of what are commonly known as smart materials in a few years they will be in many of the objects and technologies we use on a daily basis 
 we may not yet have the flying cars science
  fiction promised us 
 but we can have walls that change color depending on temperature  keyboards that roll up and windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch  
 so i 'm a social scientist by training so why am i here today talking about smart materials  
 well first of all because i am a maker i 'm curious about how things work and how they are made
  but also because i believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world  
 and right now we don 't know enough about these high tech composites our future will be made of 
 smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities  there 's barely any information available on how to use them  
 and very little is said about how they are produced  so for now they exist
 mostly in this realm of
 trade secrets and patents only universities and corporations have access to 
 so a little over three years ago kirsty boyle and i started a project we called open materials 
 it 's a website where we and anyone else who wants to join us share experiments
  publish information encourage others to contribute whenever they can 
 and aggregate resources such as research papers and tutorials by other makers like ourselves 
 we would like it to become a large collectively generated database of do it yourself information on smart materials  
 but why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of first of all because we can 't shape
  shape what we don 't understand and what we don 't understand and use ends up shaping us 
 the objects we use the clothes we wear the houses we live in all have a profound impact on our behavior health and quality of life  
 so if we are to live in a world made of smart materials we should know and understand them  
 secondly and just as important
 innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers  so many times amateurs not experts have been the inventors and improvers of things 
  ranging from mountain bikes to semiconductors  personal computers airplanes 
  always the case  two scientists at university of illinois understood this when they published a paper on a simpler method for making conductive ink 
 jordan bunker  who had had no experience with chemistry until then  read this paper and reproduced the experiment at his maker space using
  and tools he used a toaster oven  and he even made his own vortex mixer based on a tutorial by another scientist  maker 
 jordan then published his results online  including all the things he had tried and didn 't work  so others could study and reproduce it  
 so jordan 's main form of innovation was to take an experiment created in a well equipped lab at the university
  and recreate it in a garage in chicago using only cheap materials and tools he made himself 
 and now that he published this work  others can pick up where he left and devise even simpler processes and improvements  
 another example i 'd like to mention is hannah
 qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder 
 electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work  
 but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn  
 so hannah 's approach on the other hand is to formulate a series of techniques for creating unusual objects
  objects that free us from pre designed constraints by teaching us about the materials themselves  
 so amongst hannah 's many impressive experiments this is one of my favorites [ paper speakers ]
 what we 're seeing here is just a piece of paper with some copper tape on
  so based on the research by marcelo coelho from mit hannah created a series of paper speakers out of a wide range of materials from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink 
 just like jordan and so
  many other makers hannah published her recipes and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them  
 but paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics  
 so hannah 's artisanal work and the fact that she shared her findings opens the doors to a series of new
  possibilities that are both
 aesthetically appealing and innovative  
 so the interesting thing about makers is that we create out of passion and curiosity  and we are not afraid to fail 
 we often tackle problems from unconventional angles and in the process end up discovering alternatives or even better ways to do things  
 so the more people
  experiment with materials the more researchers are willing to share their research
 and manufacturers their knowledge the better chances we have to create technologies that truly serve us all  
 so i feel a bit as ted nelson must have when in the early
 large mainframes only scientists cared about and no one dreamed of even having one at home  
 so it 's a little strange that i 'm standing here and saying you must understand smart materials now 
 just keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge about emerging technologies is the best way to ensure that we have a say in the making of our future  
 thank you
