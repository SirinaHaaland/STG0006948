  faith is not very well thought of as being one that
  that is grounded in compassion the truth of the matter is otherwise our holy book the koran
 consists of one hundred and fourteen chapters
 and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala the saying in the name of god
 the all compassionate the all merciful
 or as sir richard burton not the richard burton who was married to elizabeth taylor but the sir richard burton who lived a century before that and who was a world wide
  traveler and translator of many works of literature
 translates it as in the name of god the the compassionating the compassionate
 and in a saying of the koran which to muslims is god speaking to humanity
 god says to his prophet muhammad whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets beginning
  with adam including noah including moses including abraham including jesus christ and ending with muhammad
 said that we have not sent you oh muhammad except as a raham except as a source of compassion to humanity
 and for us human beings and certainly for us as muslims
 whose mission and whose purpose
 in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet
 and the prophet in one of his sayings said adorn yourselves with the attributes of god
 and because god himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion
 in fact
  the koran says that god decreed upon himself compassion or reigned himself in by compassion
 therefore our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion
 activators of compassion
 actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion that is all well and
  do we go wrong and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world
 for the answer to this we turn to our spiritual path
 in every religious tradition there is what you call the outer path and the inner path
 or the exoteric path and the esoteric path
 the esoteric path of islam is more popularly
  known as sufism or tasawwuf in arabic
 and these doctors or these masters these spiritual masters of the sufi tradition
 refer to teachings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lie
 in one of the battles that the prophet waged he told his
 followers we are returning from the lesser war to the greater war to the greater battle
 and they said messenger of god we are battle weary
 how can we go to a greater battle he said that is the battle of the self
 the battle of the ego
 the sources of human problems
 have to do with egotism i
 the famous sufi master rumi who is very well known to most of you has a story
 in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend
 and knocks on the door
 and a voice answers who 's there
 it 's me or more grammatically correctly it is i as we might say in english
 the voice says go away
 after many years of training of disciplining of
 of search and struggle he comes back and with much greater humility he knocks again on the door
  the voice asks who is there he said it is you oh heartbreaker
 the door swings open
 and the voice says come in for there is no room in this house for two is
 two capital i not not these eyes
 for two egos
 and rumi 's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path
 in the presence of god there is no room for more than one i
 and that is the i of divinity
 in a teaching called a hadith qudsi in our tradition god says that my servant or my creature my human
  creature does not approach me
 by anything that is dearer to me than what i have asked them to do
 and those of you who are employers know exactly what i mean you want your employees your employees to do what you ask them to do
 and if they 've done that then they can do extra but don 't ignore what you 've asked them to do
 and
  god says my servant continues to get nearer to me by doing more of what i 've asked them to do extra credit we might call it
 until i love him or love her
 and when i love my servant god says i become the eyes by which he
 or she sees
 the ears by which he
  or she listens
 the hand by which he or she grasps and the foot
 by which he or she walks and the heart by which he or she understands
 it is this merging
 of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose
  of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions
 muslims regard jesus as the master of sufism
 the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path
 when he says i am the spirit and i am the way
 when the prophet muhammad said whoever has
  seen me has seen god
 it is because they became so much an instrument
 of god they became part of god 's steam
 so that god 's will was manifest through them and not acting from their own self and their own ego
 compassion on earth is given it is in us all we have
  to do is to get our egos out of the way get our egotism out of the way
 i 'm sure probably all of you here or certainly the very vast majority of you
 have had what you might call a spiritual experience
 a moment in your lives when for a few seconds a minute
  perhaps the boundaries of your ego dissolved and at
 that minute you felt at one
 with the universe
 one with that jug of water one with every human being one with the creator
 and you felt
 in the presence of power of awe of the deepest love
 the deepest sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives
 that is a moment which is a gift of god to us a gift when for a moment
  he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on i i i me me me
 and instead like the person in rumi 's story we say oh this is all you
 this is all you and this is all us
 and us and i and us are all part of you all creator all the objective
 the source of our being and the end of our journey you
 are also the breaker of our hearts you are the one whom we should all be towards for whose purpose we live
 and for whose purpose
 we shall die and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account to god
 to what extent we have been compassionate beings our message today
 and our purpose today and those of you who are here today and the purpose of this charter of compassion
 is to remind for the koran always urges us
 to remember to remind each
  other because the knowledge of truth is within every human being
 we know it all
 we have access to it all jung may have called it the subconscious
 through our subconscious in your dreams which
  our state of sleep the lesser death the temporary death
 in our state of sleep we have dreams we have visions we travel
 even outside of our bodies for many of us and we
 we see wonderful things
 we travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it
 and beyond the limitations of time as we know it but all this is for us to
 glorify the name of the creator
 whose primary name is the compassionating the compassionate god bokh whatever
  name you want to call him with allah ram om whatever the name might be
 through which you name or access the presence of divinity is the locus
 of absolute being
 absolute love and mercy and compassion and absolute knowledge and wisdom what hindus
  call satchidananda the language differs
 but the objective is the same
 rumi has another story
 about three a turk an arab and i forget the third person but for my sake it could be a malay
 one is asking for angour one is say an englishman one is asking for eneb and one is asking for
  grapes
 and they have a fight and an argument because i want grapes i want eneb i want angour
 not knowing that the word that they 're using refers to the same reality in different languages
 there 's only one absolute reality by definition
 one absolute being by definition because absolute is by definition
  single and absolute and singular
 there 's this absolute concentration of being
 the absolute concentration of consciousness awareness an absolute
 locus of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of divinity
  and that should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human
 for what defines humanity perhaps biologically
 is our physiology but god defines humanity by our
  koran says
 he speaks to the angels and says when i have finished the formation of adam from clay
 and breathed into him of my spirit then fall in prostration to him
 the angels
 prostrate not before the human body
 but before the human soul
  soul why because the soul the human soul embodies
 a piece of the divine breath a piece of the divine soul
 this is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image
 what is the imagery of god
 the imagery of god
 is absolute being absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love
 and therefore for us to be human
 in the greatest sense of what it means to be human in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human means that we too
 have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us
 and to seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being of being alive of beingness
 the attribute of wisdom of of consciousness of awareness
 and the attribute of being compassionate and loving
 beings this
 is what i understand from my faith tradition
 and this is what i understand from my studies of other faith traditions
 and this is the common platform on which we must all stand
 and when we stand on this platform as such i am convinced that
  we can make a wonderful world and i believe personally
 that we 're on the verge
 and that with the presence and help of people like you here we can bring about
 the prophecy of isiah for he foretold of a period when
  shall transform their swords into plowshares
 and will not learn war and make war anymore
 we have reached a stage in human history that we have no option
 we must we must
 lower our
  egos
 control our egos whether it is individual ego personal ego family ego
 national ego
 and let all be for the glorification of the one thank you and god
