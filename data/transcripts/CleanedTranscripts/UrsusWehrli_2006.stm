  my name is ursus wehrli and i would like to talk to you this morning about my project tidying up art  first of all any questions so far
 first of all i have to say i 'm not from around here i 'm from a completely different cultural area maybe you noticed i mean
  a tie  first  and then secondly i 'm a little bit nervous because i 'm speaking
 in a foreign language and i want to apologize in advance for any mistakes i might make because i 'm from switzerland  
 and i just don 't hope you think this is swiss german i 'm speaking now here this is just what it sounds like if we swiss try to speak american 
 but don 't worry i don 't have trouble with english as such  i mean
  's not my problem it 's your language after all
 i am fine after this presentation here at ted i can simply go back to switzerland and you have to go on talking like this all the time 
 so
 i 've been asked by by the organizers to read from my book  
  as you can see  it 's more or less a picture book  so the reading would be over very quickly  but
 since i 'm here at ted i
 decided to hold my my talk here in a more modern way 
 in the spirit of ted here and i managed to do some some slides here for you i 'd
 like to show them around so we can just you know 
  i managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures even better so tidying up art  i mean i have to say  that 's a relatively new term you won 't be familiar with it
 i mean  it 's a hobby of mine that i 've been indulging in for the last few years and it all started out with this picture
 of the american artist donald baechler i had hanging at home 
 i had to look at it every day and after a while i just couldn 't stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long
  yeah  i kind of felt sorry for him  
 and it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day  so i decided to give him a little support 
 and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other 
  i think he looks now less miserable  and
 it was great with this experience  i started to look more closely at modern art  then i realized how  you know the
 world of modern art is particularly topsy turvy and
 i can show here a very good example it 's actually a simple one but it 's a good one to start with it 's a picture by paul
  and we can see here very clearly it 's a confusion of color  
 yeah the artist doesn 't really seem to know where to put the different colors
 the various pictures here of the various elements of the picture the whole thing is unstructured we don 't know  maybe  mr klee was probably in a hurry
  of orange and
 here we can see he decided to take a break for a square  
 and i would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture
  we can see now what was barely recognizable in the original seventeen red and orange squares
  i mean that 's just tidying up for beginners  i would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced what
 can you say what a mess  i mean  you see everything seems to
 been scattered aimlessly around the space
 if my room back home had looked like this my mother would have grounded me for three days  so
 i 'd like to i wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture and
  that 's really advanced tidying up yeah you
 're right sometimes people clap at this point but that 's actually more in switzerland
  we swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese  our trains run on time we are only happy when things are in order but to go on here is
 a very good example to see this is a picture by
 joan miro and
 yeah  we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped
  it 's more economical and also more efficient with this method  mr miro could have saved canvas for another picture
  but i can see in your faces that you 're still 're still a little bit skeptical 
 so that you can just appreciate how serious i am about all this i brought along the patents the specifications for some of these works  
 because i 've had my working methods patented at the
  well i could have translated that but you would have been none the wiser  
 i 'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway  i just realized it 's important how one introduces new ideas to people that 's why these patents are sometimes necessary 
 i would like to do a short test with you everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning so i would like to ask you all to raise your right hand  
 yeah  the right hand is the one we write with apart from the left handers 
 and now i 'll count to three i mean it still looks very orderly to me now i 'll count to three and on
  the count of three i 'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you  ok  one two three 
 you can see now that 's a good example even behaving in an orderly systematic way can sometimes
  we can also see that very clearly in this next painting this is a painting
 by the artist niki de saint phalle  and i mean  in the original it 's completely unclear to
 see what this tangle of colors and and shapes is supposed to depict but in the tidied up version it 's plain to see that it 's a sunburnt woman
  this one here that 's much better that 's a picture by by keith haring 
 i think it doesn 't matter
  so i mean  this picture has not even got a proper title  it 's called untitled and i think that 's appropriate
  so in the tidied up version we have a sort of keith haring spare parts shop 
 this is keith haring looked at statistically one can see here quite clearly  you can
 see we have twenty five pale green elements of which one is in the form of a circle
  pink squares with only one pink curve  
 i mean  that 's interesting one could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all  mr haring 's various works in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares  
 and the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure procedure by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he 's likely to need
  one can obviously also make combinations for example with the keith haring circles and kandinsky 's dots  you can add them to all the squares of paul klee in the end one has a list 
  with which one then can arrange then you categorize it then you file it put that file in a filing cabinet put it in your office
 and you can make a living doing it
  here we have some artists that are a bit more structured it 's not too bad this is jasper johns we can see here he was practicing with his ruler 
 but i think it could still benefit from more discipline  and i think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it
  that 's one of my favorites tidying up rene magritte this is really fun you know 
 there is a i 'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this it goes back to a time when i was very often staying in hotels  so once i had the opportunity to stay
  had this little sign i put this little sign outside the door every morning that read please tidy room i don 't know if you have them over here  
 so actually my room there hasn 't been tidied once daily  but three times a day  
 so after a while i decided to have a little fun  and
 before leaving the room each day i 'd scatter a few
  and it was great by the time i returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place  but then one one
 morning  i hang the same little sign onto that picture by vincent van gogh 
 and you have to say this this room hadn 't been tidied up since one thousand eight hundred and
  i can see there are always people that
 like reacting that one or another picture hasn 't been properly tidied up so we can make
 a short test with you this is a picture by rene magritte and i 'd like you all
 to inwardly like in your head  that is to tidy that up so it 's possible that some of you would make it like this 
 yeah  i would actually prefer to do it
 more this way 
 some people would make apple pie out of it but it 's a very good example to see that the whole work was more of a handicraft endeavor that
  involved the very  time consuming job of
 cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements  and it 's not done  as many people imagine with the computer otherwise
 it would look like this 
 so now i 've been able to tidy up pictures that i 've wanted to tidy up for a
  long time here is a very good example take jackson pollock for example  it
 's oh no it 's that 's a really hard one 
 but after a while i just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans
  here we have the fur cup by meret oppenheim here i just brought it back to its original state
  you can even go you know or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art the pointillist movement is that kind of
 paintings where everything is broken down into dots and pixels  
 and then i this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up so
 i once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method
 georges seurat and i collected together all his dots and now they 're all in here  
 you can count them afterwards 
  if you like you see that 's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea it 's new so there is no existing tradition in it there is no textbooks
  to round things up i would like to show you just one more this is the village square by pieter bruegel  that 's how it looks like when you send everyone home
  maybe you 're asking yourselves where old bruegel 's
  i would like to show you
