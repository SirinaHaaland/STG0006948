  what i 'd like to talk about is really
 the biggest problems in the world i 'm not going to talk about the skeptical environmentalist probably that 's also a good choice 
 but i am going talk about what are the big problems in the world  and i must say  before i go on  i should ask every one of you to try and get out
 pen and paper because i 'm actually going to ask you to
  help me to look at how we do that so get out your pen and paper bottom line is there is a lot of problems out there in the world  i 'm just going to list some of them there are eight hundred million people starving there 's a billion 
  people without clean drinking water two billion people without sanitation  there are several million people dying of hiv and aids the lists go on and on there 's two
  billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change so on there are many many problems out there in an ideal world  we would solve them all 
 but we don 't 
 we don 't actually solve all problems  
 and if we do not the question i think we need to ask ourselves and that 's why it 's on the economy session is to say  if we don 't do all things we really have to start asking ourselves  which ones should we solve first  and that 's
 question i 'd like to ask you if we had say  fifty billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world where should we spend it 
 we identified ten of the biggest challenges in the world and i
 will just briefly read them climate change communicable diseases conflicts education financial instability  governance and corruption malnutrition and hunger population migration  sanitation and water and subsidies and trade barriers  
 we believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world  
 the obvious question would be
 what do you think are the biggest things where should we start on solving these problems but that 's a wrong problem to ask that was actually the problem that was asked in davos in january  but of course there 's a problem in asking people to focus on problems  because
 we can 't solve problems surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die  but we don 't have a technology
  so the point is not to prioritize problems  but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems  and that would be of course that gets a little more complicated to climate change 
 that would be like kyoto to communicable diseases it might be health clinics or mosquito nets to conflicts it would be u n ' s peacekeeping forces  and so on 
  priorities and also and that 's of course where economics gets evil
 to put down what are the things we should not do first  what should be at the bottom of the list please just take thirty seconds perhaps talk to your to your neighbor and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world 's biggest issues  
 the amazing part of this
  i would love to i only have eighteen minutes i 've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time right i 'd love to go into and get you to
 think about this process and that 's actually what we did and i also strongly encourage you and i 'm sure we 'll also have these discussions afterwards 
 to think about how do we actually prioritize of course  you have to ask yourself why on earth was such a list never done before 
 and one one reason is that prioritization is
  nobody wants to do this of course  every organization would love to be on the top of such a list but every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list and since there are many more not number one
 spots on the list than there is number ones it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list we 've had the u n for almost sixty years  yet we 've never actually made
 a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world  and said which of them should we do first  so it doesn 't mean
 that we are not prioritizing any decision is a prioritization so of course we are still prioritizing if only implicitly and that 's unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization 
  and went in and talked about it so what i 'm proposing is really to say that we have for a very long time had a situation when we 've had a menu of choices there are many many things we can do out
  not had the prices nor the sizes  we have not had an idea imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card but you have no idea what the price is you know you have a pizza 
 you 've no idea what the price is it could be at one dollar it could be one thousand dollars  it could be a family size pizza it could be a very individual size pizza right we 'd like to know these things and that is what the copenhagen consensus is really trying to do to try to put prices on these issues 
  and so basically this has been the copenhagen consensus ' process we got thirty of the world 's best economists 
 three in each area so we have three of world 's top economists write about climate change what can we do 
 what will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that 
 likewise in communicable diseases  three of the world 's top experts saying  what can we do what would be the price  what should we do about it and what will be the outcome  and so on then we had some of the world 's top economists eight
 of the world 's top economists including three nobel laureates
  meet in copenhagen in may two thousand and four we called them the dream team the cambridge university prefects
 decided to call them the real madrid of economics that works very well in europe but it doesn 't really work over here
  and what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list and then you ask why economists  and of course i 'm very happy you asked that
  because that 's a very good question 
 the point is of course if you want to know about malaria  you ask a malaria expert if you want to know about climate you ask a climatologist  
 but if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first  you can 't ask either of them 
 because that 's not what they do that is what economists do they prioritize they make that
 in some ways disgusting task of saying  which one should we do first and which one should we do afterwards  so this is the list and this is the one i 'd like to share with you of course you can also see
  talk about it more i 'm sure as the day goes on they basically came up with a list where they said there were bad
  projects where if you invest a dollar  you get less than a dollar back then there 's fair projects good projects and very good projects and of course it 's the very good projects we should start doing i 'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects 
 these were the bad projects 
 as you might see the
  the bottom of the list was climate change this offends a lot of people and that 's probably
 one of the things where people will say i shouldn 't come back either  and i 'd like to talk about that because that 's really curious  
 why is it it came up and i 'll actually also try to get back to this because it 's probably one of the things that we 'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down 
 the reason why they came up with saying that kyoto or doing something more than kyoto is a bad deal is simply because it 's very inefficient
  it 's not saying that global warming is not happening it 's not saying that it 's not a big problem but it 's saying that what we can do about it is very little at a very high cost 
 what they basically show us the average of all macroeconomic models is that kyoto if everyone agreed would cost about one hundred and fifty billion dollars a year  
 that 's a substantial amount of money
  two to three times the global development aid that we give the third world every year  yet it would do very little good  all models show it will postpone warming for about six years in two thousand one hundred  
 so the guy in bangladesh who gets a flood in two thousand one hundred can wait until two thousand one hundred and six which is a little good but not very much good
  so the idea here really is to say well we 've spent a lot of money doing a little good  and just to give you a sense of reference the u n actually estimate that for half
  billion dollars a year  
 we could solve all major basic problems in the world  we could give clean drinking water sanitation basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet  
 so we have to ask ourselves do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good  or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good  
 and that is really why it becomes a bad project it 's not to say that if we had all the money in the world we wouldn 't want to do it  but it 's to say  when we don 't  it 's just simply not our first priority
  the fair projects notice i 'm not going to comment on all these
 but communicable diseases scale of basic health services just made it simply because yes  scale of basic health services is a great thing it would do a lot of good  but it 's also very very costly again 
 what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation if you look at the good projects a lot of sanitation and water projects
  water is incredibly important  
 but it also costs a lot of infrastructure so i 'd like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world  the fourth best problem is
 malaria dealing with malaria the incidence of malaria is about a couple of [ million ] people get infected every year  it might even cost up towards a
 percentage point of gdp
  every year for affected nations if we invested about thirteen billion dollars
 over the next four years  we could bring that incidence down to half we could avoid about five hundred thousand people dying  but perhaps more importantly we could avoid about a [ million ] people getting infected 
  every year  we would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with of course  in the long run also to deal with global warming 
  especially cut subsidies in the u s and europe  
 we could basically enliven the the global economy to to an astounding number of about two thousand four hundred billion dollars a year  half of which would accrue to the third world 
  again the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty 
  two to five years 
 that would be the third best thing we could do the second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition not just malnutrition in general but there 's a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition namely 
  the lack of micronutrients basically about half of the world 's population is lacking in iron zinc iodine and vitamin a if we invest about twelve billion dollars we could make a severe 
 inroad into that problem that would be the second best investment that we could do and the very best project
 to focus on hiv aids  basically if we invest twenty seven billion dollars over the next eight years  we could avoid twenty eight new million cases of hiv aids again  what this does and what it focuses on is saying
 there are two very different ways that we can deal with hiv aids one is treatment the other one is prevention 
  and again in an ideal world we would do both but in a world where we don 't do either or don 't do it very well  
 we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first  and treatment is much much more expensive than prevention so basically what this focuses on is saying we can do a lot more by investing in prevention basically for the amount of money that we spend 
 we can do x amount of good in treatment  and ten times
  as much good in
 prevention so again what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment at first rate  
 what this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities i 'd like to have you look at your priority list and say  did you get it right or did you get close to what we came up with here  
 well  of course one of the things is climate change again  i find a lot of people find it very very unlikely that we should
  we should also do climate change if for no other reason simply because it 's such a big problem  
 but of course we don 't do all problems  there are many problems out there in the world and what i want to make
 sure of is if we actually focus on problems that we focus on the right ones the ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good  and i think actually
 thomas schelling one of the participants in the  in the dream team  he put it very very well  one of things that people forget
  talking about most of the climate change impacts will be people will be much much richer  even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the u n estimate that the average person in the developing 
  world in two thousand one hundred will be about as rich as we are today much more likely they will be two to four times richer than we are and of course we 'll be even richer than that  but the point
  when we talk about saving people or helping people in bangladesh in two thousand one hundred we 're not talking about a poor bangladeshi we 're actually talking about a fairly rich dutch guy  
 and so the real point of course is to say  do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little one hundred years from now a fairly rich dutch guy  
 or do we want to help real poor people right now in bangladesh who really need the help and whom we
 can help very very cheaply or as schelling put it imagine if you were a rich as you will be a rich chinese a rich bolivian a rich congolese in
 two thousand one hundred  thinking back on two thousand and five  and saying how odd
 so much more 
 so i think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight even if it doesn 't accord to the typical way we see this problem of course 
 that 's mainly because climate change has good pictures  we have you know 
 the day after tomorrow it
 looks great right  it 's a good film in the sense that i certainly want to see it right  but don 't expect emmerich
 to cast brad pitt in
 next movie digging latrines in tanzania or something it just doesn 't make for as much of a movie  
 so in many ways i think of the copenhagen consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems  
 to make sure that we realize it 's not about making us feel good it 's not about making things
 that have the most
 media attention  but it 's about making places where we can actually do the most good
  other objections i think that are important to say is that i 'm somehow or we are somehow positing a false choice of course we should do all things  in an ideal world i would certainly agree 
  i think we should do all things but we don 't in one thousand nine hundred and seventy  the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much
  so it doesn 't look like we 're actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems  likewise people are also saying but what about the iraq war you know 
 we spend one hundred billion dollars why don 't we spend that on doing good in the world  i 'm all for that if any one of you guys can talk bush into doing that that 's fine  
 but the point of course is still to say if you get another one hundred billion dollars  
 we still want to spend that in the best possible
  so the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities  i should just mention briefly is this really the right list that we got out you know 
 when you ask the world world 's best economists  you
 inevitably end up asking old white american men  and they 're not necessarily you know great
 ways of looking at the entire world so we actually invited eighty young people from all over the world to come and solve
  the same problem the only two requirements were that they were
 studying at the university and they spoke english
 the majority of them were first from developing countries they had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion and they certainly did to come up with their own lists and the surprising thing was
 that the list was very similar with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom 
 we 've done this many other times there 's been many other seminars and university students and different things they all come out with very much the same
  list and that gives me
 great hope really in saying that i do believe that there is a path ahead
 to get us to start thinking about priorities and saying what is the important thing in the world of course  in an ideal world again we 'd love to do everything but if we don 't do it then we can 
  start thinking about where should we start i see the copenhagen consensus as a process we did it in two thousand and four and we hope to assemble many more people getting much better information
  for two thousand and eight two thousand and twelve map out the right path for the world but also to start thinking about political triage to start thinking about saying let 's do not the 
  things where we can do very little at a very high cost not the things that we don 't know how to do but let 's do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good at very low cost
