  i have a question  can a computer write poetry 
 this is a provocative question  
 you think about it for a minute  and you suddenly have a bunch of other questions like what is a computer  
 what is poetry
 what is creativity  
 but these are questions that people spend their entire lifetime trying to answer not in a single ted talk 
 so we 're going to have to try a different approach  
 so up here  we have two poems 
 one of them is written by a human  and the other one 's written by a computer
  hands up if you think poem one was written by a human
  most of you hands up if you think poem two was written by a human  
 very brave of you because the first one was written by the human poet william blake 
 the second one was written by an algorithm that took all the language from my facebook feed on one day and then regenerated it algorithmically according to
  describe a little bit later on so let 's try another test  again you haven 't got ages to read this so just trust your gut
  time 's up  so if you think the first poem was written by a human put your hand up
  ok  and if you think the second poem was written by a human put your hand up 
 we have more or less a fifty fifty split here it was much harder the answer is 
 the first poem was generated by an algorithm called
  was created back in the 
 and the second poem was written by a guy called frank o 'hara who happens to be one of my favorite human poets 
 so what we 've just done now is a turing test for poetry  the turing test was first proposed by this guy alan
  in order to answer the question can computers think 
 alan turing believed that if a computer was able to have a to have a text based conversation with a human  with such proficiency such that the human couldn 't tell whether they are talking 
  to a computer or a human  then the computer can be said to have intelligence  
 but basically  it 's the game we just played you 're presented with a poem you don 't know whether it was written by a human or a computer and you have to guess 
 so thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online so we have results  and what are the results  
 well turing said that if a computer could fool a human thirty percent of the time that it was a human
  then it passes the turing test for intelligence  we have poems on the bot or not database that have fooled sixty five percent of human readers into thinking it was written by a human  
 so i think we have an answer to our question  
 according to the logic of the turing test  can a computer write poetry  well yes absolutely it can 
 but if you 're feeling a little bit uncomfortable with this answer that 's ok if you 're having a bunch of gut reactions to it that 's also
  ok because this isn 't the end of the story  
 let 's play our third and final test  again you 're going to have to read and tell me which you think is human
  so hands up if you think poem one was written by a human  
 hands up if you think poem two was written by a human  whoa that 's a lot more people
  so you 'd be surprised to find that poem one was written by the very human poet
 gertrude stein
  and poem two was generated by an algorithm called 
 now before we go on let me describe very quickly and simply how  rkcp works 
 so rkcp is an algorithm designed by ray kurzweil who 's a director of engineering at google and a firm believer in artificial intelligence
  a source text 
 it analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language and then it regenerates language that emulates that first text  so in the poem we just saw before poem two the one that you all thought was human 
 it was fed a bunch of poems by a poet called emily dickinson it looked at the way she used language learned the model and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure
 but the important thing to know about rkcp is that it doesn 't know the meaning of the words it 's using 
 the language is just raw material  it could be chinese it could be in swedish it could be the collected language from your facebook feed for one day it 's just raw material  
 and nevertheless  it 's able to create a poem that seems more human than gertrude stein 's poem and gertrude
  stein is a human  so what we 've done here is more or less a reverse turing test  so
 gertrude stein  who 's a human is able to write a poem that fools a majority of human judges into thinking that it was written by a computer  
 therefore  according to the logic of the reverse turing test gertrude stein is a computer
 feeling confused i think that 's fair enough 
 so far we 've had humans that write like humans  we have computers that write like computers  
 we have computers that write like humans  but we also have perhaps most confusingly 
 humans that write like computers  
 so what do we take from all
  this do we take that william blake is somehow more of a human than gertrude stein  or that gertrude stein is more of a computer than william blake 
 these are questions i 've been asking myself for around two years now and i don 't have any answers but what i do have are a bunch of insights about our relationship with technology  
 so my first insight is that
  that for some reason we associate poetry with being human  so that when we ask can a computer write poetry 
 we 're also asking what does it mean to be human and how do we put boundaries around this category how do we say who or what can be part of this category 
 this is an essentially philosophical question  i believe and it can 't be answered with a yes or no test
  like the turing test  
 i also believe that alan turing understood this and that when he devised his test back in one thousand nine hundred and fifty he was doing it as a philosophical provocation  
 so my second insight is that when we take the turing test for poetry  we 're not really testing the
  they 're pretty simple and have existed more or less 
 what we are doing with the turing test for poetry rather 
 is collecting opinions about what constitutes humanness  
 so what i 've figured out we 've seen this when earlier today
  that william blake is more of a human than gertrude stein 
 of course this doesn 't mean that william blake was actually more human or that gertrude stein was more of a computer  
 it simply means that the category of the human is unstable 
 this has led me to understand
 that the human is not a cold hard fact  rather it is something that 's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time
 so my final insight
 is that the computer more or less  works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it 
 we show it emily dickinson it gives emily dickinson back to us  we show it william blake that 's what it reflects back
  we show it gertrude stein  what we get back is gertrude stein  
 more than any other bit of technology the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it 
 so i 'm sure a lot of you have been hearing a lot about artificial intelligence recently  
 and much of the conversation is can we build it can we build an intelligent computer
 can we build a creative computer what we seem to be asking over and over is can we build a human like computer  
 but what we 've seen just now is that the human is not a scientific fact that it
 's an ever shifting concatenating idea and one that changes over time  
 so that when we begin to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future
  we shouldn 't only be asking ourselves can we build it but we should also be asking ourselves what idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us 
 this is an essentially philosophical idea and it 's one that can 't be answered with software alone  but i think requires a moment of
