  david is
 a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent or at least pretends to be that he asked me to to question him rather than
 speaking in fact what we 're going to talk about i think is in fact
 a subject that is probably better served by a conversation than an address  and i guess we have
 a bit of news clip to
 precede dan rather 
 since the september 11th attack on the world trade center many people have flocked to downtown new york to see and pay respects at
 now as cbs 's jim axelrod reports they 're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene jim
 axelrod forget the empire state building or the statue of liberty there 's a new place in new york where the crowds are thickest
 ground zero tourist i 've taken my step daughter here from indianapolis this was out of all the tourist sites in new york city this was
 thousands now line up on lower broadway tourist i 've been wanting to come down here since
 this happened ja 
 even on the coldest winter days to honor and remember tourist it 's reality it 's us it happened here 
 this is ours ja so many in fact that seeing has become a bit of a problem
 i think that people are very frustrated that they 're not able to get closer to see what 's going on ja but
 that is about to change 
 in record time a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer man 
 get an incredible panorama and understand i think more completely  the sheer totality of the destruction of
 ground zero is unlike most any other tourist site in america unlike the grand canyon or the washington monument 
 people come here to see what 's no longer there david rockwell the first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site
 but as this
 incredibly moving burial ground ja the walls are bare by design so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter
 from our hearts it affected us just as much ja the ramps are made of simple material the kind of plywood you see at construction sites which is really the whole point 
 in the face of america 's worst destruction
 people are building again jim axelrod cbs news new york ka this is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality
 segment
 david you are known as
 i know a phrase you hate an entertainment architect your work is highly sensual even hedonistic dr
 i like that word ka it
 's about pleasure
 casinos and hotels and restaurants
 how did the shock that all of us and especially all of us in new york
  felt on the on the 11th of september
 transmute into your desire to do this thing dr well the truth of the matter is
 i felt myself in the role originally first of all as someone who lives in tribeca and whose neighborhood was
  as someone who works less than a mile from there that i was in the role of forcing
 one hundred people who work
 with me in my firm to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating 
 in fact we 're finishing a book which is called pleasure 
 which is about
 sensual pleasure in spaces  but i 've got to tell you it became impossible to do that we were really paralyzed
  found myself the friday after september 11th two days afterwards literally unable to
 motivate anyone to do anything we
 gave the office a few days off and in discussing this with other architects we had seen
 people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were they should rebuild them fifty stories taller
 and i thought it was astonishing to speculate 
 as if this were a competition on something that was such a fresh wound and i
 had a series of discussions first with rick scofidio and liz diller who collaborated 
 with us on this and several other people and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something and that as people who
  create places  the ultimate way to help wasn 't to pontificate or to
 make up scenarios but to help right now  
 so we we tried to come up with a way as a group to have a kind of design swat team and that was the mission that we came up with
 ka were you conscious of suddenly
  whose work is all about fulfilling wants suddenly
 fulfilling needs 
 dr well what i was aware of was there was this overwhelming need to act now  and
 we were asked to participate in a few projects before this there was a school ps two hundred and thirty four
  that had been evacuated down at
 ground zero 
 they moved to an abandoned school we took about twenty or thirty architects and designers and artists and over four days it was like this urban barn raising to renovate it and everyone wanted to help it was just extraordinary  tom otterness contributed maira kalman
 contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us ka and that was done effectively by october eight or
  you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project and this is only one of four that you 've designed to surround the site you you
 must have run up against the incredibly byzantine  entrenched
 bureaucracy and and powers that be in new york real estate and new york politics dr well it 's a funny thing we finished ps two
 had dinner with a small group i was actually asked to be a committee chair on an aia committee to rebuild and i sat in on several meetings  
 and there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city and the fact is that
  there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process and it wasn 't an inclusive group  so we said what
  idea the city actually approached us  we first approached the city about pier 
 we saw how ps two hundred and thirty four worked the families the victims of the families were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing ka on the hudson river dr yeah  
 and the city actually through tim zagat initially and then through christyne nicholas then we got to giuliani said you know we don 't want to do anything with pier ninety four right now  but we have an
  observation platform for the families down at ground zero
 that we 'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families and a way to protect it from the weather so i went down there with rick and liz and kevin 
 and i 've got to say  it was the most moving
 experience of my life it was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it where the families of the victims had left notes to them
  and there was no mediation between us and the experience there was no filter and i remembered
 on september 11th on 14th street the roof of our building we can see the world trade towers prominently
 and i saw the first building collapse
 from a conference room on the
 floor on a tv that we had set up 
 and then everyone was up on the roof so i ran up there  and it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on tv  
 there was something about the comfort of the filter and
 how much information was between us and the experience so seeing this in a very simple dignified way was a very powerful experience  
 so we went back to the city and said we 're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a vip platform 
  we 've spent some time down there 
 at the same time the city had this need they were looking for a solution to deal with thirty or forty thousand people a day who were going down there 
 that had nowhere to go  
 and there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site  so dealing with it is just an immediate master plan there was a way there had to be a way to get people to move around the site
  but then you 've got to figure out a way
 we will we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board but simply funding this thing 
 it looks like
 a fairly simple thing but this was a half a million dollar project dr well we knew that if it wasn 't privately funded it wasn 't going to happen  and we also
  knew that if it didn 't happen by the end of the giuliani administration then everyone who we were dealing with at the dot and the police department and all of the we were meeting with twenty or thirty people 
 with the city at a time and it was set up by the office of emergency management this incredible
  thing we we had to do was find a way to get this we had to work with the the
 families of the victims through the city to make sure that they knew this was happening because this didn 't want to be a surprise  and we also had to be as under the radar screen as we 
  could be in new york  because the key was not raising a lot of objection and
  up with the idea of setting up a foundation  mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this he would not agree to
 to do this  even if we would pay him the money there needed to be a foundation in place  so we came up with a foundation  and
 actually what happened was one major developer in new
  initials are js  and he owns rockefeller center if that helps anyone
 volunteered to help  
 and we met with him the prices from the contractors were between five to seven hundred thousand dollars  
  the largest scaffolding contractor in the country volunteered to do it at cost so
  and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th 
 and we had to start construction the next day 
 we had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform
 about half the size that we had drawn it ka sort of like the spinal tap scene where you get the tiny little stonehenge i guess
 dr in fact it was as if this was going to be window washing scaffolding there was no sense of the fact that this is next to saint paul that this is really a place 
  that needs to be kind of dignified and a place to reflect and remember  and i 've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together watching the crowds that gathered at saint paul which is just to the right and moving around the site and i live down there so we spent a lot of time
 looking at the need  and i think people were amazed at two things i think they were amazed at the destruction 
 but i think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of new yorkers
 that i found very moving just the sort of everyday heroics of new yorkers  so
 we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said i 'm going to lock the door because this developer will not
 agree to have you leave till you 've signed off on this 
 and we said well this is half the size it doesn 't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone everyone in the city we 'd have to go back to to the beginning to do this 
 and i convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed 
 the next day i got
 from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding
  so we
 didn 't know what to do but we decided to cast a very wide net we emailed out letters to as many people as we could
 several people in the audience here who were very helpful ka there was no thought of abandoning ship
  in fact i told the contractor to go ahead he had already ordered materials based on my go ahead we knew that one way or another this was going to happen and
 we just felt it had to happen ka 
 you were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation  richard  i think very
  all the chair designers came out about the history of chair designers imposing
 aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal  banal  common problem of sitting it
 seems to me with this that it was the opposite of that this was an unprecedented singular
  here 's the issue we knew that this was not in the sense of
 we think about the site and think about the need for a memorial  it was important that this not be categorized as a memorial that this was a place for people to
 to reflect to remember a
 kind of quiet place so it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters
  between the viewer as we said about the families ' platform and the experience as possible  it 's
 all incredibly humble material it 's scaffolding and
 plywood 
 and it allows by sort of the procession of the movement up by saint paul 's and down the other side it gives you about three hundred feet to go up thirteen feet from the ground to
 where you get the three hundred and sixty degree view
  but the design was driven by a need to be quick  cheap  safe  
 respectful  flexible one of the other things is this is designed to be moveable
  because when we looked at the four platforms around the site one of which is an upgrade of the families ' platform  we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing
 conditions and the changing
 definition
  of what ground zero is ka your work i mean we 've talked about this before a lot of your work i think is informed by your
 belief in or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things and a kind of 
 eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die
  this is clearly not a work for the ages you know a couple of years this thing isn 't going to be here
 that require as an architect a new way of thinking about what you were doing to think of it as this
 purely temporary installation dr no i don 't think so 
 i think this is obviously substantially different from anything we 'd ever thought about doing before just by
  the nature of it  where it overlaps with 
 thoughts about our work in general is number one the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done and kevin kennon 
 rick scofidio liz diller and all the people within the city
  norman lear who i spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding offered to give us a bridge loan
 to help us get through it  
 so the notion of collaboration i think this reinforces how important that is and in terms of the temporary nature of it 
 our goal was not to create
 something that would be there longer than it needed to be  i think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue
 that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city about what 's really happening there and
 day or two before it opened was giuliani 's farewell address where he proposed the idea of all of ground zero being a memorial  which was very controversial but it resonated with a lot of people 
 and i think regardless of
 what the position is about how this
  sacred piece of land is to be used having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter
  i think makes it a more powerful dialogue and that 's what we were interested in so that very much is in the realm of
 things i 've been interested in before ka it seems to me among other things a lovely piece of civic infrastructure it enables that conversation to get serious
  months after the fact and
 only a few months away from the site being cleaned we are very quickly 
 now getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious 
 do you have
 having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project have any ideas about what should
  i think one thing that shouldn 't be done is evaluate i think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan 
 the protetch gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings which had some
 sort of inventive ideas of buildings ka but it had some really terrible ideas dr and it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas where i think
 the
  focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses  and i think there should be a broader which there 's starting to be the dialogue is really opening up to what does this site really want to be
 and i truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out that it 's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion
  this over so that there 's one uninterrupted piece of land ka well i think that 's interesting and it gets to another issue that was
 probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago but perhaps isn 't now which is 
 not many of us love the world trade center as a piece of architecture as what it had done to this city and that
 to rebuild some more traditional city grid or not dr 
 i think there 's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities  
 and why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day
 i don 't think it has much to do with fifty or sixty or seventy or eighty thousand new office spaces  
  regardless of what the number is 
 so yeah i think there is a chance to re look at how we think about cities  and in fact  there 's a proposal on the table now for building number seven 
 ka which was the building just north of the towers dr right which the towers fell into and
 the reason that 's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they 're not re opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city  
  like to see an international competition  and a call for ideas for uses ka 
 whether it 's arts whether it 's housing whether it 's what amount of shopping dr right and we 're looking for other things this small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help including
 taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting
 ten architects who currently don 't have a voice in new york to do artist housing  and find other ways to
  encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic single solutions and more about a multiplicity of things ka before we end
 i know you have a
 piece of
 digital video of the experience of being
 on this platform dr john kamen who 's here actually put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use  so i thought that
  would be good to end
  with looking from fulton street 
  complexity and length of time they really take to do it 's three hundred and fifty people on the committee for oklahoma city 
 which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad hoc spontaneous solution
 that expanded on union square and the places that were ad hoc
 memorials in the city already  
 the scaffolding you can see built up over the street
  what 's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed so that what you 're aware of
  around it and the scars on the building around it which are enormous this shows saint paul 's on the left
 i just want to
 thank you on behalf of new yorkers for making this happen and getting this done  but the kind of
 virtually instantaneous
  nature of its erection and its
 being there almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished
 is part of its extraordinary i don 't know if beauty is the word but presence
