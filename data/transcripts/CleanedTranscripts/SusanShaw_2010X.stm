  i am a marine toxicologist and i 've been very very concerned about the gulf particularly about the
 massive applications of the toxic dispersants the corexits i 've been working on ocean pollution for quite a long time
 the impacts on marine life and
  particularly the impacts on marine mammals as it turns out marine mammals are at the top of this food chain
 that we 're pouring millions of
 tons of toxic substances into every year  
 and they are showing the signs of this  i 'm sorry to have a sad slide like this but
  not everything is all that happy especially in my work
 they are
 loaded with toxic chemicals in their body hundreds of compounds all kinds of compounds it 's staggering  
 and they 're dying off rather regularly tens of thousands around the world 
 it 's predicted they may go extinct about a third of them
 within about thirty years  so my project is along the northwest atlantic it 's called seals as
  sentinels we 're tracking pollution at the top of the food web in marine mammals and fish it 's a 
  investigation 
 we 're looking at a lot of compounds but recently been quite interested in the flame retardants 
 the brominated flame retardants that are in many many things that we use in our everyday
  the cushions in the chairs we 're all sitting on to the plastic casings of our computers our television sets and so on  
 so we are tracking how do these things get from the products into the ocean which is the final sink for them and
 there 's quite a complicated pathway for that
 because as these products age  they get concentrated
  and then they also get thrown out so they go to the landfills  
 they wind up in waste water treatment plants 
 as you all know we throw out billions of computers and tvs every year and those go to  e waste dumps and all that gets into surface waters eventually reaching the ocean the final sink 
 so in our study  we did find quite high levels as we expected of these flame retardants in the harbor seals ' bodies and
 we reported this it led to a ban of this neuro toxic flame retardant called deca
 in maine where i am based and also then 
 at the end of last year but we said well on the bright side our harbor seals at least will not be bursting into flame anytime soon  
 so then i got really curious myself as a toxicologist and i
 donated some blood to my lab and said okay let 's do it well we detected one hundred and
  thirteen different compounds in my blood  and i must say if any of you would have this done you 'd probably find
 a similar profile or cocktail as they call it 
 but i was the recipient of a lot of flame retardant material for some reason and just to point out the levels
 americans have ten to forty times higher levels of these compounds in our bodies
 than the europeans  why because we are flame retarding everything and we have weak regulations for toxic chemicals  
 but lo and behold i 'm one of the high end individuals lucky me  
 but then i thought well in case of a fire i might be the last one to ignite 
 so anyway here 's the problem and it is a problem that we 're looking at in the gulf today
 we 're not regulating chemicals in this country properly we 're hardly regulating them at all 
 and we 're letting industry run the show  and jackie savitz spoke this morning about big oil and the propaganda and how we 're all brainwashed with
 their  you know  lies
  big chemical is what we 're dealing with here  
 and they 're allowed to keep trade secrets so they don 't even give the ingredients out  plus they don 't give health and safety data so 
 consequently they cannot be regulated before they go to market  
 so it 's a case of
 innocent until proven guilty  the burden of proof is not on the producer so
 i then was invited to go to the gulf in may i went down there on a
  preliminary investigation to look into dispersants and how they 're going into the water column and so forth and
 i was told that i was the only toxicologist to date who was dumb enough to get into the water  but i did  and
 we dove in the slick without even hazmat
 gear
  and i did get sick i got a ferocious sore throat two days later i felt like my throat was on fire
 but it did pass  
 and what i did see in the water as we went down what really shocked me and it 's haunted me ever since because i could see the droplets of oil
 dispersing  and as you go down they 're catching all kinds of plankton bumping into
  little wisps of life that are the food for the planktivores the herring kind of fish and you could just see the web of death
 as as you go down in the water column well you know  we got into this in the beginning
 as a trade off they say  between the wetlands versus the ocean depth  and i didn 't agree with that decision at the time i still don 't
  the decision was to protect the marshes  when the oil gets into the marshes you can 't get it out  
 and as you know there 's been a very weak response up until recently to actually collect the oil 
 it 's gotten much more aggressive this is an exxon slide showing what happens the scenario and the trade off 
 so this shows oil on the surface you can see it getting up into the mangrove  
 but it is not harming
 the
 corals or the sea grass right so here we have the
 other scenario if you disperse the sea grass and the corals are getting hit pretty hard  but you 're saving the mangrove so
 this to me is like going to the eye doctor okay is it better with one
 or two the problem is that we have
 released so darn much of this stuff we 're climbing up to two million gallons
 very quickly
 and then there 's the problem of the plumes  what plumes  it turns out there are plumes 
 independent researchers found that  
 and then there 's the looming  messy problem of human health reported human health effects  
 and actually one of our federal officials said
 that it was probably heat stress
  been in that water
 just for the short time i was there i can tell you it is not heat stress  
 there are volumes of volatile petroleum fumes coming off that water  plus the corexit  
 which has solvent in it so it
 is not at all rational  so what do we have the bp show is going on our officials complained about corexit which is the most
  toxic line of dispersants but
 heck they 're still using it  and they used the most toxic one the nine thousand five hundred and twenty seven until they ran out of supplies 
 now they 're on nine  thousand five hundred nine thousand five 
  in it that causes internal bleeding we know that from the exxon valdez spill by the way  so what we 're doing we 're putting
  compounds with petroleum solvents onto a petroleum spill does this make sense  
 so this is the way it works  and i want to show you this cute little thing that happens here it 's a micelle micelles form around the oil and what happens first is the solvents break into the oil
  they let the surfactants in there the surfactants which are like things we use on fast food wrappers
 they grab around the droplets of oil and they make little tiny droplets with
 nice little surfactant
 edges to them  the thing to remember about the micelles
 these little floating globules of toxin is they are there to deliver  
  like the fedex guys and if you 're a fish and you haven 't gotten your glob in the morning you 're going to get it in the afternoon because they 've got your number  
 so
 from a toxicology perspective this is really awful because
 corexit and the dispersed oil are much more toxic together than either alone  and usually the exposure is a combined exposure
  as i was saying their job is to break down the lipid membrane the solvents in them do that very efficiently  so they break down lipid membranes
 in our body  starting with cells of the skin the cells of organs  so it actually hastens oil getting into the body easily and readily
  oil contains hundreds of hydrocarbon compounds and other compounds
 that are toxic to every organ in the body and so with the dispersants combined you have this very synergistic combined toxicity 
 corexit also contains petroleum solvents and many other toxic compounds and i 'm part of a chat group  which is a national
 group of
  turning cartwheels trying to figure out what 's in this stuff  and what is it doing and what are the interactions
 of these chemicals most of which we don 't know  and what are their byproducts which are usually more toxic than the parent compound  
 so we did find that corexit nine thousand five hundred contains
 heavy metals arsenic and chromium arsenic
 at at high
  this is what we have to look at these you know ridiculous safety data sheets which have nothing on them
 much and now they were forced to release the ultimate list of everything that 's in corexit 
 and guess what tons of stuff is missing  derivatives  
  these are whole big groups of
 many many compounds these sorbitans  and then you get down to the petroleum distillates which are the solvents hundreds of them 
 they are not identified  and why 
 trade secrets again bp 's running the show 
 and the nalco company  this is all they have to do so far these ingredients have not been released 
 and toxicologists are actually going nuts because we cannot predict with certainty
  what the interactions and toxic
 results are going to be but we do have quite a lot at risk down there as we all know the
 thirty three wildlife refuges  so much
 wildlife and fish and diversity  so we know from previous spills  and then part of this is just part of my
  and i appreciate being able to
 vent some of my anguish upon you what we do know is that the corals are going to get hit hard  
 and this is a study that was done on the australian coast the coast of tasmania 
 corals are  you know the home to about a quarter of all marine species and
 with the corexit
  percent fertilization so they 're a very sensitive species to this combo 
 here 's another group  
 i could see myself easily in the water column the plankton and the plankton eaters you know  these are the little herring fish that go through the water column with their mouths open feeding indiscriminately and just
 lapping up this
 brown pudding of toxic
  stuff  and we do know from other studies that this is a highly toxic mixture see the oil and corexit is causing death at
 a much much lower dose than oil alone  that 's probably as far as what we do know about toxic effects but
 my bad dreams go like this  the piscivorous fish  the cobia
  those big fish also the tuna and sharks are going to hit by this and the gills are quite sensitive  the respiratory system is very sensitive think about it with the corexit
 hitting the membranes and it will clog up the gills and then these animals are going to be
 something like what you call chemical pneumonia trying to aspirate the compounds it also will cause internal bleeding
 upon ingestion  
 i 'm very worried about the air breathing mammals because i study them but also 
 the way their going to be exposed is every time they come to the surface to take a breath they 're going to inhale these volatile fumes 
 and what does happen with that eventually is
 pneumonia
  every membrane and every system of the body  and you 're having
 a lot of different unpleasant effects but
 burns to the eyes and mouth 
 skin ulcers  lesions  
 and i think personally that we have not begun to see the impacts of this spill on the wildlife of the gulf  
 we started
  hypothesizing 
 what do we know  what do with think would be a trophic cascade  which means that somebody gets wiped out  and then everything above that 's eating those guys will crash  so our thought was
 this is a simple thinking process but obviously the plankton the planktivores  and that 's about as far as we
  it turns out we 're not very good at figuring this stuff out 
 this is what the exxon valdez scientists thought would happen this trophic cascade where you lose the kelp and the herring and other fishes and going up they thought that eventually the killer whale would be at the top of this
 cascade and then here 's what really happened much more complicated  much more specific actually the kelp and the barnacles
  attach to the rock were
 decimated by the combination of corexit
 and the
 oil they were replaced by invasive species which had less holding power to the rock
  storms came along  they ripped out of the rock and this was the entire food web for the sea ducks  and as you know we lost about three hundred thousand sea ducks from the exxon valdez spill  
 and they haven 't come back  
 so we are
  launching
 an independent study  and by independent i do not mean alone  i mean
 independent in the sense of not tied to
 the kind of  crime scene secrecy that 's going on in the gulf now  but we are actually going to be assessing toxic impacts but we need lots and lots of partners to do this intelligently we have some of the partners lined up 
  dave gallo signed on 
 sylvia 's in here  and we hope that some of you will help us my question to you is why shouldn 't we know  don 't we have the right to know surely
 we have the right to learn
 what loss we are are going through in the gulf and my wish would be for the
 the gulf prize would be that we have
  truth  whatever it is please let us have the truth  and to get there  we need to do the assessment  so i appreciate being here thank you
