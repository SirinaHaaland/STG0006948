  khan academy is most known for its its collection of videos so before i go any further
 let me show you a little bit of a montage salman khan 
 so the hypotenuse is now going to be five this animal 's fossils are only found in this area of south america a nice clean band here and
  this part of africa we can integrate over the surface and the notation usually is a capital sigma  national assembly they create the committee of public safety which 
  sounds like a very nice committee notice  this is an aldehyde  and it 's an alcohol start differentiating into effector and memory cells a galaxy hey there
  there 's another galaxy and for dollars is their thirty million plus the twenty million dollars from the american manufacturer  if this does not blow your mind  
 then you have no emotion sk 
 we now have
 on the order of two thousand two hundred videos covering everything from basic arithmetic all the way to to vector calculus and some of the stuff that you saw
  there  we have
 a million students a month using the site watching on the order of one hundred to two hundred thousand videos a day  
 but what we 're going to talk about in this is how we 're going to the next level  
 but before i do that i want to talk a little bit about really just how i got started and
 some of you all
  about five years ago i was an analyst at a hedge fund  
 and i was in boston and i was tutoring my cousins in new orleans remotely  
 and i started putting the first youtube videos up really just as a kind of nice to have just kind of a supplement for my cousins something that might give give them a refresher or something 
 and as soon as i put those first youtube videos up something interesting happened actually a bunch of interesting things  happened the first
  the feedback from my cousins 
 they told me that they preferred me on youtube than in person 
 and
 once you get over the backhanded nature of that there was actually something very profound there they were saying that they preferred
 the automated version of their cousin to their cousin at first it 's very unintuitive but when you think about it from their point of view it makes a
  ton of sense 
 you have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin
 without feeling like they 're wasting my time if they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago or maybe a couple of years ago
  they don 't have to be embarrassed and and ask their cousin they can just watch those videos if they 're bored 
  of this is the notion that 
  the very first time that you 're trying to get your brain around a new concept  the very last thing you need is another human being saying do you understand this 
 and that 's what was happening with the the interaction with my cousins before and now they can just do it
 in
  the other thing that happened is i put them on youtube just just
 i saw no reason to make it private so i i let other people watch it and then people started stumbling on it 
 and i started getting some comments and some letters and and all sorts of feedback from from random people around the world these are just a few
  this is actually from one of the original calculus videos
 someone wrote it on youtube it was a youtube comment first time i smiled doing a derivative 
 laughter let 's pause here  this person did a derivative  and then they smiled
 in response to that same comment this is on the thread you can go on youtube and look at the comments
  same thing here i actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day  since i remember seeing all of this matrix text in class and here i 'm all like ' i know kung fu ' 
 we get a lot of feedback along those lines this clearly was helping people but then as the viewership kept growing and kept growing 
 i started getting letters from from people and it was starting to become clear that it was more than
  just a nice to have this is just an excerpt from one of one of those letters 
 my twelve year old son has autism and has had a terrible time with math 
 we have tried everything  viewed everything  bought everything we stumbled on your video on decimals  and it got through 
 then we went on to the dreaded fractions again he got it  
 we could not believe it  he is so excited 
 and so you can imagine
  was an analyst at a hedge fund it was very strange for me to do something of social value 
 but i was excited so i kept going  and then a few other
  things started to dawn on me that not only would it help my cousins right now or these people who were sending letters  but that this content will never grow old that it could help their kids 
 or their grandkids  if isaac newton had done youtube videos on calculus 
 assuming he was good we don 't know 
 the other thing that happened and even at this point i said ok maybe it 's a good supplement it 's good for
  motivated students it 's good for maybe home schoolers 
 but i didn 't think it would somehow penetrate the classroom then i started getting letters from teachers 
 and the teachers would write saying we 've used your videos to flip the classroom you 've given the lectures so now what we do and this could happen in every classroom in america tomorrow 
 what i do is i assign the lectures for homework  and what used to be homework
  now have the students doing in the classroom and i want to pause here 
 i want to pause here because there 's a couple of interesting things one when those teachers are doing that 
 there 's the obvious benefit the benefit that now their their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did they can pause repeat at their own pace 
  time  but the more interesting thing and this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom by removing the 
  lecture from the classroom  and letting students have a self paced lecture at home 
 then when you go to the classroom letting them do work having the teacher walk around having the peers actually be able to interact with each other  these teachers
 have used technology to humanize the classroom
  they took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience thirty kids with their fingers on their lips not allowed to interact with each other a teacher no matter how good has to give 
 this one size fits all lecture to thirty students
 blank faces slightly antagonistic and now it 's a human experience now they 're actually interacting with each other  
 so once the khan academy i quit my job and we turned into a real organization we 're
 a not for profit the question is how do we take this to the next level how do we take what those teachers were doing to its natural conclusion 
 and so what i 'm showing over here these are actual
 exercises that i started writing for my cousins  the ones i started were much more primitive this is a more competent version of it  
  generate as many questions as you need  until you get that concept  until you get ten in a row and the khan academy videos are there you get hints the actual steps for that problem if you don 't know how to do it 
 the paradigm here seems like a very simple thing ten in a row you move on  but it 's fundamentally different than what 's happening in classrooms right right now in a traditional classroom  
 you have homework  homework
  you have a snapshot exam  and that exam whether you get a seventy percent an eighty percent a ninety percent or a ninety five percent the class moves on to the next topic  
 and even that that ninety five percent student what was the five percent they didn 't know maybe they didn 't know what what happens when you raise something to the to the zeroth power  then you build on that in the next concept that 's analogous to
 imagine learning to ride a bicycle 
  maybe i give you a lecture ahead of time and i give you a bicycle for two weeks then i come back after two weeks
  and say well let 's see you 're having trouble taking left turns you can 't quite stop you 're an eighty percent bicyclist so i put a big c stamp on your forehead 
 and then i say here 's a unicycle 
 but
 as ridiculous as that sounds that 's exactly what 's happening in our in our classrooms right now and the idea is
 you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of the sudden and start
 calculus all of the sudden  despite being smart despite having good teachers and it 's usually because they have these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation so our our model is 
 learn math the way you 'd learn anything like riding a bicycle stay on that bicycle  fall off that bicycle do it as long as necessary  until you have
  the traditional model  it penalizes you for experimentation and failure  but it does not expect mastery  
 we encourage you to experiment we encourage you to fail but we do expect mastery  
 this is just another one of the modules this is trigonometry  this is shifting and reflecting functions 
 and they all fit together we have about ninety of these right now you can go to the site right now it 's all free not
  trying to sell anything 
 but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map 
 that top node right there that 's literally single digit addition it 's like one plus one is equal to two 
 the paradigm is once you get ten in a row on that it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules 
 further down the knowledge map we 're getting into more advanced arithmetic  further down you start getting into pre algebra and early algebra  further down you start getting into
 algebra one algebra two a little bit of precalculus
  and the idea is from this we can actually teach everything well  everything that can be taught in this type of a framework so you can imagine and this is what we are working on
  from this knowledge map you have logic you have computer programming you have grammar  you have genetics all based off of that core of if you know this and that now you 're ready for this next concept 
 and i encourage you to do it with your kids but i also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself it 'll change what happens at the dinner table 
 but what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about 
 and so what i 'm showing you here this is data from a pilot in the los altos school district where they took two fifth grade classes
  and completely gutted their old math curriculum these kids aren 't using textbooks or getting one size fits all lectures they 're doing khan academy that software for roughly half of their math class  i want 
  to be clear  we don 't view this as a complete math education what it does is this is what 's happening in los altos it frees up time it 's the blocking and tackling making sure you know how to move through a system of equations  and it frees up time for the simulations for the games for the
  for the estimating how high that hill is based on its on its shadow  
 and so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day  every kid works at their own pace this is actually a live dashboard from the los altos school district
 and they look at this dashboard 
 every row is a student every column is one of those concepts green means the student 's already proficient blue means they 're working on it no need to worry  red means they 're stuck 
  and what the teacher does is literally just say 
 let me intervene on the red kids or even better let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their peer 
 now 
 i come from a very  data centric reality so we don 't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions
  you understand and all the rest 
 so our paradigm is to arm teachers with as much data as possible data that in any other field is expected  in finance marketing manufacturing so the teachers can diagnose what 's wrong 
  with the students so they can make their interaction as productive as possible now teachers know exactly what the students have been up to how long they 've spent each day what
  when did they pause the videos  what did they stop watching what exercises are they using what have they focused on the outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on the inner circle shows the videos they 're focused on
 the data gets pretty granular so you can see the exact problems the student got right or wrong red is wrong  blue is right the leftmost question is the first one the student attempted they watched the video over there  and you can see eventually
  they were able to get ten in a row it 's almost like you can see them learning over those last ten problems they also got faster the height is how long it took them
 when you talk about self paced learning it makes sense for everyone in education speak differentiated learning 
 but it 's kind of crazy what happens when you see it in a classroom  because every every time we 've done this in every classroom we 've done 
 over and over again if you go five days into it  there 's a group of kids who 've raced ahead and a group
 who are a little bit slower
 in a traditional model in a snapshot assessment you say these are the gifted kids  these are the slow kids maybe they should be tracked differently maybe we should put them in different classes 
 but when you let students work at their own pace we see it over and over and over again
 you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other  but once they get through that concept they just race ahead and so the same kids that you thought were slow
  slow six weeks ago  you now would think are gifted and we 're seeing it over and over and over again it makes you really wonder
 how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from
 were really just due to a coincidence of time
 now as valuable as something like this is in a district like los altos
  our goal is is to use technology to humanize not just in los altos but on a global scale what 's happening in education and that that
 brings up an interesting point  a lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios in our mind the relevant metric is
  ratio  so in a traditional model most of the teacher 's time is spent doing lectures and grading and whatnot maybe five percent of their time is sitting next
  to students and working with them 
 now one hundred percent of their time is so once again using technology not just flipping the classroom  
 you 're humanizing the classroom i 'd argue by a factor of five or ten
 as valuable as that is in los altos imagine what it does to the adult learner who 's embarrassed to go back and learn stuff they should have known before before going back to
  imagine what it does to
 a street kid in calcutta 
 who has to help his family during the day and that 's the reason he or she can 't go to school now they can spend two hours a day and remediate or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or or don 't know 
 now imagine what happens where we talked about the peers teaching each other
 inside of a classroom  but this is all one system there 's no reason why you can 't have that
 peer to peer tutoring beyond that one classroom  imagine what happens if
 that student in calcutta all of the sudden can tutor your son or your son can tutor that kid in calcutta  and i think what you 'll see emerging is this notion
 of
  what we 're trying to build  thank you
  motivation and feedback energy points merit badges  tell me
 what you 're thinking there sk oh yeah no we have an awesome team working on it i have to be clear it 's not just me anymore  i 'm still doing all the videos but we have a rock star team doing the software
  we 've put a bunch of game mechanics in there where you get badges we 're going to start having leader boards by area  you get
 points it 's actually been pretty interesting just the wording of the badging or how many points you get for doing something we see on a system wide basis like tens of thousands of
 going one direction or another depending what
 badge you give them bg 
 and the collaboration you 're doing with los altos  how did that come about 
 sk los altos it was kind of crazy once again i didn 't expect it to be used in classrooms
  someone from from their board came and said what would you do if you had carte blanche in a classroom
  something like this we 'd give a dashboard they said this is kind of radical we have to think about it me and the rest of the team were like 
 they 're never going to want to do this but literally the next day they were like can you start in two weeks
  only in school on christmas we saw some of the kids were doing it we can track everything
 track them as they go through the entire district through the summers as they go from one teacher to the next you have this continuity of of data that that even at the district level they can see bg 
 so some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what 's going on with those those kids  
 so you 're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they think they need
   most of those were were specs by the teachers we made some of those for students so they could see their data but we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves and 
 this is nice but like that focus graph a lot of the teachers said i have a feeling a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic so we made that focus diagram
  it 's been pretty crazy bg is this ready for prime time do you think a lot of  classes next school year should try this thing out sk yeah  it 's ready 
 we 've got a million people on the site already so we can handle a few more 
 laughter no no reason why why it really can 't happen in every classroom in america tomorrow bg 
 and the vision of the tutoring thing the idea there is if i 'm confused about a topic somehow right in the user interface
  i 'd find people who are volunteering maybe see their reputation  and i could schedule and connect up with those people sk absolutely and this is something i recommend everyone in this audience 
 do those dashboards the teachers have you can go log in right now and you can essentially become a coach for your your kids your nephews your cousins or maybe some kids at the boys and girls club
  really immediately but yeah it 's all there bg well it 's amazing i think you just got a glimpse of the future of education
