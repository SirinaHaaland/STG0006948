  trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations  
 but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs trees become very dynamic entities moving and growing  and i decided to
  explore this movement by turning trees into artists  
 i simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig  i waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas and that produced art the piece of art you see on your left is 
 painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a douglas fir  and what i learned was that different species have different signatures
  like a picasso versus a monet  but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it  
 so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree which produced this painting moved in a single year  i simply measured and summed each of those lines  
 i multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes
  and so i was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year 
 you might have a guess the answer is actually one hundred and eighty six thousand five hundred and forty miles or seven times around the globe  and so simply by shifting 
  our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities  but rather extremely dynamic  
 began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees to consider other entities that are also static and stuck  but which cry for change and dynamicism  
 and one of those entities is our prisons prisons of course are where people who break our laws are stuck  confined behind bars  and our prison system itself is stuck  
 the united states has over two point three million incarcerated men and women 
  that number is rising 
 of the one hundred incarcerated people that are released sixty will return to prison  funds for education for training and for rehabilitation are declining so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues 
 i decided to ask whether the lesson i had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons  
 and i think the answer is yes
  the year two thousand and seven i started a partnership with the washington state department of corrections working with four prisons we began bringing science
 and scientists  sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons  we give science lectures and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting 
 that i think is movement  we partnered with the nature conservancy for inmates at stafford creek correctional center to
  grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in washington state 
 that i think is movement  we worked with the washington state department of fish and wildlife to grow endangered frogs the oregon spotted frog for later release into protected wetlands that i think is movement  
 and just recently we 've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call supermax facilities they 've incurred
  violent infractions
 by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners they 're kept in bare cells like this for twenty three hours a day when they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals they 're placed in immobile booths like this 
 for one hour a day they 're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards
  although we can 't bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards  putting them on the walls so at least they get contact with visual images of nature 
 this is mr lopez who has been in solitary confinement for eighteen months and he 's providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene more calm  less apt to
  and so what we see i think is that small  collective movements of change can perhaps move
 an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope  
 we know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks 
 but if trees can create art if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year  if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs then perhaps there are other static entities
 that we hold inside ourselves like grief like addictions  like racism that can also change thank you very much
