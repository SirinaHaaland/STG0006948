  for four months with
 three wishes and all the ideas will start to percolate up  i think everybody should do it think that you 've got three wishes and what would you do it 's actually a great exercise to to really
 drill down to the things that you feel are important and really reflect on on the world around us and thinking that can an individual actually
 do something or come up with something that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference  inspired by nature
 that 's the theme here  and i think quite frankly that 's where i started  i
 became very interested in the landscape as a canadian
  we have this great north and there was a pretty small population and my father was an avid outdoorsman  so i really had a chance to experience that and
 i could never really understand exactly what it was or how it was informing me but what i think it was telling me is that
 is that we are this transient
 thing that 's happening   and that the the nature that you see out there the untouched shorelines the untouched forest that i was able to
  see really
 bring in a sense of that
 geological time that this has gone on for a long time and we 're experiencing it in a different way and that to me  was
 a reference point that i think i needed to have to be able to make the work that i did and i did go out and i did this
 picture of grasses coming through
 in the spring  along a roadside this rebirth of grass and then i went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape 
 but as a fine art photographer i somehow felt that it wouldn 't
 catch on out there that there would be a problem with trying to make this
 as a fine art career and i kept kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture or something of that nature and i couldn 't get away from it
  so i started to think of how can i rethink
 the landscape i decided to rethink the landscape as the landscape that we 've transformed i had a bit of an epiphany being lost in pennsylvania and i took a
 a left turn trying to get back to the highway and i ended up in a town called frackville i got out of the car and i stood up and it was a
  i did a three hundred and sixty turnaround  
 and that became one of the most surreal landscapes i 've ever seen  totally transformed by man and that that got me to go out and look at mines like this and go out and look at the largest
 industrial incursions in the landscape that i could find  and that became the baseline of what i was doing  and it also became the theme that i felt that i could hold onto and not have to re invent myself that this theme was large enough
  to become a life 's work to become something that i could sink my teeth into and just
 research and find out where these industries are  and i think
 one of the things i also wanted to to say in my thanks which i kind of missed was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in because it took
 negotiation
 for almost every one of these photographs to get into that place to make those photographs and if it wasn 't for those people letting me in
 at the heads of those corporations i would have never made this body of work  so in that respect
  to me  i 'm not against the corporation  i own a corporation i
 work with them and i feel that we all need them and they 're important but i am also for sustainability so there 's
  this thing that is pulling me in both directions and i
 'm not making an indictment towards what 's happening here  but it is a slow progression so
 i started thinking well we live in all these ages of man the stone age and the iron age and the copper age  and these ages of man are still at work today but we 've become totally disconnected from them  there 's something that
 that we 're not seeing there
  and it 's a scary thing as well because when we start looking at the collective appetite for our lifestyles and what we 're doing to that landscape
 that to me  is something that is a very sobering moment
 for me to contemplate and through my photographs i 'm hoping to be able to engage the
 audiences of my work  and to come up to it and not
  but to be challenged by it to say wow this is beautiful on one level but on on the other level this is scary i shouldn 't be enjoying it like a forbidden pleasure  
 and it 's that forbidden pleasure
 that i think is what resonates out there and it gets people to look at these things and it gets people to enter it  and it also in a way defines
 kind of what i feel
  i 'm drawn to have a good life i want a house and i want a car but there 's this consequence out there and how do i begin to have that attraction repulsion
 it 's even in my own conscience i 'm having it and here in my work i 'm trying to build that same toggle  
 these things that i photographed
 this tire pile here had
 forty five million tires in it it was the largest one it was only about an hour and a half away from me and it caught fire about four years ago  it 's around westley california around modesto
 and i decided to start looking at something that  to me had
 if the earlier work of looking at the landscape had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature 
 in the recycling work that you 're seeing here was starting to point to a direction to me it was our redemption that in the recycling work
 that i was doing i 'm looking for
 a practice a human activity that is sustainable that if we
  keep putting things through industrial and and urban
 existence back into the system if we keep doing that we can continue on of course listening at the conference there 's many many things that are coming bio mimicry and there 's many other things that are coming on stream nanotechnology that may
 also
 prevent us from having to go into that into that landscape and tear it apart
  and we all we all look forward to those things but in the meantime these things are scaling up these things are continuing to happen what you 're looking at here
 i went to bangladesh so i started to move away from north america i started to look at our world globally these images of bangladesh came out of
 a radio program i was listening to they were talking about exxon
  that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers because of the insurance industries  
 and that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned and two thousand and four was going to be the pinnacle and i thought my god wouldn 't that be something to see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand literally in third world countries 
 so originally i was going to go to india  and i was shut out of india because of a greenpeace situation there  and then i was able to get into bangladesh
  a third world a view of it that i had never actually thought was possible 
 one hundred and thirty million people living in an area the size of wisconsin people everywhere the pollution was intense and the working conditions were horrible 
 here you 're looking at some oil fields in california some of the biggest oil fields
  and again i started to think that there was another epiphany that
 the whole world i was living in was
 a result of having plentiful oil
  and that to me was again something that i started building on and i continued to build on so this is
 a series i 'm hoping to have ready in about two or three years
  under the heading of the oil party because i think everything that we 're involved in our clothing our cars our roads and everything are directly a result i 'm
 going to move to
 to some pictures of china  and for me china
 i started photographing it four years ago and china truly is a question of sustainability in my mind not to mention that china as well has a great effect on the industries that i grew up around i came out of a blue collar town a gm town  
 and my father worked at gm so i was very
 familiar with with that kind of industry and that also informed
 informed my work  but you know 
 to see china and the scale at which it 's evolving is quite something 
 so what you see here is the three three gorges dam  and this is the largest dam by fifty percent
 ever attempted by man most of the engineers around the world left the project because they said it 's just too big
  it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago
  they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning it took fifteen days to fill it so this this created a reservoir six hundred kilometers long one of the largest reservoirs ever created 
 and
 what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving
  out of the reservoir and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships this is a before and after so that was before and this is like ten weeks later  
 demolished by hand i think eleven of the buildings they used dynamite everything else was by hand that was ten weeks later and
 this gives you an idea  and it was all the people who lived in those homes were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart
  and these are some of the images from that so i spent about three trips to the three gorges dam looking at that massive transformation of a landscape 
 and it looks like a bombed out landscape but it isn 't what it is it 's
 a landscape that is an intentional one this is
 a need for power  and they 're willing to go through this massive transformation on this scale
  to get that power  
 and again
  it 's actually a relief for what 's going on in china because i think on the table right now there 's twenty seven nuclear power stations to be built  
 there hasn 't been one built in north america for twenty years because of the nimby problem not in my backyard but in china they 're saying
  hydroelectric power literally
 weekly  so coal itself is probably one of the largest problems  
 and one of the other things that happened in the three gorges a lot of the agricultural land that you see there
 on the left was also lost some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that and one point two to two million people were relocated depending on whose statistics you 're looking at
  is what they were building this is wushan one of the largest cities that was relocated this is 
  the town hall for the city 
 and again the rebuilding of the city
 to me it was sad to see that they didn 't really grab a lot of i guess what we know here in terms of urban planning there were no parks there were no green spaces 
  on the side of a hill and here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up but somehow were not connecting with them 
 here is a sign that that  translated says obey the birth control law  build our science civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth so here if you look at this poster  
 it has all the trappings of western culture you 're seeing
 the tuxedos the bouquets but what 's really
 to me frightening about the picture
 and about this billboard is the refinery in the background so it 's like marrying up all the things that we have and it 's an adaptation of
 of our way of life  full stop and again when you start seeing that kind of
 embrace  and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle with a very
  very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle with a much higher footprint it starts to become very sobering this is a shot in one of the biggest squares
 in guangdong and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country and there 's about one hundred and thirty million people
 in migration trying to get into urban centers at all times and in the next
 ten to fifteen years are expecting another four
  five hundred million people to migrate into the urban centers like shanghai and the manufacturing centers the manufacturers
 are the domestics are usually you can tell a domestic factory by the fact that they all use the same
 color uniforms so this is a pink uniform at this factory it 's a shoe factory and they have dorms for the
  so they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms  this is one of the biggest shoe factories the yuyuan shoe factory near shenzhen
 it has ninety thousand employees making shoes  
 this is a shift change one of three there 's two factories of this scale in the same town  this is one with forty five thousand so
 every
 lunch there 's about twelve thousand coming through for lunch they sit down they have about twenty minutes the next round comes in it 's an incredible workforce
 that 's
 that 's building there  shanghai i 'm looking at the urban renewal in shanghai and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years 
 what 's also happening in shanghai is china is changing because this wouldn 't have happened five years ago for instance this is a holdout
  called dengzahoos they 're like pin tacks to the ground  they won 't move they 're not negotiating they 're not getting enough so they 're not going to move  and so they 're holding off until
 they get a deal with them and they 've been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a raw deal they 're being put out about two hours
 the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years or maybe even thousands of years are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas outside of shanghai  
 but these are a whole series of of guys holding
  out in this reconstruction of shanghai  probably the largest
  project i think ever attempted on the planet  and then the embrace of the things that they 're replacing it with again
 one of my wishes and i never ended up going there was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house
  the kinds of collisions of styles and things were
 were quite something  and these are called the villas 
 and also like right now they 're just moving the scaffolding is still on and this is an e waste area 
 and if you looked in the foreground on the big print you 'd see that the industry their industry they 're all recycling so the industry 's already growing around these new new
  was a very intriguing city it 's exploding on a level that that i don 't think any city has experienced in fact even shenzhen
  the economic zone one of the first ones
 fifteen years ago was about one hundred thousand people and today it boasts about ten to eleven million so that gives you an idea of the kinds
  migrations and the speed with which this is just the taxis being built by volkswagen
 there 's nine thousand of them here and they 're being built for
 for most of the big cities beijing and shanghai  shenzhen  and this isn 't even the domestic car market this is the
  put twenty or forty up at a time  and they just go up in the same way as
 as a single family dwelling would go up here in an area  and the density is quite quite
  and one of the things in this picture that i wanted to point out is that
 when i saw these kinds of buildings i was shocked to see that
 they 're not using a central air conditioning system every window
 has an air conditioner in it and i 'm sure there are people here who probably know better than i do about efficiencies
  but i can 't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale and when you start looking at that and then you start factoring up into
 a city the size of shanghai  it 's literally a forest of skyscrapers  it 's
 breathtaking in terms of the speed at which this
 city is transforming and you can see in the foreground of this picture  it 's still
 one of the last areas that was being held up right now that 's all cleared out this was done about eight months ago and high rises are now going up into that central spot so
  built literally overnight in
 in shanghai 
 most recently i went in and i started looking at some of the biggest industries in in china and this is baosteel right outside of
  this is the coal supply for the steel factory eighteen square kilometers  it 's an incredibly
 massive operation  
 i think fifteen thousand workers five cupolas and the sixth one 's coming in here  so they 're building very large
 blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel
  so this is
 three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot  and again looking at these images there 's this constant like haze that you 're seeing this is going to show you real time 
 an assembler it
 's a circuit breaker
  with china is that they 're using a lot of the latest
 production technology in that one there were four hundred people that worked on the floor and i asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers  
 and then i went and looked at each one of them for about fifteen or twenty minutes and picked
 this one woman  and it was just lightning fast
 way she was working was almost unbelievable but that that is the trick that they 've got
 right now that they 're winning with is that they 're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines and bringing all the components into into play  
 but the assembly is where they 're actually
 bringing in the country workers are very
 willing to work they want to work there 's a massive backlog of
 people wanting their jobs  that condition 's going to be there for the next ten to fifteen years if
 realize what they want which is you know four hundred to five hundred million more people coming into the cities in this particular case this is the assembly line that you saw this is a shot of it i had 
  to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field i had to have them freeze for ten seconds to get this shot
  to slow them down was literally impossible they were just wound up doing these things all day long until the manager had to with a stern voice
  five hundred of these machines they 're worth about two hundred thousand dollars each so you have about twelve people running this and they 're just inspecting it and they 're just walking the lines the machines are all running absolutely incredible to see to see what
 the scale of industries are and i started getting in further and further
 into
 the factories
  that 's a diptych i do a lot of pairings to try and get the sense of scale in these places  this is a line where they get the threads and they wind the threads together
  into the textile mills  here 's something that 's far far more labor intensive which is
 the making of shoes this floor has about one thousand five hundred workers on this floor  the company
  had about ten thousand employees  and they 're doing
 domestic shoes  
 it was very hard to get into the international companies because i had to get permission from companies like nike and adidas and that 's very hard to get and they don 't want to let me in but the domestic was much easier to do it just gives you a sense of 
 again 
 and that 's where really the whole migration of jobs started going over to
  it was such a high labor component to it that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market  this is
 a high tech mobile phone bird mobile phone one of the largest mobile makers in china 
 i think mobile phone companies are popping up literally on a weekly basis  and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones
  textile where they 're doing shirts youngor the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in china and
 this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms  everything is very efficient
 while setting up this shot people on average would spend eight to ten minutes having a lunch  
  one of the biggest factories i 've ever seen they make coffeemakers here the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest
  iron makers they make twenty million of them in the world there 's twenty one thousand employees
  this one factory and they had several of them is half a kilometer long these are just recently shot i just came back about a month ago  so you 're the first ones to be seeing these 
 these new factory pictures i 've taken
  so it 's taken me almost a year to gain access into these into these places 
 the other aspect of of what 's happening in china is that there there 's a real need for materials there  
 so a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to china
 by ships that 's cubed metal 
  from electrical motors
 out and recycling them  
 this is certainly connected to california and silicon valley but this is what happens to most of the computers fifty percent of the world 's computers end up in china to be recycled 
 it 's referred to as e waste there  and it is a bit of a problem the way they recycle the boards is that they actually
 use the coal briquettes which are used all through china
  they heat up the boards and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components they 're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components but the toxic smells when you come into a town that 's that 's 
  actually doing this kind of burning of the boards you can smell it a good five or ten kilometers before you get there 
 in their backyards  even in their homes they 're burning boards if there 's a concern for for somebody coming by because it is considered
 in china to be illegal doing it but they can 't stop the
 the product from coming in  this portrait i 'm not usually known for portraits but i couldn 't resist this one where
  she 's been through mao and she 's been through the great leap forward and the cultural revolution 
 and now she 's sitting on her porch with with this e waste beside her it 's quite something  
 this is a road where it 's been shored up by by computer boards in one of the biggest towns
 where they 're recycling  so that 's the photographs that i wanted to show you i
 want to dedicate my wishes to my two
  they 've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while i 've been thinking  one 's megan the one of the right and katja there  and to me
 the whole notion the things i 'm photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress 
 and as much as there are great things around the corner and
 it 's palpable in this room of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems
 i 'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to
 have a positive effect and it isn 't something that isn 't just affecting our world but it starts to go up because i think
 we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down but
 but there 's a growing footprint that 's happening in asia and is growing at a rapid rapid rate  and so i don 't think we can equalize it so ultimately the strategy i think here is that we have to be very concerned
 about their evolution
  because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well 
 so part of my thinking and part of my wishes is sitting with these thoughts in mind  and thinking about
  their life going to be when they want to have children or when they 're ready to get married twenty years from now or whatever fifteen years from now and to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking in my work  and also
 for this incredible chance to have some wishes  wish one 
 i want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global
 conversation on sustainability  and it is through communications today that i believe that that is not an
  and i went in search i wanted to put
 what i had in mind
 hitch it onto something i didn 't want a wish just to start from nowhere one of them i 'm starting from almost nothing but the other one i wanted to find out what 's going on that 's working right now and 
 is a fantastic blog  and that
 blog is is now being visited by close to half a million people a month  and it just
  started about fourteen
 fourteen months ago and the beauty of what 's going on there is that the tone of the conversation
 is the tone that i like what they 're doing there is that they 're not
 i think the environmental movement has failed in that it 's used the stick too much it 's
  the apocalyptic tone too much it hasn 't sold the positive
 aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is
 about positive movements about how to change our world in a better way  quickly and it 's looking at technology and it 's looking at
 new energy saving devices and it 's looking at how to rethink and how to
  towards sustainability  and so for me one of the things that i thought
 would be to put some of my work in the service of of promoting the 
 website  some of you might know he 's a tedster stephen sagmeister and i
  can be placed into any kind of media they could be posted through the web they could be used as a
 billboard or a bus shelter or anything of that nature so we 're looking at this as trying to build out
  we ended up discussing was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text and the text is blasted all over what was unusual  
 according to stephen is less than five percent of of ads are actually
 leading with image and so in this case because
 it 's about a lot of these images and what they represent and the kinds of questions they bring up that we thought letting the images
 play out and bring someone
  images have to do and hopefully inspire people to go to that website so 
 and building that blog and it is a blog and i 'm hoping that it isn
 't i don 't see it as the kind of blog where we 're all going to follow each other to death this one is one that will spoke out and will go out and to start reaching because right now there 's conversations in
 india in china in south
  america there 's entries coming from all around the world i think there 's a chance to have a dialogue a conversation about sustainability at 
 and anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic wish two is more of the 
  one that i 'm trying to work with and this one is i wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas
  on and invent ideas on sustainability  
 and one of the things that came out allison who actually nominated me  said something earlier on in a brainstorming she said that recycling in canada had a fantastic entry
 into our psyche through
 kids between grade four and six and
  age seven is the age of reason so they 're into the age of reason  and 
 so it 's this great window where they actually are you can influence them  you know what happens at puberty you know we know that from earlier presentations so my
 my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids
 to start driving home ideas let them understand what sustainability is and that they have a vested interest in it to
  happen  and one of the
 ways i thought of doing it is to use my prize so i would take
 thirty thousand or forty thousand dollars of the winnings and the rest is going to be to manage this project but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands  but the other thing that i thought would be fantastic was to create these
 call them prize targets and so one could be for the best sustainable sustainable idea for an
 the best
 one for a household project  or it could be the best community project for sustainability  
 and i also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for in my world 
 and what would happen it 's a scalable thing and
 if we can get people to put in things whether it 's equipment like a
  to make the prize significant enough and to open it up to all the schools that that are public schools or schools
 that are with kids that age and make it a wide open competition for them to go after those prizes and to submit them and the prize has to be a verifiable thing so it 's not about 
 just ideas the art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them but the actual things have to be
  that way what 's happening is that we 're motivating
 a certain age group to start thinking and they 're going to push that up from the bottom up into 
 i believe into the households and parents will be reacting to it and trying to help them with the projects  and i think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability
 in a very positive way and starts to teach them  they know
  about recycling now  but they don 't really i think get sustainability in all the things and the energy footprint and how that matters 
 and to teach them to me would be a fantastic
 wish and it would be something that i would certainly put my shoulder into 
 and again in in my world the competition we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it and i like the words in my world because it gives possession
 of the world to the person who 's doing it it is my world it 's not someone else 's i want to help
  it i want to do something with it so i think it has
 a great opportunity to engage the imaginations and great ideas i think come from kids and engage their imagination into a project and do something for schools i think all schools could use
 extra equipment extra cash it 's going to be an incentive for them
 to do that
  these are some of the the ideas
 in terms of where we could possibly
 put in some some promotion for in my world 
 and wish three is imax film   so i was told i should do one for myself and i 've always wanted to actually get involved
 with doing something and the scale of my work and the kinds of ideas i 'm playing with when i first saw an imax film i
  there 's a real resonance between what i 'm trying to do and the scale of what i try to do as a  photographer and i think there 's a real possibility
 to reach new audiences if i had a chance so i 'm looking really for a mentor because i
 just had my birthday  i 'm fifty and i don 't have time to go back to school right now i 'm too busy  so i need somebody who can put me on
 a quick
 catch up course on how to do something like that and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this that would be fantastic so those are my three wishes
