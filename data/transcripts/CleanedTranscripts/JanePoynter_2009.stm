  the distinct pleasure
 of living inside two biospheres of course we all here in this room live in biosphere one i 've also lived in biosphere two and
  wonderful thing about that is that i get to compare biospheres and hopefully from that i get to learn something
 so what did i learn well here i am inside biosphere two making a pizza so i am harvesting the wheat in order to make the dough and then of course i have to 
 milk the goats and feed the goats in order to make the cheese it took me four months in biosphere two to make a pizza here in biosphere one well it takes me about two minutes because i pick up the phone and i call and say hey can you deliver the pizza
 so biosphere two was essentially a three acre entirely sealed miniature world that i lived in for two years and twenty minutes
 over the top it was sealed with steel and glass underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel essentially entirely sealed
 so we had our own miniature rainforest a private beach with a coral reef we had a savanna
 a marsh a desert we had our own half acre farm that we had to grow everything and of course we had our human habitat where we lived
 back in the mid eightys when we were designing biosphere two we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions i mean what is a biosphere back then yes i guess we 
  all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the earth right well you have to get a little more specific than that if you 're going to build one
  decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed that is nothing goes in or out at all no material
 and energetically open which is essentially what planet earth is
 this is a chamber that was one four hundredth the size of biosphere two that we called our test module and the very first day that this fellow john allen walked in to spend a couple
 days in there with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we 'd put in there to hopefully keep him alive
 the doctors were incredibly concerned that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something fungus but of course none of that happened
 and over the ensuing few years there were great sagas about designing biosphere two but by nineteen ninety one we finally had this thing built and it was time for us to go in and give it a go
 we needed to know is
  life this malleable can you take this biosphere that has evolved on a planetary scale and jam it into a little bottle and will it survive big questions
 and we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe if we were going to go to mars for instance would we take a biosphere with us to live in it we also wanted to know so we can understand more about the earth that we all live in
 well in nineteen ninety one it was
  finally time for us to go in and try out this baby lets take it on a maiden voyage
 will it work or will something happen that we can 't understand and we can 't fix thereby negating the concept of man made biospheres so eight of us went in four men and four women
 more on that later
 and this is the world that we lived in
 so on the top we had these beautiful rainforests and an ocean and underneath we had all this technosphere we called it which is where all the pumps and the valves 
  and the water tanks and the air handlers and all of that one of the biospherians called it garden of eden on top of an aircraft carrier and then also we had the human habitat of course with the laboratories and all of that
  farm
 the day i walked into biosphere two i was for the first time breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world except seven other people
 at that moment i became part of that biosphere and i don 't mean that in an abstract sense i mean it rather literally
 when i breathed out my
  fed the sweet potatoes that i was growing and we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes
 and those sweet potatoes became part of me in fact we ate so many sweet potatoes i became orange with sweet potato i literally was eating the same carbon over and over again
 i was eating myself in some strange sort of bizzare way
  when it came to our atmosphere however it wasn 't that much of a joke over the long term because it turned out that we were losing oxygen quite a lot of oxygen
 and we knew that we were losing cotwo and so we were working to sequester carbon good lord we know that term now we were growing plants like crazy we were taking their biomass 
  storing them in the basement growing plants going around around around trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere we were
 trying to stop carbon from going in to the atmosphere we stopped irrigating our soil as much as we could we stopped tilling so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air
 but our oxygen was going down faster than our cotwo was going up which was quite unexpected because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module and it was like playing atomic hide and seek we had lost
 seven tons of oxygen and we had no clue where it was
 and i tell you when you lose a lot of oxygen and our oxygen went down quite far it went from twenty one percent down to fourteen two percent my goodness do you feel dreadful
 i mean we were dragging ourselves around the biosphere and and we had sleep apnea at night so you 'd wake up gasping with breath because your your blood chemistry has changed and that you literally do that you stop breathing and then you
 take a breath and it wakes you up and it 's very irritating and everybody
  outside thought we were dying i mean the media made it sound like were were dying and i had to call up my mother every other day saying no mum it 's fine fine we 're not dead we 're fine we 're fine
 and the doctor was in fact checking us to make sure we were in fact fine but in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen and one day he couldn 't add up a line of figures and it was time for us to put
  oxygen in
 and you might think well boy your life support system was failing you wasn 't that dreadful yes
 in a sense it was terrifying except that i knew i could walk out the airlock door at any time if it really got bad though who was going to say i can
 't take it anymore
 not me that was for sure but on the other hand it was the scientific gold of the project because we could really crank this baby up as a scientific tool
 and see if we could in fact find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone and we did indeed find it and we found it in the concrete essentially 
 it had done something very simple we had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost it broke down it took oxygen out of the air it put cotwo into the air and it went into the concrete
 pretty straightforward really so
 at the end of the two years when we came out we were elated because in fact although you might say we had discovered something that was quite
 uhh when your oxygen is is going down
 stopped working essentially in your life support system that 's a very bad failure except that we knew what it was and we knew how to fix it and nothing else emerged that really was as serious as that and we proved the concept more or less
 people on the other hand was a different subject
  we were i don 't know that we were fixable
 we all went quite nuts i will say and the day i came out of biosphere two i was thrilled i was going to see all my family and my friends for two years i 'd been seeing people through the glass
 and everybody ran up to me and i recoiled they stank
 people stink we stink of hairspray and underarm
  deoderant and all kinds of stuff now we had stuff inside biosphere to keep ourselves clean
 but nothing with perfume and boy do we stink out here
 not only that but i lost touch of where my food came from i had been growing all my own food
 i had no idea what was in my food where it came from i didn 't even recognize half the names in most of the food
  that i was eating in fact i would stand for hours in the isles of shops reading all the names on all of the things people must have thought i was nuts
 it was it was really quite astonishing
 and i slowly lost track of where i was in this big biosphere in this big biosphere that we all live in in biosphere two i totally understood
 that
  i had a huge impact on my biosphere everyday and it had an impact on me very viscerally very literally
 so i went about my business paragon space development corporation a little firm i started with people while i was in the biosphere because i had nothing else to do
 and one of the things we did was try to figure out how small can you make these biospheres and what can you do with them and so we sent one onto the mir space station we had one on the shuttle and one on
  the international space station for sixteen months where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete multiple life cycles in space really pushing the envelope of understanding how malleable our life systems are
 and i 'm also proud to announce that you 're getting a sneak preview on friday we 're going to announce that we 're actually
 forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the moon
 which is going to be pretty fun and the legacy of that is a system that we were designing an entirely sealed system to grow
 formerly part of ethiopia
 is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful
 incredibly stark and i have no understanding of how people eke out a living there it is so dry
 this is what i saw but this is also what i saw i saw a company that had taken seawater
 and sand and they were growing
 a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it and it will produce a food crop in this case it was oilseed
 it was astonishing they were also producing mangroves in a plantation
 and the mangroves where providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals so that they could produce milk and whatnot like we had in the biosphere and all
  it was coming from this shrimp farms shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth frankly from an environmental point of view they pour huge amounts of pollutants 
  into the ocean they also pollute their next door neighbors so they 're all shitting each other 's ponds quite literally
  turning pollution into abundance for a desert people they had created an industrial ecosystem of a sense i was there because i was actually modeling 
  the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program under the u n kyoto protocol system
 in in a mangrove forest like this i have no idea well of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the earth and understand its interactions with the entire earth and put your project in that context
 around the world today we 're seeing an incredible transformation from what i would call a biocidal species
 one that whether we
  intentionally or unintentionally have designed our systems to kill life a lot of the time
 this is in fact this beautiful photograph is in fact over the amazon
 and here the light green are areas of massive deforestation and those beautiful wispy clouds are in fact fires human made fires
 we 're in the process of transforming from this
  this to what i would call a biophilic society one where we learn to nurture society
 now it may not seem like it
 but we are it is happening all across the world in every kind of walk of life and every kind of career and industry that you can think of
 and i think often times people get lost in that they go but how
  can i possibly find my way in that it 's such a huge subject
 and i would say that the small stuff counts it really does this is the story of a rake in my backyard
 this was my backyard very early on when i bought my property and in in arizona of course everybody puts gravel
 down and they like to keep everything beautifully raked and they keep all the leaves away and on sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out and i want to throttle them
 it 's a certain type of aesthetic we 're very uncomfortable with untidiness
 and
 i threw away my rake
 and i let all of the leaves fall from the trees that i have on my property
 and over time essentially what have i been doing i 've been building topsoil and so now all the birds come in and i have hawks and i
  have an oasis
 this is what happens every spring for six weeks six to eight weeks i have this flush of green oasis this is actually in a riparian area
  and all of tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake the small stuff counts
 this the ability to light up the world
 it has also given us this the ability to look at the world from the outside now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to and compare it to this biosphere
 but we can look at the world and try to understand where we are in its context and
  how we chose to interact with it
 and if you lose where you are in your biosphere or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting with where you are in the biosphere
 i would say to you
 take a deep breath
 the yogis had it right breath does in fact connect us all in a very literal way take a breath now
 and as you breathe think about what is in your breath
 there perhaps is the cotwo from the person sitting next door to you
 maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here
 it also connects us in time there may be some carbon in your breath
  breath from the dinosaurs
 there could also be carbon that you are exhaling now that will be in the breath
 of your great great great grandchildren
