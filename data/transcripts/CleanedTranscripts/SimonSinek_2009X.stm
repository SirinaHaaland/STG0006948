  how do you explain when things don 't go as we assume  or better 
 how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions 
 for example why is apple so innovative year after year after year
  year  they 're more innovative than all their competition 
 and yet they 're just a computer company  they 're just like everyone else  they have the same access to the same talent the same agencies the same consultants the same media 
 then why is it that they seem to have something different 
 why is it that martin luther king
 led the civil rights movement  he wasn 't the only man
 who suffered in
 and he certainly wasn 't the only great orator of the day  why him  and why is it
 that the wright brothers were able to figure out controlled powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified better funded
 and they didn 't achieve powered man flight and the wright brothers beat them to it there
  there 's something else at play here 
 about three and a half years ago  i made a discovery  and this discovery profoundly changed my view
 on how i thought the world worked and it even profoundly changed the way in which i operate in it  
 as it turns out there
 's a pattern as it turns out all the great inspiring leaders and organizations in the world whether it 's apple or martin luther king or the wright brothers they all think
 and communicate the exact same way  and it 's the complete opposite
 to everyone else 
 all i did was codify it  
 and it 's probably the world 's simplest idea 
 i call it the golden circle 
  this little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren 't let me define the terms really quickly 
 every single person every single organization on the planet knows what they do  one hundred percent 
 some know how they do it  whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your usp but very very few people
  organizations
 know why they do what they do 
 and by why i don 't mean to make a profit that 's a result  it 's always a result by why i mean what 's your purpose what 's your cause what 's your belief  
 why does your organization exist 
 why do you get out of bed in the morning  and why should anyone care
  as a result the way we think we act the way we communicate is from the outside in it 's obvious we go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing  
 but the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations
 regardless of their size regardless of their industry
 all think act and communicate
 from the inside out 
 let me give you an example i use apple because they 're easy to understand and everybody gets it if apple were like everyone else 
 a marketing message from them might sound like this
 we make great computers  they 're beautifully designed  simple to use and user friendly  want to buy one meh
 that 's how most of us communicate that 's how most marketing and sales are done that 's how we communicate interpersonally we say what we do we say how we 're different or better and we expect some sort
  a purchase a vote something like that here 's our new law firm 
 we have the best lawyers with the biggest clients we always perform for our clients here 's our new car  it gets great gas mileage it has
 leather seats buy our car  but it 's uninspiring here 's how apple actually communicates 
 everything we do we believe
 in challenging the status quo we believe
 in thinking differently the way we challenge the status
  quo is by making our products beautifully designed  simple to use and user friendly  we just happen to make great computers  want to buy one 
 totally different right you 're ready to buy a computer from me i just reversed the order of the information what it proves to us is that people don 't buy what you do  people buy why you do it
  room
 is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from apple 
 but we 're also perfectly comfortable buying an mp3 player from apple or a phone from apple or a dvr from apple
 as i said before apple 's just a computer company nothing distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products in fact they tried a few years ago  gateway came out with
  they 're eminently qualified to make flat screen tvs they 've been making  flat screen monitors for years nobody bought one
  dell came out with mp3 players and pdas 
 and they make great quality products and they can make perfectly  well designed products
 and nobody bought one in fact talking about it now we can 't even imagine buying an
  from dell why would you buy one from a computer company  but we do it every day 
 people don 't buy what you do they buy why you do it the goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have 
 the goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe  
 here 's the best part none of what i 'm telling you is my opinion  it 's all grounded in the tenets of biology
  psychology biology  
 if you look at a cross section of the human brain  from the top down the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle 
 our newest brain our homo sapien brain our neocortex 
 corresponds with the what level the neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language
  middle two sections make up our limbic brains and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings like trust
 and loyalty  
 it 's also responsible for all human behavior  all decision making and it has no capacity for language 
 in other words when we communicate from the outside in yes people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures
  doesn 't drive behavior  when we can communicate from the inside out we 're talking directly to the part of the brain
 that controls behavior  and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do  this is where gut decisions come from
 sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures and they say i know what all the facts and details say but it just doesn 't feel right why would we use that verb it doesn 't
  the part of the brain that controls decision making doesn 't control language  the best we can muster up is i don 't know it just doesn 't feel right or sometimes you say you 're leading with your heart or soul i hate to break it to you those aren 't
 other body parts controlling your behavior  it 's all happening here in your limbic brain the part of the brain that controls decision making and not language 
  but if you don 't know why you do what you do  and people
 respond to why you do what you do  then how will you ever get people to to vote for you or buy something from you or more importantly be loyal
 and want to be a part of what it is that you do the goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe  
 the goal is not just to hire people
 who need a job  it 's to hire people who believe what you believe  i always say that
 you know if you
 hire people just because they can do a job they 'll work for your money but if they believe what you believe they 'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears 
 nowhere else is there a better example than with the wright brothers 
 most people don 't know about samuel pierpont langley  and back in the early
  the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day everybody was trying it 
 and samuel pierpont langley had what we assume to be the recipe for success
 even now you ask people why did your product or why did your company fail and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things
 under capitalized the wrong people bad market conditions it 's always the same three things so let 's explore that samuel pierpont langley
 was given fifty thousand
  dollars by the war department to figure out this flying machine money was no problem 
 he held a seat at harvard and worked at the smithsonian and was extremely well connected he knew all the big minds of the day  
 he hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic  the new york times followed him around
  everyone was rooting for langley  then how come we 've never heard of samuel pierpont langley a few hundred miles away in dayton ohio  
 orville and wilbur wright they had none
 of what we consider to be the recipe for success they had no money they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop 
 not a single person on the wright brothers ' team had a college education not even orville or
  and the new york times followed them around nowhere  
 the difference was orville and wilbur were driven by a cause by a purpose by a belief they believed that if they could figure out this flying machine it
 'll change the course of the world  
 samuel pierpont langley was different  he wanted to be rich  and he wanted to be famous  he was in pursuit of the result he was in pursuit of the
  and lo and behold look what happened the people who believed
 in the wright brothers ' dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears  the others just worked for the paycheck
 they tell stories of how every time the wright brothers went out they would have to take five sets of parts because that 's how many times they would crash before supper 
 and eventually on
 december 17th one thousand nine hundred and three the wright
  and no one was there to even experience it  we found out about it a few days later  
 and further proof that langley was motivated by the wrong thing the day the wright brothers took flight  
 he quit  
 he could have said that 's an amazing discovery guys and i will improve upon your technology 
 but he didn 't  he wasn 't first  he didn 't get rich  he didn 't get famous so he quit 
 people don 't buy what you do they buy why you do it  if you talk about what you
  believe you will attract those who believe what you believe but why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe  
 something called the law of diffusion of innovation if you don 't know the law you know the terminology the first
 two point five % of our population are our innovators the next
  of our population are our early adopters  the next thirty four % are your early majority your late majority and your laggards 
 the only reason these people buy touch tone phones is because you can 't buy rotary phones anymore 
 we all sit at various places at various times on this scale but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us
 is that if you want mass market success or
  acceptance of an idea you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between fifteen and eighteen percent market penetration and then the system
 tips
 i love asking businesses what 's your conversion on new business they love to tell you it 's about ten percent proudly well you can trip over ten % of the customers 
 we all have about ten % who just get it that 's how we describe them right that 's like that gut feeling oh they just get it the problem is how do you find the ones that get it before doing business versus the ones who don 't get it
 so it 's this here this little gap
 that you have to close as jeffrey moore calls it crossing the chasm because you see the early majority will not try something until someone else
 has tried it first  and these guys  the innovators and the early adopters  they 're comfortable making those gut
  they 're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world
 and not just what product is available these are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iphone when they first came out when you could have bought one off the shelf the next week
 these are the people who spent forty thousand dollars on flat screen tvs when they first came out even though the technology was substandard 
  by the way they didn 't do it because the technology was so great 
 they did it for themselves  it 's because they wanted to be first 
 people don 't buy what you do they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe 
 in fact people will do the things that prove what they believe  
 the reason that person bought the iphone in the first six hours stood  in line for six hours 
 was because of what they believed about the world and how they wanted everybody to see them  they were first
 people don 't buy what you do they buy why you do it  so let me give you a famous example a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation 
 first the famous failure it
 's a commercial example  
 as we said before the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions you should have success then
  look at tivo from the time tivo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day  they are the single
  product on the market hands down there is no dispute  
 they were extremely well funded market conditions were fantastic  i mean we use tivo as verb i tivo stuff on my piece of junk time warner dvr all the time 
 but tivo 's a commercial
  they 've never made money 
 and when they went ipo their stock was at about thirty or forty dollars and then plummeted and it 's never traded above ten 
 in fact i don 't think it 's even traded above six except for a couple of little spikes 
 because you see when tivo launched their product they told us all what they had 
 they said we have a product that pauses live tv  skips commercials  rewinds live tv and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking
  and the cynical majority said we don 't believe you we don 't need it  we don 't like it you 're scaring us 
 what if they had said if you 're the kind of person
 who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life  boy do we have a product for you 
 it pauses live tv skips commercials memorizes your viewing habits
 people don 't buy what you do they buy why you do it and what you do simply serves as the proof
 of what you believe  now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation in the summer of one thousand nine 
 two hundred and fifty thousand people showed up on the mall in washington to
  they sent out no invitations 
 and there was no website to check the date how do you do that 
 well
 dr king wasn 't the only man in america who was a great orator  he wasn 't the only man in america who suffered in a pre civil rights america in fact some of his ideas were bad  
 but he had a gift 
 he didn 't go around telling people what needed to change in america he went around and told people what he believed
  i believe i believe he told people and people who believed what he believed took his cause and they made it their own and they told people and some of those people
 created structures to get the word out to even more people 
 and lo and behold  two hundred and fifty thousand people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak 
 how many of them showed up
 for him
 zero  
 they showed up for themselves  
 it 's what they believed about america that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in washington in the middle of august  
 it 's what they believed and it wasn 't about black versus white twenty five % of the audience was white
 dr king believed that there are two types of laws in this world those that are made by a higher authority
  and those that are made by men and not until all the laws that are made by men
 are consistent with the laws made by the higher authority will we live in a just world 
 it just so happened that the civil rights movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life  
 we followed not for him but for ourselves  by the way he gave
  listen to politicians now with their comprehensive 12 point plans they 're not inspiring anybody 
 because there are leaders and there are those who lead leaders hold a position of power or authority  but those who lead
 inspire us  whether they 're individuals or
  we follow those who lead not because we have to but because we want to we follow those who lead not for them  
 but for ourselves  
 and it 's those who start with why that have the ability
 to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them thank you very much
