  cholera was reported in haiti for the first time in over fifty years last october there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies
 and how bad the situation would get
  knowing where help was needed
 always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most 
 we 've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms before they take innocent lives and cause irreversible damage 
 but we still can 't do that with water 
 and here 's why right now if you want to test water in the field you need a trained technician expensive equipment like this
  and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results  it 's too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground
 before they change too expensive to implement in all the places that require testing and it ignores the fact that in the meanwhile people still need to drink water 
 most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak
 didn 't come from testing water  it came from
  forms like this which documented all the people we failed to help 
 countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines a simple and invaluable way for miners to know whether they 're safe 
 i 've been inspired by that simplicity as i 've been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people i 've ever known 
 we think there 's a simpler solution to this problem one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday
 's in its early stages  but this is what it looks like right now  
 we call it the water canary it 's a fast  cheap device that answers an important question is this water contaminated 
 it doesn 't require any special training and instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place 
  that means there 's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place no need to use reagents that can run out
 and no need to be an expert to get actionable information 
 to test water  you simply insert a sample and within seconds it either displays a red light  indicating contaminated water  or a green light indicating the sample is safe 
 this will make it possible for anyone to collect life saving information
 and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold
  we 're also on top of that integrating wireless networking into an affordable device
 with gps and gsm what that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be mapped in real time 
 with enough users maps like this will make it possible to take preventive
  containing hazards before they turn into emergencies that take years to recover from 
 and then instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most it can happen automatically  
 we 've seen how distributed networks big data
 and information can transform society  i think it 's time for us to apply them to water  our goal over the next year is to get water canary ready for the field
 and to open source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation so we can tackle this problem together  thank you
