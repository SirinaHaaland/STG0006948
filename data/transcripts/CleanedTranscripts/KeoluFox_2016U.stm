  as a little hawaiian my mom and auntie always told me stories about kalaupapa the hawaiian leper colony surrounded by the highest sea cliffs in the world
 and father damien the belgian missionary who gave his life for the hawaiian community as a young nurse my aunt trained the nuns
  caring for the remaining lepers almost a one hundred years after father damien died of leprosy 
 i remember stories she told about traveling down switchback cliff paths on a mule 
 while my uncle played her favorite hula songs on the ukulele all the way down to kalaupapa 
 you see as a youngster  i was always curious about a few things
  first was why a belgian missionary chose to live in complete isolation
 in kalaupapa knowing he would inevitably contract leprosy from the community of people
 he sought to help and secondly  
 where did the leprosy bacteria come from and why were knaka maoli the indigenous people of hawaii  
 so susceptible to developing leprosy or mai pake
  this got my curious about what makes us unique as hawaiians namely our genetic makeup  
 but it wasn 't until high school through the human genome project that i realized i wasn 't alone
 in trying to connect our unique genetic ancestry to our
 potential health wellness and illness you see the two point seven billion dollar project promised an era
 of predictive and preventative medicine based on our unique genetic
  makeup  so to me it always seemed obvious that in order to achieve this dream we would need to sequence a diverse cohort of people
 to obtain the full spectrum of human genetic variation on the planet that 's why
 ten years later it continues to shock me knowing that ninety six percent of genome studies associating common genetic variation with specific diseases have focused
  exclusively on individuals of european ancestry  now you don 't need a phd to see that that leaves four percent for the rest of diversity 
 and in my own searching 
 i 've discovered that far less than one percent have actually focused on indigenous communities like myself 
 so that begs the question  who is the human genome project actually for just like we have different colored eyes and hair
 we metabolize drugs differently based on the variation in our genomes so how many of you
 would be shocked to learn
 that ninety five percent
 of clinical trials have also exclusively featured individuals of european ancestry  
 this bias and systematic lack of engagement of indigenous people
 in both clinical trials and genome studies is partially the result
  of a history of distrust for example 
 researchers from arizona state university obtained blood samples from arizona 's havasupai tribe  
 promising to alleviate the burden of type two diabetes that was plaguing their community 
 only to turn around
 and use those exact same samples without the havasupai 's consent to study rates of schizophrenia
 and challenge the havasupai 's origin story  when the havasupai found out 
 they sued successfully for $ seven hundred thousand and
 they banned asu from conducting research on their reservation this culminated in a sort of
 domino effect with local tribes in the southwest including the navajo nation one of the largest tribes in the country putting a moratorium
  on genetic research now despite this history of distrust i still believe
 that indigenous people can benefit from genetic research and if we don 't do something soon 
 the gap in health disparities is going to continue to widen 
 hawaii for example  has the longest life expectancy on average of any state in the us  yet native hawaiians like myself
 die a full decade before
 non native counterparts  because we have some of the highest rates of type two diabetes  
 obesity and the number one and number two killers in the us cardiovascular disease and cancer  
 so how do we ensure the populations of people that need genome sequencing the most are not the last to benefit 
 my vision
 is to make genetic research more native to indigenize genome sequencing technology
 traditionally genomes are sequenced in laboratories  
 here 's an image of your classic genome sequencer it 's huge it 's the size of a refrigerator  
 there 's this obvious physical limitation  but what if
 you could sequence genomes on the fly what if you could fit a genome sequencer in your
  the size of your traditional genome sequencer  
 it doesn 't have the same physical limitations in that it 's not tethered to a lab bench with extraneous cords  large vats of chemicals or computer monitors 
 it allows us
 to de black box genome sequencing technology development in a way that 's immersive and collaborative  activating and empowering indigenous
  communities  
 as citizen scientists  
 one hundred years later in kalaupapa  
 we now have the technology to sequence leprosy bacteria in real time  using mobile genome sequencers  
 remote access to the internet
 and cloud computation  but only if that 's what hawaiian people want in our space
 on our terms
  about science for the people by the people we 'll be starting with a tribal consultation resource 
 focused on educating indigenous communities on the potential use and misuse of genetic information  
 eventually we 'd like to have our own indigenomics research institute to conduct our own experiments and educate
 the next generation of indigenous scientists in the end 
 indigenous people need to be partners in and not subjects of genetic research and for those on the outside  just as father damien did 
 the research community needs to immerse itself in indigenous culture
 or die
