  i would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals  there are ten thousand species of birds
 in the world vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds
  when you see a vulture like this the first thing that comes to your mind is these are disgusting 
 ugly  
 greedy creatures that are just after your flesh associated with politicians 
 i want to change that perception i want to change those feelings you have for these birds because they need our sympathy 
  and i 'll tell you why first of all why do they have such a bad press 
 when charles darwin went across the atlantic in one thousand eight hundred and thirty two on the beagle he saw the turkey vulture 
 and he said these are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads
 that are formed to revel in putridity you could not get a worse insult and that from
  you know he changed his mind when he came back and i 'll tell you why  they 've also be associated with disney 
 personified as goofy dumb  stupid characters
 more recently if you 've been following the kenyan press
 these are the attributes that they associated the kenyan mps with
 but i want to challenge that i want to challenge that do you know why  because mps
 do not keep the environment clean 
 mps do not help to prevent the spread of diseases  they are hardly monogamous
  there 's two types of vultures in this planet there are the new world vultures that are mainly found in the americas like the condors and the caracaras  
 and then the old world vultures where we have sixteen species from these sixteen eleven of them are facing a high
  risk of extinction  
 so why are vultures important  
 first of all they provide vital ecological services  they clean up they 're our natural garbage collectors  they clean up carcasses right to the bone  
 they help to kill all the bacteria they help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals
  studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures  
 carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose  and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases 
 vultures also have tremendous historical significance they have been associated in ancient egyptian culture  nekhbet
 was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood  and together with the cobra  symbolized the unity between
 upper and lower egypt in hindu mythology  jatayu was the vulture god  and he risked his life
 in order to save the goddess sita
 from the 10 headed demon ravana  
 in tibetan culture  they are performing very important sky burials in places like tibet there are no places to bury the dead or wood to cremate them  so these vultures provide a
  natural disposal system  
 so what is the problem with vultures  
 we have eight species of vultures that occur in kenya of which six are highly threatened with extinction 
 the reason is that they 're getting poisoned and the reason that they 're getting poisoned
 is because there 's  human wildlife conflicts the pastoral communities
  are using this poison to target predators and in return the vultures are falling victim to this 
 in south asia in countries like india and pakistan four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered 
 which means they have less than ten or fifteen years to go extinct and the reason is because they are falling prey
 by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like diclofenac this drug has now been banned for veterinary use in india and they have taken a stand
  because there are no vultures there 's been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites and when you have feral dogs you have a huge time bomb of rabies the number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in india 
 kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in africa  three hundred and fifty three wind turbines are going to be up at lake
  i am not against wind energy but we need to work with the governments because wind turbines do this to birds  they slice them in half they are  bird blending machines 
 in west africa there 's a horrific trade
 of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market  
 so what 's being done well we 're conducting research on these birds  we 're putting transmitters on them we 're trying to determine their basic ecology and see where they go
  we can see that they travel different countries so if you focus on a problem locally it 's not going to help you we need to work with governments in regional levels  
 we 're working with local communities 
 we 're talking to them about appreciating vultures about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide
  how can you help you can become active  make noise you can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very misunderstood creatures 
 volunteer your time to spread the word 
 spread the word when you walk out of this room  you will be informed about vultures  but speak to your families to your children to your neighbors about vultures
  changed his mind
