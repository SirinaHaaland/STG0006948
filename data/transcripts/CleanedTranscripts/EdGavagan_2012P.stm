  wake up in the morning  you get dressed put on your shoes you head out into the world
  you plan on coming back getting undressed going to bed
  waking up doing it again and that anticipation that rhythm  helps give us a structure
 to how we organize ourselves and our lives and gives it a
 measure of predictability living in new york city as i do 
 it 's almost as if with so many people doing so many things
 at the same time
  time in such close quarters it 's almost like life is dealing you extra hands out of that deck you
 're never there 's just juxtapositions are are possible that just aren 't you don 't think they 're going to happen 
 and you never think you 're going to be the guy who 's walking down the
  because you choose to go down one side or the other the rest of your life is changed forever
  and one one night i 'm riding the uptown local train i get on i tend to be
 a little bit vigilant when i get on
 the subway i 'm not one of the people zoning out with headphones or a book  and i get on the car and i look and
  guy and a girl and they 're sitting next to each other and she 's got her
 leg draped over his knee and they 're
 doing they
 have this little contraption and they 're tying these knots  and they 're doing it with one hand they 're doing it
 left handed and right handed very quickly and then she 'll hand the thing to him and he 'll do
  never seen anything like this it 's almost like they 're practicing magic tricks 
 and at the next stop a guy gets on the car and he has this
 sort of visiting professor look to him he 's got the overstuffed leather satchel and the
 rectangular file case and a laptop bag and the tweed jacket with the leather patches and 
 he looks at them  and then in a blink of an eye he kneels down in front of them  and he starts to
 listen here 's how you can do it look if you do this and he takes the laces out of their hand and instantly he starts tying these knots  and
 even better than they were doing it remarkably  
 and it turns out they are medical students on their way to a lecture about the latest suturing techniques  and he 's the guy giving the lecture
  tell them and he 's like no this is very important here you know  when you 're needing these knots  it 's going to be you know everything 's going to be happening at the same time
  it 's going to be
 you 're going to have all this information coming at you there 's going to be organs getting in the way it 's going to be slippery  and
 it 's just very important that you be able to do these beyond second nature each hand left
  right hand you have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers and at that moment when i heard that i just got catapulted out of the subway car
 into
 a night when i had been getting a ride in an ambulance from the sidewalk where i had been stabbed
 to the trauma room of st vincent 's hospital in manhattan
  and what had happened was
 a
 gang had come in from brooklyn as part of an initiation for three of their members they had to kill somebody  and i happened
 to be the guy walking down bleecker street that night  and they jumped on me without a word one of the very lucky
  when i was at notre dame i was on the boxing team so i put my hands up right away  instinctively 
 the guy on the right had a knife with a 10 inch blade  and he went in
 under my elbow  and it went up and
 cut my inferior vena cava 
 if you know anything about anatomy that 's not a good thing to get cut and everything of course on the way up and then i still had my hands up
 he pulled it out and went for my neck
  and sunk it in up to the hilt
 in my neck
  and i got one straight right punch and knocked the middle guy out the other guy was still working on me  collapsing my other lung  
 and i managed
 to by hitting that guy to get a minute i ran down the street and collapsed and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk and
  let the trauma room know they had an incoming  and one of the
 side effects of having major massive blood loss is you get tunnel vision  so i remember being on the stretcher and having a little 
 cone of vision and i was moving my head around and we got to st vincent 's and we 're racing down this hallway and i see the lights going
  and it 's a peculiar
 effect of of memories like that they don 't really go to the usual place that memories go they kind of have this
 vault where they 're stored in high def and george lucas did all the sound effects
  it 's not like
 any other kind of memories  and i get into the the trauma room and they 're waiting for me and the lights are there  and
 i
 'd been able to breathe a little more now because the the blood has left had been filling up my lungs and i was having a very hard time breathing but
 now it 's kind of gone into the stretcher and i said
  anything i can do to help and 
 laughter the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh  and i 'm turning my head trying to see everybody  and
 i had this weird memory of being in college and raising
 raising money for the flood victims of bangladesh  and then i look over and my anesthesiologist is clamping the mask on me and i think he looks bangladeshi
 and i just have those two facts and i just think this could work somehow and then i go i go out and
 they work on me for the rest of the night  and
 i needed about
 forty units of blood to keep me there while they
 did their work and the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines my
 cecum organs i didn 't know that i had and he later told me one of the last things he did while he was in there was to remove my appendix for me  which
 i thought was great you know just a little tidy thing there at the end and
 i came to in the morning  out of anesthetic he had let them know that he wanted to be there  and
 he had given me about a two percent chance of
  living  so he was there when i when i woke up and it was waking up was like breaking through the ice into
 a frozen lake of pain it was that
 enveloping  and there was only one spot
 that didn 't hurt worse than anything i 'd ever felt and it was my instep  and he was holding
 the arch of my foot and
 and rubbing the instep with his thumb  and i looked up and he 's like good to see you and
 i
 was trying to remember what had happened and trying to get my head around everything and the pain was just overwhelming  and he said you know we didn 't cut your hair
  you might have gotten strength from your hair like samson and you 're going to need all the strength you can get and in those days my hair was down to my waist
  i drove a motorcycle i was unmarried i owned a bar  so those were different times 
 but i had three days of life support
  the massive amount of what they had had to do that i wasn 't going to make it so it was three days of
 everybody was either waiting for me to die or poop  and when i finally
 pooped then that somehow surgically speaking that 's like you crossed some good line and um on that
  came in and
 whipped the sheet off of me he had three or four friends with him 
 and he does that and they all look and there was no infection and they bend over me and they 're poking and prodding and they 're like there 's no hematomas blah blah 
 look at the color and they 're talking amongst themselves and i 'm like this restored automobile that he 's just going yeah i did that
  these guys are high fiving him over
 how good i turned out you know and it 's my zipper  and i 've still got the staples in and everything  and
 later on when i got out and the the flashbacks and the
 nightmares were giving me a hard time i went back to him
 and 
 and i was sort of asking him  you know  what am i gonna do
  and i think kind of as a surgeon he basically said 
 kid i saved your life like now you can do whatever you want like   you gotta get on with that it 's like
 i gave you a new car and you 're complaining about
  and the subway doors are closing and
 my stop is next  and i look at these kids  and i go i think to myself i 'm going to lift my shirt up
  this is the new york city subway that 's going to lead to
 other things 
 and so i just think they got their lecture to go to i step off i 'm standing on the platform  and
 i feel my index finger in
 in the first scar that i ever got from my umbilical
  and then around that is traced the last scar that i got from my surgeon  
 and i
 think that that chance encounter with those kids on the street with their knives
 led me
 to my surgical team and their training
 and
  skill and always a little bit of luck pushed back against chaos
