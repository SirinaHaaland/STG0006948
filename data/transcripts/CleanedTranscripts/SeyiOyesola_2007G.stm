  just to put
 everything in context 
 and to kind of give you a background to where i 'm coming from so that a lot of the things i 'm going to say and the things i 'm going to do or
 things i 'm going to tell you i 've done
 you will understand exactly
 why and how i got motivated to
 to be where i am  i graduated high school in cleveland ohio 
 and just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad we went back home finished
 university education got a medical degree one thousand nine hundred and eighty six and by the time i was
 an intern house officer  i could barely afford to maintain my mother 's
 13 year old car and i was a paid doctor
 this brings us to why a lot of us who are professionals are now as they say in diaspora 
 now are we going to make that a permanent thing where we all get trained and we leave  
 and we don 't go back 
 perhaps not
  i should certainly hope not
 because that is not my vision all right  for good measure  that 's where nigeria is
 on the african map  and just there is the delta region
 that i 'm sure everybody 's heard of people getting kidnapped where the oil comes from the oil that sometimes i think has driven us all crazy
 in nigeria
  but critical poverty this slide is from a presentation i gave not that long ago
 tells the story of the gap between africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care very interesting
  how many people do you think
 are on that taxi and believe it or not that is a taxi in nigeria and the capital well  what used to be the capital
  of nigeria lagos  that 's a taxi and you have police on them so 
  how many policemen do you think are on this taxi  and now  three so when these
 kind of people and believe me it 's not just the police that use these taxis in in lagos  we all do i 've been on one of these and i didn 't have a helmet either
  and it just reminds me of the thought
 of what happens
 when
 one of us on a taxi like this
 falls off has an accident and needs a hospital believe it or not some of us do survive some of us do survive
  we do survive aids  and like i tell my family and my wife reminds me every time 
 you 're risking your life you know  every time you go to that country and she 's right  
 every time you go there  you know
 that if you actually need
 critical care
 critical care of any sort if you have an accident of which there are many there are accidents everywhere
 where do they go where do they go when they
  need
 help for this kind of stuff  i 'm not saying instead of 
 i 'm saying as well as aids  tb malaria  
 typhoid the list goes on i 'm saying where do they go when they 're like me 
 when i go back home and i do
 all kinds of things i teach  i train
 but i catch one of these things or i 'm chronically ill
  with one of those 
 where do they go what 's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled  
 i think it 's quite significant this is where they go 
 these are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden this is a major hospital in
  from a major teaching hospital in nigeria now that
 is less than a year old 
 in an operating room that 's sterilizing equipment in nigeria  you remember all that oil yes 
 i 'm sorry if it upsets some of you but i think you need to see this  that 's the floor  ok  you can say some of this is education you can say it 's
  i 'm not pleading poverty  i 'm saying we need more
 than just you know vaccination 
 malaria  aids  because i want to be treated in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there in fact when i start
 running around saying hey  boys and girls you 're cardiologists in the u s can you come home with me and do a mission i want them to think well there 's some
  have a look at that that 's the anesthesiology machine  and that 's my specialty right  anesthesiology and critical care
 look at that bag it 's been
 taped with tape that we even stopped using in the  u k and believe me these are current pictures now  if something like this 
 which
 has happened in the u k that 's where they go this is the intensive care unit
  this is a slide from a talk i gave about intensive care units in
 nigeria and jokingly we refer to it as expensive scare because it 's scary
 and it 's expensive  but we need to have it  ok 
 so these are the problems there are no prizes for
 telling us what the problems are
  i think we all know and
 several speakers before and speakers after me are going to tell us
 even more problems these are a few of them 
 so what did i do there we go we 're going on a mission we 're going to do some open heart surgery i was the only
 brit on a team of about nine american cardiac surgeons cardiac nurse intensive care nurse
  we all went out and did a mission and we 've done three of them so far just so you know  i do believe in missions i do believe in aid
 and i do believe in charity they have their place  but where do they go
 for those things we talked about earlier because it 's not everyone that 's going to benefit from a mission 
 health is wealth in the words of hans rosling
  you get
 wealthier faster
 if you are healthy first so here we are mission big trouble open heart surgery in nigeria
 big trouble that 's mike mike comes out from mississippi  does he look like he 's happy
  it took us two days just to organize the place but hey  you know
  does he look happy yes 
 that 's the medical advice the committee chairman says yes i told you you weren 't going to be able to you can 't do this i just know it 
 look that 's the technician we had so yes you go on all right 
 i got him to come with me anesthesia tech come with me from the u k yes let 's just go work this thing out
  africa generally  we get a lot of donated equipment equipment that 's obsolete equipment that doesn 't quite work or it works and you can 't fix it and there 's nothing wrong with that 
 so long as we use it and we move on  but we had problems with it we had severe problems there he had to get on the phone  this guy was always on the phone so what we going to do now  it looks like all these americans are here and yes
 he thinks he 's british actually and he 's actually nigerian i just thought about that we eventually got it working is the truth  
 but it was one of these even older than the one you saw 
 the reason i have this picture here this x ray it 's just to tell you
 where and how we were viewing x rays do you
  nowadays everything 's on pax anyway you look at your x rays on a screen
 and you you do stuff with them you email them  but we were still using x rays but we didn 't even have a viewing box and we were doing  open heart surgery  
 ok i know it 's not aids i know it 's not malaria  but we still need this stuff
  this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready
  people still believe in voodoo heart disease 
 vsd hole in the heart  tetralogies you still get people who believe in it and they came at sixty seven percent
 oxygen saturation the normal is about ninety seven her condition open heart surgery that as she required  would have been treated when she was a child  
 we had to do these for adults so we did succeed
 and we still do we 've done three we 're planning another one in july in the north of the country so we certainly still do open heart but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in we ship everything instruments  
 we had explosions
 because the kit was designed was designed and installed by people who weren 't used to it the oxygen
  tanks didn 't quite work right but how many did we do the first one 
 twelve we did twelve open heart surgical patients successfully here is our very first patient out of intensive care  
 and
 just watch that chair all right this is what i mean about
 appropriate technology
  that 's what he was doing  propping up
 the bed because the bed simply didn 't work have you seen one of those before no
 doesn 't matter it worked i 'm sure you 've all seen or heard this before we the willing have been doing so much with so little for so long
  this was my first company this one 's sole aim is to provide the very things that i think are missing so we put my hand in my pocket and say guys let 's just buy stuff let 
  's go set up a company that teaches people educates them  gives them the tools they need to keep going 
  transport  this one will do everything and it will do it at half the price and doesn 't need compressed air if you 're in america and you don 't know about this one we do because we make it our duty
 to find out what 's appropriate technology for for africa
 what 's appropriately priced  does the job and we move on anesthesia machine multi parameter
  this little unit here
 remember your little 12 volt plug in the car that charges your  whatever  game boy telephone  
 that 's exactly how the outlets are designed yes it will take a solar panel yes
 a solar panel will charge it  but if you 've got mains as well  it will charge the batteries in there  
 and guess what we have a little pedal charger too
  just in case  and guess what if it all fails if you can find a car that 's still got a live battery and you stick it in it will still work  
 then you can customize it 
 is it dental surgery you want  general surgery you want  decide which instruments  
 stock it up with consumables  
 and currently we 're working on oxygen oxygen
 oxygen
 delivery is not new
  oxygen concentrators are very old technology what is new  and what we will have in a few months i hope is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce
  's not new zeolite removes nitrogen from air and
 nitrogen is seventy eight percent
 of air if you take nitrogen out what 's left oxygen pretty much so that 's not
 new what we 're doing is applying this technology to it  these are the basic features of my device or our device
  this is what makes it so special apart from the awards it 's won it 's portable and it 's certified it 's
 registered the mhra and the ce mark for those who don 't know for europe is the equivalent of 
 in the u s if you compare it with what 's on the market
 ease of use complexity this picture was taken last year these are members of my graduating class
  it was in this gentleman 's house in the potomac for those of you who are familiar with maryland  there are too many of us outside
 and everybody just to borrow a bit from hans hans rosling he 's my guy
 if the size of the text represents what gets the most
  the problems but what we really need are african solutions
 that are appropriate for africa looking at the culture  looking at the people looking at how much money they 've got 
 african people because they will do it with a passion  i hope  
 and lots and lots of that little bit down there sacrifice you have to do it  africans have to do it 
 in conjunction with everyone else  thank you
