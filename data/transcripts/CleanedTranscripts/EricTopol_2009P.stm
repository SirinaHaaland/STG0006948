  does anybody know when the stethoscope was invented 
 any guesses one thousand eight hundred and sixteen  and what i can say is in two thousand and sixteen  doctors aren 't going to be walking around with
  a whole lot better technology coming  and that 's part of the change in medicine what has changed our society
 has been wireless devices  but the future are digital medical
 wireless devices  ok  so let me give you some examples of this to kind of make this much more concrete  this is the first one  
 this is an electrocardiogram and as a cardiologist to think that you could see in real time a patient an individual anywhere in the world on your
  smartphone  watching your rhythm that 's incredible and it 's with us today  but that 's just the beginning  
 you check your email while you 're sitting here 
 in the future you 're going to be checking all your vital signs  all your vital signs  your heart rhythm your blood pressure your oxygen your
  this is already available today this is airstrip technologies it 's now
 wired or i should say wireless by taking the aggregate of these signals in the hospital in the intensive care unit and putting it on a smartphone for physicians 
 if you 're an expectant parent  what about the ability to monitor continuously  fetal heart rate or intrauterine contractions  and not having to worry so much that things are fine as the pregnancy
 over into the time of delivery  and then as we go further today we have continuous glucose sensors right now they are under the skin 
 but in the future 
 they won 't have to be implanted  
 and of course the desired range trying to keep glucose between seventy five and less than two hundred 
 checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor you 'll see how that can impact diabetes 
  and what about sleep we 're going to zoom in on that a little bit we 're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep  what if on your phone  which will be available in the next few weeks you had every minute of your sleep displayed  
 and this is of course as you can see the awake is the orange  
 the rem sleep rapid eye movement dream state is in light green  and light is gray  light sleep and deep sleep the best restorative sleep  is that dark green
  how about counting every calorie  and this is ability in real time to actually take measurements of caloric intake as well as expenditure through a band aid 
 now  what i 've talked about are physiologic metrics but what i want to
 get to the next frontier very quickly  and why the stethoscope is on its way out is because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds  and the breath sounds
  because now  introduced by g e is a handheld ultra sound 
 why is this important because this is so much more sensitive 
 here is an example of an abdominal ultrasound  and also a cardiac echo 
 which can be sent wireless and then there 's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone  so we 're not just talking about physiologic metrics
 the key measurements of vital signs and all those things in physiology
  but also all the imaging
 that one could look at in your smartphone now  this is an example of another obsolete technology soon to be buried  the holter monitor
 twenty four hour recording  lots of wires  this is now a little tiny patch 
 you can put it on for two weeks and send it in the mail  
 now how does this
  or these sensors that one would put on on a shoe or on the wrist  and this sends a signal
 and it creates a body area network to a gateway gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway  as today many of these things are dedicated gateways because they are not so well integrated 
 that signal goes to the web  the cloud and then it can be processed and sent anywhere to a caregiver to a physician  back to the patient
  basically very simplistic technology of how this works now i have this device on i didn 't want to take my
 shirt off to show you but i can tell you it 's on this is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm  
 as you saw already  but it also goes well beyond that  
 this is me now  and
  below that 's the actual heart rate and the trend to the right of that is a bioconductant that 's the fluid status  
 fluid status that 's really important if you 're monitoring somebody with heart failure  
 and below that 's temperature  
 and respiration and oxygen and then the position activity  so this is really striking  because this device
 measures seven things that are very much vital signs for monitoring someone with heart failure
  and why is this important well this is the most expensive bed 
 what if we could reduce the need for hospital beds  well  we can first of all heart failure is the number one
 reason for hospital admissions and readmissions in this country  the cost of heart failure is thirty seven billion dollars a
  which is eighty percent related to hospitalization and in the course of thirty days after a hospital stay for a medicare greater than sixty five years or older is twenty seven percent are readmitted in thirty days and by
 six months over fifty six percent are readmitted so can we improve that well the idea is we take this device that i 'm wearing  and we put it on six hundred patients with heart failure  
  versus six hundred patients who don 't have active monitoring and see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions and that 's exciting and we 'll start that trial  and you 'll hear more about how we 're going to do that  but that 's a
 type of wireless device trial that could change medicine in the years ahead  
 why now  why has this all of a sudden become a reality an exciting direction in the future of medicine what we have is in a way a perfect
 positive storm this sets up
  that 's where this is all starting  let me just give you specifics about why this is a big movement if you 're not aware of it one point two million americans have gotten a nike shoe 
  which is a body area network that connects the shoe  the sole of the shoe to the iphone or an ipod  and this wired magazine cover article really captured a lot of this it talked a lot about the nike shoe and how quickly that 's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology and
  energy expenditure here are some things the principles that are guiding principles to keep in mind 
 a data driven health revolution promises to make us all better faster and stronger living by numbers and this one which is really telling  this was from july this cover article 
 the personal metrics movement goes way beyond diet and exercise  it 's about tracking every facet of life from sleep to mood to pain
 well  i tried this device 
 a lot of you have gotten that phillips direct life i didn 't have one of those  but i got the fitbit that looks like this it 's like a wireless
 accelerometer pedometer and i want to just give you the results of that testing because i wanted to understand about the consumer movement i hope the by the way the phillips direct
  life works better i hope so  
 but this monitors food it monitors activity and tracks weight however you have to put in most of this stuff the only thing it really tracks by itself is activity and even then it 's not complete  
 so  you exercise and it picks up the exercise you put in your height and weight it calculates bmi and
  course it tells you how many calories you 're expending
 from the exercise and how many you took in if you go in and enter all the foods  but it really wants you to enter all your activity and so
 i went to this
  and of course i was gratified that it picked up the forty two minutes of exercise elliptical exercise i did but then it wants more information so it says 
 you want to log sexual activity  how long did you do it
  this doesn 't appear this just doesn 't work i mean this just doesn 't work  
 so  now i want to move to sleep  who would ever have thought you could have your own eeg at your home  tagged to a very nice alarm clock by the
 way this is the headband that goes with this alarm clock  
 it monitors your brainwaves continuously when you 're sleeping so i did this thing for seven
  days getting ready for tedmed  this is an important part of our life one third you 're supposed to be sleeping of course how many here
 have any problems with sleeping it 's
 usually ninety percent  so you tell me you sleep better than expected
 okay well this was a week of my life in sleeping  and you get a z q 
  is adjusted to age and you want to get as high as you possibly can so this is the
  sleep and you see that z q there was 80 odd and
 the wake time is in orange  and this can be a problem as i learned  because it not only helps you
  your sleep but also tells others you 're awake so when my wife came in and she could  tell
 you 're awake eric i want to talk i want to talk and i 'm trying to play possum this thing is very very impressive ok 
 so that 's the first night and this one is now sixty seven and that 's not a good score  and
  tells you of course how much you had in rem sleep in deep sleep  
 and all this sort of thing this was really fascinating because this gave that quantitation about all the different phases of sleep so it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group it 's
 like a managed competition of sleep  
 and
 really interesting stuff  look at this thing and say well  i didn 't think i was a very good sleeper
 but actually i did better than average in
 fifty to sixty year olds ok  and the key thing was what i didn 't know
 was that i was a really good dreamer  ok  now let 's move from sleep to diseases eighty percent of
 americans have chronic disease or eighty percent of age greater than sixty five have
 two or more chronic disease one hundred and forty million americans have one or more chronic disease  and eighty percent of our one point
 five whatever trillion expenditures are
  to chronic disease  now diabetes is one of the big ones almost  twenty four million people have diabetes and here is the latest map it was published just a little more than a week ago in the new york times 
 and it isn 't looking good 
 that is for men twenty nine percent in the country over sixty have type ii diabetes and women although it 's less it 's terribly high 
 but of course we have a way to measure that now on
  continuous basis with a sensor that detects blood glucose and it 's important because we could detect hyperglycemia that otherwise wouldn 't be known  and also hypoglycemia and you can see the red 
  dots in this particular patient 's case were finger sticks which would have missed both ends  
  is being able to move this to a band aid type phenomenon and that 's not so far away  
 so let me just give you very quickly ten top targets for wireless medicine 
 all these things are possible some of them are very close or already  as you heard are available today in some way or form alzheimer 's disease  
 there 's five million people affected and you can check vital signs activity balance asthma
  we could detect things like pollen count air quality respiratory rate breast cancer i 'll show you an example of that real quickly  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  depression there 's a 
  great approach to that in mood disorders  diabetes i 've just mentioned heart failure we already talked about hypertension seventy four million people could have continuous blood pressure monitoring to to come up with much better management and prevention
  and obesity we already talked about the ways to get to that and sleep disorders  this is effective around the world the access to smartphones and cell phones today is extraordinary  and this 
 article from the economist summed it up beautifully about the opportunities in health across the developing world mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people more quickly than any previous technology and that 's before we got going
  the problem is enormous  three hundred thousand broken hips per year  but the solutions are extraordinary and they include so many different things one of the ones i just wanted to mention  
 the ishoe is another example of a sensor that improves proprioception among the elderly to prevent falling 
  seniors the pharmaceutical arena changes  
 the full spectrum of disease i hope i 've given you a sense of that across the globe there are two things that can really accelerate this whole process 
 one of them we 're very fortunate is to develop a dedicated institute and that 's work that started with the work that scripps
 with qualcomm  and then the great fortune of meeting up with gary and mary west to get behind this wireless health
  institute  san diego is an extraordinary place for this there 's over six hundred and fifty wireless companies  one hundred of which or more are working in wireless health
  it 's the number one source of commerce  and interestingly it dovetails beautifully with over five hundred life science companies  the wireless
 institute the west wireless health institute is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people who are here this evening
 gary and mary west and i 'd like to give it up for them for getting behind
 this their fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible  and
 this is really a nonprofit education center which is just about to open it looks like this this whole building dedicated  and what it 's trying to do is accelerate this era to take unmet medical needs to work and innovate
  we just appointed the chief engineer mehran mehregany it was announced on monday then to move up with development 
 clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice the most challenging thing of all  requiring attention to reimbursement  healthcare policy healthcare economics the other big 
  thing besides having this fantastic institute to catalyze this process is guidance
  guidance  and that 's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital if we understand biology from genomics and omics and wireless through physiologic phenotyping 
 that 's big because what it does is allow a convergence like we 've never had before over eighty major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level  but this is quite extraordinary
  more has been learned about the underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years than in the history of man  
 and when you put that together with for example now an app for the iphone with your genotype to guide drug therapy  but the future
 we can now tell who 's going to get type ii diabetes from all the common variants and that 's going to get filled in more with low frequency variants in the future we can tell who 's going to get breast cancer
 from the various genes we can also know who 's likely to get atrial fibrillation
  and finally  another example sudden cardiac death  each of these has a sensor we can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it 
 we can prevent or have the earliest detection possible for breast cancer with an ultrasound device given to the patient
  thousand people a year in the u s from sudden cardiac death  so  i hope i 've convinced you of this of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive
 across all these different diseases and more it 's really taking individualized individualized medicine to a new height and it 
 and i think it represents the black swan of medicine thanks for your attention
