  i was sitting with my girls and joy said dang 
 i wish he 'd get off my back my daddy  he calls me all the time lucky for you he calls at all
  from my dad in years at this moment  i knew the girls needed a way
 to connect with their fathers 
 at camp diva my  non profit organization we have these types of conversations all the time
 as a way to help girls of african descent prepare for their passage into womanhood these girls
 just needed
 a way to invite their fathers into their lives
 on their own terms  so i asked the girls how can we help other girls develop healthy relationships with their fathers
  quickly backed her up  they started dreaming about the decorations  
 invitations the dresses they were going to wear  and what their fathers could and could not wear 
 it was off and running before i could even blink my eyes but even if i could have slowed down those
  wouldn 't have because one thing that i have learned from over a decade of working with girls
 is that they already know what they need the
 wisdom lives inside of them 
 as long as they have infrastructure  mentorship and resources  they can build
 what they need not only to
  so
 we had a dance
  and girls and their fathers came in multitudes  they were dressed to the nines  
 they acted sweet 
 they acted silly  they really enjoyed each other 's company it was a huge success
  and the girls decided to make it an annual event 
 so as the seasons changed  and it was time to plan the dance again one girl named brianna spoke up  
 and she said 
 my dad can 't come to the dance  and this whole thing
  can he just get out for a day one of the girls asked 
 and come in shackles 
 that 's worse than not having him here at all at this moment
  i saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion
 and to become their own heroes  so i asked what do you think we should do about this 
 we want every girl to experience the dance  right 
 so the girls thought for a moment  and one girl suggested why don 't we just take the dance in the jail 
  to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in spongebob suits because that 's what they called them
  a letter was written to the richmond city sheriff  signed collectively by each girl 
 and i would have to say he is a very special sheriff  he contacted me immediately
 and said  whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside
  his doors are always open  
 because one thing he did know that when fathers are connected to their children it is less likely that they will return  
 so  sixteen inmates
 and eighteen girls were invited the girls were dressed in their sunday best
 and the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits for shirts and ties 
 they hugged they shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish  
 they laughed together it was beautiful
  the fathers and daughters
 even experienced an opportunity to have a physical connection 
 something that a lot of them didn 't even have for a while fathers were in a space where they were
 able to make their daughters play  and pull out her chair
 and extend his hand for a
  dance even the guards cried  but
 after the dance we all realized that
 dad still would be in jail  
 so we needed to create something that they could take with them  
 so we brought in flip cams and we had them look at the
 flip cams and just interview each other
  messages their thoughts this was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other
 and feel disconnected they could reconnect
 through this image i 'll never forget
 that one girl looked in her father 's eyes with that camera and said daddy when you look at me what
 do you see 
 because our daddies
 are our mirrors
 that we reflect back on
 when we decide about what type of man we deserve  and how they see us for the rest of our lives 
 i know that
  was one of the lucky girls i have had
 my father
 in my life always 
 he 's even here today 
 and that is why it is extremely special
  special for me to make sure that these girls are connected to their fathers especially those who are separated
 because of barbed wires and metal doors we have just created a form
 for girls who have heavy questions on their heart
 to be in a position to ask their fathers those questions
 and given the fathers the freedom to answer because we know
 that the fathers are even leaving with this one thought what type of woman
 am i preparing to put in the world  because a father is locked in
  not mean he should be locked out of his daughter 's life
