  people say things about religion all the time 
 the late great christopher hitchens wrote a book called god is not great whose subtitle was
 rabbi david wolpe who i gather is referred to as america 's rabbi said 
 to balance that against that negative characterization that no important form of social change can be brought about except through
 organized religion  now remarks of this sort on the negative and the positive side are
  i should have been able to learn that by heart which is that 's how much religion is able to persuade people to do evil
  and he was talking about the fact of agamemnon 's decision to place his daughter iphigenia on an altar of sacrifice in order to preserve
 the prospects of his army so there have been these long debates
 over the centuries in that case actually we can say over the millennia about religion people have talked about it a lot
 and they 've said good and bad and indifferent things about it 
 what i want to persuade you of today is of a very simple claim which is that these debates are in
  a certain sense preposterous because there is no such thing as religion
 about which to make these claims there isn 't a thing called religion and so it can 't be good or bad it can 't even be indifferent  and
 if you think about claims about the nonexistence of things
  one obvious way to try and establish the nonexistence of of a purported thing
 would be to offer a definition of that thing and then to see whether anything
 satisfied it i 'm going to start out on that little route to begin with so
 if you look in the dictionaries and if you think about it one very natural definition of religion is that it involves belief in gods
  gods or in spiritual beings as i say this is in many dictionaries but you 'll also find it
 actually in the work of sir edward tylor who was the first professor of anthropology at oxford one of the first modern anthropologists in his book on primitive culture he says
 the heart of religion is what he called animism that is the belief in spiritual agency belief in spirits the first problem for that definition is from a recent
  guy talking to a rabbi the rabbi says he doesn 't believe in god
 the guy says you 're a rabbi how can you not believe in god and the reply is it 's what 's so great about being jewish 
 you don 't have to believe in a god per se just in being jewish 
 laughter so if this guy is a rabbi and a jewish rabbi and if you have to believe in god in order to be religious then we have the rather counterintuitive conclusion
  that since it 's possible to be a jewish rabbi without believing in god judaism isn 't a religion that
 seems like a pretty counterintuitive thought  here 's another
 argument against this view a friend of mine an indian friend of mine went to his grandfather when he was very young  a child and said to him i want to
 talk to you about religion and his grandfather said you 're too young come back when you 're a teenager so he came back when he was a teenager and he said to his grandfather it may be a bit late now because
 i 've discovered
  that i don 't believe in the gods and his grandfather who was a wise man said oh  so you belong to the atheist branch of the hindu tradition 
 and finally there 's this guy 
 who famously doesn 't believe in god his name is the dalai lama he often jokes that he 's one of the world 's leading atheists
  but it 's true because the dalai lama 's religion does not involve belief in god 
 now you might think this just shows that i 've given you the wrong definition and that i should come up with some other definition and test it against these cases and try and find something that captures
 atheistic judaism atheistic hinduism and atheistic buddhism as forms of religiosity  but i actually think that that 's a bad idea
  and the reason i think it 's a bad idea
 is that i don 't think that 's how our concept of religion works i think the way our concept of religion works is that we actually have we have a list
 of paradigm religions and 
 right  and if something new comes along
 that purports to be a religion what we ask is well is it like one of these right 
 and i think that 's not only how we think about religion and that 's  as it were so
 from our point of view
  anything on that list had better be a religion which is why i don 't think an account of religion that excludes buddhism and judaism has a chance of being a good starter because they 're on our list
  but why do we have such a list what 's going on how did it come about that we
 have this list i think the answer is
 a pretty simple one
 and therefore crude and contentious
  story and
 true or not it 's a story that i think gives you a good sense of how the list might have come about and therefore helps you to think about what use the list might be i think the answer is
 european travelers starting roughly about the time of columbus started going around the world they came from a christian culture  and when they arrived in a new place they noticed that some people didn 't have christianity and so they asked themselves
  following question what have they got instead of christianity  
 and that list was essentially constructed it consists of the things that other people had instead of
 christianity  now there 's a difficulty with proceeding in that way which is that christianity is extremely  even on that list
  an extremely specific tradition  
 it has all kinds of things in it that are very very particular that are the results of the specifics of christian history 
 and one thing that 's at the heart of it one thing that 's at the heart of most understandings of christianity which is the result of the specific history of christianity is that it 's an extremely 
 creedal religion  it 's a religion in which people are really concerned about whether you believe the right things 
  people killing each other because they believed the wrong thing
 and it 's also involved in struggles with other religions  obviously starting
 in the middle ages a struggle with islam in which again it
 was the infidelity the fact that they didn 't believe the right things that seemed so
 offensive to the christian world
  now that 's a very specific and particular history that christianity has and
 not everywhere is everything that has ever been put on this sort of list
 like it here
 's another problem i think a very specific thing happened it was actually adverted to earlier but a very specific thing happened in the history of the kind of christianity that we see around us mostly in the united states today  and it happened
  and that specific thing that happened in the late 19th century was a kind of deal that was cut
 between science this new
 way of
 organizing intellectual authority  
 and religion if you think about the 18th century say if you think about intellectual life before the late 19th century  anything you did 
 anything you thought about whether it was
 the physical world the human world
 the natural world apart from the human world or morality anything you did would have been framed against the background of a set of assumptions that were religious christian assumptions you couldn 't give an account
 of the natural world that didn 't say something about its relationship for example to the creation story in the abrahamic tradition the creation story
  in the first book of the torah  so
 everything was framed in that way 
 but this changes in the late 19th century and for the first time it 's possible for people to develop serious intellectual careers as natural historians like darwin 
 darwin worried about the relationship between what he said and the truths of religion  but he could proceed he could write books about his subject without having to say what the
  the religious claims  and similarly geologists increasingly could talk about it in the early 19th century if you were a geologist and made a claim about the age of the earth you had to explain whether that was consistent or how it was or wasn 't consistent 
  with the age of the earth implied by the account in genesis by the end of the 19th century you can just write a geology textbook in which you make arguments about how old the earth is  so there 's a big change and that division that intellectual division of labor occurs as i say i think
 there 's a real intellectual division of labor and you can do all sorts of serious things including increasingly even philosophy  
 without being constrained by the thought well what i have to say has to be consistent
 with the with the deep truths that are given to me by our religious tradition so imagine someone who 's coming out of that world that
 into
 the country that i grew up in ghana the society that i grew up in asante coming into that world at the turn of the 20th century with this question that made the list what have they got
 instead of christianity  well  
 here 's one thing he would have noticed and by the way there was a person who actually did this his name was captain rattray he was sent as the british government anthropologist and he wrote a book about asante religion
  this
 is a soul disc there are many of them in the british museum  i could give you an interesting different history of how it comes about that many of the things from my society ended up in the british museum but
 't have time for that so this object is a soul disc what is a soul disc it was worn around the necks of the soul washers of the asante king 
 what was their job to wash the king 's soul
  it would take a long while to explain how a soul could be the kind of thing that could be washed  
 but rattray knew that this was religion because souls were were in play
 and similarly  there were many other things many other practices for example every time anybody had a drink more or less they poured a little bit on the ground in what 's called the libation  and they gave some to the ancestors my father did this every time he opened a
  bottle of whiskey which i 'm glad to say was very often  he would take the top off and pour off just a little on the ground and he would talk to he would say to akroma ampim
 the founder of our line or yao antony my great uncle he would talk to them
  offer them a little bit of this and finally there were these huge public ceremonials this is an
  drawing by another british military officer of such a ceremonial  where the king was involved and the king 's job  one of the large parts of his job apart from
 organizing warfare and things like that was to look after the the tombs of his ancestors  and when a king died  the stool that he sat on was blackened and put in the royal ancestral
 temple  and every forty days the king of asante has to go and do cult for his ancestors that 's a large part of his job and people think that if he doesn 't do it
 things will fall apart  so he 's a religious figure  as rattray would have said as well as a political figure  
 so all this
 would count as religion for rattray  but my point is that when you look into the lives of those people you also find that every time they do anything they 're conscious of the
  every morning
 at breakfast you can go outside the front of the house and make an offering to the the god tree the nyame dua outside your house and again you 'll talk to the gods and the high gods and the low gods and the ancestors and so on 
 this is not a world in which the separation between religion and science has occurred religion has not being separated from any other areas of life  and in particular 
 what 's crucial to understand about this world is that it 's a world in which the job that science does for us is done by what
  rattray is going to call religion because if they want an explanation of something if they want to know why the crop just failed if they want to know why it 's raining or not raining if they need rain  
 if they want to know why
 why their grandfather has died  they are going to appeal to the very same entities the very same language talk to the very same gods about
  this would be a mere historical curiosity  except that
 in large parts of the world this is still the truth  
 i had the privilege of going to a wedding the other day in northern namibia twenty miles or so south of the angolan border in a village of two hundred people these were modern people we had
 with us oona chaplin who some of you may have heard of and one of the people from this village came up to her and said i 've seen you in ' game of thrones ' so these were not people who were isolated from our world  
 but nevertheless for them the gods and the spirits are still very much there and when we were on the bus going back and forth to the various parts of the [ ceremony ] they prayed not just in a generic way but for the safety of the journey and they meant it  and when they said to me
  was with us they didn 't mean it figuratively they meant even though she was a
 dead person they meant that she was still around so in large parts of the world today
  that separation between science and religion hasn 't occurred in large parts of the world today and as i say these are not
 this guy used to work for chase and at the world bank
  these are fellow citizens of the world with you but they come from a place in which religion is is occupying a very different role  so what i want you to think about next time somebody wants to make some vast generalization about religion
 is that maybe there isn 't such a thing as a religion such a thing as religion and that therefore what they say cannot possibly be true
