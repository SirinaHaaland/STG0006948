  is the air jordan three black cement 
 this might be the most important sneaker in history  
 first released in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight this is the shoe that started nike marketing as we know it this is the shoe that
  propelled the entire air jordan lineage  and perhaps saved nike 
 the air jordan three black cement did for sneakers what the iphone did for phones  it 's been re released four times 
 every celebrity 's been seen wearing it there 's a site about what to wear with the black cement  it 's been right under your nose for decades and you never looked down 
 and right about now most of
  you are probably thinking sneakers 
 yes  yes sneakers  some extraordinary things about sneakers
 and data and nike and how they 're all related possibly to the future of all online commerce 
  in two thousand and eleven the last time the jordan three black cement was released at a retail of one hundred and sixty dollars  it sold out globally in minutes  
 and that 's because people were camped outside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale 
 and just minutes after that thousands of those pairs were on ebay for two and three times retail 
 in fact there 's over one thousand pairs on ebay right now four years later  
 but here 's the thing this happens every single saturday
 every week there 's another release or two or three and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling as the jordan three black cement 
 this is nike building the marketplace for
  very important demographic  these are the tastemakers  these are the apple fanboys  
 because who else is going to buy a pair of $ eight thousand back to the future sneakers 
 yeah  eight thousand dollars  and while that 's obviously the anomaly the resell sneaker market is definitely
  years in the making what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers just a bit too much 
 now we have sneaker addictions 
 in a market where in the past twelve months there have been over nine million pairs of shoes resold in the united states alone at a value of one point two billion dollars  
 and that 's a conservative estimate
  i should know  i am a sneakerhead this is my collection in the pantheon of great collections mine doesn 't even register  
 i have about two hundred and fifty pairs but trust me  i am small time people have thousands i 'm a very typical  37 year old sneakerhead 
 i grew up playing basketball when michael jordan played i always wanted air jordans my mother would never buy me air jordans as soon as i got some
  money i bought air jordans literally we all have the exact same story  but here 's where mine diverged  
 after starting three companies i took a job as a strategy consultant when i very quickly realized
 that i didn 't know the first thing about data  
 but i learned  because i had to 
 and i liked it so i thought i wonder if i could get ahold of some sneaker data just to play with for my own amusement 
 the goal was to develop a price guide a real data driven view of the market
 and four years later we 're analyzing over twenty five million transactions providing real time analytics on thousands of sneakers  
 now sneakerheads check prices while camping out for releases  
 others have used the data to validate insurance claims 
 and the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze the retail footwear industry  and here 's the best part
 have sneaker portfolios laughter
 sneakerheads can track the value of their collection over time compare it to others and have access to the same analytics you might for your online brokerage account  
 so sneakerhead dan builds his collection and identifies which three hundred and fifty two are his 
 he can see it 's worth one hundred and three thousand dollars frankly a modest collection 
 at the asset level
 he can see gain loss by shoe here he 's made over six hundred dollars on one pair i have one of those 
 so an unregulated one point two billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street as it does online and has spawned fundamental financial services for
  at some point i asked myself what 's really going on in the market  and two comparisons started to emerge are sneakers more like stocks
 or drugs in fact one guy emailed to say he thought his 15 year old son
 was selling drugs and later found out he was selling sneakers 
 and now they use the data to do it together  and that 's because sneakers are an investment opportunity where none other exists and
  don 't just mean the kid selling sneakers  instead of drugs how about all kids you have to be eighteen to play the stock market  
 i sold chewing gum in sixth grade  blow pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards through high school 
 the cards are long dead and the candy market 's usually quite local 
 for a lot of people
  and accessible investment opportunity
 a democratized stock market  
 but also unregulated which is why the story you 're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers 
 and while that definitely happens and is tragic  it 's not nearly the epidemic some media would have you believe in fact it 's a very
 small piece of a much bigger and better story 
 so sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange and the illegal drug trade but perhaps the most fundamental is the existence of a central actor 
 someone is making the rules 
 in the case of sneakers  that someone
 is nike  
 let me walk you through some numbers the resell market we know is $ one point two billion nike  including jordan brand accounts for
 ninety six percent of all shoes sold on the secondary market  just complete domination sneakerheads love jordans  
 and profit on the secondary market is about a third 
 that means that sneakerheads made three hundred and eighty million dollars selling nikes last year  
 let 's jump to retail for a second  skechers earlier this year became the number two footwear brand in the country
  adidas this was a big deal  and in the twelve months ending in june  skechers 's net income was two hundred and nine million dollars 
 that means that nike 's customers make almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor 
 that 
 how is that even possible
 the sneaker market is just supply and demand  but nike 's gotten very good at using supply
 limited sneakers and the distribution of those sneakers to their own benefit 
 so it 's really just supply
  sneakerheads joke that as long as it 's limited and nike they 'll buy it 
 shoes that sell for eight thousand dollars do so because they 're very rare  it 's no different than any other collectible market
  only
 this isn 't a market at all 
 it 's a false construct created by nike ingeniously created by nike in the most positive sense to sell more shoes  
 and in the process it provided tens of thousands of people with life long passions  myself included 
 if nike wanted to kill the resell market they could do so
  all they have to do is release more shoes but we certainly don 't want them to nor is it in their best interest 
 that 's because unlike apple who will sell an iphone to anyone who wants one 
 nike doesn 't make their money by just selling $ two hundred sneakers  
 they sell millions of shoes to millions of people for sixty dollars  
 and sneakerheads are the ones who drive the marketing and the hype and the pr and the brand cachet  and enable nike to sell millions of $ sixty sneakers
 it 's marketing the likes of which has never been seen before this isn 't in any textbook 
 for fifteen years nike has propped up an artificial commodities market  with a facebook level hyped ipo every single weekend 
 drive by any footlocker at 8am on a saturday morning and there will be a line down the street and around the block  and sometimes those kids have been waiting there all week 
 you know those crazy iphone lines you see on the news every other year
  year 
 nike lines happen one hundred and four times more often 
 so nike sets the rules  and they do so by controlling supply and distribution  
 but once a pair leaves the retail channel it 's the wild west  there are very few if any legal unregulated markets
  nike is definitely not the stock exchange in fact  there is no central exchange 
 by last count there were forty eight different online markets that i know of 
 some are ebay clones some are mobile markets 
 and then you have consignment shops and brick and mortar stores and sneaker conventions and reseller sites and facebook and instagram and twitter
 literally  
  come into contact with each other shoes will be bought and sold but that means
 no efficiencies no transparency sometimes not even authenticity can you imagine if that 's how stocks were bought 
 what if the way to buy a share of apple stock was to search over one hundred places online and off  including every time you walk down the street just hoping to pass someone wearing some apple stock 
 never knowing who had the best price or even if the stock
  were looking at was real that would surely make you say [ wtf ]
 of course that 's not how we buy stock  but what if that 's not how we need to buy sneakers either 
 what if the inverse is true and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock  and what if it wasn 't just sneakers but any similar product
  like watches and handbags and women 's shoes and any collectible any seasonal item and any markdown item what if there was a stock market for commerce 
 a stock market
 of things  
 and not only could you buy in a much more educated and efficient manner  
 but you could engage in all the sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market  shorts and options and futures
  maybe you see where this is going  maybe you want to invest in a stock market
 of things  because if you had invested in a pair of air jordan three black cement in two thousand and eleven 
 you could either be wearing them onstage 
 or have earned one hundred and sixty two percent on your money double the s & p and twenty percent more than apple 
 and that 's why we 're talking about sneakers  thank you
