  i got my start in writing
 and research as a surgical trainee as someone who was a long ways away from becoming any kind of an expert at
  the natural question you ask then at that point is how do i get good at what i 'm trying to do and it became a question of how do we all get good at what we 're trying to do 
 it 's hard enough to learn to get the skills  
 try to learn all the material you have to absorb at any task you 're taking on i had to think about how i sew and how i cut but then also how i pick the right person to come to an operating room 
 and then in the midst of all
  this came this new context for thinking about what it meant to be good in the last few years we realized we were in the deepest crisis
 of medicine 's existence due to something you don 't normally think about when you 're a doctor concerned with how you do good for people 
 which is the cost
  there 's not a country in the world that now is not asking
 whether we can afford what doctors do the political fight that we 've developed has become one around
 whether it 's the government
 that 's the problem or is it insurance companies that are the problem and the answer is yes
 and no it 's deeper than all of that the cause of
  our troubles is actually the complexity that science has given us and in order to understand this i 'm going to take you back
 a couple of generations i want to take you back to a time when lewis thomas was writing in his book the youngest science lewis thomas was 
 one of my favorite writers  and
  he wrote this book to explain among other things what it was like to be a medical intern at the boston city hospital in the 
  year of 
 it was a time when medicine was cheap and very ineffective  
 if you were in a hospital he said  it was
 going to do you good only because it offered you some warmth
  some food  shelter and maybe the caring attention of a nurse  doctors and medicine
 made no difference at all 
 that didn 't seem to prevent the doctors from being frantically busy in their days as he explained what they were trying to do was figure out whether you might have
 one of the diagnoses for which they could
  do something and there were a few  
 you might have a lobar pneumonia for example  and they could give you an antiserum an injection of rabid antibodies
 to the bacterium streptococcus  if the intern sub typed it correctly  if you had an acute
 congestive heart failure  they could bleed a pint of blood
  from you by opening up an arm vein  
 giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis and then giving you oxygen by tent  
 if you had early signs of paralysis and you were really good at asking personal questions you might figure out that this paralysis someone has
  in which case you could give this nice concoction of mercury and arsenic
 as long as you didn 't overdose them and kill them  
 beyond these sorts of things a medical
 doctor didn 't have a lot that they could do this was when the core structure
 of medicine was created what what it meant to be good at what we did and and how we wanted to build medicine to be
  was at a time when what was known you could know you could hold it all in your head and you could do it all if you had a prescription pad 
 if you had a nurse if you had a a hospital that would give you a place to convalesce maybe some basic tools you really could do it all you set the fracture  you
  you spun the blood looked at it under the microscope you plated the culture you injected the antiserum this was
 a life as a craftsman 
 as a result we built it around a culture and set of values that said what you were good at was being daring 
 at being
 courageous 
  our highest value 
 go a couple generations forward to where we are though  and it looks like a completely different world we have now found treatments
 for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions
 that a human being can have we can 't cure it all we can 't guarantee that everybody will live a long
 and healthy life
  but we can make it possible for most but what does it take well we 've now discovered
 four thousand medical and surgical procedures 
 we 've discovered six thousand drugs that i 'm now licensed to prescribe 
 and we 're trying to deploy this capability town by town to every person alive
 in our own country  let alone around the world  
 and we 've reached the point where we 've realized as doctors 
 we can 't know it all we can 't
 do it all
 by ourselves  there was a study where they looked at how many clinicians it took to take care of you if you came into a hospital as it changed over
  time and in the year one thousand nine hundred and seventy  it took just over two full time equivalents of clinicians that is to say  it took basically the nursing time
 and then just a little bit of time for a doctor who more or less checked in on you
 once a day 
 by the end of the 20th century  it had become more than fifteen clinicians for the same typical hospital
  patient
 specialists  physical therapists  the nurses we
 're all specialists now  even the primary care physicians everyone just has a piece
 of the care  but holding onto that structure we built around the daring independence
  each of those people
 has become a disaster  
 we have trained  hired and rewarded people to be cowboys  
 but it 's pit crews that we need pit crews
 for patients 
 there 's evidence all around us  forty percent of our coronary artery disease patients in our communities receive incomplete or inappropriate care
  percent of our asthma  stroke patients receive incomplete or inappropriate care  two million
 people come into hospitals and pick up an infection they didn 't have
 because someone failed to follow the basic practices of
  our experience as people who get sick need help from other people is that we have
 amazing clinicians that we can turn to hardworking  incredibly well trained and very smart
 that we have access to incredible technologies that give us great hope  but little sense
 that it consistently all comes together for you from start to finish
  in a successful way  there 's another sign that we need pit crews  and that 's the unmanageable cost
 of our care
  now we in medicine i think are baffled by this question of cost we want to say this is just the way it is this is
  when you go from a world where
 you treated arthritis with aspirin that
 mostly didn 't do the job to one where if it gets bad enough we can do a hip replacement a knee replacement that gives you
 years maybe decades  without disability a dramatic change well is it any surprise that that $ forty
  it 's just the way it is  but i think we 're ignoring certain facts that tell us something about what we can do 
 as we 've looked at the data about the results
 that have come as the complexity has increased we found that the most expensive care
 is not necessarily the best care  and vice
 versa the best care often turns out to be the least expensive
 has fewer complications  the people get more efficient at what they do  and what that means is
 there 's hope  because [ if ] to have the best results you really needed the most expensive care in the country or in the world
 well then we really would be talking about rationing
 who we 're going to cut off from medicare 
 that would be really our only choice 
 but when we look at the positive deviants the ones who are getting the best results at the lowest costs
 we find the ones that look the most like systems are the most successful that is to say
 they found ways to get all of the different pieces all of the different components to come together into a whole  
 having great components is not enough and yet we 've been obsessed in medicine with components we want the best drugs 
 the best technologies the best specialists
  we don 't think too much about how it all comes together  it 's a terrible design strategy actually
  there 's a famous thought experiment that touches exactly on this that said what if you built a car from the very best car parts  
 well it would lead you to put
 in porsche brakes a ferrari
  a volvo body a bmw chassis and you put it all together and what do you get a very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere  
 and that is what medicine can feel like sometimes 
 it 's not a system  
 now a system however when things start to come together  
 you realize it has certain skills for acting and looking that way
  one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure when you are a specialist you can 't see the end result very well you have to become really interested in data  
 unsexy as that sounds 
 one of my colleagues is a surgeon in cedar rapids iowa 
  and he got interested in the question of well how many ct scans did they do for their community in cedar rapids  he got interested in this because there had been government 
  reports  newspaper reports journal articles saying that there had been too many ct scans done  
  took him three months no one had asked this question in his community before 
 and what he found was that for the three hundred thousand people in their community in the previous year they had done fifty two thousand ct scans 
 they had found
 a problem  
 which brings us to skill number two a system has 
 skill one find where your failures are skill two is devise solutions
 i got interested in this when the world health organization came to my team asking if we could help with a project to reduce deaths in surgery  the volume of surgery had spread around the world  
 but the safety of surgery had not 
 now our usual tactics for tackling problems like these are to
 do more training give people more specialization or
  bring in more technology  well in surgery you couldn 't have people who are more specialized and you couldn 't have people who are better trained  
 and yet we see
 unconscionable levels of
 death disability that could be avoided  and so we looked at what other high risk industries do
 we looked at skyscraper construction we looked at the aviation world  
 and we found that they have technology they have training and then they have one other thing 
 they have checklists  i did not expect to be spending a significant part of my time as a
 harvard surgeon worrying about checklists  and yet what we found were that
 these were tools
 to help
  make experts better  we got the lead safety engineer for boeing to help us could we design a checklist for surgery not for the lowest people on the totem pole
 but for the folks who were all the way around the chain the entire team including the surgeons  
  understood you have to think about things like pause points 
 you need to identify the moments in a process when you can actually catch a problem before it 's a danger and do something about it you have to identify that this is a 
 checklist and then you need to focus on the killer items 
  aviation checklist like this one for a single engine plane isn 't a recipe for how to fly a plane  it 's a reminder of the key things that get forgotten
 or missed if they 're not checked so we did this we created a 
 checklist for surgical teams we had the pause points immediately before anesthesia is given immediately
  the knife hits the skin immediately before the patient leaves the room  and we had a mix of dumb stuff on there making sure an antibiotic
 is given in the right time frame because that cuts the infection rate by half and then interesting stuff because you can 't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery  instead  you can make a 
  recipe for how to have a team that 's prepared for the unexpected  and we had items like
  you get half a dozen people or more who are sometimes coming together as a team for the very first time that day
 that you 're coming in we implemented this checklist in eight hospitals around the world 
 deliberately in places from rural tanzania to the university of washington in seattle  we found that after they adopted
  it fell in every hospital it went into the death rates fell   forty seven percent 
 this was bigger than a drug 
 and that brings us to skill number three 
 the ability to implement this to get colleagues across the entire chain
  chain to actually do these things  and it 's been slow to spread this is not yet our norm in surgery
 let alone making checklists to go onto childbirth and other areas  
 there 's a deep resistance because using these tools forces
 us to confront that we 're not a system  forces us to behave with a different
  set of values just using a checklist requires you to embrace different values from the ones we 've had like humility  
 discipline  teamwork this is the opposite of what we were built on
  by the way i asked him what was it like to actually
 herd a thousand cattle across hundreds of miles how did you do that and he said we have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around they communicate electronically constantly and they have protocols and checklists for how they handle everything
  for the cattle  
 even the cowboys are pit crews now
 and it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves  
 making systems work is the great task of my generation of physicians and scientists  
 but i would go further and say that making systems work 
  in health care  education climate change making a pathway out of poverty is the great task of our generation as a whole 
 in every field  knowledge has exploded  but it has brought complexity it has brought specialization  
 and we 've come to a place where we have no choice but to recognize 
 as individualistic as we want to be complexity requires group success
 we all need to be pit crews now
