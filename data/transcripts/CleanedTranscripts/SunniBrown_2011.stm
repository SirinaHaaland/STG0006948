  so i just want to tell you my story  i spend a lot of time teaching adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace and naturally i encounter a lot of resistance because it 's considered to be
  and counter to serious learning  
 but i have a problem with that belief because i know that doodling has a profound impact on the way that we can process information and the way that we can solve problems 
  so i was curious about why there was a disconnect between the way our society perceives doodling
  was a simpleton or a fool as in yankee doodle in the 18th century  it became a verb and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone 
 in the  19th century it was a corrupt politician and today we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition at least to me which is the following 
 to doodle officially means to dawdle
  to dilly dally to monkey around to make meaningless marks to do something of little value substance or import and my personal favorite to do nothing no wonder people are averse to doodling at work 
 doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work it 's totally inappropriate 
 additionally i 've heard horror stories from people whose teachers scolded them of course for doodling in
  and they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom there is a powerful cultural norm against doodling in settings in which we are supposed to learn something 
 and unfortunately the press tends to reinforce this norm when they 're reporting on a doodling scene of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like they typically use words 
  like discovered or caught or found out as if there 's some sort of criminal act being committed
  and additionally there is a psychological aversion to doodling thank you freud in the 1930s freud told us all that you could analyze people 's psyches based on their doodles 
  this is not accurate but it did happen to tony blair at the davos forum in two thousand and five when his doodles were of course discovered 
  and bill if you 're here nobody thinks you 're megalomaniacal but that does contribute
 to people not wanting to share their doodles  and here is the real deal here 's what i believe i think that our culture is so intensely focused on verbal information that we 're almost blinded to the value of doodling 
 and i 'm not comfortable with that and so because of that belief that i think needs to be burst i 'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth and here 's the truth doodling is an
  incredibly powerful tool and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re learn 
 so here 's a new definition for doodling and i hope there 's someone in here from the oxford english dictionary because i want to talk to you later here 's the real definition doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think that is why millions of people doodle 
 here 's another
  interesting truth about the doodle people who doodle when they 're exposed to verbal information retain more of that information than their non doodling counterparts 
 we think doodling is something you do when you lose focus but in reality it is a preemptive measure to stop you from losing focus  
 additionally  it has a profound effect on creative problem solving and deep information processing there are four ways that learners intake information so that they can make
  they are visual auditory  
 reading and writing and kinesthetic now in order for us to really chew on information and do something with it we have to engage at least two of those modalities or we have 
  to engage one of those modalities coupled with an emotional experience the incredible contribution of the doodle is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously with the possibility of an emotional experience 
  doing nothing  this is so nerdy but this made me cry when i discovered this 
 so they did anthropological research into the unfolding of artistic activity in children  and they found that across space and time all children exhibit the same evolution 
  in visual logic as they grow in other words they have a shared and growing complexity in visual language that happens in a predictable order  
  means doodling is native to us and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct 
 and finally a lot a people aren 't privy to this but the doodle is a precursor to some of our greatest cultural assets 
 this is but one this is frank gehry the architect 's precursor to the guggenheim in abu dhabi 
 so here is my point  under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated from a classroom or a boardroom or
  even the war room on the contrary doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations where information density is very high and the need for processing that information is very high and i will go you one further  
 because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy
  my friends the doodle has never been the nemesis of intellectual thought in reality it is one of its greatest allies
