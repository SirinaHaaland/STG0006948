  funny to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen  and present my proposal to build a 
  wall across the entire african continent about the size of the great wall of china this would hardly be an invisible structure and yet it 's made
  from parts that are invisible 
 to the naked eye bacteria and grains of sand 
 now as architects we 're trained to solve problems but i don 't really believe in architectural problems i only believe in opportunities which is why i 'll show you a threat 
 and an architectural response  
 the threat is
  my response
 is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidified sand stretching across the desert 
 now sand is a magical material of beautiful contradictions  it is simple and complex 
 it is peaceful and violent  it is always the same never the same endlessly fascinating 
 one billion grains of sand
 come into existence in the world each second
 that 's a cyclical process as rocks and mountains die grains of sand are born some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone and as the sandstone weathers  new grains break free 
 some of those grains may then accumulate on a massive scale into a sand dune in a
  the static stone mountain becomes a moving mountain of sand 
 but moving mountains can be dangerous let me try and explain why 
 dry areas cover more than one third of the earth 's land surfaces some are already deserts  others are being seriously degraded by the sand  
 just south of the sahara we find the sahel the name means edge of the desert 
 and this is the region most closely associated with desertification it was here in the late
 that major droughts brought three million people to become dependent upon emergency food aid with about up to two hundred and fifty thousand dying 
 this is a catastrophe waiting to happen again and it 's one that gets very little attention in our accelerated media culture 
 desertification is simply too slow to reach the headlines 
 it 's nothing like a tsunami
 or a katrina too few crying children and smashed up houses  
 and yet desertification is a major threat on all continents affecting some one hundred and ten countries
 and about seventy percent of the world 's agricultural drylands
 it seriously threatens the livelihoods of millions of people and
 especially in africa and china  and it is largely an issue that we 've created for ourselves through unsustainable use of scarce resources  
 so we get climate change  we get droughts increased desertification crashing food systems water scarcity
  a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously 
 but how far away is it i went to sokoto in northern nigeria to try and find out how how far away it is 
 the dunes here move southward at a pace of around six hundred meters a year that 's the sahara eating up almost [ two meters ] a day of the arable land physically pushing people away from their homes 
 here i am i 'm the second person
  on the left 
 with the elders in gidan kara a tiny village outside of sokoto  
 they had to move this village in one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven as a huge dune threatened to swallow it so they moved the entire village hut by hut 
 this is where the village used to be it took us about ten minutes to climb up to the top of that dune which goes to show why they
  had to move to a safer location 
 that 's the kind of forced migration that desertification can lead to 
 if you happen to live close to the desert border you can pretty much calculate how long it will be before you have to carry your kids away 
 and abandon your home and your life as you know it 
 now sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts and still those extreme environments are very good places
 if we want to stop the shifting sands  
 four years ago twenty three african countries came together to create the great green wall sahara a fantastic project the initial plan called for a shelter belt of trees 
  to be planted right across the african continent from mauritania in the west all the way to djibouti in the east if you want to stop a sand dune from moving what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains from avalanching
  over its crest and a good way of doing that the most efficient way is to use some kind of sand catcher trees or cacti are good for this
  but one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they chop them down for firewood  
 now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they won 't get chopped down this sandstone wall that i 'm proposing
  essentially does three things it adds roughness to the dune 's surface to the texture of the dune 's surface  
 binding the grains 
 it provides a physical support structure for the trees 
 and it creates physical spaces habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes if people live inside of the green barrier they can help support the trees protect them from humans and from some of the forces of nature 
 inside of the dunes
  we find shade
 we can start harvesting condensation  and start greening the desert from within 
 sand dunes are almost like ready made buildings in a way all we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid  and then excavate the sand 
 and we have our architecture  
 we can either excavate it by hand or we can have the wind excavate it for us so the wind carries the sand onto the site and then it carries the redundant
  sand away from the structure for us 
 but by now you 're probably asking how am i planning to solidify a sand dune how do we glue those grains of sand together  
 and the answer is perhaps that you use these guys bacillus pasteurii 
  that is readily available in wetlands and marshes and does precisely that it takes a pile of loose sand and it creates sandstone out
 these images from the american society for microbiology show us the process what happens is you pour bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand and it starts filling up the voids 
 in between the grains a chemical process produces calcite which is a kind of natural cement
  i learned about this from a professor at u c davis called jason dejong he managed to do it in in a mere one thousand four hundred minutes 
 here i am playing the part of the mad scientist working with the bugs at ucl in london  
 trying to solidify them  so how much would this cost
  i 'm not an economist very much not but i did quite literally a
  we would have to pay in the region of ninety dollars and after an initial cost of sixty bucks to buy the bacteria which you 'll never have to pay again 
 one cubic meter of bacterial sand would be about eleven dollars  
 how do we construct something like this well i 'll quickly show you two options the first is to create a kind of balloon structure fill it with bacteria 
 then allow the sand to wash over the balloon
 pop the balloon as it were disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it then a few years afterwards using permacultural strategies  
 we green that part of the desert 
 the second alternative would be to use injection piles so we pushed the piles down through the dune 
 and we create an initial bacterial surface  we then pull the piles up through the dune
 and we 're able to create almost any conceivable shape
  inside of the sand with the sand acting as a mold as we go up 
 so we have a way of turning sand into sandstone  and then creating these habitable spaces
 inside of the desert dunes but what should they look like
 like well i was inspired for my architectural form by tafoni which look a little bit like this this is a model representation of it 
 these are cavernous rock structures that i found on the site
 in sokoto and i realized that if i scaled them up they would provide me with good
 spatial qualities for ventilation for thermal comfort and for for other things now  part of the
 formal control over this structure would be lost to nature obviously as the bacteria do their work  and i think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually
 i think there is really something in that articulation
 that is quite nice
 we see the result the traces if you like 
 of the bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert into these habitable environments some people believe that
 this would
 spread uncontrollably  and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way that 's not true at all it 's a natural process it goes on in nature today  and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them
  architectural
  structures made from the desert itself sand stopping devices made from sand 
 the world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century in a period of
 unprecedented population growth and increased food demands this could prove
  and quite frankly we 're putting our heads in the sand if
 nothing else i would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion 
 but if i had something like a ted wish it would be to actually get it built to start building this habitable wall this very very long  
 but very narrow city in the desert built into the dunescape
 itself  it 's
 not only something that supports trees but something that connects people and countries
  together  i would like to conclude
 by showing you an animation of the structure  
 and leave you with a sentence by by jorge luis borges borges said
 that nothing is built
 on stone  everything is built on sand but we must build as if the sand
