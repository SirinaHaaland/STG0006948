  if you had caught me straight out of college in the halls of the vermont state house where i was a lobbyist in training
 and asked me what i was going to do with my life i would have told you that i 'd just passed the
  the chinese equivalency exam and i was going to go study law in beijing  
 and i was going to improve u s china relations through top down policy changes and judicial system reforms 
 i had a plan
 and i never ever thought it would have anything to do with the banjo
  little did i know what a huge impact it would have on me one night
 when i was at a party and i heard a sound coming out of a record player in the corner of a room and it was it was doc watson singing and playing shady grove
  that sound was just so
 beautiful the sound of doc 's voice and the rippling groove of the banjo and after being
 totally and completely obsessed with the mammoth richness
 and history of chinese culture it was like this total relief to hear something so truly
  american and so truly awesome i knew i had to take a banjo with me to china 
 so before going to law school in china i bought a banjo i threw it in my little red truck and i
 i traveled down through appalachia and i
 i learned a bunch of old american songs and i ended up in kentucky at the international bluegrass music association convention and i was
  sitting in a hallway one night and a couple girls came up to me and they said hey
 do you want to jam 
 and i was like sure so i picked up my banjo and i nervously played four songs that i actually knew with them 
 and a record executive walked up to me and invited me to nashville tennessee to make a record
  eight years
 and i can tell you that i didn 't go to china to become a lawyer in fact i went to nashville  
 and after a few months i was writing songs  and the first song i wrote was in english and the second one
 was in chinese
  outside your door the world is waiting  inside your heart a voice is calling the four corners of the world are watching so travel daughter travel 
 go get it girl
  it 's really been eight years since that fated night in kentucky
  and i 've played thousands of shows and i 've collaborated with so many incredible inspirational musicians around the world 
 and i see the power of music i see the power of music to connect
 cultures i see it when i stand on a stage in a bluegrass festival in east virginia and i look out at the sea of lawn
  chairs and i bust out into a song in chinese [ chinese ]
 and everybody 's eyes just pop wide open like it 's going to
 fall out of their heads  and they 're like what 's that girl doing and then they come up to me after the show and they all have a story they all come up
  to china and adopted a girl and i tell you what it like everybody 's
 got a story it 's just incredible  and then i go to china
 and i stand on a stage at a university and i bust out into a song in chinese and everybody sings along and they
 roar with delight at this girl
 with the hair and the
  instrument and she 's singing their music  
 and i see even more importantly 
 the power of music to connect hearts like the time i was in sichuan province
 and i was singing for kids in relocation schools in the earthquake disaster zone  and this little girl
  big sister wong  can i sing you a song that my mom sang for me before she was swallowed in the earthquake 
 and i sat down
  she sat on my lap she started singing her song and the warmth of her body
 and the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks and i started to cry  and
 the light that shone off of her eyes
 was a place i could have
 stayed forever  and in that moment we weren 't our american selves  we weren 't our chinese selves  we were just
  mortals sitting together in that light that keeps us here 
 i want to dwell in that light
 with you and with everyone and i know u s china relations doesn 't need another lawyer  thank you
