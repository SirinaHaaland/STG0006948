  many times i go around the world to speak  and people ask me questions about the challenges 
 my moments some of my
  single mother of four three months after the birth of my fourth child  i went to do a job
 as a research assistant i
 went to northern liberia  and as part of the work the village would give you
  and they gave me lodging with a single mother
 and her daughter  this girl
 happened to be the only girl in the entire village
 who had made it
 to the ninth grade  
 she was the laughing stock of the community 
 her mother was often told by other women you and your child will die poor 
 after two weeks of working in that village it was
  time to go back the mother came to me  knelt down and said leymah  take my daughter  
 i wish for her
 to be a nurse 
 dirt poor  living in the home with my parents  i couldn 't afford to 
 with tears in my eyes i said
 two months later  i go to another village on the same assignment
 and they asked me to live with the village chief 
 the women 's chief of the village has this little girl fair color like me totally dirty  and all day she
  the meaning of her name is pig her mother died while giving birth to her and no one had any idea who her father was 
 for two weeks she became my companion  slept with me  i bought her used clothes
 and bought her her first
  the night before i left  she came to the room and said leymah  don 't leave me here  
 i wish to go with you  i wish to go to school 
 dirt poor no money  living with my parents  i again said no 
 two months later both of those villages fell
 into another war  till today
  i have no idea where those two girls are
 two thousand and four in the peak of our activism  the minister of gender liberia called me and 
 i want you to bring her home because we don 't have safe homes the story of this little girl  she had been raped by her paternal grandfather every day for six months 
 she came to
  me bloated very pale 
 every night i 'd come from work and lie on the cold floor she 'd lie beside me and say auntie  
 i wish to be well  i wish to go to school
 a young woman stands before president sirleaf and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together
  father and mother died during the war  she 's nineteen her dream is to go to college to be able to support them  she 's highly athletic 
 one of the things that happens is that she applies for a scholarship full scholarship  
 she gets it her dream of going to school  her wish of being educated is
  she goes to school on the first day the director of sports who 's responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class and for the next three years her fate will be having sex with him
 every day as a favor for getting her in school  globally  we have policies  
  work leaders great people have made commitments
 we will protect our children from want and from fear the u n has the convention on the rights of the child 
 countries like america we 've heard things like no child left behind other countries come with different things there is a millennium development called three that focuses on
  all of these great works by great people
 aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally  i think has failed 
 in liberia for example the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every ten girls  
 teen prostitution is at its peak in one community we 're
  you wake up in the morning and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper 
 girls as young as twelve being prostituted for less than a dollar a night it
 's disheartening it 's sad  and then someone asked me just before my tedtalk a few days ago so where is the hope 
 several years ago a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and
  the generation of young women it
 's not enough to say you have two nobel laureates from the republic of liberia when your girls ' kids are totally out there and no hope  or seemingly no hope  
 we created a space called the young girls transformative project 
 we go into rural communities and all we do like has been done in this room is create the space
  space when these girls sit 
 you unlock intelligence  you unlock passion 
 you unlock commitment you unlock focus you unlock great leaders today 
 we 've worked with over three hundred  and some of those girls who walked in the room very shy have taken bold steps as young
  mothers to go out there and advocate for the rights of other young women 
 one young woman i met  teen mother of four  
 never thought about finishing high school  graduated successfully  
 never thought about going to college  enrolled in college one day she said to me my wish is to finish college and be able to support my
  children she 's at a place where she can 't find money to go to school  
 she sells water sells soft drinks and sells recharge cards for cellphones and you would think she would take that money and put it back
 into her education  juanita is her name she takes that money and finds single mothers in her community to send back to school
 says leymah  my wish is to be educated  and if i can 't be educated  when i see some of my sisters being educated  my wish has been fulfilled 
 i wish for a better life  i wish for food for my children  i wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop this is the dream of the african girl  
 several years ago
  was one african girl  this girl had a son who wished for a piece of doughnut because he was extremely hungry  
 angry  
 frustrated  really upset about the state of her society and the state of her children  this young girl
  a movement 
 a movement of ordinary women banding together to build peace i will fulfill the wish  this is another african girl 's wish  i 
  failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls i failed to do this these were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman i failed i failed  i failed  
  fearlessly spoke not only
 did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true  the wish of peace came true  
 this young woman wished also to go to school  she went to school  this young woman wished for other things to happen it happened for her 
  this young woman is me a nobel laureate i 'm now on a journey
 to fulfill the wish in my tiny capacity of little african girls the wish of being educated  we set up a foundation 
  we 're giving full four year scholarships to girls from villages that we see with potential  
  i 've also been to places in this u s and i know that girls in this country also have wishes a
 wish for a better life somewhere in the bronx a
 wish for a better life somewhere in downtown l a a wish for a better life somewhere in texas a wish for a better life somewhere in new york a wish for a better life somewhere in new jersey 
 will you journey with me
 to help that girl be it an african girl
 or an american girl
 or a japanese girl fulfill her wish fulfill her dream  achieve that dream because
 all of these great innovators and inventors that we 've talked to and seen over the last few days
 are also sitting in tiny corners in different parts of the world and all they 're asking us
  to do is create that space to unlock the intelligence unlock the passion unlock
 all of the great things that they hold within themselves
  issue that troubles you
 to lead the liberian reconciliation initiative as part of my work i 'm doing these tours
 in different villages and towns thirteen fifteen hours on dirt roads
 and there is no community that i 've gone into
 that i haven 't seen intelligent
  of a great future or the dream of a great future is just a dream 
 because you have all of these vices  teen pregnancy like i said  is epidemic  so what troubles me
 is that i was at that place
 and somehow i 'm at this place and i just
 want to be the only one at this place 
 i 'm looking for ways for other girls to be with me  
 i want to look back twenty years from now and see that there 's another liberian girl ghanaian girl nigerian girl  ethiopian girl standing on this ted stage  
 and maybe just maybe saying because of that nobel laureate
 i 'm here today so i 'm troubled when i see them like there 's no hope
 also not pessimistic  because i know it doesn 't take a lot to get them charged up ca 
 and in the last year  tell us one hopeful thing that you 've seen happening lg 
 i can tell you many hopeful things that i 've seen happening but in the last year where president sirleaf comes from her village we went there to work with these girls 
 and we could not find
  all of these girls went to the gold mine and they were predominantly prostitutes doing other things  we took fifty of those girls
 and we worked with them  and this was at the beginning of elections  
 this is one place where women were never even the older ones barely sat in the circle with
  these girls banded together and formed a group
 and launched a campaign for voter registration  this is a real rural village and the theme they used was even pretty girls vote 
 they were able to mobilize young women but not only did they do that they went to those who were running for seats to ask them what is it that you will give the girls of this community
  one of the guys who already had a seat
 was very because liberia has one of the strongest rape laws and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric  rape is not barbaric but the law he said was barbaric  
 and when the girls started engaging him he was very hostile towards them these
  little girls turned to him and said we will vote you out of office he 's out of office today
