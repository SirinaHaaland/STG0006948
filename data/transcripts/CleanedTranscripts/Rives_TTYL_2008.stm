  here we have a story the start of the story where this
 means guy  and that is a ponytail on a passer by 
 here 's where it happens  these
 are when 
 this is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette tape player she wears it every day it 's not considered vintage she just likes certain music to sound a certain way look at her posture it 's remarkable that 's because she dances
  now he the guy takes all of this in figuring honestly geez what are my chances and
 he could say oh my god or i heart you i 'm laughing out loud i want to give you a hug but he comes up with that you know he tells her 
  put a crab inside it 
 add some water  
 seven different salts he means he 's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land but just panhandle at the ocean he says you look like a mermaid  
 but you walk like a waltz and the girl goes 
  i know i know  i think my heartbeat might be the morse code for inappropriate 
 at least that 's how it seems  
 i 'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes for swearing  awkward silences  and very simple rhyme schemes right now 
 talking to you i 'm
 not even really a guy i 'm
 a monkey 
 blowing kisses
 at a butterfly
  suggesting you and i should meet first soon and then
 a lot
  i 'm thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow  but i 'll stay until you show up ponytail or not hell 
 ponytail alone 
 i don 't know what else to tell you  i got a pencil you can borrow 
 you can put it in your phone
  the girl
 does not budge does not smile does not frown she just says no thank you
