  like to talk to you today about the human brain  which is what we do research on at the university of california  
 just think about this problem for a second here is a lump of flesh about three pounds which you can hold in the palm of your hand  
 but it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space 
 it can contemplate the meaning of infinity
  ask questions about the meaning of its own existence about the nature of god  
 and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world it 's the greatest mystery confronting human beings how does this all come about well 
 the brain as you know is made up of neurons we 're looking at neurons here there are one hundred billion neurons in the adult human brain 
 and each neuron makes something like one thousand to ten thousand contacts with other neurons in the brain  and based on this
  people have calculated that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe  
 so how do you go about studying the brain  one approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain and study changes in their behavior this is what i spoke about in the last ted today i 'll talk about 
  a different approach which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain  and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain
  on the activity of nerve cells in the brain  
 now one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in italy in parma by giacomo rizzolatti and his colleagues 
 is a group of neurons called mirror neurons which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes  
 now it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary motor command neurons in
 front of the brain  which have been known for over fifty years 
 these neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action for example if i do that and reach and grab an apple a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire  
 if i reach out and pull an object another neuron will fire  commanding me to pull that object  
 these are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time 
 but what rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons  maybe about twenty percent of them will also fire when i 'm looking at somebody else performing the same action so
  that fires when i reach and grab something but it also fires when i watch joe reaching and grabbing something  and this is truly astonishing because it 's as though this neuron is adopting the other person 's point of view 
 it 's almost as though it 's performing a performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person 's action  
 now what is the significance of these mirror neurons for one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation  because to imitate a complex act
  act requires my brain to adopt the other person 's point of view so this is important for imitation and emulation well why is that important well let 's take a look at the next slide  
 so  how do you do imitation why is imitation important mirror neurons and imitation emulation  now let 's look at culture the phenomenon of human culture if you
  one hundred thousand years ago  let 's look at human evolution it turns out that something very important happened around  seventy five thousand years ago  and that is there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number 
  of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use the use of fire the use of shelters and of course language and the ability to read somebody else 's mind and interpret that person 's behavior 
 all of that happened relatively quickly even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago
 hundred thousand years ago all of this happened very very quickly and i claim that what happened was
 the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people 's actions so that when there was a sudden
 accidental discovery by one member of the group say the use of fire  or a particular type of tool instead of dying out this spread
  or was transmitted vertically  down the generations so this made evolution suddenly lamarckian instead of darwinian
 darwinian evolution is slow it takes hundreds of thousands of years a polar bear to evolve a coat will take thousands of generations  maybe one hundred thousand years a human being a child can just watch its parent
 kill
 another polar bear  and skin it and put the skin on its body fur on the body  and learn it in one step what the polar bear took one hundred thousand years to learn
 it can learn in five minutes  maybe ten minutes
  and then once it 's learned this it spreads in geometric proportion across a population  this is the basis the imitation of complex skills is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization
 now there is another kind of mirror neuron which is involved in something quite different and that is there are mirror
  just as there are mirror neurons for action there are mirror neurons for touch in other words if somebody touches me my hand neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires 
 but the same neuron in some cases will fire when i simply watch another person being touched 
 so it 's empathizing the other person being touched  so most of them will fire when i 'm touched in different locations different neurons for different locations  but a subset of them will fire even when i watch somebody else being touched in the
  here again you have neurons which are enrolled in empathy now the question then arises  if i simply watch another person being touched  why do i not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation
 merely by watching somebody being touched i mean i empathize with that person but i don 't literally feel the touch  well that 's because you 've got receptors in your skin touch and pain receptors going back into your brain and saying don 't worry you 're not being touched  
  by all means with the other person 
 but do not actually experience the touch otherwise you 'll get confused and muddled okay so there is a feedback signal that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch  
 but if you remove the arm  you simply anesthetize my arm so you put an injection into my arm anesthetize the brachial plexus  so the arm is numb and there is no sensations coming in if i now watch 
  you being touched i literally feel it in my hand in other words  you have dissolved the barrier between you and other
  human beings so i call them
 gandhi neurons  or empathy neurons 
 and this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense  
 all that 's separating you from him from the other person is your skin remove the skin  you experience that person 's touch in your mind you 've dissolved the barrier between you and other 
  human beings  and this of course is the basis of much of eastern philosophy  and that is there is no real independent self aloof from other human
  beings  inspecting the world inspecting other people you are in fact connected not just via facebook and internet you 're actually quite literally connected by your neurons and there is whole chains of neurons 
  around this room talking to each other and there is no real distinctiveness of your consciousness from somebody else 's consciousness  and this is not mumbo jumbo philosophy it emerges from our understanding of basic
  a patient with a phantom limb if the arm has been removed and you have a phantom and you watch somebody else being touched  you feel it in your phantom  
 now the astonishing thing is if you have pain in your phantom limb  you squeeze the other person 's hand massage the other person 's hand that relieves the pain in your phantom hand  
 almost as though the neuron were were obtaining relief from merely watching somebody else being massaged
  from other human beings
