  debate is over the proposition what the world needs now is nuclear energy 
 true or false  and before we have the debate  i 'd like to actually take a show of hands
  hands down those who are against raise your hands  okay i 'm reading that at about
 in favor at the start which means
 we 're going to take a vote at the end and see see how that shifts if at all 
 so here 's the format they 're going to have six minutes each and then after one little quick exchange between them i want two people on each side
  of this debate in the audience to have thirty seconds to make one short crisp pungent powerful point 
 so in favor of the proposition possibly shockingly is one of truly the founders of the environmental movement
 tedster  the founder of the whole earth catalog someone we all know and love stewart brand
  those who know the most
 are the most worried  
 with nuclear  those who know the most are the least worried 
 a classic example is james hansen a nasa climatologist pushing for three hundred and fifty parts per million carbon dioxide in the atmosphere he came out with a wonderful book recently called storms of my grandchildren 
 and hansen is hard over for nuclear power  as are most climatologists who are engaging
 this issue seriously  this is the design situation a planet that is facing climate change and is now half urban 
 look at the client base for this five out of six of us live in the developing world 
 we are moving to cities we are moving up in the world  and
  we are educating our kids having fewer kids basically good news all around but we move to cities toward the bright lights and one of the things that is there that we want besides jobs is electricity  
 and if it isn 't easily gotten we 'll go ahead and steal it  
 this is one of the most desired things by poor people all over the world  in the cities and in the countryside 
 electricity for cities at its best is what 's called
  that 's where it is on all the time  and so far there are only three major sources of that
 coal and gas hydro electric which in most places is maxed out and nuclear  
 i would love to have something in the fourth place here but in terms of constant clean  scalable energy [ solar
 ] and wind and the other renewables aren 't there yet because they 're inconstant 
 nuclear is and has been for forty years
  standpoint  the main thing you want to look at is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal the two major sources of electricity  
 if all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear the waste from that lifetime of electricity would go in a coke can a pretty heavy coke can about two pounds 
  but one day of coal adds up to one hell of a lot of carbon dioxide in a normal 
 then what happens to the waste the nuclear waste typically goes into a dry cask storage out back of the parking lot at the reactor site because most places don 't have underground storage yet it 's just as well because
 it can stay where it is while the carbon dioxide vast quantities of it
  gigatons goes into the atmosphere where we can 't get it back yet and where it is causing the problems that we 're most concerned about  
 so when you add up the greenhouse gases in the lifetime
 of these various energy sources nuclear is down there with wind and hydro below solar and way below
  all the fossil fuels wind is wonderful i love wind i love being around these
 big wind generators  
 but one of the things we 're discovering is that wind like solar is an actually relatively dilute source of energy  
 and so it takes a very large footprint on the land a very large footprint in terms of materials five to ten times what you 'd use for nuclear 
 and typically to get one gigawatt of electricity is on the order of two hundred and fifty square miles
 of wind farm 
 in places like denmark and germany they 've maxed out on wind already they 've run out of good sites the power lines
 are getting overloaded  and you you peak out likewise with solar  especially here in california we 're discovering that
 the eighty solar farm schemes that are going forward want to basically bulldoze one thousand square miles
 of southern california desert well 
 as an environmentalist we would rather that didn 't happen  it 's okay on frapped out agricultural land solar 's wonderful on rooftops  
 but out in the landscape one gigawatt is on the order of fifty square miles of bulldozed desert  when you add all these things up
 saul griffith did the numbers and figured out what would it take
 to get
  thirteen clean terawatts of energy
 from wind solar and biofuels  
 and that area would be roughly the size of the united states an area he refers to as renewistan a
 guy who 's added it up all this very well is david mackay a physicist in england and in his wonderful
  in terms of weapons  the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy  we have been taking down the russian warheads  
 turning it into electricity ten percent of american electricity comes from decommissioned warheads  
 we haven 't even started
  i think of most interest to a ted audience would be the new generation of reactors that are very small 
 down around ten to one hundred and twenty five megawatts  this is one from toshiba  here 's one the russians are already building that floats on a barge  
 and that would be very interesting in the developing world  typically these things are put in the ground  they 're referred to as nuclear batteries they 're incredibly safe weapons 
  a commercial version from new mexico called the hyperion  and another one from oregon called nuscale  
 babcock & wilcox that make nuclear reactors here 's an integral fast reactor 
 thorium reactor that nathan myhrvold 's involved in the governments of the world are going to have to decide that coals need to be made expensive and these will go
  been at the nitty gritty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years in two thousand he discovered that soot was probably the second leading cause of global warming after co2 
 his team have been making detailed
  calculations
 of the relative impacts of different energy sources  his first time at ted possibly a disadvantage we shall see from stanford 
 professor mark jacobson good luck mark jacobson thank you 
 so my premise here is that nuclear energy puts out more carbon dioxide
 puts out more air pollutants enhances mortality more and takes longer to put up than real renewable energy systems namely wind solar 
 geothermal power hydro tidal wave power  
 and it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation  so let 's start just by looking at the co2 emissions from the life cycle
  co2e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted
  and if you look wind and concentrated solar have the lowest co2 emissions if you look at the graph nuclear there are two bars here one is a low estimate and one is a high estimate the low estimate is the nuclear 
  energy industry estimate of nuclear  the high is the average of one hundred and three scientific peer reviewed studies  
  years to put up a nuclear power plant from planning to operation this includes about three and a half to six years for a site permit and another two and a half to four years for a construction permit and issue  and then four to nine years for
 actual construction and in china right now they 're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear and the average just for the construction time of these is seven point one years 
 on top of any planning times while you 're waiting around for your nuclear  you have to run the regular electric
  power grid which is mostly coal in the united states and around the world  and the chart here shows the difference between the emissions from the regular grid
 resulting if you use nuclear or anything else versus wind  csp
 or photovoltaics wind takes about two to five years on average  same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics
 so the difference is the opportunity cost of using nuclear versus wind or something else so if you add these two together alone  you can see a separation that 
  nuclear puts out at least nine to seventeen times more co2 equivalent emissions than wind energy  
  to battery electric vehicles hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or flex fuel vehicles run on
  right now in the united states fifty to one hundred thousand people die per year from air pollution and vehicles are about twenty five thousand of those in two thousand and twenty the number will go down to fifteen thousand 
  due to improvements  and so on the right you see gasoline emissions the death rates of two thousand and twenty  if you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol you 'd actually increase the death rate slightly
 if you go to nuclear  you do get a big reduction but it 's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar now if you consider the fact that nuclear
 weapons proliferation is associated with nuclear energy proliferation 
 because we know for example india and pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly by enriching uranium in nuclear energy facilities  north korea did that to some extent
  iran is doing that right now  and venezuela would be doing it if they started with their nuclear energy facilities
  if you do a large scale expansion of nuclear energy across the world  and as a result there was just one nuclear bomb
 created that was used to destroy a city such as mumbai or or some other big city megacity the additional death
  rates due to this averaged over thirty years and then scaled to the population of the u s would be this so do we need this
  the next thing is what about the footprint  stewart mentioned the footprint actually the footprint on the ground for wind is by far the smallest of any energy source in the world  that because the footprint 
 as you can see is just the pole touching the ground  and you can power the entire u s vehicle fleet with seventy three thousand to one hundred and
  thousand five megawatt wind turbines that would take between one and three square kilometers of footprint on the ground entirely  the spacing is something else that 's the footprint that
 is always being confused people confuse footprint with spacing as you can see from these pictures  the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes including agricultural land  range land or open space over the ocean
  look at nuclear  
 with nuclear what do we have we have facilities around there you also have a buffer zone that 's seventeen square kilometers  and you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with now 
 if we go to the area  lots is worse than nuclear or wind for example cellulosic ethanol to power the entire u s vehicle
  this is how much land you would need that 's cellulosic second generation biofuels from prairie grass here 's corn ethanol
 it 's smaller this is based on
 ranges from data but if you look at nuclear it would be the size of rhode island to power the u s vehicle fleet for wind  there 's a larger area but much smaller footprint 
 and of course with wind  you could put it all over the east coast  offshore theoretically or you can split it up  and now if you go back to
 looking at geothermal it 's even smaller
  than both and solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing  but it 's still pretty small and this is to power the entire u s vehicle fleet to power the entire world with fifty percent 
  wind  you would need about one percent of world land  matching the reliability  base load is actually irrelevant we want to match the hour by hour
 and it considers just using existing hydro to match the hour by hour power demand here are the world wind resources there 's five to ten times more wind available worldwide than 
 we need for all the world so then here 's the final ranking  and one last slide i just want to show  this is the choice
  you guarantee ice will last nuclear  the time lag alone will allow the arctic to melt and other places to melt more and we can guarantee a clean  blue sky
 or an uncertain future
 with nuclear power 
 all right so while they 're having their comebacks on each other and yours is slightly short because you slightly overran i need two people from either side
 if you 're for this  if you 're for nuclear power  put up two hands if you 're against put up one 
 and i want two of each for the mics now then you guys have
 you have a minute comeback on him to
 pick up a point he said challenge it whatever sb 
 i think a point of difference we 're having mark
  and
 energy  
 these diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow putting out a lot of greenhouse gases a lot of those studies include well of course war will be inevitable and therefore we 'll have cities burning and stuff like that which
 is kind of finessing it a little bit i think the reality is that there 's what twenty one nations that have
  of those seven have nuclear weapons in every case they got the weapons before they got the nuclear power  
 there are two nations north korea and israel that have nuclear weapons and don 't have nuclear power at all 
 the places that we would most like to have really clean energy occur are china  india  europe  north america all of which have sorted out their situation in relation to nuclear weapons 
 so that leaves a couple of places like iran maybe venezuela
  venezuela that you would like to have very close
 surveillance of anything that goes on with fissile stuff 
 pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we really know where all of the fissile material is and we can move toward zero weapons left  once we know all that
  and then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories  so the other thing is 
 we don 't need nuclear energy there 's plenty of solar and wind you can make it reliable as i showed with that diagram that 's from real data and this is an ongoing research this is not rocket science  solving the world 's problems can be done if you really put your mind to it and use clean renewable
  when i joined the board of environmental defense fund that was one of the crafters of the kyoto protocol
  and i want to support stewart brand 's position  i 've come around in the last ten years i used to be against nuclear power i 'm now supporting stewart 's position softly from a
  standpoint  agreeing that the risks of overheating the planet outweigh the risk of
 nuclear incident which certainly is possible and is a very real problem  however i think there may be a win win solution here where both parties can win this debate   and that is 
 we face a situation where it 's carbon carbon caps on this planet
  in the united states senate we need bipartisan support only one or two votes are needed to move global warming through the senate  and this room can help  so if we get that through then mark will solve these problems thanks chris ca thank you rod beckstrom  against david fanton 
 hi i 'm david fanton i just want to say a couple quick things the first is be aware of the propaganda the propaganda from the industry has been very very
  we have not had the other side of the argument fully aired so that people can draw their own conclusions be very aware of the propaganda secondly think about this if 
  we build all these nuclear power plants all that waste is going to be on hundreds if not thousands of trucks and trains moving through this country every day 
  tell me that those accidents aren 't going to put material into the environment that is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years 
 and then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains isn 't a potential terrorist target
  that i own and i 'm you know very much pro that kind of stuff  however  there 's a basic arithmetic problem here the
 capability of the sun shining the wind blowing
 and the rain falling simply isn 't enough to add up  so if we want to keep the lights on we actually need a solution which is going to keep generating all of the
  i campaigned against nuclear weapons in the ' 80s 
 and i continue to do so now but we 've got an opportunity to recycle them into something more useful that enables us to get energy all of the time and ultimately the arithmetic 
  problem isn 't going to go away we 're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone we need a solution that generates all of the time if we 're going to keep the lights on 
  last person who was in favor made the premise that we don 't have enough alternative renewable resources and our
 against proponent up here made it very clear that we actually do and so the fallacy that we need this resource and and we can actually make it in a time frame that is 
 meaningful is is not possible i will also add one other thing ray kurzweil and all the other talks we know that the the stick is going up exponentially
 so you can 't look at state of the art technologies in renewables and say that 's all we have because five years from now  it will blow you away what we 'll actually have as alternatives to this horrible disastrous nuclear power ca point well made thank you 
 so each of you has really just a couple sentences thirty seconds each
  it all balances out chart that you had there it was a sunny day and a windy night and just now in england
 they had a cold spell all of the wind in the entire country shut down for a week  none of those things were stirring 
 and as usual they had to buy nuclear power from france two gigawatts comes through the chunnel  this keeps happening
 i used to worry about the ten thousand year factor 
 and the fact is we 're going to use the nuclear waste we have for fuel in the fourth generation of reactors that are coming along and especially the small reactors need to go forward i heard from nathan myhrvold and i think here 's the action point
 it 'll take an act of congress to make the nuclear regulatory commission start moving quickly on these small reactors which we need very much here and in the world
 we 've analyzed the 
 power demand and supply looking at solar wind  using data for california  and you can match that demand hour by hour for the whole year almost  
 now with regard to the resources
 we 've developed the first wind map of the world from data alone at eighty meters we know what the wind resources are you can cover fifteen percent fifteen percent of the entire u s has wind at 
  fast enough speeds to be cost competitive and there 's much more solar than there is wind there 's plenty of resource you can make it reliable
  people of the ted community i put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy all those in favor raise your hands
  now that is
 my take on that just put up hands up people who changed their minds during the debate who voted differently those of you who changed your mind
 in favor of for put your hands up okay so here 's here 's the read on it both people won
  mood of the ted community shifted from about 
 to about sixty five to 
 in favor  in favor you both won i congratulate both of you
