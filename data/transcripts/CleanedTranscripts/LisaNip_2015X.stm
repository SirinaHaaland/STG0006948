  so there are lands few and far between on earth itself that are hospitable to humans by any measure  
 but survive we have our primitive ancestors
 when they found their homes and livelihood endangered they dared to make their way into unfamiliar territories in search of better opportunities  
 and as the descendants of these explorers we have their nomadic blood coursing through our own veins  
 but at the same time distracted by our bread and circuses and embroiled in the wars that we have waged on each other 
 it seems that we have forgotten this desire to explore 
 we as a species
 uniquely
 for earth on earth  and by earth  
 and so content are we with our living conditions that we have grown complacent
 and just too busy to notice that its resources are finite  and that our sun 's life is also finite  
 while mars and all the movies made in its name have reinvigorated the ethos for space travel
 few of us seem to truly realize that our species ' fragile constitution
 is woefully unprepared for long duration journeys into space  
 let us take a trek to your local national forest for a quick reality check 
 so just a quick show of hands here how many of you think you would be able to survive in this lush wilderness for a few
  that 's a lot of you  how about a few weeks that
 's a decent amount how about a few months 
 that 's pretty good too now let us imagine that this local national forest experiences
 an eternal winter same questions how many of you think you would be able to survive for a few days 
 that 's quite a lot how about a few weeks  
 so
 for a fun twist let us imagine that the
  source of water available is trapped as frozen blocks miles below the surface soil nutrients are so minimal that no vegetation can be found 
 and of course hardly any atmosphere exists to speak of 
 such examples are only a few of the many challenges we would face on a planet
  like mars so how do we steel ourselves for voyages whose destinations are so far removed from a tropical vacation 
 will we continuously ship supplies from planet earth  
 build space elevators  or impossible miles of transport belts that tether your planet of choice to our home planet 
 and how do we grow things like food that grew up on earth like us 
 but i 'm getting ahead of myself in our
  species ' journey to find a new home under a new sun 
 we are more likely than not going to be spending much time in the journey itself in space 
 on a ship a hermetic flying can 
 possibly for many generations  
 the longest continuous amount of time that any human has spent in space is in the vicinity of twelve to fourteen months 
 astronauts ' experiences in space  we know that spending time in a microgravity environment
 means bone loss  
 muscle atrophy  cardiovascular problems among many other complications that range for the physiological to the psychological
 and what about macrogravity or any other variation in gravitational pull of the planet that we find ourselves on in short our
  cosmic voyages will be fraught with dangers both known and unknown 
 so far we 've been looking to this new piece of mechanical technology or that great next generation robot as part of a lineup to ensure our species safe passage in space  
 wonderful as they are i believe the time has come for us to complement
  living machine it requires fairly little to maintain offers much flexibility in design and only asks to be carried in a single plastic tube  
 the field of study that has enabled us
  to utilize the capabilities of the microbe is known as synthetic biology  it comes from molecular biology which has given us antibiotics  vaccines and
 better ways to observe the physiological nuances of the human body 
 using the tools of synthetic biology  we can now edit the genes of nearly any organism  
 microscopic or not with incredible speed and fidelity 
 given the limitations of
  synthetic biology will be a means for us to engineer not only our food our fuel
 and our environment but also ourselves
 to compensate for our physical inadequacies and to ensure our survival in space 
 to give you an example of how we can use synthetic biology for space exploration  let us return to the mars environment  the martian soil
 composition is similar to that of hawaiian volcanic ash with trace amounts of organic material 
 let 's say  hypothetically what if martian soil could actually support plant growth without using earth derived nutrients 
 the first question we should probably ask is how would we make our plants cold tolerant 
 because on average the temperature on mars is a very uninviting negative sixty degrees centigrade  
 the next question we should ask is how do we make our plants
  most of the water that forms as frost
 evaporates more quickly than i can say the word evaporate 
 well it turns out we 've already done things like this by borrowing genes for anti freeze protein from fish
 and genes for drought tolerance from other plants like rice and then stitching them into the plants that need them we now have plants that can tolerate most droughts and freezes
 or genetically modified organisms and we rely on them to feed all the mouths of human civilization nature
 does stuff like this already without our help  we have simply found more precise ways to do it 
 so why would we want to change the genetic makeup of plants for space  well to not do so would mean needing to
  engineer endless acres of land on an entirely new planet by releasing trillions of gallons of atmospheric gasses
 and then constructing a giant glass dome to contain it all it
 's an unrealistic engineering enterprise that quickly becomes a high cost cargo transport mission 
 one of the best ways to ensure that we will have the food supplies and the air that we need
 is to bring with us organisms that have been
  engineered
 to adapt to new and harsh environments 
 in essence using engineered organisms to help us terraform a planet both in the short and long term 
 these organisms can then also be engineered to make medicine or fuel so we can use
 synthetic biology to bring highly engineered plants with us but what else can we do well i mentioned earlier that
  that we as a species were evolved uniquely for planet earth 
 that fact has not changed much in the last five minutes that you were sitting here and i was standing there 
 and so if we were to dump any of us on mars right this minute  even given ample food water air
 and a suit  we are likely to experience very unpleasant health problems from the amount of ionizing radiation that bombards
  the surface of planets like mars that have little or nonexistent atmosphere  
 unless we plan to stay holed up underground for the duration of our stay on every new planet 
 we must find better ways of protecting ourselves without needing to resort to wearing a suit of armor that weighs something equal to your own body weight or needing to hide behind a wall of lead 
 so let us appeal to nature for inspiration
 among the plethora of life here on earth  there 's a subset of organisms known as extremophiles or lovers of extreme living conditions if you 'll remember from high school biology  
 and among these organisms is a bacterium by the name of deinococcus radiodurans  
 it is known to be able to withstand cold
  radiation tolerance mechanisms are known we have yet to adapt the relevant genes to mammals 
 to do so is not particularly easy there are many facets that go into its radiation tolerance and it 's not as simple as transferring one gene but
 given a little bit of human ingenuity and a little bit of time i think to do so is not very
  even if we borrow just a fraction
 of its ability to tolerate radiation it would be infinitely better than what we already have which is just the melanin in our skin  
 using the tools of synthetic biology we can harness deinococcus radiodurans ' ability to thrive under otherwise very lethal doses of radiation 
 as difficult as it is to see  homo sapiens
 evolves every day  and still continues to evolve  
 thousands of years of human evolution has not only given us humans like tibetans  who can thrive in low oxygen conditions  
 but also argentinians  who can ingest and metabolize arsenic  the chemical element that can kill
  the average human being 
 every day  the human body evolves by accidental mutations that equally accidentally allow certain humans to persevere in dismal situations 
 but and this is a big but  
 such evolution requires two things that we may not always have or be able to afford and they are death
 and time 
  in our species ' struggle to find our place in the universe 
 we may not always have the time necessary for the natural evolution of extra functions for survival on on non earth planets we
 're living in what e o wilson has termed the age of
 gene circumvention 
 during which we remedy our genetic defects like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy with temporary external supplements  
 but with every passing day  we approach the age of volitional evolution
  during which we as a species will have the capacity to decide for ourselves our own genetic destiny  
 augmenting the human body with new abilities is no longer a question of how but of when 
 using synthetic biology to change the genetic makeup of any living organisms especially our own is not without its moral and ethical quandaries 
 will engineering
  ourselves make us less human but then again what is humanity but star stuff that happens to be conscious 
 where should human genius direct itself  surely it is a bit of a waste to sit back and marvel at it 
 how do we use our knowledge to protect ourselves from the external dangers
 and then protect ourselves from ourselves
 i pose these questions not to engender the fear of science
 but to bring to light the many possibilities that science has afforded and continues to afford us 
 we must coalesce as humans to discuss and embrace the solutions not only with caution
 but also with courage
  but it will not be our last 
 our true final frontier is the line we must cross in deciding what we can and should make of our species ' improbable intelligence 
 space
 is cold brutal
 and unforgiving our path to the stars will be rife with trials that will bring us to question not only who we are but where we will be going
  the answers will lie in our choice to use or abandon the technology that we have gleaned from life itself  and it will define us for the remainder of our term in this universe  thank you
