  i would start with a simple request i 'd like
 all of you to to pause for a moment you wretched weaklings and take stock of your
  that was the advice that st benedict gave his rather startled followers
 in the fifth century it
 was the advice that i decided to follow myself when i turned forty 
 up until that moment  i had been that classic corporate warrior i was eating too much i was drinking too much i was working too hard and i was neglecting the family  
 and i decided
 that i would try and turn my life around in particular
 i decided i would try to address the thorny issue of work life balance  
 so i stepped back from the workforce  
 and i spent a year at home with my wife and four young children  
 but all i learned about work life balance from that year
 was that i found it quite easy to balance work and life when i didn 't have any work
 not a very useful skill
 especially when the when the money runs out so i went back to work and i 've spent these seven years since
 struggling with studying and writing about work life
  i have four observations i 'd like to share with you today the first is if society 's to make any progress on this issue we need an honest
 debate  but the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work life balance 
 all the discussions about
  which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible
 with being meaningfully engaged on a day to day basis with a young family  
 now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you 're
  and the reality of the society that we 're in
 is there are thousands and thousands of people out there
 leading lives of quiet screaming desperation  where they work long hard hours at jobs they hate
 to enable them to buy things they don 't need to impress people they don 't like it 's
 my contention that going to work on friday in jeans and [ a ] t shirt isn 't really getting
  to the nub of the issue 
 the second observation i 'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations
 aren 't going to solve this issue for us we
 should stop looking outside  it 's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead
  you don 't design your life someone else will design it for you and you may just not like their idea of balance  
 it 's particularly important
 this isn 't on the world wide web is it i 'm about to get fired it 's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial
  i 'm not talking here just about the bad companies the abattoirs of the human soul as i call them i
 'm talking about all companies  because commercial companies are inherently designed
 to get as much out of you [ as ] they can get away with it 's in their nature it 's in their dna it 's what they do
  on the one hand  putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened 
 on the other hand it 's a nightmare it just means you spend more time at the bloody office 
 we have to be responsible for setting and enforcing
 the boundaries that we want in our life the third observation
 is we have to be careful with the time frame
 that we choose upon which to judge our balance  
 before i went back to work after my year at home  i sat down
 and i wrote out a
 detailed
 description of the ideal balanced day that i aspired
  and it went like this wake up well rested after a good night 's sleep 
 have sex
  walk the dog  have breakfast with my wife and children  
 have sex again 
 laughter drive the kids to school on the way to the office do three
  play a sport with a friend at lunchtime 
 do another three hours ' work  meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink  
 drive home for dinner with my wife and kids  meditate for half an hour 
 have sex  
 walk the dog  have sex again
  how often do you think i have that day 
 we need to be realistic 
 you can 't do it all in one day we need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life but we need to elongate it
 without falling into the trap of the i 'll have a life when i retire when my kids have left home
  wife has divorced me my health is failing  i 've got no mates or interests left 
 a day is too short after i retire is too long there 's got to be a middle way 
 a fourth observation we need to approach balance in a balanced way 
  a friend came to see me last year and she doesn 't mind me telling this story a friend came to see me last year and said nigel i 've read your book  and i realize that my life is completely out of balance  it 's totally dominated by work  
 i work ten hours a day  i commute two hours a day all of my relationships have failed  there 's nothing in my life apart from my work  
 so i 've decided to get a grip and sort it out
  i don 't mean to mock  but being a fit 10 hour a day office rat
 isn 't more balanced  it 's more fit 
 lovely though physical exercise may be there are other parts to life there 's the intellectual side there 's the emotional side there 's the
  i believe we have to attend to all of those areas not just do fifty stomach crunches  
 now that can be daunting  because people say bloody hell mate  i haven 't got time to get fit  you want me to go to church and call my mother 
 and i understand i truly understand how that can be daunting  but an incident that happened a couple of years
  gave me a new perspective my wife who is somewhere in the audience today  called me up at the office
 and said nigel you need to pick our youngest son harry up from school because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening 
 so i left work an hour early that afternoon
 and picked harry up at the school gates we walked down to the local park
  messed around on the swings played some silly games  i then walked him up the hill to the local cafe  and we shared a pizza for two 
 then walked down the hill to our home
 and i gave him his bath and put him in his batman pajamas  i then read him a chapter of roald dahl 's james and the giant peach 
 i then put him to bed  tucked him in gave him a kiss on his forehead and said goodnight mate 
  this has been the best day of my life  ever 
 i hadn 't done anything 
 hadn 't taken him to disney world or bought him a playstation  now my point is the small things matter 
 being more balanced doesn 't mean dramatic upheaval in your
  life with the smallest investment in the right places  you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life  
 moreover  i think  it can transform society  
 because if enough people do it we can change society 's definition of success
 away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins
  wins to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like 
 and that i think is an idea worth spreading
