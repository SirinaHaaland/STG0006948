  i have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive  
 waking up with abraham lincoln in the morning thinking of franklin roosevelt when i went to bed at night 
 but when i try and think about what i 've learned about the meaning in life my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that i took when i
  was a graduate student at harvard
 with the great psychologist erik erikson he taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance
 between three realms work love and play 
 and that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other  is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age 
 whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication is to make possible a life filled not only
  with achievement but with serenity  so since i tell stories let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents i 've studied to illustrate this point
 abraham lincoln and lyndon johnson 
 as for that first sphere of work 
 i think what abraham lincoln 's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing  
 he had a huge ambition but it wasn 't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame
 what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life
 so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it 
 even as a child it seemed lincoln dreamed heroic dreams  he somehow had to escape that hard scrabble farm from which he was born 
 no schooling was possible for him except a few
 weeks here a few weeks there  but he read books in every spare moment he could find 
 it was said when he got a copy of the king james bible or aesop 's fables he was so excited he couldn 't sleep he couldn 't eat 
 the great poet emily dickinson once said there is no frigate like a book to take us lands away how true for lincoln  though he never would travel to europe he went with shakespeare 's kings 
  to merry england he went with lord byron 's poetry to spain and portugal literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings 
  life that he was haunted by death 
 his mother died when he was only nine years old his only sister sarah in childbirth a few years later and his first love ann rutledge at the age of twenty two 
 moreover when his mother lay dying she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an afterworld she simply said to him abraham i 'm going away from you
  and i shall never return 
 as a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away dust to dust 
 but only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient greek notion but followed by other cultures as well
 that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life you could live on in the memory of others your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence  
  and that worthy ambition became his lodestar 
 it carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s three things had combined to lay him low 
 he had broken his engagement with mary todd not certain he was ready to marry her but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that 
 his one intimate friend joshua speed was leaving illinois to go back to kentucky because speed 's father had died 
 and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal
 they took all knives and razors and scissors from his room  
 and his great friend speed went to his side and said lincoln you must rally or you will die 
 he said that i would just as soon die right now  but i 've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that i have lived 
 so fueled by that ambition he returned to the state legislature
  he eventually won a seat in congress 
 he then ran twice for the senate lost twice everyone is broken by life ernest hemingway once said but some people are stronger in the broken places 
 so then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced far more educated far more celebrated rivals  
 and then when he won the general election he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his cabinet it was an unprecedented act at the
  time because everybody thought he 'll look like a figurehead compared to these people they said why are you doing this lincoln he said look these are the strongest and most able men in the country 
  the country is in peril i need them by my side but perhaps my old friend lyndon johnson might have put it in less noble fashion better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out
  but it soon became clear that abraham lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team 
 for each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strengths and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external  rsum 
 for one thing he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other peoples ' point of view he repaired injured feelings that
  have escalated into permanent hostility he shared credit with ease  assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes 
 these are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in two thousand and eight
 he refused to be provoked by petty grievances he never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights
  and he expressed his unshakeable convictions
 in everyday language in metaphors in stories  and with a beauty of language almost as if the shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul 
 in one thousand eight hundred and sixty three when the emancipation proclamation was signed he brought his old friend joshua speed back to the white house
  and remembered that conversation of decades before when he was so sad 
 and he pointing to the proclamation said i believe in this measure my fondest hopes will be realized 
 but as he was about to put his signature on the proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a new year 's reception  so he put the pen down he said if ever my soul were in an act it is in this act  
 but if i sign with a shaking hand
  so he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand  
 but even in his wildest dreams lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach  i was so thrilled to find
 an interview with the great russian writer leo tolstoy in a new york newspaper in the early 1900s 
 and in it tolstoy told of a trip that he 'd recently made to a very remote area of the caucasus where there were only wild barbarians who had never left this part of russia
  that tolstoy was in their midst they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history  
 so he said i told them about napoleon and alexander the great and frederick the great and julius caesar and they loved it but before i finished the chief of the barbarians stood up and said ' but wait you haven 't told us about the greatest ruler of them all 
 we want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder who laughed like the sunrise who came from that place called america which is so far from here
  that if a young man should travel there he would be an old man when he arrived tell us of that man tell us of abraham lincoln ' he was stunned he told them everything he could about lincoln and then in the interview he said what made lincoln so great 
 not as great a general as napoleon not as great a statesman as frederick the great 
 but his greatness consisted and historians would roundly agree
  in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being 
 so in the end that powerful ambition that had carried lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized 
 that ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself 
 to go through that string of political failures and the darkest days of the war his story would be told 
 so as for that second sphere not of work  but of love
 encompassing
  takes work and commitment 
 the lyndon johnson that i saw in the last years of his life when i helped him on his memoirs 
 was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work power and individual success 
 that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone 
 my relationship with him began on a rather curious level i was selected as a white house fellow when i was twenty four years old we had a big dance at the white house
  house president johnson did dance with me that night not that peculiar there were only three women out of the sixteen white house fellows  
 but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the white house  but it was not to be that simple for in the months leading up to my selection 
 like many young people i 'd been active in the anti vietnam war movement and had written an article against lyndon johnson which unfortunately came out in the new republic two days after the dance in the white house
  theme of the article was how to remove lyndon johnson from power so
 i was certain he would kick me out of the program but instead surprisingly he said oh bring her down here for a year and if i can 't win her over no one can 
 so i did end up working for him in the white house eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs never fully understanding why he 'd chosen me to spend so many hours with i like to believe it was because i was a good listener he was a great
  storyteller fabulous colorful anecdotal stories there was a problem with these stories however which i later discovered which is that half of them weren 't true but they were great nonetheless 
 so i think that part of his attraction for me was that i loved listening to his tall tales  but i also worried that part of it was that i was then a young woman and he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing 
  reputation so i constantly chatted to him about boyfriends even when i didn 't have any at all everything was working
  perfectly until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake conveniently called lake lyndon baines johnson and there was wine and cheese and a red checked tablecloth all the romantic trappings and he started out 
 doris more than any other woman i have ever known and my heart sank  and then he said you remind me of my mother
  it was pretty embarrassing given what was going on in my mind  
 but i must say the older i 've gotten the more i realize what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man a victor in a thousand 
  contests three great civil rights laws  medicare aid to education and yet roundly defeated in the end by the war in vietnam 
 so sad and so vulnerable he opened up to me in ways he never would have had i known him at the height of his power sharing his fears his sorrows and his worries  
 and i 'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure that i 've tried to bring to each of my books since then  
 but it also brought home to me the lessons which erik erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life 
 for on the surface lyndon johnson should have had everything in the world to
  to feel good about in those last years in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted he owned a spacious ranch 
  in the countryside a penthouse in the city sailboats speedboats he had servants to answer any whim  and he had a family who loved him deeply  
  he could find no solace in family in recreation in sports or in hobbies
 it was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family without work could not fill it 
 as his spirits sagged his body deteriorated until i believe he slowly brought about his own death  
 in those last years he said he was so
 so sad watching the american people look toward a new president and forgetting him he spoke with immense sadness in his voice 
 saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children and their children in turn  
 but it was too late  despite all that power all that wealth he was alone when he finally died his ultimate terror realized  
 so as for that third sphere of play which he never had learned
 to enjoy  i 've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy enough so that a hobby
 a sport a love of music or art or literature or any form of recreation can provide true pleasure  relaxation and replenishment  
 so deep for instance was abraham lincoln 's love of shakespeare that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater even during those dark days of the war 
 he said when the lights went down and a shakespeare play came on for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in
  hal 's time 
 but an even more important form of relaxation for him that lyndon johnson never could enjoy 
 was a love of somehow humor and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce as a sidelight to the sadness 
 he once said that he laughed so he did not cry that a good story for
  was better than a drop of whiskey 
 his storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in illinois the lawyers and the judges would travel from one county courthouse to the other 
 and when anyone was knowing lincoln was in town they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories he would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales 
 and all these stories became part of his memory bank so he could call on them whenever he needed to and they 're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument one of his favorite
  stories for example had to do with the revolutionary war hero ethan allen  
 and as lincoln told the story mr allen went to britain after the war and the british people were still upset about losing the revolution so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture 
  of general washington in the only outhouse where he 'd have to encounter it they figured he 'd be upset about the indignity of george washington being in an outhouse  but he came out of the outhouse not upset at all 
  you see george washington in there oh yes he said perfectly appropriate place for him what do you mean they said well he said there 's nothing to make an englishman shit faster than the sight of general george washington 
 so you can imagine if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting and he had hundreds of these stories you
 so between his nightly treks to the theater his 
 and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting shakespeare and poetry he found that form of play which carried him through his days 
 in my own life i shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball which allows me from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall to have something to occupy my mind and heart other
  than my work it all began when i was only six years old and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games
 so that when he went to work in new york during the day i could record for him the history of that afternoon 's brooklyn dodgers game 
 now when you 're only six years old and your father comes home every single night and listens to you as i now realize that i in excruciating detail recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon  
  i was telling him a fabulous story it makes you think there 's something magic about history to keep your father 's attention in fact i 'm convinced i learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father 
 because at first i 'd be so excited i would blurt out the dodgers won or the dodgers lost which took much of the drama of this two hour telling away 
  dodgers in those days that i had to confess in my first confession two sins that related to baseball the first occurred because the dodgers ' catcher roy campanella came to my hometown of rockville centre long island just as i was in preparation for my first holy communion  
 and i was so excited first person i 'd ever see outside of ebbets field but it so happened he was speaking in a protestant church when you are brought up as a catholic you think that if you ever set foot in a protestant church you 'll be struck dead at the threshold
  so i went to my father in tears what are we going to do he said don 't worry he 's speaking in a parish hall we 're sitting in folding chairs he 's talking about sportsmanship it 's not a sin 
 but as i left that night  i was certain that somehow i 'd traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with roy campanella 
 and there were no indulgences around that i could buy  
 so i had this sin on my soul when i went to my first confession i told the priest right away he said
 but then unfortunately he said and what else my child 
 and then came my second sin i tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church wishing harm to others being mean to my sisters and he said to whom did you wish harm 
 and i had to say that
 i wished that various new york yankees players would break arms legs and ankles
 so he said look i 'll tell you something i love the brooklyn dodgers as you do but i promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely you do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen oh yes i said but luckily my first confession 
  priest 
 though my father died of a sudden heart attack when i was still in my 20s before i had gotten married and had my three sons 
 i have passed his memory as well as his love of baseball
  baseball on to my boys  though when the dodgers abandoned us to come to l a i lost faith in baseball until i moved to boston and became an irrational red socks fan  
 and i must say  even now when i sit with my sons with our season tickets i can sometimes close my eyes against the sun
 and imagine myself a young girl once more in the presence of my father watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below jackie robinson
  campanella pee wee reese and duke snider
  i shall always be grateful for
