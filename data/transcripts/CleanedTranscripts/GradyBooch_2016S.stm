  and you sir who laughed the loudest you probably still are 
 i grew up in a small town in the dusty plains of north texas
  son of a sheriff who was the son of a pastor  getting into trouble was not an option
  and so i started reading calculus books for fun 
 you did too that led me to building a laser and a computer and model rockets  and that led me to making rocket fuel in my bedroom  
  in scientific terms  we call this a very bad idea 
 around that same time  
 stanley kubrick 's two thousand and one a space odyssey came to the theaters and my life was forever changed  
 i loved everything about that movie  especially the hal nine thousand now hal was a sentient computer designed to guide the discovery spacecraft from
 the earth to jupiter hal was also a flawed character
  for in the end he chose to value the mission over human life 
 now hal was a fictional character  but nonetheless he speaks to our fears our fears of being subjugated by some unfeeling artificial intelligence who is indifferent to our humanity  
 i believe that such fears are unfounded
  we stand at a remarkable time in human history  
 where  driven by refusal to accept the limits of our bodies and our minds 
 we are building machines of exquisite  beautiful complexity and grace that will extend the human experience in ways beyond our imagining 
 after a career that led me from the air force academy to space command to now  i became a
 systems engineer and recently i was drawn into an engineering problem associated with nasa 's mission to mars  
 now  in space flights to the moon we can rely upon mission control in houston to watch over all aspects of a flight  however mars is two hundred times further away  
 and as a result it takes on average thirteen minutes for a signal to travel from the earth to mars if there 's trouble
  there 's not enough time and so a reasonable engineering solution calls for us to put mission control inside the walls of the orion spacecraft 
 another fascinating idea in the mission profile places humanoid robots on the surface of mars before the humans themselves arrive first to build facilities and later to serve as collaborative members of the science team 
  as i looked at this from an engineering perspective it became very clear to me that what i needed to architect
 was a smart collaborative socially intelligent artificial intelligence in other words i needed to build something very much like a hal
 but without the homicidal tendencies 
 let 's pause for a moment is it really possible to build an artificial intelligence
  in many ways this is a hard engineering problem with elements of ai not some wet hair ball of an ai problem that needs to be engineered 
 to paraphrase alan turing
  i 'm not interested in building a sentient machine i 'm not building a hal 
 all i 'm after is a simple brain something that offers the illusion of intelligence 
  the art and the science of computing have come a long way since hal was onscreen and i 'd imagine if his inventor dr chandra were here today he 'd have a whole lot of questions for us 
 is it really possible for us to take a system of millions upon millions of devices to read in their data streams to predict their failures and act in advance 
 yes  
 can we build systems that converse with humans in natural language  yes
  can we build systems that recognize objects identify emotions emote themselves play games and even read lips 
 yes  can we build a system that sets goals that carries out plans against those goals and learns along the way yes  
 can we build systems
 that have a theory of mind this we are learning to do can we build systems that have an ethical and moral foundation 
 this we must learn how to do 
 so let 's accept for a moment that it 's possible to build
  such an artificial intelligence for this kind of mission and others the next question you must ask yourself is should we fear it 
 now  every new technology brings with it some measure of trepidation 
 when we first saw cars people lamented that we would see the destruction of the of the family when we first saw telephones come in people were worried it would destroy all civil conversation at a point in time
  time we saw the written word become pervasive people thought we would lose our ability to memorize these things are all true to a degree  but it 's also the case that these technologies brought to us things that extended the human experience
 in some profound ways 
 so let 's take this a little further  i do not fear the creation of an ai like this
  because it will eventually embody some of our values  consider this building a cognitive system is fundamentally different than building a traditional software intensive system of the past we don 't program them  we teach them  
 in order to teach a system how to recognize flowers i show it thousands of flowers of the kinds i like  in order to teach a system how to play a game well i would you would
  flowers come on 
 to teach a system how to play a game like go i 'd have it play thousands of games of go  but in the process i also teach it how to discern a good game from a bad game 
 if i want to create an artificially intelligent legal assistant i will teach it some corpus of law but at the same time i am fusing with it the
 sense of mercy and justice that is part of that law  
 in scientific terms this is what we call ground truth and here 's the important point in producing these machines we are therefore teaching them a sense of our values 
 to that end i trust an artificial intelligence the same if not more as a human who is well trained 
 but you may ask what about
 rogue agents
  i do not fear an artificial intelligence in the hand of a lone wolf clearly  we cannot protect ourselves against all random acts of violence but the reality is such a system 
 requires substantial training and subtle training far beyond the resources of an individual and furthermore it 's far more than just injecting an internet virus to the world 
 where you push a button all of a sudden it 's in a million places and laptops start blowing up all over the place
  these kinds of substances are much larger and we 'll certainly see them coming 
 do i fear that such an artificial intelligence might threaten all of humanity  if you look at movies such as the matrix
  on this theme and observes that a superintelligence might not only be dangerous it could represent an existential threat to all of humanity 
 dr bostrom 's basic argument
 is that such systems will eventually have such an insatiable thirst for information that they will perhaps learn how to learn
 and eventually discover that they may have goals that are contrary to human needs
  dr bostrom has a number of followers he is supported by people such as elon musk and and stephen hawking with all due respect
 to these brilliant minds  
 i believe that they are fundamentally wrong  now there are a lot of pieces of dr bostrom 's argument to unpack and i don 't have time to unpack them all but
 very briefly consider this super knowing is very different than super
  doing hal was a threat to the discovery crew only insofar as hal commanded all aspects of the discovery so it would have to be with a 
  would have to have dominion over all of our world this is the stuff of skynet from the movie the terminator in which we had a 
 that commanded human will that directed every device that was in every corner of the world  practically speaking it ain 't
  gonna happen  we are not building ais that control the weather that direct the tides that
 command us capricious chaotic humans and furthermore if such an artificial intelligence existed 
 it would have to compete with human economies and thereby compete for resources with us 
 and in the end don 't tell siri this
 we can always unplug them
 we are on an incredible journey of coevolution with our machines the humans we are
 today are not the humans we will be then to worry now about the rise of a superintelligence is in many ways
 a dangerous distraction because the rise of computing itself brings to us a number of human and societal issues to which we must now
  attend how shall i best organize society
 when the need for human labor diminishes how can i bring understanding and education throughout the globe and still respect our differences how might i extend and enhance human life through cognitive healthcare  
 how might i
 use computing to help take us to the stars  and that 's the exciting thing the opportunities
 to use computing to advance the human experience are within our reach here and now  and we are just beginning  thank you very much
