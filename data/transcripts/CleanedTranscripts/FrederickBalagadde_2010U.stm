  the greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest
 disease burden 
 if we resize the countries of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest  we see that sub saharan africa is the worst hit region by hiv aids 
 this is the most
  devastating epidemic of our time  
 we also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease there are very few doctors and quite frankly these countries do not have the resources
 that are needed to cope with such epidemics  
 so what the western countries developed countries have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in third world countries who actually can 't afford these medications
 and this has already
 saved millions of lives and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in sub saharan africa  but there is a fundamental problem
 that is
 killing the efforts in fighting this disease  because
 if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don 't have diagnostic services you end up creating a
  of drug resistance  this is already beginning to happen in sub saharan africa the problem is is that what begins as a tragedy in the third world
 could easily become a global problem and the last thing we want to see is 
  strains of hiv popping up all over the world because it will make treatment more expensive
  i experienced this firsthand as a high school student in uganda this was in the 90s during the peak of the hiv epidemic  before there were any arvs in sub saharan africa  
 and during that time i actually lost more relatives as well as the teachers who taught me 
 to hiv aids  so this became one of the driving passions of my life to help
 find real solutions that
  could address these kinds of problems  
 we all know about the miracle of miniaturization back in the day  computers used to fill this entire room and people actually used to work inside the computers
 but what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink
 technology into a cell phone and i 'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world in the third
  world countries the good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological
 laboratories so right now we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories
 onto microfluidic chips  i was very lucky to come to the us right after high school and was able to work on this technology and
  develop some devices this is a microfluidic chip that i developed a close look at how the technology works these are channels that are about the size of a human hair
 so you have integrated valves pumps mixers and injectors so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a a microfluidic system  
 so what i plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology
 and build an hiv kit
 in a microfluidic system  so with one microfluidic chip  which is the size of an iphone 
 you can actually diagnose one hundred patients at the same time  
 for each patient  we will be able to do up to one hundred different viral loads per patient  
 and this is only done in four hours  
 fifty times faster than the current state of the art
  cost that will be five to five hundred times cheaper
 than the current options  so this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the third world at a cost that is actually achievable
 and make the world a safer place  i invite your interest as well as your
 involvement
 in driving this vision to a point of practical reality  thank you very much
