  let me tell you a story  it 's my first year
 as a new high school science teacher and i 'm so eager i 'm so excited i 'm pouring myself into my lesson plans  
 but i 'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization
 that my students just
 might not be learning anything 
 this happens one day  i 'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology 
 viruses
 and how they attack  and so i 'm so excited to discuss this with them and i
  can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool there 's silence  
 finally my favorite student she looks me straight in the eye and she says the reading sucked 
 and then she clarified she said you know what i don 't mean that it sucks it means that i didn 't understand a word of it it 's boring um who cares 
 and it sucks
 these sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now  
 and i realize that all of my other students are in the same boat 
 that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook  but not one of them really understood
 the main ideas not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool why it 's so important
 i 'm totally clueless  i have no idea what to do next 
 so the only thing i can think of is say listen  
 let me tell you a story  the main characters in the story
 are bacteria
 and viruses these guys are blown up a couple million times  the real bacteria and viruses are so
  small
 we can 't see them without a microscope and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick  
 but what a lot of people don 't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick 
 now the story that i start telling my kids  it starts out
 like a horror story  once upon a time there 's this happy little bacterium don 't get too
  attached to him  
 maybe he 's floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere 
 and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good maybe he ate something bad for lunch  
 and then things get really horrible as his skin rips apart and he sees a virus coming out from his insides  
 and then it gets horrible
  he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides
  if ouch is right  
 if you see this and you 're a bacterium this is like your worst nightmare  
 but if you 're a virus and you see this you cross those little legs of yours and you think
  because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium  
 here 's what had to happen a virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its dna into it 
 the next thing is that virus dna made stuff that chopped up the bacteria dna  
 and now that we 've gotten rid of the bacteria dna the virus dna takes control of the cell
 and it tells it to start making more viruses 
 because you see dna is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make  
 so this is kind of like going into a car factory
 and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer
  the workers still come the next day they do their job but they 're following different instructions  so replacing the bacteria dna with virus dna
 turns the bacteria
 into a factory for making viruses that is until it 's so filled with viruses that it bursts  
 but that 's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria 
  a secret agent virus infects a bacterium  they do a little espionage  here this
 cloaked secret agent virus is slipping his dna into the bacterial cell but here 's the kicker  
 it doesn 't do anything harmful
  it silently slips into the bacteria 's own dna and it just stays there
 like a terrorist sleeper cell  waiting for instructions  
 and what 's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies  
 the babies also have the virus dna in them  
 so now we have a whole extended bacteria family
 with virus sleeper cells  
 they 're just happily living together until a signal happens and bam all of the dna pops out 
 it takes control of these cells  turns them into virus making factories and they all burst a huge extended bacteria family
  dying with viruses spilling out of their guts the viruses taking over the bacterium  
 so now you understand how viruses can attack cells  there are two ways  
 on the left is what we call the lytic way where the viruses go right in and take over the cells  
 on the [ right ] is the lysogenic way
 that uses secret agent viruses  so this stuff is not that hard right
 and now all of you understand it but if you 've graduated from high school i can almost guarantee you 've seen this information before  
 but i bet it was presented in a way that it didn 't exactly stick in your mind  
 so when my students were first learning this why did they hate it so much  
  there were a couple of reasons first of all i can guarantee you that their textbooks didn 't have secret agent viruses and they didn 't have horror stories 
 you know in the communication of science there is this obsession
 with seriousness  it kills me i 'm not kidding i used to work for an educational publisher  and as a writer i was always told never to use stories or fun engaging language because then my work might not be viewed as
  serious and scientific right i mean because god forbid somebody have fun when they 're learning science  
 so we have this field of science that 's all about slime  
 and
 color changes  check this out
  and then we have of course as any good scientist has to have  explosions  but
 if a textbook
 seems too much fun it 's somehow unscientific now another problem
 was that the language in their textbook was truly
  incomprehensible  
 if we want to summarize that story that i told you earlier we could start by saying something like these viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their dna into a bacterium 
 the way this showed up in the textbook  it looked like this bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic
  but here 's the thing there are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there 's no way that we could ever give that to students because it contains some language that isn 't completely accurate 
 for example i told you that viruses have dna well a very tiny fraction of them don 't  they have something called
  professional science writer would circle that and say that has to go we have to change it to something much more technical 
 and after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation 
 they 'd find fault with almost every word i 've used  and they 'd have to change anything that wasn 't serious enough  
 and they 'd have to change everything that wasn 't one hundred percent perfect 
  accurate  but it would be completely impossible
 to understand this is horrifying you know  i keep talking about this idea of of telling a story  
 and it 's like science communication
 has taken on this idea of what i call the tyranny of precision
  can 't just tell a story  
 it 's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know who gives us all the details nobody cares about where you 're like 
 i met my friend for lunch the other day and she was wearing these ugly jeans i mean they weren 't really jeans they were more kind of like leggings but like i guess they 're actually kind of more like jeggings like but
  science education is becoming like that guy who always says actually 
 right you want to be like oh dude we had to get up in the middle of the night
 and drive a hundred miles in total darkness and that guy 's like
  because good storytelling
 is all about emotional connection we have to convince our audience
 that what we 're talking about matters  but just as important
 is knowing which details we should leave out
 so that the main point still comes across  i 'm reminded of what the architect mies van der rohe said  and i paraphrase
  when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth  i think this sentiment is particularly relevant
 to science education 
 now  finally   i am often so disappointed
 when people think that i 'm advocating a dumbing down of science that 's not true at all
 i 'm currently a ph d student at mit and i absolutely
 understand the importance of detailed specific scientific communication between experts  
 but not when we 're trying to teach
 if a young learner thinks that all viruses have dna that 's not going to ruin their chances
 of success in science  
 but if a young learner can 't understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this 
 that will ruin their chances of success 
 this needs to stop  
 and i wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems and i beg them i beseech
  them to just stop it  
 but i think that 's unlikely  so we are so lucky that we have resources like the internet where we can circumvent these institutions
 from the bottom up  there 's a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just
  website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of
 in simple language any middle schooler can understand  
 and i myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that i put on youtube  
 i explain chemical equilibrium using analogies to awkward middle school dances  and i talk about fuel cells
 with stories about boys and girls at a summer camp  
 the feedback that i get is sometimes misspelled and it 's often written in lolcats  
 but nonetheless
 it 's so appreciative  so thankful that i know
 this is the right way we should be communicating science there 's still so
  much work left to be done though  
 and if you 're involved with science in any way i urge you to join me 
 pick up a camera start to write a blog  whatever  
 but leave out the seriousness  leave out the jargon make me laugh make me
  out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point  
 how should you start why don 't you say listen  let me tell you a story
