  as a culture we tell ourselves lots of stories about the future and where we might move forward from this point 
 some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling  
 but i want to tell you a different story
  here today like all stories it has a beginning 
 my work for a long time has been involved in education in teaching people practical skills for sustainability 
 teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food how to build buildings using local materials how to generate their own energy and so on 
 i lived in ireland
  some cob buildings and all this kind of thing  but all my work for many years was
 focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized
 economic growth model and moderating what comes in at one end and moderating the outputs at the other end  
 and then i came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that
  and in order to to introduce you to that i 've got something here that i 'm going to unveil which is one of the great marvels of the modern age and it 's something so astounding and so astonishing that i think maybe 
  as i remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate if you could help me with that it would be fantastic 
 this is a liter of oil this bottle of oil
  distilled over a hundred million years of geological time  ancient sunlight  contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor
 equivalent to about
 strong people coming round and working for you we can turn it into a dazzling array of
  a whole range of different things
  it gives us an energy return that 's unimaginable  historically  
 we 've based the design of our settlements our business models our transport plans even the idea of economic growth some would argue on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity  
 yet when we take a step
  and look over the span of history at what we might call the petroleum interval  it 's a short period in history
 where we 've discovered this extraordinary material  and then based a whole way of life around it  
 but as we straddle the top of this energy mountain at this stage we move from a time where our economic success our sense of individual prowess and well being is directly
 directly linked to how much of this we consume to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability  
 and it 's increasingly clear that we aren 't going to be able to rely on the fact that we 're going to have this at our disposal forever 
 for every four barrels of oil that we consume  we only discover one  and that gap continues to widen  
 there is also the fact that the amount of energy that we get back from the oil that
 we discover is falling in the 1930s we got one hundred units of energy back for every one that we put in to extract it completely unprecedented historically already that 
  's fallen to about eleven  and that 's why now  the new breakthroughs the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in alberta  or at the bottom of the oceans  
  the moment when the world on average passes this peak people wonder when that 's going to happen  and there is an emerging case that maybe that was what happened last july when the oil prices were so high  
 but are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side  
  but the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic
 assessment of where we are  
 there is also the issue of climate change is the other thing that underpins this transition approach but the thing that i notice as i talk to climate scientists is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes 
 as the data that 's coming in which is far ahead of what the ipcc are talking about 
  said that we might see significant breakup of the arctic ice in two thousand one hundred in their worst case scenario actually if current trends continue it could all be gone in five or ten years ' time  
 if just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms it would offset all the savings that we need to make in carbon over the next forty years to avoid runaway climate change 
 we have no choice other than deep
  but i 'm always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations
 further down the slope from us are going to tell about us 
 the generation that lived at the top of the mountain that partied so hard  and so abused its inheritance 
 and one of the ways i like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil before we had fossil fuels and people relied on their own muscle animal muscle energy or a little bit of wind
 water energy 
 we had stories like the seven league boots the giant who had these boots where once you put them on with every stride you could cover seven leagues or twenty one miles a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal 
 stories like the magic porridge pot where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words this pot would just make as much food as you liked without you having to
  do any work provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge otherwise you 'd flood your entire town
 with warm porridge  
 there is the story of the elves and the shoemaker the people who make shoes go to sleep wake up in the morning and all the shoes are magically made for them it 's
 something that was unimaginable to people then now we have the
  boots in the form of ryanair and easyjet  we have
 the magic porridge pot in the form of walmart and tesco  and we have the elves in the form of china  but we don 't appreciate
 what an astonishing
 thing that has been  
 and what are the stories that we tell ourselves now as we look forward about where we 're going to go  and i would argue that there are four there is the idea of business as usual
  the future will be like the present just more of it  but as we 've seen over the last year i think that 's an idea that is increasingly coming into question 
 and in terms of climate change is something that is not actually feasible  
 there is the idea of hitting the wall that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse this is a popular story in some places 
 the third story is the idea that technology can solve everything that technology can somehow get us through this completely
 and it 's an idea that i think is very prevalent at these at these ted talks the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints 
 the idea that we 'll discover some fabulous new source of energy that will mean we can sweep all concerns about energy security to one side  
 the idea that we can step off neatly onto a completely renewable
 world  
 but the world isn 't second life we can 't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse and as we sit exchanging free ideas with each other there are still people mining 
  coal in order to power the servers extracting the minerals to make all of those things 
  is still transported at great distances usually at the expense of the local more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past 
 which we 've so effectively devalued and dismantled  
 we can be astonishingly inventive and creative but we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands energy and technology are not the same thing 
 what i 'm involved with is the transition response  and this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face and responding with a
  creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need it 's something which has spread incredibly fast  
 and it is something which has several characteristics it 's viral it seems to spread under the radar very very quickly
  it 's
 open source it 's something which everybody who 's involved with it develops and
  there is no great central organization that pushes this people just pick up an idea and they run with it and they implement it where they are it 's solutions focused it 's very much looking at what people can do 
 where they are to respond to this  it 's sensitive to place and to scale transitional is completely different transition groups in chile transition groups in the u s transition groups here what they 're doing looks very different in every place that you go to 
  historic it tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary  and it 's a process which is really joyful people have a huge amount of fun doing this reconnecting with other people as they do it 
 one of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience  and i think in many ways the idea of resilience is a more useful
  than the idea of sustainability the idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology and it 's really about how
 systems settlements withstand shock from the outside when they encounter shock from the outside that they don 't just unravel and fall to pieces  and i think it 's a more useful concept than sustainability as i said 
 when our supermarkets have only two or three days ' worth of food in them at any one time  often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped
  up in looking through the lens of resilience we really question
 how we 've let ourselves get into a situation that 's so vulnerable 
 resilience runs much deeper it 's about building modularity into what we do building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us 
 this is a photograph of the bristol
  this is at a time when the city of bristol which is quite close to here was surrounded by commercial market gardens which provided a significant amount of the food that was consumed in the town  and 
 created a lot of employment for people as well there was a degree of resilience if you like at that time  which we can now only look back on with envy 
 pick up some of the tools that we 've developed they start to run an awareness raising program looking at how this might actually work in in the town they show films they give talks and so on it 's a process which is playful and creative
 and informative
 then they start to form working groups looking at different aspects of this and then from that there emerge a whole lot of projects which then the transition project itself starts to support and
 so it started out with some work i was involved in in ireland where i was teaching and has since spread there are now over two hundred formal transition projects  and there are thousands of 
  others who are at what we call the mulling stage they are mulling whether they 're going to take it further and actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff
 this isn 't something which is going to to do everything on its own we need international legislation from copenhagen and so on we need national responses we need local government responses  but all of those things are going to be
 much easier if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas and leading from the front making unelectable policies electable over the next five to ten years 
 some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects
  like community supported agriculture schemes
 urban food production  creating local food directories and so on a
 lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies community owned energy companies where the community can invest money into itself to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure 
  that we need a lot of places are working with their local schools newent in the forest of dean big polytunnel they built for the school the kids are learning how to grow food
 recycling things like garden share that matches up people who don 't have a garden who would like to grow food with people who have gardens they aren 't using anymore  planting productive trees throughout urban spaces 
 and also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies 
 this is lewes in sussex who have recently launched the lewes pound a currency that you can only spend within the town as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy you take it anywhere else
  's not worth anything  but actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively 
 another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan which is basically to develop a plan b for the town most of our local authorities when they sit down to plan for the next five ten 
 fifteen twenty years of a community still start by assuming that there will be more energy more cars more housing more jobs more growth and so on
  what does it look like if that 's not the case and how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody 
 as a friend of mine says life is a series of things you 're not quite ready for 
 and that 's certainly been my experience with transition from three years ago it just being an idea this has become something that has virally swept around the world we 're getting a lot of interest from government ed miliband the energy minister of this country
  invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener which he did 
 and
 has since
 become a great advocate of the whole idea  
 there are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities leicestershire and somerset and in stroud the transition group there in effect wrote the local government 's
 food plan
  and the head of the council said if we didn 't have transition stroud we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time 
 as we see the spread of it we see national hubs emerging in scotland the scottish government 's climate change fund has funded transition scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this and
 we see it all over the place as well now  but the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now
 but that things are already inevitably changing and what we need to do is to work creatively with that 
 based on asking the right questions 
 i think i 'd like to just return at the end to the idea of stories  
 because i think stories are vital here  and actually the stories that we tell ourselves we have a huge dearth of
 of stories about how to move forward creatively from here  and one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories
  out of what people are doing stories about the community that 's produced its own twenty one pound note for example
  the school that 's turned its car park into a food garden the community that 's founded its own energy company  
 and for me one of the great stories recently was the obamas digging up the south lawn of the white house to create a vegetable garden  because the last
  time that was done when eleanor roosevelt did it it led to the creation of twenty million vegetable gardens across the united states  
 so the question i 'd like to to leave you with really is for all aspects
 of of the things that your community needs in order to thrive 
 how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions while also building resilience
  move forward from this point
