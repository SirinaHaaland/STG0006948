  share with you something my father taught me no condition is permanent it 's
 a lesson he shared with me again and again and
  i learned it to be true the hard way 
 here i am in my fourth grade class this is my yearbook picture taken in my class in school in monrovia liberia 
 my
 parents migrated from india to west africa in the 1970s and i had the privilege of growing up there 
 i was nine years old i loved kicking around a soccer ball and i was a total math and science
  i was living the kind of life that really any child would dream of 
 but no condition is permanent on christmas eve in one thousand nine 
 civil war erupted in liberia 
 the war started in the rural countryside and within months rebel armies had marched towards our hometown 
 my school shut down  and when the rebel armies captured the only international airport people started panicking and fleeing
 my mom came knocking one morning and said raj pack your things we have to go 
 we were rushed to the center of town  and there on a tarmac  we were split into two lines  
 i stood with my family in one line  and we were stuffed into the cargo hatch of a rescue
  and there on a bench i was sitting with my heart racing as i looked out the open hatch i saw hundreds of liberians in another line children strapped to their backs 
 when they tried to jump in with us i watched soldiers restrain them 
 they were not allowed to flee  
 we were the lucky ones  we lost what we had but we resettled in america  and as immigrants we benefitted from the community of
  that rallied around us 
 they took my family into their home they mentored me 
 and they helped my dad start a clothing shop  i 'd visit my father on weekends as a teenager to help him sell sneakers and jeans and every time business would get bad 
 he 'd remind me of that mantra no condition is permanent 
 that mantra and my parents
 and that community of supporters made it possible for me to go through college and eventually to medical school i
 'd once had my hopes crushed in a war but because of them i had a chance to pursue my dream to become a doctor 
 my condition had changed  
 it had been fifteen years since i escaped that airfield but the memory of those two lines had not escaped my mind
  i was a medical student in my mid 20s and i wanted to go back to see if i could serve the people we 'd left behind but
 when i got back what i found was utter destruction the war had left us with just fifty one doctors to serve a country of four million people it
 would be like the city of san francisco having just ten doctors 
 so if you got sick in the city where those few doctors remain you might stand a chance but if you got sick
  the remote rural rainforest communities where you could be days from the nearest clinic i was seeing my patients die from conditions no one should die from 
 all because they were getting to me too late  imagine you have a two year old who wakes up one morning with a fever and you realize she could have malaria 
 and you know the only way to get her the medicine she needs would be
  take her to the riverbed get in a canoe paddle to the other side and then walk for up to two days through the forest just to reach the nearest clinic 
 one billion people live in the world 's most remote communities and despite the advances we 've made in modern medicine and technology our innovations are not reaching the last mile 
 these communities have been left behind because they 've been thought too hard to reach and too difficult to serve  
  is universal access to care is not and realizing this lit a fire in my soul no one should die because they live too far from a doctor or clinic  
 no condition should be permanent  
 and help in this case didn 't come from the outside it actually came from within it came from the communities themselves  
 meet musu 
 way out in rural liberia where most girls have not had a chance to finish primary school 
 musu had been
 at the age of eighteen she completed high school and she came back to her community 
 she saw that none of the children were getting treatment for the diseases they needed treatment for deadly diseases like malaria and pneumonia  so she signed up to be a volunteer
 there are millions of volunteers like musu in rural parts around our world and we got to thinking
 community members like musu could actually
  help us solve a puzzle 
 our health care system is structured in such a way that the work of diagnosing disease and prescribing medicines is limited to a team of nurses and doctors like me  
 but nurses and doctors are concentrated in cities so rural communities like musu 's have been left behind  
 so we started asking some questions what if we could reorganize the medical care system what if we could
  community members like musu be a part or even be the center of our medical team 
 what if musu could help us bring health care from clinics in cities to the doorsteps of her neighbors 
 musu was forty eight when i met her 
 and despite her amazing talent and grit she hadn 't had a paying job in thirty years
 so what if technology could
  support her what if we could invest in her with real training equip her with real medicines and
 have her have a real job well 
 in two thousand and seven  i was trying to answer these questions and my wife and i were getting married that
  we asked our
 relatives to forgo the wedding registry gifts and instead donate some money so we could have some start up money to launch a nonprofit i
 promise you i 'm a lot more romantic than that 
 we ended up raising $ six thousand  teamed up with some liberians and americans and launched a nonprofit called last mile health our goal is to bring a health worker within reach of everyone everywhere  
 we designed a
 and pay to invest more deeply in volunteers like musu to become paraprofessionals to become community health workers  first we trained musu to prevent diagnose and treat the top ten
 diseases afflicting families in her village a nurse supervisor visited her every month to coach her 
 we equipped her with modern medical technology like this $ one
 malaria rapid test and put it in a backpack full of medicines like this to treat infections like pneumonia
 and crucially a smartphone  to help her track and report on epidemics 
 last  we recognized the dignity in musu 's work with the liberian government we created a
  paid her
 and gave her the chance to have a real job and she 's amazing musu has
 learned over thirty medical skills from screening children for malnutrition  to assessing the cause of a child 's cough with a smartphone  to supporting people with hiv
 and providing follow up care to patients who 've lost their limbs  working as part of
  community health workers can help ensure that a lot of what your family doctor would do reaches the places that most family doctors could never go 
 one of my favorite things to do is to care for patients with community health workers so last year i was
 visiting a b and like 
  had had a chance to go to school  he was in middle school in the eighth grade when his parents died he became an orphan and had to drop out
  last year we hired and trained a b as a community health worker 
 and while he was making door to door house calls he met this young boy named prince 
 whose mother had had trouble breastfeeding him and by the age of six months prince had started to waste away a b had just been taught how to use this color coded measuring tape that wraps around the upper arm of a child to diagnose malnutrition 
 a b noticed that
 prince was in the red zone which meant he had to be hospitalized so a b took prince and his mother to the river got in a canoe and paddled for four hours to get to the hospital 
 later after prince was discharged
 a b taught mom how to feed
 baby a food supplement a few months ago a b took me to visit prince and he 's a chubby little guy he 's meeting his
  milestones he 's pulled himself up to a stand and is even starting to say a few words i 'm so inspired by these community health workers 
 i often ask them why they do what they do and when i asked a b 
 he said doc  since i dropped out of school this is the first time i 'm having a chance to hold a pen to write 
 my brain is getting fresh
  taught me something fundamental about being human our will to serve others
 can actually help us transform our own conditions 
 i was so moved by how powerful the will to serve our neighbors can be a few years ago  when we faced a global catastrophe
  in december two thousand and thirteen something happened in the rainforests across the border from us in guinea a toddler named emile fell sick with vomiting fever and diarrhea  he lived 
  in an area where the roads were sparse and there had been massive shortages of health workers
  when every minute counted we had already lost months and by then the virus had spread like wildfire all across west africa and eventually to other parts of the world  businesses shut down  airlines started 
  canceling routes at the height of the crisis when we were told that one point four million people could be infected 
  i remember standing with a group of health workers in the rainforest where an outbreak had just happened 
 we were helping train and equip them to put on the masks the gloves and the gowns that they needed to keep themselves safe from the virus while they were serving their patients 
 i remember the fear in their eyes and
 i remember staying up at night  terrified if i 'd made the right call
  to keep them in the field  
 when ebola threatened to bring humanity to its knees liberia 's community health workers didn 't surrender to fear 
 they did what they had always done they answered the call to serve their neighbors community members across liberia learned the symptoms
  teamed up with nurses and doctors to go door to door to find the sick and get them into care they tracked thousands of people who had been exposed to the virus and helped break the chain of transmission  
 some ten thousand community health workers risked their own lives to help hunt down this virus and stop it in its tracks 
 today ebola has come under control in west africa
  and we 've learned a few things 
 we 've learned that blind spots in rural health care can lead to hot spots of disease and that places all of us at greater risk  
 we 've learned that the most efficient emergency system is actually an everyday system  and that system has to reach all communities including rural communities like emile 's 
 and most of all we 've learned from the courage of liberia 's community health workers that
 we as people are not defined by the conditions we face no matter how hopeless they seem we 're defined by how we respond to them 
 for the past fifteen years 
 i 've seen the power of this idea to transform everyday citizens into community health workers into everyday heroes  
 and i 've seen it play out everywhere from the forest
  communities of west africa to the rural fishing villages of alaska it
 's true these community health workers aren 't doing neurosurgery  
 but they 're making it possible to bring health care within reach of everyone everywhere  
 so now what 
 well  we know that there are still millions of people dying from preventable causes in rural communities around the world
  know that the great majority of these deaths are happening in these seventy five blue shaded countries 
 what we also know is that if we trained an army of community health workers
 to learn even just thirty lifesaving skills  we could save the lives of nearly thirty million people by two thousand and thirty 
 thirty services
 could save thirty million lives by two
  that 's not just a blueprint we 're proving this can be done in liberia the liberian government
 is training thousands of workers like a b and musu after ebola to bring health care to every child and family in the country  
 and we 've been honored to work with them and are now teaming up with a number of organizations that are working across
  other countries to try to help them do the same thing 
 if we could help these countries scale  
 we could save millions of lives and at the same time we could create millions of jobs  
 we simply can 't do that though without technology 
 people are worried that technology is going to steal our jobs  but when it comes to community health workers technology has actually been vital for creating jobs
  without technology without this smartphone without this rapid test
 it would have been impossible for us to be able to employ a b and musu 
 and i think it 's time for technology to help us train to help us train people faster and better than ever before 
 as a doctor  i use technology to stay  up to date and keep certified i use smartphones i
 i use apps i use online courses but when a b wants to learn  he 's got to jump back in that canoe
 and get to the training center  and when musu shows up for training her instructors are stuck using flip charts and markers  
 why shouldn 't they have
 the same access to learn as i do 
 if we truly want community health workers to master those lifesaving skills and even more we 've got to change this
  model of education
 tech can truly be a game changer here i 've been in awe of the digital education revolution that the likes of khan academy and edx have been leading  
 and i 've been thinking that it 's time it 's time for a collision between the digital education revolution and the community health revolution 
 and so this brings me to my ted prize wish
 i wish
 i wish that you would help us recruit the largest army of community health workers the world has ever known by creating the community health academy 
 a global platform to train connect and empower
  and curate
 the best in
 digital education resources  
 we will bring those to community health workers around the world including a b and musu they 'll get video lessons on giving kids vaccines and
 have online courses on spotting the next outbreak so they 're not stuck using flip charts we 'll help these countries accredit
 these workers so that they 're not stuck remaining an
 undervalued group  but become a renowned empowered profession just like nurses and doctors 
 and we 'll create a network of companies and entrepreneurs who 've created innovations that can save lives and help them connect to workers like musu so she can help better serve her community
  to persuade governments to make community health workers a cornerstone of their health care plans  
 we plan to test and prototype the academy in liberia and a few other partner countries and then we plan to take it global  including to rural north america 
 with the power of this platform we believe countries can be more persuaded that a health care revolution really is
  possible 
 my dream is that this academy will contribute to the training of hundreds of thousands of community members to help bring health care to their neighbors the hundreds of millions of them that live in the world 's most remote communities 
 from the forest communities of west africa to the fishing villages of rural alaska
  and join this revolution  let us know if you or your organization or someone you know could help us as we try to build this academy
 over the next year now
 as i look out into this room  i realize that our journeys are not self made they 're shaped by others and there have been
  so many here that have been part of this cause we
 're so honored to be part of this community  and a community that 's willing to take on a cause as audacious as this one so i wanted to offer as i end a reflection  
 i think a lot more about what my father taught me these days i too have become
  i have two sons and my wife and i just learned that she 's pregnant with our third child thank you applause
 i was recently caring for a woman in liberia who like my wife was in her third pregnancy  
 but unlike my wife 
 had had no prenatal care with her first two babies 
 she lived in an isolated community in the forest that had gone for one hundred years without any health care
 until 
 until last year when a nurse trained her neighbors to become community health workers so here i was seeing this
 patient who was in her second trimester and i pulled out the ultrasound to check on the baby and she started telling us stories about her first two
  had the ultrasound probe on her belly and she just stopped mid sentence 
 she turned to me and she said doc  what 's that sound it
 was the first time she 'd ever heard her baby 's heartbeat 
 and her eyes lit up in the same way my wife 's eyes and my own eyes lit up when we heard our baby 's heartbeat 
 for all of human
  history  illness has been universal
 and access to care has not  but as a wise man once told me  no condition
 is permanent  it 's time  it 's time for us to go as far as it takes to change this condition together  thank you
