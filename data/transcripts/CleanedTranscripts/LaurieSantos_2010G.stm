  i want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species
  the first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious and that 's that our species homo sapiens is actually really
  really smart like ridiculously smart like
 you 're all doing things that no other species on the planet does right now
 and this is of course  not the first time you 've probably recognized this of course in addition to being smart we 're also an extremely vain species  so we like pointing out the fact that we 're smart you know so i could turn to pretty much any sage from
 shakespeare to stephen colbert to point out things like the fact that we 're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral
  but of course there 's a second observation about the human species that i want to focus on a little bit more  
 and that 's the fact that even though we 're actually really smart  sometimes uniquely smart  we can also be incredibly incredibly dumb
 when it comes to some aspects of our decision making now i 'm seeing lots of smirks out there don 't worry i 'm not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes  
 but of course just in the last two years we see these unprecedented examples
  of human ineptitude and we 've watched as the tools we uniquely make to pull the resources out of our environment kind of just blow up in our face we 've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create these markets that were supposed to be foolproof we 've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes  
 but both of these two embarrassing examples i think don 't highlight what i think is most embarrassing about the mistakes that humans make which is that we 'd like to think that the mistakes we make
  are really just the result of a couple bad apples or a couple really sort of fail blog worthy decisions  
 but it turns out what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us when put in certain contexts will actually make very specific mistakes 
 the errors we make are actually predictable we make them again and again and they 're actually immune to lots of
  when we get negative feedback we still the next time we 're face with a certain context tend to make the same errors  
 and so this has been a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature what i 'm most curious about is how is a species that 's as smart as we are
 capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time you know we 're the smartest thing out there why can 't we figure this out in some sense where do our mistakes really come
  and having thought about this a little bit i see a couple different possibilities 
 one possibility is in some sense it 's not really our fault because we 're a smart species we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super super complicated sometimes too complicated 
  for us to even actually understand even though we 've actually created them  we create financial markets that are super complex we create mortgage terms that we can 't actually deal with and of course  if we are 
 put in environments where we can 't deal with it in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up
  if this was the case we 'd have a really easy solution to the problem of human error we 'd actually just say okay let 's figure out the kinds of technologies we can 't deal with the kinds of environments that are bad get 
  rid of those design things better  and we should be the noble species that we expect ourselves to be  
  this is a hint that i 've gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors and what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way over and over 
  again it feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways this is a possibility that i worry a little bit more about because  if it 's us that 's messed up it 's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it we might just have to accept the fact that we 're error prone
 try to design things around it 
 so this is the question my students and i wanted to get at how can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two 
 what we need is a population that 's basically smart can make lots of decisions  but doesn 't have access to any of the systems we have any of the things that might mess us up no human technology human culture 
  maybe even not human language  and so this is why we turned to these guys here these are one of the guys i work with this is a brown capuchin monkey
 these guys are new world primates which means they broke off from the human branch about thirty five million years ago  this means that your great great great great great great with about five million greats in there grandmother 
 was probably the same great great great great grandmother with five million greats in there as holly up here you know 
  the good news about holly though is that she doesn 't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do you know she 's a smart very cut creature a primate as well  but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up so
  she 's the perfect test case what if we put holly into the same context as humans does she make the same mistakes as us does she not learn from them and so on  
  problems at holly see if she messes these things up first problem is just well where should we start because you know it 's great for us but bad for humans we make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts you know where are we actually going to start with this 
 and because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news we said 
 hhmm maybe we should actually start in the financial domain maybe we should look at monkey 's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do 
 of course that 's when we hit a sort second problem a little bit more
  methodological which is that maybe you guys don 't know but monkeys don 't actually use money i know 
 you haven 't met them but this is why you know they 're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the atm you know they don 't do this stuff so now we faced you know  a little bit of a problem here how are we actually going to
  ask monkeys about money if they don 't actually use it so we said well maybe we should just actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money so that 's just what we did
 is actually the first unit that i know of of non human currency  
 we weren 't very creative at the time we started these studies so we just called it a token  but this is the unit of currency that we 've taught our monkeys
 at yale to actually use with humans to actually buy different pieces of food  
 it doesn 't look like much in fact it isn 't like much like most of our money it 's just a piece of metal as those of you who 've taken currencies home from your trip know once you get home it 's actually pretty useless
 was useless to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it when we first gave it to them in their enclosures  they actually kind of picked them up looked at them they were these kind of weird things but 
  very quickly the monkeys realized that they could actually hand these tokens over to different humans in the lab for some food and so you see one of our monkeys mayday up here doing this  this is a
 b are kind of the points where she 's sort of a little bit curious about these things doesn 't know  there 's this waiting hand from a human experimenter  and mayday quickly figures out apparently the human wants this  
 hands it over and then gets some food it
 turns out not just mayday all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman so here 's just a quick video of what this looks like here 's mayday she 's going to be trading a token for some food
 and waiting happily and getting her food here 's felix i think he 's our alpha male he 's a kind of big guy but he too waits patiently gets his food and goes on so the monkeys get really good at
  this they 're surprisingly good at this with very little training we just allowed them to pick this up on their own the
 question is is this anything like human money is this a market at all or did we just do a weird psychologist 's trick by getting monkeys to do something looking smart but not really being smart  
 and so we said  well  what would the monkeys spontaneously do if this was really their currency if they were really using it like money  
 well  you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things
  that humans do when they start exchanging
 money with each other you might have them start paying attention to price paying attention to how much they buy sort of keeping track of their monkey token as it were 
 do the monkeys do anything like this  and so our monkey marketplace was born the way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social
  when they get a hankering for some treats we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market upon entering the market it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because as the monkeys entered the door of the market a
 human would give them a big wallet full of tokens so they could actually trade the tokens with one of these two guys here two different possible human salesmen that they could actually buy stuff from 
 the salesmen were students from my lab they dressed differently they were different people and over time they did basically
  the same thing so the monkeys could learn you know who sold what at what price you know who was reliable who wasn 't and so on and you can see that each of the experimenters is actually holding up a little yellow 
  food dish and that 's what the monkey can for a single token so everything costs one token but as you can see sometimes tokens buy more than others sometimes more grapes than others 
 but here 's honey she 's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently all of a sudden the market opens here 's her choice one grapes or two grapes you can see honey very good market economist goes with the guy who gives more 
 she could teach our financial advisers a few things or two  so not just honey  most of the monkeys went with guys who had more  most of the monkeys went with guys who
  when we introduced sales we saw the monkeys paid attention to that they really cared about their monkey token dollar the more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys ' data using economic tools 
 they basically matched not just qualitatively  but quantitatively with what we saw humans doing in a real market  so much so that if you saw the monkeys ' numbers you couldn 't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same
  and what we 'd really thought we 'd done is like we 'd actually introduced something that at least for the monkeys and us works like a real financial currency  
 question is do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do  well  we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might one thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving 
 you know just like our own species the monkeys entered the market spent their entire budget and then went
 the monkeys would rip off the tokens at every available opportunity from each other often from us
 you know things we didn 't necessarily think we were introducing but things we spontaneously saw  so we said  this looks bad can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do 
 one possibility is just kind of let the monkey financial system play out you know 
 see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years we were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit so we said  let 's actually give the monkeys the same kinds of problems that 
  humans tend to get wrong in certain kinds of economic challenges or certain kinds of economic experiments  
  dollars so ten crisp hundred dollar bills  take these put it in your wallet and spend a second thinking about what you 're going to do with it because it 's yours now you can buy whatever you want donate it take it and so on 
 sounds great but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money and here 's your choice you can either be risky in which case i 'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens if it comes up heads you 're going to get a thousand
  if it comes up tails you get nothing  so it 's a chance to get more but it 's pretty risky your other option is a bit safe your just going to get some money for sure i 'm just going to give you five hundred bucks  you can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately  
 so see what your intuition is here
  most people actually go with the play it safe option most people say  why should i be risky when i can get one thousand five hundred dollars for sure  this seems like a good bet i 'm going to go with that you might say eh that 's not really
  people are a little risk averse so what well the so what comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently  
 so now imagine that i give each and every one of you two thousand dollars twenty crisp hundred dollar bills  now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before think about how you 'd feel sticking it in your wallet 
 and now imagine that i have you make another choice but this time it 's a little bit worse now you 're going to be deciding how you 're going to lose money  
 but you 're going to get the same choice you can either take a risky loss so i 'll flip a coin if it comes up heads
  actually lose a lot if it comes up tails you lose nothing you 're fine get to keep the whole thing
 or you could play it safe  which means you have to reach back into your wallet and give me five of those $ one hundred bills for certain 
 and i 'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there so maybe you 're having the same intuitions as the subjects that were actually tested in this  which is when presented with these options people don 't choose to
 play it safe they actually tend to go a little risky  
 the reason this is irrational is that we 've given people in both situations the same choice  it 's a fifty fifty shot of a thousand or two thousand or just one thousand five hundred dollars with certainty  but 
  people 's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with so what 's going on well it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level
  one is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms you really have to do work to figure out well one option 's a thousand two thousand one is one thousand five hundred instead we find it very easy 
  to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another so we think of things as oh i 'm going to get more or oh i 'm going to get less this is all well and good except that changes 
  in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not and this leads to the second bias which economists have called loss aversion the
  idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red we really hate it when we have to lose out on some money  and this means that sometimes we 'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this what you saw in that 
  last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won 't be any loss 
  we actually become more risky which can actually be really worrying 
 these kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans they 're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer because they 're evaluating them in relative terms they 're why people in the housing market refused 
  to sell their house because they don 't want to sell at a loss  the question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases  if we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market would they do the same thing as people
  and so this is what we did we gave the monkeys choices between guys who were safe they did the same thing every time or guys who were risky they did things differently half the time 
 and then we gave them options that were bonuses like you guys did in the first scenario so they actually have a chance more  or pieces where they were experiencing losses they actually thought they were going to get more 
 than they really got  and so this is what this looks like we introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen the guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape so it looks pretty good but they 're going to give the monkeys bonuses
 the guy on the left is a safe bonus all the time he adds one to give the monkeys two the guy on the right is actually a risky bonus  sometimes the monkeys get no bonus so this is a bonus of zero 
  sometimes the monkeys get two extra for a big bonus now they get three  but this is the same choice you guys just faced do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who 's going to do the same thing on every trial or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky
  but big bonus  but risk the possibility of getting no bonus people here played it safe turns out the monkeys play it safe too 
 qualitatively and quantitatively they choose exactly the same way as people when tested in the same thing you might say well maybe the monkeys just don 't like risk maybe we should see how they do with losses and so we ran a second version of this now
  the monkeys meet two guys who aren 't giving them bonuses they 're actually giving them less than they expect so they look like they 're starting out with a big amount these are three grapes the monkey 's really psyched for this but now they learn these 
  guys are going to give them less than they expect they guy on the left is a safe loss every single time he 's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two the guy on the right is the risky loss  sometimes he gives no loss so the monkeys are really psyched but sometimes he actually
  big loss taking away two to give the monkeys only one 
 and so what do the monkeys do again same choice they can play it safe for always getting two grapes every single time or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three  the remarkable 
  thing to us is that when you give monkeys this choice they do the same irrational thing that people do they actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started this is crazy 
  because it suggests that the monkeys too are evaluating things in relative terms and actually treating losses differently than they
 so what does all of this mean well what we 've shown is that  first of all we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency  and they do very similar things with it they do some of the smart things we do some of the 
  kind of not so nice things we do like steal it and so on  but they also do some of the irrational things we do they systematically get things wrong and in the same ways that we do 
  this is the first take home message of the talk which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought oh i 'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser they 're way cuter than the one at you know don 't do that they 're probably going to be just as dumb as the human one you already have 
 so you know 
 a little bad sorry sorry sorry a little bad for monkey investors but of course  you know  the reason you 're laughing is bad for humans too because we 've answered the question we started out with 
 we wanted to know where these kinds of errors came
  and we started with the hope that maybe we can sort of tweak our financial institutions tweak our technologies to make ourselves better  
 but what we 've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that in fact they might be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history you know 
 maybe it 's not just humans at the right side of this chain that 's duncey  maybe it 's sort of duncey all the way back  and this  if we believe the capuchin monkey results means that these duncey strategies might be
  million years old 
 that 's a long time for a strategy to potentially get changed around really really old what do we know about other old strategies like this well one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome you know 
 think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things fatty things like cheesecake you can 't just shut that off you can 't just look at the dessert cart as say no no no that looks disgusting to me we 're just built differently we 're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after 
 my guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving
 different financial decisions  when you 're watching your stocks plummet into the red when you 're watching your house price go down you 're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms 
 this means that the biases that lead investors to do badly that lead to the foreclosure crisis are going to be really hard to overcome 
 so that 's the bad news the question is is there any good news i 'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news  well  the good news i think is
  with at the beginning of the talk  which is that humans are not only smart we 're really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom we
 're so good at overcoming our biological limitations you know i flew over here in an airplane i didn 't have to try to flap my wings  i 'm wearing contact lenses now so that i can see all of you i don 't have to rely on my own
  we actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means seemingly pretty easily  but we have to recognize that we have those limitations and here 's the rub  
 it was camus who once said that man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is 
 but the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them
  the hope is that you all will think about your limitations not necessarily as unovercomable but to recognize them accept them and then use the world of design to actually 
  figure them out that might be the only way that we will really be able to achieve our own human potential and really be the noble species
