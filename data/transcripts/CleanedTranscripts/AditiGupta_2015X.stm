  a natural biological process that every girl and woman goes through every month
 for about half of her life a phenomenon that is so significant that the survival and propagation of our species depends on it  
 yet we consider it a taboo  we feel awkward and shameful talking about it
  when i got my first periods i was told to keep it a secret from others
 even from my father and brother
  later when this chapter appeared in our textbooks our biology teacher skipped the subject 
 you know what i learned from it  
 i learned that it is really shameful to talk about it  i learned to be ashamed of my body  i learned to stay unaware
  in order to stay decent
  research in various parts of india shows that three out of every ten girls are not aware of menstruation at the time of their first periods  
 and in some parts of rajasthan this number is as high as
 nine out of ten girls being unaware of it  
 you 'd be surprised to know that most of the girls that i have spoken to who did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation thought that they have got blood cancer
  and they 're going to die soon 
 menstrual hygiene is a very important risk factor for reproductive tract infections  
 but in india only twelve percent of girls and women have access to
 hygienic ways of managing their periods  
 if you do the math eighty eight percent of girls and women use unhygienic ways to manage their periods  i was one
  of them  
 i grew up in a small town called garhwa in jharkhand where even buying a sanitary napkin is considered shameful 
 so when i started getting my periods  i began with using rags  
 after every use i would wash and reuse them  but to store them i would hide and keep it in a dark
  damp place so that nobody finds out that i 'm menstruating  
 due to repeated washing the rags would become coarse  and i would often get rashes and infections using them  
 i wore these already for five years until i moved out of that town  
 another issue that periods brought in my life those of the social restrictions
 that are imposed upon our girls girls and women when they 're on their periods  i think you all must be aware of it
  list it for the few who don 't  
 i was not allowed to touch or eat pickles  
 i was not allowed to sit on the sofa or some other family member 's bed  i had to wash my bed sheet after every period even if it was not stained  
 i was considered impure and forbidden from worshipping or touching any
  object of religious importance you 'll find signposts outside temples denying the entry of menstruating girls and women 
 ironically most of the time it is the older woman who imposes such restrictions on younger girls
 in a family after all they have grown up accepting such restrictions as norms  and in the absence of any intervention
  it is the myth and misconception that propagate from generation to generation 
 during my years of work in this field i have even come across stories where girls have to eat and wash their dishes separately 
 they 're not allowed to take baths during periods  and in some households they are even secluded from other family members 
 about eighty five percent of girls and women in india would follow one or more restrictive customs on their periods
 every month
  can you imagine what this does to the 
  of a young girl the psychological trauma that this inflicts  affecting
 her personality her academic performance
 and every single aspect of growing up during her early formative years 
 i religiously followed all these restrictive customs for thirteen years until a discussion with my
  partner tuhin changed my perception about menstruation forever in two thousand and nine tuhin and i were pursuing
  in design we fell in love with each other and i was at ease discussing periods with him tuhin knew little about periods
  to know that girls get painful cramps and we bleed every month 
 yeah  
 he was completely shocked to know about the restrictions that are imposed upon menstruating girls menstruating girls and women by their own families and their society 
 in order to help me with my cramps he would go on the
  internet and learn more about menstruation when he shared his findings with me i realized how little i knew about menstruation myself  
 and many of my beliefs actually turned out to be myths 
 that 's when we wondered  if we being so well educated were so ill informed about menstruation there would be millions of girls out there
 who would be ill informed too to study to understand the problem better i undertook a year long research to
  the lack of awareness about menstruation and the root cause behind it  while it is generally believed that menstrual
 and misconception is a rural phenomenon during my research  i found that it is as much an urban phenomenon as well  and it exists with
 the educated urban
  while talking to many parents and teachers  i found that many of them actually wanted to educate girls about 
 before they have started getting their menstrual cycle  and
 but they lacked the proper means themselves  and since it is a taboo  they feel inhibition and shameful in talking about it  
 girls nowadays
  get their periods in classes six and seven  but our educational curriculum teaches girls about periods only in standard eight and nine  
 and since it is a taboo  teachers still skip the subject altogether  
 so
 school does not teach girls about periods  parents don 't talk about it  where do the girls go two decades ago
 and now
 nothing has changed
  changed 
 i shared these finding with tuhin and we wondered what if we could create something that would help girls understand about menstruation on their own
 something that would help parents and teachers talk about periods comfortably to young girls 
  i was collecting a lot of stories these were stories of experiences of girls
 during their periods  these stories would make girls curious and interested in
 talking about menstruation in their close circle that 's what we wanted  we wanted something that would
 make the girls curious and drive them to learn about it  we wanted to use these stories to teach girls about periods  
 so we decided to create a comic book
 where the cartoon characters would enact these stories and educate girls about menstruation in a fun and engaging way 
 to represent girls in their different phases of puberty we have three characters 
 pinki who has not gotten her period yet  jiya who gets her period during the narrative of the book
  there is a fourth character priya didi through her girls come to know about the various aspects of growing up and menstrual hygiene management  
 while making the book we took great care that none of the illustrations were objectionable in any way and that it is culturally sensitive  
 during our prototype testing we found that the girls loved the book  they were keen on reading it and knowing more and more about
  parents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods to young girls using the book and sometimes even boys were interested in reading it 
 the comic book helped in creating an environment where menstruation ceased to be a taboo
  many of the volunteers took this prototype themselves to educate girls and take menstrual awareness workshops in five different states in india and one of the volunteers took this prototype 
  to educate young monks and took it to this monastery in ladakh  we made the final version of the book called menstrupedia comic and launched in september last year  
  and ten different countries  we are constantly translating the book into different languages and collaborating with
 local organizations to make this book available in different countries  fifteen schools in different parts of india have
 made this book a part of their school curriculum to teach girls about
  menstruation 
 i am amazed to see how
 volunteers  individuals parents teachers school principals  have come together
 and taken this menstrual awareness drive to their own communities have made sure that the girls learn about
  periods at the right age and helped in breaking this taboo  
 i dream of a future where menstruation is not a curse 
 not a disease  but a welcoming change in a girl 's life  
 and i would 
 and i would like to end this with a small request to all the parents here
 dear parents if you would be ashamed of periods  your daughters would be too so please be period positive
