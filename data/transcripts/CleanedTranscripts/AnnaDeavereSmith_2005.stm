  a word often enough it becomes you 
 and having grown up in a segregated city baltimore maryland
  i sort of use that idea to go around america with a tape recorder thank god for technology to interview people thinking that if i walked in their words which is also why i don 't wear shoes when i perform
 if i walked in their words that i could sort of absorb america i was also inspired by walt whitman who wanted to absorb america and have it absorb him so these four characters are going to be from that
 work that i 've been doing for many years now and
 well over i don 't know a
 couple of thousand people i 've interviewed anybody out here old enough to know studs terkel  that old radio man  so i thought he would be the perfect person to go to
  to ask about a defining moment in american history you know he was born in one thousand nine hundred and twelve the year the titanic sank greatest ship every built hits the tip of an iceberg 
  and bam  it went down  it went down and i came up wow  some century 
 laughter so this is his answer about a defining moment in american history
  defining moment in american history i don 't think there 's one you can 't say hiroshima that 's a big one i can 't think of any one moment i would say is a defining moment the gradual slippage 
  ' slippage ' is the word used by the people in watergate moral slippage it 's a gradual kind of thing combination of things you see 
  tell you a funny little play bit the atlanta airport is a modern airport  and they should leave the gate there these trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination 
 and these trains are smooth  and they 're quiet and they 're efficient and there 's a voice on the train  you know the voice was a human voice  you see in the old days we had robots
  got this voice on this train  concourse one  omaha  lincoln concourse two dallas fort worth same voice 
 just as a train is about to go a young couple rush in and they 're just about to close the pneumatic doors  and that voice  without losing a beat says ' because of late entry
 ' just then everybody 's looking at this couple with hateful eyes and the couple 's going like this you know shrinking well i 'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before 
  boarding i do that to steel my nerves and so i imitate a train call holding my hand on my ' george orwell  your time has come
 silence and so suddenly they 're looking at me so here i am with the couple the three of us shrinking at the foot of calvary about to be up you know 
 just then
 i see a baby a little baby in the lap of a mother 
 i know it 's hispanic because she 's speaking spanish to her companion  so i 'm going to talk to the baby  so i say to the baby
  my hand over my mouth because my breath must be one hundred proof  
 i say to the baby ' sir or madam what is your considered opinion
 of the human species  ' and the baby looks you know the way babies look at you clearly  starts laughing  starts busting out with this crazy little laugh i say ' thank god for a
  of course was tremendous  remember that great scene on the raft remember what huck did you see here 's huck he 's an illiterate
  's had no schooling but there 's something in him 
 and the official truth  the truth was the law was that a black man was a property was a thing you see  and huck gets on the raft with a property named jim a slave 
 see  and he hears that jim is going to go and take his wife and kids and steal them from the woman woman who owns them and huck
  slavers caught up guys chasing slaves looking for jim ' anybody up on that raft with
  goodness of huck that stuff that huck 's been made of you see  all been buried it 's all been buried  so the human touch you see  it 's disappearing  so you ask about a defining moment ain 't no defining moment in american 
  history for me it 's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now where trivia becomes news
  and more and more less and less awareness of the pain
 of the other huh you know  i don 't know if you could
 use this or not but i was quoting wright morris a writer from nebraska who says ' we 're more and more into communications
 and less and less into communication ' okay kids i got to scram got
  talk about risk taking  i 'm going to do somebody that nobody likes you know most actors want
 to do characters that that are likeable well not always but the notion especially at a conference like this i like to inspire people
 but since this was called risk taking i 'm doing somebody who i never do
 because she 's so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she was in 
 and i 'm doing her because i think we think of risk at a conference like this as a good thing  
 but there are certain other connotations to the word risk and the same thing about the word nature what is nature maxine greene who 's a wonderful
 philosopher who 's as old as studs and was the head of a philosophy great
 big philosophy kind of an organization
 i went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesn 't
 know that she still wants to know and she said well personally i still feel like i have to curtsey when i see the president of my university  
 and i still feel as though i 've got to get coffee for my male colleagues even though i 've outlived most of them 
 and she said and then intellectually  i don 't know enough about the negative imagination and september
  certainly taught us that that 's a whole area we don 't investigate so
 this piece is about a negative imagination 
 it raises questions about what nature is what mother nature is 
 and about what a risk can be and i got this in the maryland correctional institute for women everything i do is word for word off a tape  and i title things because i think people speak in
  this is called a mirror to her mouth and this is an inmate named paulette jenkins 
 i began to learn how to cover it up 
 because i didn 't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home 
 i want everybody to think we were a normal family i mean we had all the materialistic things  but that didn 't make my children pain
  any less that didn 't make their fears subside  
 i ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises i didn 't
 had no more excuses  and he beat me too  but that didn 't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family it was a nightmare  
 and i failed them dramatically because i allowed it to go on and on and on but the night that
  myesha got killed and the intensity just
 just grew and grew and grew  until one night we came home from getting drugs  
 and he got angry with myesha and he started beating her and he put her in a bathtub  oh he would use a belt he had a belt because he had this
 warped perverted thing that myesha was having sex
  little brother and they was fondling each other that would be his reason i 'm just
 talking about the particular night that she died 
 and so he put her in the bathtub  and i was in the bedroom with the baby and four months before this happened four months before myesha died  i thought i could really fix this man  so i had a baby by him insane
 thinking that if i gave him his own kid he would leave mine alone and it
  didn 't work  and i ended up with three children houston myesha and dominic who was four months old when i came to jail 
 and i was in the bedroom like i said he had her in the bathroom and he he every time he hit her she would fall and
 she would hit her head on the tub 
 it happened continuously repeatedly i could hear it 
 but i dared not to move i didn 't move i didn 't even go and see what was happening i just sat there and listened
 and then he put her in the hallway he told
 her just set there and so she set there for about four or five hours  
 and then he told her get up and when she got up she says she couldn 't see  her face was
  had a black eye  all around her head was just swollen her head was about two sizes of its own size 
 i told him ' let her go to sleep '
 he let her go to sleep 
 the next morning she was dead 
 he went in to check
  i knew immediately that she was dead  i didn 't even want to accept the fact that she was dead so i went in and i put a mirror to her mouth there was no thing nothing 
 coming out of her mouth  he said  he said  he said ' we can 't we can 't let nobody find out about this ' he say ' you 've got to help me ' i agree  i agree 
 i mean i 've been keeping a secret for years and years and years so it just seemed like second hand to me just to keep on keeping it a secret
 so we went to the mall
 and we told a police that we had like  lost her that she was missing  we told a security guard
 that she was missing 
 though she wasn 't missing  
 and we told the security guard what we had put on her and we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing that we had told the security guard
 that we had put on her and then we got the baby and my other child  and we drove out to like
 i was so petrified and so numb all i could look was
 right on the shoulder of the highway 
 my own child  
 i let that happen to 
 so that 's an investigation of the negative imagination
  when i started this project called on the road a search for an american character with my tape recorder i thought that i was going to go around america and find it in all its aspects bull riders cowboys pig farmers
  drum majorettes but i sort of got tripped on race relations because my first big show was a show about a race riot
  i went to both two race riots one of which was the los angeles riot and this next piece
 is from that because this is what i would say i 've learned the most about race relations from this piece
  it 's a kind of an aria i would say and in many tapes that i have  everybody knows that the los angeles riots happened
 because four cops beat up a black man named rodney king it was captured on videotape technology and it was played all over the world everybody thought the four cops would go to jail they did not so there were riots
 what a lot of people forget is there was a second trial ordered by george bush  sr and
 that trial came back with two
 two cops going to jail and two
 cops declared innocent i was at that trial  and i mean the people just danced in the streets because they were afraid there was going to be another riot  explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way  
 so there was a community that didn 't the korean americans 
 whose stores had been burned to the ground
  and so this woman mrs young soon han i suppose will have taught me the most that i have learned about race and she asks also a question
 that studs talks about this notion of the official truth to question the official truth 
 so what she 's questioning here she 's taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society and this is called 
 swallowing the bitterness
  the best i watched in korea many luxurious hollywood
 lifestyle movie i never saw any poor man any black 
 until one thousand nine hundred and ninety two i used to believe america was the best i still do i don 't deny that because i
  we were in such turmoil  and having all the financial problems  and all the mental problems  i began to really realize that koreans are 
  completely left out of this society
  who never work
 got minimum amount of money to survive  we didn 't get any because we have a car
 and
  probably think that they won by the trial  i was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict and all the day they were having a party they celebrated all of south
  central all the churches and they say ' well finally justice has been done in this society '
 well what about victims ' rights 
 they got their rights by destroying innocent korean merchants
  of respect as i do for dr martin king  
 he is the only model for black community i don 't care jesse jackson  
 he is the model of
  they destroyed innocent people
 and i wonder if that is really justice for them to get their rights in that way  
 i was
 swallowing the bitterness  sitting here alone and watching them they became
  so hilarious but i was happy for them i was glad for them
 rights
 for
 over two centuries and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities hispanic asian we would suffer more
 in the mainstream that 's why i understand that 's why i have a mixed feeling about the verdict but
 i wish that i wish that i wish that i could be part
 of the enjoyment  i wish that i could live together with black people 
 but after the riot it 's too much difference
  the fire
  is still there how do you
  the other reason that i don 't wear shoes
 is just in case i really feel like i have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody walking really in somebody else 's shoes  and i told you that in you know i didn 't give you the
  i thought that i was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that and i got sidetracked on race relations  
 finally  i did find a bull rider two years ago and i 've been going to the rodeos with him and we 've bonded  and
 he 's the lead in an op ed i did about the republican convention he 's a republican i won 't say anything about my party affiliation but
 anyway so this is
  this is on toughness in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do i think there 's a real lesson in this and this is called toughness 
 i 'm an optimist i mean basically i 'm an optimist i mean you know i mean it 's like my wife jolene her family 's always saying you know you ever think he 's just a born loser it seems like he has so much
  but then when that bull stepped on my kidney you know i didn 't lose my kidney i could have lost my kidney i kept my kidney so i don 't think i 'm a born loser i think that 's good luck 
 and i mean funny things like this happen i was in a
 doctor 's office last cat scan and there was a reader 's digest  october two thousand and two it was like ' seven ways to get lucky ' and it says if you want to get lucky  you know you 've got to be around positive people  
 i mean like even when i told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me
  she 's just talking she 's just being nice to you she 's not going to do that ' and then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the internet she said ' look who she is you 're not even going to be able to answer her questions ' 
 and she was saying you 're going to make me look like an idiot because i 've never been to college and i wouldn 't be talking professional or anything i said ' well look the woman talked to me for four hours you know if i wasn 't talking you
  me to talk i don 't think she would even come out here ' 
 confidence  well i think i ride more out of
 out of determination than confidence i mean confidence is like you know you 've been on that bull before you know you can ride him i mean confidence is kind of like being cocky but in a good way  but determination you know it
  always said when i was a boy he say ' you know you got more try than any kid i ever seen ' and try and determination is the same thing determination is like you 're going to hang on that bull even if you 're riding upside down determination 's like you 're going to ride till your head hits the back
  think i know what beauty is well you know i guess that 'd have to be the rodeo too i mean look how we are the roughy family palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me it 's like you know  racking up
 our credit cards on entry fees and gas we ride together we you know we we eat together and we sleep together  i mean i can 't even imagine what it 's going to be like the last
  i have my ranch and everything but i actually don 't even want to think the day that comes i mean i guess it just be like i guess it be like the day my brother died 
 toughness  
 well  we was in west jordan utah and this bull shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a you know
 busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital and they had to sew me up and straighten my nose
  to put me under
 anesthesia or whatever you call it and so
 they sewed my face up and then they had to straighten out my nose and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose and went up through my brains and felt like it was coming out the top of my head and everybody said that it should have killed me but it didn 't because i guess
 i have a high tolerance for pain 
 but the good thing was once they shoved those rods up there and straightened my nose
  out i could breathe  and i hadn 't been able to breathe since i broke my nose in the high school rodeo
