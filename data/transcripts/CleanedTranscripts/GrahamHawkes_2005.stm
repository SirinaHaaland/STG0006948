  i think the future of this planet depends on humans not technology and we already have the knowledge were kind of at the endgame with knowledge but were nowhere near the endgame when it comes to our perception 
 we still have one foot
 in the dark ages and when you listen to
  of the presentations here and the extraordinary
 the extraordinary range
 of human capability our understandings and then you contrast it with
 the fact we still call this planet earth its pretty extraordinary we have one foot in the dark ages just quickly
  its not flat stupid its round 
 galileo he had the inquisition so he had to be a little bit more polite his was its not in the middle you know 
 and hawkes  its not earth stupid its ocean this is an ocean planet t s eliot
 really said it for me and this should give you goose bumps we shall not cease from
  exploration and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started and know the place for the first time 
 and the next lines are through the unknown remembered gate where the last of earth discovered is that which is the beginning 
 so i have one message it seems to me
 that were all pointed in the wrong direction
 for the rocketeers in the audience 
 i love what youre doing  i admire the guts i admire the courage but your rockets are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction 
 and its all a question of perspective let me try and tell you i dont mean to insult
  and im not doing this for real because it would be an insult so im going to pretend and it softens the blow
 im going to tell you what youre thinking  if i held up a square that was one foot square and the color of
 earth  and i held up another square that was the root two square so its one point five times bigger
 and was the color of the oceans  and i said what is the relative value of these two things
  you would say yeah yeah yeah we all know this water covers twice the area of the planet
 than dry land 
 but its a question of perception and if thats what youre thinking if thats what you think i mean when i say this is an ocean planet stupidly called ' earth ' if you think
  that that thats the relative importance two to one youre wrong by a factor of ten now
 that demonstration  if i turned around this way that earth
 plane would be as thin as paper 
 its a thin film two dimensional existence the ocean representation would have a depth to it 
 and if you hefted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is twenty to one 
 it turns out that something
  more than ninety four percent of life on earth is aquatic that means that us terrestrials
 occupy a minority the problem we have in believing that is you just have to give up this notion
 that this earth was created for us because its a problem we have if this is an ocean planet
 and we only have a small minority of this planet it just interferes
  with a lot of what
 humanity thinks okay let me criticize this thing im not talking about james cameron
 although i could but i wont 
 you really do have to go and see his latest film aliens of the deep 
 its incredible it features two of these deep rovers and i can criticize them because these sweet things are mine 
 this i think represents one of the most beautiful classic
  submersibles built if you look at that sub 
 youll see a sphere  
 this is an acryclic sphere it generates all of the buoyancy all of the payload for the craft and the batteries are down here hanging underneath exactly like a balloon this is the envelope and this is the gondola the payload 
 also coming up later for criticism
 are these massive lights and this one actually
  carries two great manipulators it actually is a very good working sub thats what it was designed for 
 the problem with it is and the reason i will never build another one like it is that this is a product of two dimensional thinking  
 its what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers we take all
  constraints that we have and theyre so constrained we dont even understand it and we take them underwater
  you notice that jim cameron is sitting in a seat 
 a seat works in a two dimensional world where gravity blasts
 down on that seat ok and in a two dimensional world we do know about the third dimension but we dont use it because to go up requires an awful lot of energy against
  gravity and then our mothers tell us careful you dont fall down because youll fall over  
 now  go into the real atmosphere of this planet 
 this planet has an inner atmosphere of water 
 its its inner atmosphere it has two atmospheres a lesser  outer gaseous atmosphere a lighter one 
 most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere
  and that life enjoys a three dimensional existence  which is alien to us fish do not sit in seats 
 they dont 
 their mothers dont say to little baby fish careful you dont fall over 
 they dont fall over they dont fall they live in a three dimensional world where there is no difference in energy
  between going this way that way that way or that way  its truly a three dimensional space  and were only just beginning to grasp it  i dont know of any other
 submersible or even remote 
 that just takes advantage that this is a three dimensional space  this is the way we should be going into the oceans this is a
  what we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals and move in this three dimensional space  ok this is good stuff this is mans first attempt at flying underwater 
 right now im just coming down on this gorgeous big
  giant manta ray she has twice the wingspan that i do there im coming she sees me and just notice how she rolls under
  sit there and try and blow air into a tank and kind of flow up or sink down she just rolls and the craft
 that im in this hasnt been shown before chris asked us to show stuff that hasnt been shown before  i wanted you to notice that she actually turned
 to come back up there i am i see her coming back coming up underneath me  i put reverse thrust and i try and
 pull gently down im trying to do everything very gently we spent about three hours together and shes beginning to trust me and this ballet is controlled by
 this lady here she gets about that close and then she pulls away  so now i try and go after her  but
 im practicing flying this is the first flying machine  this was the first prototype this  was a fly
  it has wings therere no silly buoyancy tanks
 its permanently positively buoyant and then by moving through the water its able to take that control now look at that look its
 she just blew me away she just rolled
 right away from underneath really thats the only real dive ive ever made in this machine it took ten years
  to build but this lady here taught me 
 taught me so much we just learned so much in in three hours in the water there 
 i just had to go and build another machine  but look here  instead of blowing tanks and coming up slowly without thinking about it its a little bit of back pressure  
 and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water  this is an internal sony
  i dont really look that ugly but the camera is so close that its just distorted now
 there she goes right overhead  this is a wide angle camera shes just a few inches off the top of my head
  this is an incredible encounter with a manta  im speechless  
 just feet apart im going back down now okay can we cut that lights back up please 
 trying to fly and keep up with that animal it wasnt
 the lack of maneuverability that we had it was the fact she was going so slow
  actually designed that to move faster through the water
 because i thought that was the thing that we needed to do to move fast and get range but after that encounter i really did want to go back with that animal and dance she wanted to dance  
 and so what we needed to do was increase the wing area
 so that we just had more grip
  develop higher forces so the sub that was outside last year this is the one you see the larger wing area here  
 also clearly it was such a powerful thing we wanted to try and bring other people but we couldn 't figure out how to do it so we opened the worlds first flight school 
 the rational for the worlds first flight first flight school goes something like when the coastguards come up to me and say
 they used to leave us alone when we were diving these goofy little spherical things but when we started flying around in underwater jet fighters they
 got a little nervous
 they would come up and say 
 do you have a license for that 
 and then id put my sunglasses on the beard that would all sprout out and i would say i dont need no stinking license 
 i write these stinking license 
  which i do so bob gelfond 's around here but
 somebody in the audience here has license number twenty
 theyre one of the first subsea aviators so weve run two flight schools where the hell that goes i dont know but its a lot of fun 
 what comes next in thirty seconds  i cant tell you
