  today i want to talk about the the meaning of words
  how we define them and how they  almost as revenge 
 define us the english language is a magnificent sponge  i love the english language i 'm glad that i speak it  but for all that it has a lot of holes
  in greek there 's a word lachesism which is the hunger for 
 when you see a a thunderstorm on the horizon
 and you just find yourself rooting for the storm in mandarin they have a word y y i 'm not pronouncing that correctly
 which means the longing to feel intensely again the way you did when you were a kid
 in polish they have a word jouska which is the the kind of hypothetical conversation that you compulsively play out in your head
 and finally in german of course in german they have a word called zielschmerz which is the dread of getting what
  finally fulfilling a lifelong dream  
 i 'm german myself so i know exactly what that feels like now
 i 'm not sure if i would use any of these words as i go about my day  but i 'm really glad they exist  
 but the only reason they exist is because i made them up  
 i am the author of the dictionary of obscure
  which i 've been writing for the last seven years  and
 the whole mission of the project is to find holes in in the language of emotion
 and try to fill them so that we have a way of talking about all those human peccadilloes and quirks of the human condition
 that
 that we all feel but may not think to talk about because we don 't have the words to do it
  the idea that we all think of ourselves as the main character and everyone else is just extras
  but in reality we 're all the main character and you yourself are an extra in someone else 's story  
 and so as soon as i i published that i got a lot of response from people saying thank you
 for giving voice to something i had felt all my life but
  for that so it made them feel less alone
 that 's the power of words 
 to make us feel less alone  
 and it was not not long after that that i started to notice sonder being used earnestly in conversations online
 and not long after i actually noticed it
  i caught it next to me in an actual conversation in person there is no stranger feeling than making up a word and then seeing it take on a
 mind of its own  i don 't have a word for that yet but i will 
 i 'm working on it 
 i started to think about what makes words real 
 because a lot of people ask me the most common thing i got from people is well are these words made up i don 't really understand 
 and i didn 't really know what to tell them because once
 sonder started to take off who am i to say
 what words are real and what aren 't  and so i sort of felt like steve jobs who described his
 his epiphany as when he realized that most of us as we go through the day we just try to avoid bouncing against the walls too much and just sort of
 get on with things but once you realize
  that people
 that this world was built by people no smarter than you 
 then you can reach out and touch those walls and even put your hand through them and realize that you you have the power to change it 
 and when people ask me are these words real i had a variety of answers that i tried out some of them made sense some of them didn 't but
 one of them i tried out was well a word is real if you want it to be
  the way that this path is real because people wanted it to be there 
 it happens on college campuses all the time it 's called a desire path but then i decided what people are really asking when they 're asking if a word is real they 're really asking
 how many brains will this give me access to because i think that 's a lot of how we
  is essentially a key that gets us into certain people 's heads  and if it gets us into one brain 
 it 's not really worth it not really worth knowing  two brains eh it depends on who it is a million brains  ok now we 're talking 
 and so a real word is one that gets you access to
 as many brains as you can that
  word of all by this measure
 is this [ o k ]
 that 's it the realest word we have that is the closest thing we have to a master key 
 that 's the most commonly understood word in the world no matter where you are the problem with that is no one
 seems to know what those two letters stand for 
 which is kind of weird
  it could be a misspelling of all correct i guess or old kinderhook no one really seems to know but the fact
 the fact that it doesn 't matter says something about
 how we add meaning to words the meaning is not in the words themselves we
 're the ones that pour ourselves into it and i think when we 're all searching for meaning in our lives  
 and searching for the meaning of life i think
 words have something to do with that
  that  and i think if you 're looking for the meaning of something  the dictionary is a decent place to start  it brings a sense of order
 to a very chaotic universe our view of things is so limited
 that we have to come up with patterns and shorthands and try to figure out a way to interpret it and and be able to get on with our day  we need words
 to contain us to define
  ourselves i think a lot of us feel boxed in
 by how we use these words we forget that words are
 made up it 's not just my words all words are made up  but not all of them mean something we 're all just sort of trapped in our own
 lexicons that don 't necessarily correlate with people who aren 't already like us  and so i i think i feel us drifting apart
  a little more every year  the more seriously we take words 
 because remember words
 are not real  they don 't have meaning we do  and i 'd like to
 leave you with a reading from one of my favorite philosophers  bill watterson
  creating a life that reflects your values and satisfies your soul is a rare achievement to invent your own life 's meaning
 is not easy  but it is still allowed  and i think you 'll be happier for the trouble
