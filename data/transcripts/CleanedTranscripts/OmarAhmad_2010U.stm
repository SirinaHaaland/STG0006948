  one of the things that defines a tedster
 is you 've taken your passion and you 've turned it into stewardship you actually put action to the issues you care about 
 but what you 're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials
 to help you out
  so how do you do that 
 one of the things i should probably tell you is i worked for the discovery channel early in my career  and that sort of warped my framework 
 so when you start to think about politicians  
 you 've got to realize these are strange creatures  other than the fact that they can 't tell directions and they have very strange breeding habits  how do you actually work
  what we need to understand is what drives the political creature and there are two things that are primary in a politician 's heart one is reputation and influence these are the primary tools 
  by which a politician can do his job the second one unlike most animals which is survival of the species this is preservation of self  
 the challenge with you moving your issue forward is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time so what doesn 't work in terms of getting your issue to be important  
 you can send them an email well unfortunately i 've got so many viagra ads coming at me your email is lost it doesn 't matter it 's spam  
 how about you get on the phone well chances are i 've got a droid who 's picking up the phone yes they called and they said they didn 't like it
 that doesn 't move face to face would work  but it 's hard to set it up it 's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work  
 yes contributions actually do make a difference and they set a context for having a conversation  but it takes some time to build up 
 so what actually works and the answer is rather strange it 's a
  we live in a digital world but we 're fairly analog creatures  letters actually work  even
 the top dog himself takes time every day to read ten letters that are picked out by staff 
 i can tell you that every official that i 've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean 
 so how are you going to write your letter  first of all  you 're going to pick up an analog
  a pen 
 i know these are tough and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it 
 laughter but this is actually critical and it is critical that you actually handwrite your letter it is so novel to see this that somebody actually picked up an analog device and has written to me  
 second of all i 'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month here 's my promise to you 
 if you are consistent and do this within three months the elected official will start calling
  you when that issue comes up and say what do you think now i 'm going to give you a four paragraph format to work with 
 now  when you approach these animals
  you need to understand there 's a dangerous end to them  
 and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness so in paragraph number one what i 'm going to tell you to do is very simply this
  you appreciate them 
 you may not appreciate the person you may not appreciate anything else but maybe you appreciate the fact that they 've got a tough gig 
 when animals are going to make a point they make the point they don 't spend a lot of time dicking around so here you go 
 paragraph number two you may actually have to just get very blunt and say
 what 's really on your mind  when you do this don 't attack people  you attack tactics  ad hominem
  attacks will get you nowhere paragraph number three 
 when animals are attacked or cornered they will fight to the death 
 so you have to give them an exit most of the time if they have an exit strategy  they should take it 
 obviously you 're intelligent if you had the right information you would have done the right thing 
 lastly you want to be the nurturing agent you 're the safe place to come in to
  so in paragraph number four you 're going to tell people if no one is providing you with this information let me help 
 animals do displays they do two things they warn you or they try to attract you and say we need to mate 
 you 're going to do that by the way you sign your letter  you do a number of things you 're a vice
  you volunteer you do something else  why is is this important because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature that you have influence in a large sphere  and that my preservation depends on you 
 here is one very quick hack especially for the feds in the audience here 's how you mail your letter first of all  you send the original to the district office so
 you send the copy to the main office  if they follow protocol they 'll pick up the phone and say hey do you have the original
  in the back puts the name on a tickler and says oh this is an important letter and you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read  
 so what your letter means  
 i 've got to tell you we are all in a party  and political officials are the pinatas 
 we are harangued lectured to sold marketed
  a letter
 is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication i got this letter when i was first elected and i still carry it to every council meeting i go to 
 this is an opportunity at real dialogue  and if you have stewardship
 and want to communicate that dialogue is incredibly powerful  
 so when you do that here 's what i can promise  you 're going to be the eight hundred pound gorilla in the forest get writing
