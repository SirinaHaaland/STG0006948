  the past six months i 've spent my time traveling  i think i 've done sixty thousand
 miles  but without leaving my desk and the reason i can do that is because i 'm actually two
  i look like one person but i 'm two people i 'm eddie who is here  and at the same time my alter ego is a big green boxy avatar nicknamed cyber frank so
 that 's what i spend my time doing i 'd like to start if it 's possible with a test  because i do business stuff so it 's important that we focus on outcomes
  and then i struggled because i was thinking to myself what should i talk what should i do it 's a ted audience 
  i just hope i 've got the level of difficulty right  so let 's just walk our way through this please could you work this through with me you can shout out the answer if you like the question is which of these horizontal lines is longer the answer is audience the same eddie obeng 
 the same  no they 're not the same 
 they 're not the same  the top one is ten percent longer than the bottom one  so why did you tell me they were the same  do you remember
  the lengths are you say they 're the same  but they 're not the same because i 've changed it and this is what i 'm trying to explain has happened to us in the  21st century somebody or something has changed the rules about how our world works 
 when i 'm joking i try and explain it happened
  at midnight you see while we were asleep but it was midnight fifteen years ago  okay  you didn 't notice it but basically what they do is they switched all the rules round  so that the way to
  successfully run a business an organization or even a country has been deleted flipped
  idea is that
 what 's happened is the real 21st century around us isn 't so obvious to us  so instead we spend our time responding rationally to a world which we understand and recognize but which no longer exists
  you don 't believe me do you okay so
 let me take you on a little journey of many of the things i don 't understand  if you search amazon for the word
  creativity you 'll discover something like ninety thousand books if you go on google and you look for innovation + creativity you get thirty million hits  if you add the word consultants it doubles to sixty 
  million are you with me and yet  statistically what you discover is that about one in one hundred thousand ideas is found making money or delivering benefits two years after its inception it
  companies make their expensive executives spend ages carefully preparing forecasts and budgets
 which are obsolete or need changing before they can be published how is that possible  if you look at
 the visions we have the visions of how we 're going to change the world the key thing is implementation we have the vision we 've got to make it happen  we 've spent decades professionalizing implementation people are supposed to be good at making stuff happen  
 however
  if i use as an example
 a family of five going on holiday  if you can imagine this all the way from london all the way across to hong kong  what i want you to think about is their budget is only three thousand pounds of expenses 
 what actually happens is if i compare this to the average real project  
 average real successful project  the family actually end up in makassar south sulawesi at a cost of four thousand
 pounds whilst leaving two of the children behind what i 'm trying to explain to you is there are things which don 't make sense to us  
 it gets even worse than that let me just walk you through this one this is a quote and i 'll just pick words out of it it says
 i 'll put on the voice in summary your majesty  the failure to foresee the timing extent and severity of the crisis was due to the lack of
  of creativity and the number of bright minds or something like that this was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the queen of england
 when she asked the question why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming i 'll
 never get my knighthood i 'll never get my knighthood that 's not the important point the thing you have to remember is these are eminent economists
  on the planet do you see the challenge 
 it 's scary 
 my friend and mentor tim brown of ideo he explains that design must get big  and he 's right  he wisely explains this to us he says design thinking must tackle big systems for the challenges we have he 's absolutely right  
 and then i ask myself why was it ever small
  amazing  why did we build these huge hierarchies  what 's going on 
 you see  i think what 's happened perhaps 
 is that we 've not noticed that change i described earlier  what we do know is that the world has accelerated cyberspace moves everything at the speed of light  technology
  so if this is now and that 's the past and we start thinking about change you know all governments are seeking change you 're here seeking change  everybody 's after change it 's really cool so what happens is  we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change 
 the speed is accelerating that 's not the only thing at the same time as we 've done that we 've done something really weird we 've doubled the population in forty years 
 put half of them in cities then connected them all up so they can interact the density of the interaction of human
  beings is amazing  there are charts which show all these movements of information that density of information is amazing and then we 've done a third thing you know for those of you who have as an office a 
  little desk underneath the stairs  and you say well this is my little desk under the stairs no you are sitting at the headquarters of a global corporation if you 're connected to the internet  
  size and scale are no longer the same and then add to that every time you tweet 
 over a third of your followers follow from a country which is not your own 
 global is the new scale we know that 
 and so people say things like the world is now a turbulent place have you heard them saying things like that  and they use it as a metaphor  have you come across this  
 and they think it 's a metaphor  but this is not a metaphor  it 's reality
  as a young engineering student i remember going to
 a demonstration where they basically the demonstrator did something quite intriguing what he did was he got a
 transparent pipe  have you seen this demonstration before he attached it to a tap  so effectively what you had was you had a situation where i 'll try and draw the
  he attaches it to a transparent pipe and he turns the water on  and he says do you notice anything and the water is whooshing down this pipe  i mean this is not exciting stuff are you with me  so the water 
  goes up he turns it back down great  and he says anything you notice no then he sticks a needle into the pipe  and he connects this to a
  and he fills the container up with green ink you with me  so guess what happens a thin green line comes out as it flows down the pipe it
 's not that interesting  
 and then he turns the water up a bit  so it starts coming back in and nothing changes so he 's changing the flow of the water but it 's
 just a boring green line  he adds some more he adds some more  and then something weird happens there 's this
 little flicker  
 and then as he turns it ever so slightly more  the whole of that green line disappears
 and instead there are these little sort of inky dust devils close to the needle they 're called eddies not me and they 're violently dispersing the ink so that it actually gets diluted out  and the color 's gone  
 what 's happened in this world of pipe
 is somebody has flipped it they 've changed the rules from laminar to turbulent all the rules are
  in that environment instantly all the possibilities which turbulence brings are available and it 's not the same as laminar 
 and if we didn 't have that green ink  you 'd never notice 
 and i think this is our challenge  because somebody has actually increased and it 's probably you guys with all your tech and stuff the speed 
 the scale and the density of
  now how do we cope and deal with that well we could just call it turbulence or we could try and learn  yes  learn  but
 i know you guys grew up in the days when there were actually these things called correct answers  because of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle and you believe it will last 
  forever  so i 'll put a little line up here which represents learning  and that 's how we used to do it we could see things understand
  take the time to put them into practice out here is the world 
 now what 's happened to our pace of learning as the world has accelerated  
 well  if you work for a corporation you 'll discover it 's quite difficult to work on stuff which your boss doesn 't approve of isn 't in the strategy and anyway you 've got to go through your monthly meetings
  if you work in an institution one day you will get them to make that decision  
 and if you work in a market where people believe in cycles it 's even funnier  because you have to wait all the way for the cycle to fail before you go
  something wrong you with me  so it 's likely that the line in terms of learning is pretty
 flat  you with me  this point over here  the point at which the lines cross over 
 the pace of change
 overtakes the pace of learning  and for me  that is what i was describing when i was telling you about midnight  so what does
  it do to us well it completely transforms what we have to do many mistakes we make we solve last year 's problems without thinking about the future  if you try and think about it the things you 're solving now what problems are they going to bring in the future  
 if you haven 't understood the world you 're living in it 's almost impossible to be absolutely certain that what you 're going to deliver fits i 'll give you an example a quick one  creativity and ideas i mentioned that earlier all the ceos around me my clients they want innovation so they
  seek innovation they say to people take risks and be creative but unfortunately the words get transformed as they travel through the air entering their ears what they hear is do crazy things and then i 'll fire you why because
 why  because in the old world  okay in the old world over here getting stuff wrong was unacceptable if you got something wrong you 'd failed how should you be treated  well  harshly  because
  you could have asked somebody who had experience  
 so we learned the answer and we carried this in our heads for twenty thirty years are you with me  the answer is  don 't do things which are different  
 and then suddenly we tell them to and it doesn 't work you see in reality there are two ways you can fail in our new world one you 're doing something that you should follow a procedure to and it 's a very difficult thing you 're sloppy you get it wrong  
  how should you be treated  you should probably be fired on the other hand you 're doing something new no one 's ever done before
  it 's called smart failure why  because you can 't put it
