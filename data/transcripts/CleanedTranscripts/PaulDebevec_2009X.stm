 biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo real digital human face and one of the reasons it is so difficult is that unlike
 aliens and dinosaurs we look at human faces every day they are
  important to how we communicate with each other as a result  we 're tuned in to the subtlest things that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering 
 in order to believe whether these things are realistic  and what i 'm going to do in the next five minutes is take you through a process where we tried to create a reasonably 
  face using some computer graphics technology we 've developed  and also some collaborators at a company called image metrics and we 're going to try to do a photo real face of an actress named emily o 'brien who is right there  and that 's actually a completely
  by the end of the talk we 're going to see it move 
 the way that we did this is we tried to start with emily herself who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory in marina del rey  and sit for a session in light stage five this is a
 face scanning sphere with one hundred and  fifty six white leds all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions and the lighting that we use these days looks something like this we shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds
 and we basically capture enough information with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face and different principle directions of light from the light stage to figure out both 
  the coarse scale and the  fine scale detail of her face if we zoom in on this photograph right here we can see it 's a really nice photograph to have of her because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the
 same time to get a nice image of her facial texture and in addition  we 've actually used polarizers on all the lights just like polarized sunglasses can block the glare off of the road polarizers 
  can block the shine off of the skin so we don 't get all those specular reflections to take this map now if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit we can actually bring that specular reflection of the skin back in  and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point
  just the shine off of emily 's skin i don 't think any photograph like this had ever been taken before we had done this  and
 this is very important light to capture  because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin it doesn 't get underneath the translucent layers of the skin and blur out and as a result it 's a very good 
  cue to the detailed shape of the skin pore structure and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have the things that actually make us look like real humans  so if we
  use information that comes off of this specular reflection  
 we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore 
  structure and fine wrinkles and even more importantly since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture  we can shoot emily in just part of an afternoon in many different facial poses and
  expressions  so here you can see her moving her eyes around moving her mouth around and these we 're actually going to use to create a photo real digital character  if you take a look at these scans that we have of emily 
  you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions  you can see things
  all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs you can see that
 the skin pore structure changes enormously from stretched skin pores
 to the regular skin texture  you can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there you can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that 
 in addition to this kind of high resolution geometry 
 since it 's all captured with cameras we 've got a great texture map to use for the face and by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination the red and the green and the blue  diffuse the light differently  we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer then instead of looking like a
 plaster mannequin it actually looks like it 's made out of living human flesh  and this is what we used to give to the company image metrics to create a rigged  
  version of emily we 're just seeing the coarse scale geometry here but they basically created a digital puppet of her where you can pull on these various strings  and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely 
  consistent with the scans that we took and in addition to the coarse scale geometry  they also used all of that detail to create a set of what are called displacement maps that animate as well 
 these are the displacement maps here and you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates  so the next process was then to animate her we actually
  used one of her own performances to provide the source data  so by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques they were able to drive the facial rig with the computer generated performance 
 so what you 're going to see now  after this is a completely photo real digital face we can turn the volume up a little bit if that 's available emily image metrics is a markerless  performance driven animation company  
  image metrics is a markerless performance driven animation company
 we specialize in high quality facial animation for video games and films paul debevec 
 so if we break that down into layers here 's that diffuse component we saw in the first slide here is the specular component animating you can see all the wrinkles happening there  
 and there is the underlying wireframe
  and that is emily herself
