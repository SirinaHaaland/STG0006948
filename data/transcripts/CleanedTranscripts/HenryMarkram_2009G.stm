  our mission is to build a detailed  realistic computer model of the human brain  and
 we 've done in the past four years a proof of concept on a small part of the rodent brain  and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project
  up to reach
 the human brain  
 why are we doing this there are three important reasons the first is it 's essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society and i think that it is a key step in evolution
 the second
 reason is we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever
  and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge
 into a working model  it 's like a noah 's ark it 's like an archive 
 and the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet that are affected by mental disorder  and the drugs that are used today
  i think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders 
 now  even at this stage  we can use the brain model to explore some fundamental questions about how the brain works  
 and here at ted for the first time i 'd like to share with you how we 're addressing one theory there are many theories
 one theory of how the brain works
  this theory is that the brain creates  builds a version of the universe  and
 projects this version of the universe like a bubble all around us 
 now this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries
  for the first time  we can actually address this with brain simulation and ask very systematic and rigorous questions whether this theory could possibly be true  
 the reason why the moon is huge on the horizon is simply because our perceptual bubble
 does not stretch out three hundred and eighty thousand kilometers it runs out of space  
  and so what we do is we compare the buildings
 within our perceptual bubble  and we make a decision  we make a decision it 's that big even though it 's not that big  
 and what that illustrates is that decisions are the key things that support
 our
 perceptual bubble it keeps it alive without decisions you cannot see you cannot think you cannot feel  
 and you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep
  blocking your receptors
 so that you don 't feel pain  but in fact most anesthetics don 't work that way  what they do is they introduce a noise into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other they are confused  
 and you cannot make a decision 
 so while you 're trying to make up your mind what
  the doctor the surgeon is doing while he 's hacking away at your body he 's long gone he 's at home having tea 
 so when you walk up to a door and you open it  what you compulsively have to do to perceive
 is to make decisions 
 thousands of decisions about the size of the room the walls the height the objects in this room ninety nine percent of what you see
 is not what comes in through the eyes it is what you infer
 about that room  
 so i can say 
 with some certainty i think  therefore i am but i cannot say you think  therefore you are 
 because you are within my perceptual bubble  
 now we can speculate and philosophize this but we don 't actually have to for the next hundred
  years we can ask a very concrete question can the brain build such a perception 
 is it capable of doing it  does it have the substance to do it and that 's what i 'm going to describe to you today 
 so it took the universe eleven billion years to build the brain  it had to improve it a little bit it had to add to the frontal part so that
 you would have instincts because they had to cope on land
  but the real big step was the neocortex  it 's a new brain you needed it 
 the mammals needed it because they had to cope with
 parenthood  social interactions  complex cognitive functions  so you can think of the neocortex actually
  of the universe as we know it  it 's the pinnacle it 's the final product
 that the universe has produced 
 it was so successful in evolution that from mouse to man it expanded about a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons 
 to produce this almost frightening
 organ structure
  and it has not stopped its evolutionary path in fact the neocortex in the human brain is evolving at an enormous speed 
 if you zoom into the surface of the neocortex  you discover that it 's made up of little modules g5 processors like in a computer but there are about a million of them 
 they were so successful in evolution that what we did was to duplicate them over and over and add more and more of them to the brain until we ran out of space in the skull  and the brain started to fold in on itself
  and that 's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted we 're just packing in columns 
 so that we 'd have more neocortical columns to perform more complex functions  
 so you can think of the neocortex actually as a massive grand piano
 grand piano each of these neocortical columns would produce a note you stimulate it it produces a symphony
  but it 's not just a symphony of perception  it 's a symphony of your universe your reality  
 now of course it takes years to learn how to master a grand piano with a million keys 
 that 's why you have to send your kids to good schools  hopefully eventually to oxford  
 but it 's not only education  it 's also
  you may be born lucky where you know how to master your neocortical column and you can play a fantastic symphony in fact there is a new theory
 of autism called the intense world theory which suggests that the neocortical columns are 
 they are highly reactive and 
 and so the the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony which is unthinkable for us  but you can
  also understand
 that if you have a disease within one of these columns the note is going to be off  
 the perception the symphony that you create is going to be corrupted  and you will have symptoms of disease 
 so the holy grail for neuroscience is really to understand the design
  of the neocoritical column
 and it 's not just for neuroscience it 's perhaps to understand perception to understand reality  and perhaps to even also understand physical reality 
 so what we did was for the past fifteen years was to dissect out the neocortex systematically  it 's a bit
 like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest 
 how many trees does it have what shapes are the trees how many of each type of tree do you have where are they positioned  but it 's a bit more
  than cataloging because you actually have to describe and discover all the rules of communication the rules of connectivity because the neurons don 't just like to connect with any neuron 
 they choose very carefully who they connect with it 's also more than cataloging because you actually have to build three dimensional digital models of them  
  neurons we came across and once you have that you can actually begin to build the neocortical column 
 and here we 're coiling them up but as you do this what you see is that the branches intersect
 actually in millions of locations  and at each of these intersections
 they can form a synapse and a synapse is
  chemical location where they communicate with each other  and these synapses together form the network
 or the circuit of the brain  
 now  the circuit you could also think of as the fabric of the brain  
 and when you think of the fabric of the brain the structure how is it built what is the pattern of the carpet
  realize that this poses a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain  
 and especially to a theory that says that there is some reality that emerges out of this carpet out of this particular carpet with a particular pattern  
 the reason is because the most important design secret of the brain is diversity  
 every neuron is
  it 's the same in the forest every pine tree is different you may have many different types of trees but every pine tree is different and in the brain it 's the same 
 so there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours 
 and your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned in exactly the same way  and you may have more or less neurons  
 so it 's very unlikely that you got the same fabric the same circuitry so how could we possibly create a reality that we can
  even understand each other  
 well we don 't have to speculate we can look at all ten million synapses now we can look at the fabric  
 and we can change neurons we can use different neurons with different variations we can position them in different places  orient them in different places we can use less or more of them  
 and when we do that
 what we discovered is that the circuitry does change
 of how the circuitry is designed does not 
 so the fabric of the brain  even though your brain may be smaller bigger  it may have different types of neurons different
 morphologies of neurons we actually do share
 the same fabric  and we think this is
  which means that that could explain why we can 't communicate across species  so let 's switch it on but to do it what you have to do is you have to make this come alive  
 we make it come alive with equations a lot of mathematics 
 and in fact the equations that make neurons into electrical generators were discovered by two cambridge nobel laureates  
 so we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive  we also have the mathematics to describe how neurons collect information 
  how they create a little lightning bolt to communicate with each other  and when they get to the synapse what they do is they effectively literally shock
 the synapse it 's like electrical shock that releases the chemicals from these synapses  
 and we 've got the mathematics to describe this process so we can describe the communication between the neurons 
 there literally are only a
  handful
 of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex  
 but what you do need is a very big computer  and in fact you need one laptop to do all the calculations just for one neuron  
 so you need ten thousand laptops so where do you go you go to ibm and you get a supercomputer because they know how to take ten thousand
  laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator  
 so now we have this blue gene supercomputer  we can load up all the neurons each one on to its processor  and fire it up 
 and see what happens take the magic carpet for a ride 
 here we activate it  and this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain when there is a stimulation it 's the first
  when you look at that the first time you think my god how is reality coming out of that 
 but in fact 
 you can start even though we haven 't trained this neocortical column to create a specific reality  but we can ask where
 is the rose we can ask where is it inside if we stimulate it with a
  where is it inside the neocortex ultimately it 's got to be there if we stimulated it with it 
 so the way that we can look at that is to ignore the neurons ignore the synapses and look just at the raw electrical activity because that is what it 's creating it 's creating electrical patterns 
 so when we did this we indeed for the first time  saw these
  neocortical column and it 's these electrical objects that are holding all the information about
 whatever stimulated it and then when we zoomed into this  it 's like a veritable universe
