  once upon a time at the age of 
 i was a student at  st john 's medical college in bangalore  
 i was a guest student during one month of a public health course  and that changed my mindset forever
 the course was good but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset it was the brutal realization the first morning that the indian students were better than me you see
 i was a study nerd i loved statistics from a young age and i studied very much in
  i used to be in the upper quarter of all courses i attended  but in st john 's  i was in the lower quarter  
 and the fact was that indian students studied harder than we did in sweden they read the textbook
 twice or three times or four times in sweden we read it once and then we went partying 
 laugher and that to me that personal experience was the first time in my life that
  the mindset i grew up with was
 changed  and i realized that perhaps the western world will not continue to dominate the world forever  
 and i think many of you have the same sort of personal experience it 's that realization of someone you meet that really made you change your ideas about the world  it 's not the statistics although i tried to make it funny
 and
 i will now 
 here  onstage  try to predict when that will happen that that asia will 
 its dominant position as the leading part of the world  as it used to be over thousands of years  and
 i will do that by
  trying to predict precisely at what year the average income per person in india in china  will reach that of the west and i don 't mean the whole 
  economy  because to to grow an economy of india to the size of u k that 's a piece of cake with one billion people  
 and china  when will that have reached that of u k and the united states
 but i will start with a historical background  and you can see my map if i get it up here  you know  i will start at one thousand eight hundred and 
 eight hundred and fifty eight was a year of great technological advancement in the west 
 that was the year when queen victoria was able for the first time to
  communicate with president buchanan  through the transatlantic telegraphic cable  and they were the first to twitter transatlantically 
 and i 've been able  through this wonderful google and internet to find the text of the telegram sent back from president buchanan to queen victoria  and it ends like this 
 this telegraph is
  a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion civilization liberty and law throughout the world those are nice words  
 but i got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty and liberty for whom  
 and we will we will think about that when we look at the wider picture of the world in
  was the year when the courageous uprising against the foreign occupation of india
 was defeated by the british forces  and india was up to eighty nine years more of foreign domination one thousand 
 eight hundred and fifty eight in china was the victory in the opium war by the british forces  
 and that meant that foreigners as it said in the treaty
  to trade freely in china it meant paying with opium for chinese goods 
 and one thousand eight hundred and fifty eight in japan was the year when japan had to sign the harris treaty and accept trade on favorable
 condition for the u s and they were threatened by those black ships there  that had been in tokyo harbor over
  in contrast to india and china  maintained its national sovereignty 
 and let 's see how much difference that can make  
 and i will do that by bringing these bubbles back to a gapminder graph here  where you can see each bubble is a country the size of the bubble here is 
  the population on this axis as i used to have income per person in comparable
  and on that axis i have life expectancy the health of people  and i also bring an innovation here i have transformed the laser beam into an ecological  recyclable version here in
 green india 
 and we will see you know  look here one thousand eight hundred and fifty eight india was here  china
  japan was there  united states and united kingdom was richer over there  and i will start the world like this india was not always like this level actually 
  if we go back into the historical record there was a time hundreds of years ago when the income per person in india and china was even above that of europe but one thousand eight hundred and fifty had already been many many years of foreign domination and india had been
  and you can see that the countries who were growing their economy was united states and united kingdom  and they were also by the end of the century getting healthy  and japan was starting to catch up india was trying down here can you see how it starts to move there but
 really really natural sovereignty was good for japan  and japan is trying to move up there  and it 's the new century now health is getting better united kingdom united states 
  but careful now we are approaching the first world war  and the first world war you know we 'll see a lot of
  of of deaths and
 economical problems here united kingdom is going down and now comes the spanish flu also and then after the first world war  they continue up  still under foreign domination 
  and without sovereignty india and china are down in the corner not much has happened they have grown their population but not much more in the one thousand nine hundred and thirty 's now you can see that japan is going to a period of war with lower life
  expectancy and the second world war was really a terrible event also economically for japan but they did recover quite fast afterwards  and we are moving into the new world in one thousand nine hundred and
 forty seven india finally gained its independence  and they could raise the indian flag and become a sovereign nation
  we saw the emergence of the modern china in a way which surprised the world  and what happened what happens in the after independence you can see that the health started to improve  
 children started to go to school
 health services were provided  this is the great leap forward  when china fell down it was central planning by mao tse tung china recovered then they said nevermore stupid central planning
  went up here  and india was trying to follow and they were catching up indeed and both countries had the better health but still a very low economy  and we came to 
 and mao tse tung died  and a new guy turned up from the left  and it was deng xiaoping coming out here and he said 
 doesn 't matter if a cat is white or black as long as it catches mice
 catching mice is what the two cats wanted to do  and you can see the two cats being here  china and india  wanting to catch the mices over there you know  and they decided 
  to go not only for health and education but also starting to grow their economy  and the market reformer was
  they go quite closely together and you can see that the similarity with india and china in many ways are greater than the differences with them and here they march on and will they catch up this is the big question today there they are today  
 now what does it mean that the the
 averages there this is the average of china  if i would split china look here  shanghai has already catched
  shanghai is already there  and it 's healthier than the united states  
 but on the other hand guizhou one of the poorest inland provinces of of china is there  and if i split guizhou into urban and rural the 
  rural part of guizhou goes down there  you see this enormous inequity in china in the midst of fast economic growth and if i would also look at india you have another type of inequity actually in
  india  the geographical 
  difference is not so big 
 uttar pradesh  the biggest of the states here is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of india kerala is flying on top there  matching united states in health but not in economy
  and here maharashtra with mumbai is
  now in india the big inequities are within the state rather than between the states and that is not a bad thing in itself if you have a lot inequity
 inequities can be more difficult in the long term to deal with than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center relatively close to where poor people are living
  out here  my friends at gapminder wanted me to show this because there is a new leader in washington who is really concerned about the health system and i can understand him  because 
 washington d c is so rich over there but they are not as healthy as kerala it 's quite interesting
  for kerala helping fix the health system in the united states 
 now here we have the whole world you have the legend down there  and when you see the two giant cats here  pushing forward you see that in between them and
 ahead of them is the whole emerging economies of the
  thomas friedman so correctly called the flat world you can see that in health and education a large part of the world population is putting forward  but in africa and other 
  parts as in rural guizhou in china there is still people with low health and very low economy  we have an enormous disparity in the world  but most of the world in the middle are 
  pushing forwards very fast now back to my projections when will it catch up i have to go back to very conventional graph
  will show income per person on this axis instead poor down here  rich up there  and then time here  from one thousand eight hundred and fifty eight i start the world  and we shall see what will happen with these countries 
 you see china under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the indian level here  whereas u k and united states is getting richer and richer and after second world war united states is richer than
 u k but independence is coming here  growth is starting economic reform  growth is faster  and with projection from imf you can see where you expect them to be in two thousand and fourteen 
 now the question is when will the catch up take place 
 look at look at the united states  can you see the bubble  
  but the financial bubbles that 's the dot com bubble this is the lehman brothers
 doorstep there
 you see it came down there  
 and it seems this is this is another rock coming down there you know 
 so they doesn 't seem to go this way these countries they seem to go in a more humble growth way you know and people interested in growth are turning their eyes towards asia  i can compare to japan this is japan coming up  you see
  see  japan did it like that we add japan to it 
 and there is no doubt that fast catch up can take place can you see here what japan did 
 japan did it like this until full catch up and then they follow with the other high income economies  
 but the real projections for those ones i would like to give it like this
  be worse can be better it
 's always difficult to predict especially about the future  now a historian tells me it 's even more difficult to predict about the past 
 i think i 'm in a in a difficult position here  inequalities in china and india i consider really the big obstacle
 because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity is what will create
 a domestic market what will avoid social instability  and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population 
 so social investments in health education and infrastructure  and electricity is really what is needed in india and china  
 you know the climate we have great international experts within india telling us that the climate is changing
 and actions has to be taken otherwise china and india would be the countries most to suffer from climate change  and i consider india and china the best partners in the world in a good global climate policy  
 but they ain 't going to pay for what others who have more money have largely created  and i can agree on that but what i 'm really worried about is war 
 will the former rich countries really
  accept a completely changed world economy  and a shift of power away from where it has been the last fifty to one hundred to one hundred and fifty years back to asia  
  and will asia be able to handle that new position of being in charge of being the most mighty and the governors of the world  
  and war can be avoided  get ready for a world in equity because this is what seems to be happening  and that vision that i got as a young student 
 that indians can be much better than swedes  is just about to happen  and it will happen precisely
