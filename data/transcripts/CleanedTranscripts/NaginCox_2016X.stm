  so many of you have probably seen the movie the martian 
 but for those of you who did not it 's a movie about an astronaut who is stranded on mars  and his efforts to stay alive until the earth can send a rescue mission to bring him back to earth
 gladly they do re establish communication
 with the character astronaut watney at some point so that he 's not as alone on mars until he can be rescued  
 so while you 're watching the movie or even if you haven 't when you think about mars you 're probably thinking about how far away it is
  what might not have occurred to you is what are the logistics really like of working on another planet of living on two planets when there are people on the earth and there are
 rovers or people on mars  so think about when you have friends families and 
  co workers in california on the west coast or in other parts of the world when you 're trying to
 communicate with them one of the things you probably first think about is wait 
 what time is it in california  will i wake them up is it ok to call 
 so even if you 're interacting with colleagues who are in europe you 're immediately thinking about what does it take
 to coordinate communication when people are far away  
 so we don 't have people on mars right now  but we do have rovers and actually right now on curiosity
 it is six ten in the morning so six ten in the morning on mars  
 we have four rovers on mars the united states has put four rovers on mars since the mid 1990s and i have been privileged enough to work on three of them so i am a spacecraft engineer a spacecraft operations engineer
  at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in los angeles california  
 and these rovers are our robotic emissaries  so they are our eyes and our ears  and they see the planet for 
  us until we can send people so we learn how to operate on other planets through these rovers so before we send people we send robots 
  difference on mars right now from the time that we 're at is because the martian day is longer than the earth day 
 our earth day is twenty four hours because that 's how long it takes the earth to rotate how long it takes to go around once  so our day is twenty four hours 
 it takes mars
  hours and approximately forty minutes to rotate once  so that means that the martian day is forty minutes longer
 than the earth day  so teams of people who are operating the rovers on mars like this one what we are doing is we are
 living on earth but working on mars so we have to think as if we are actually on mars with the rover 
 our job the
  job of this team of which i 'm a part of is to send commands to the rover to tell it what to do the next day 
 to tell it to drive or drill or tell her whatever she 's supposed to do  
 so while she 's sleeping
 and the rover does sleep at night because she needs to recharge her batteries and she needs to weather the cold martian night and so she sleeps
  while she sleeps  we work on her program for the next day  so i work the martian night shift 
 so in order to come to work on the earth at the same time every day on mars like let 's say i need to be at work at five zero p m this team needs to be at work
  mars time every day then we have to come to work on the earth
 forty minutes later every day 
 in order to stay in sync with mars that 's like moving a time zone every day so one day you come in at eight zero 
 the next day forty minutes later at eight forty 
 the next day forty minutes later at
  the next day at ten zero so you keep moving forty minutes every day until soon you 're coming to work in the middle of the night
 the middle of the earth night  right so you can imagine how confusing that is hence  the mars watch 
  have been mechanically adjusted so that it runs more slowly 
 right and we didn 't start out i got this watch in two thousand and four when spirit and opportunity
 the rovers back then we didn 't start out thinking that we were going to need mars watches right we thought ok we 'll just have the time on our on our computers and on the mission control screens and that would be enough 
 yeah not so much because we weren 't just working on mars time we were actually living on mars time and we got just instantaneously confused about what time it was
  was  so you really needed something
 on your wrist to tell you what time is it on the earth what time is it on mars  
 and it wasn 't just the time on mars that was confusing we also needed to be able to talk to each other about it 
 so a
  a martian day again twenty four hours and forty minutes so when we 're talking about something that 's happening on the earth  we will say  today 
 so for mars we say tosol 
 laughter yesterday became 
 for mars  again we didn 't start out thinking oh let 's invent a language
  it was just very confusing i remember somebody walked up to me and said i would like to do this activity on the vehicle tomorrow on the rover and i said 
 tomorrow  tomorrow or mars  tomorrow we started this terminology because we needed a way to talk to
  some of you might say pop 
 so we have people who say nextersol or solorrow 
 and then something that i noticed after a few years of working on these missions was that the people who work on the rovers  we say tosol 
 the people who work on the landed missions that don 't rove around they say tosoul
  i could actually tell what mission you worked on from your martian accent 
 so we have the watches and the language and you you 're detecting a theme here right so that we don 't get confused 
 but even the earth daylight could confuse us if you think that right now you 've come to work and it 's the middle of the martian night and there 's light streaming in from the windows that 's going to be confusing as well
  so you can see from this image of the control room that all of the blinds are down so that there 's no light to distract us the blinds went down all over the building 
 about a week before landing and they didn 't go up until we went off mars time 
  all over the windows and and
 dark curtains and shades because it also affects your families and so here i was living in kind of this darkened environment  but so was he and he
 'd gotten used to it but then i would get these plaintive emails from him when he was at work should i come
  are you awake  what time is it on mars  and i decided ok so he needs a mars watch 
 but of course it 's two thousand and sixteen so there 's an app for that so now
 instead of the watches we can also use our phones  but the impact on families was
 was just across the board it wasn 't just those of us who were working on the rovers but our families as well
  well this is david oh one of our flight directors and he 's at the beach in los angeles with his family at one zero in the morning 
 so because we landed in august and his kids didn 't have to go back to school until september they actually went on to mars time with him for one month 
 they got up forty minutes later
  every day  
 and they were on dad 's work schedule so they lived on mars time for a month and had these great adventures like going bowling in the middle of the night or going to the beach  
 and one of the things that we all discovered
 is you can get anywhere in los angeles at three zero in the morning when there 's no traffic 
 so we would get off work and
 we didn 't want to go home and bother our families and we were hungry so instead of going
 locally to eat something we 'd go wait 
 there 's this great all night deli in long beach  and we can get there in ten minutes so we would drive down it was like the 60s no traffic we would drive down there and the restaurant owners would go who are you people 
 and why are you at my restaurant at three
  morning so they came to realize that there were these packs of martians  
 roaming the la freeways in the middle of the night
 in the middle of the earth night and we did actually start calling ourselves martians 
 so those of us who were on mars time would refer to ourselves as martians
 and everyone else as earthlings
  have people on mars
