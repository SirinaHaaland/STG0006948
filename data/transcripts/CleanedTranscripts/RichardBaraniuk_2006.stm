  i 'm rich baraniuk and what i 'd like to talk a little bit about today are some ideas that i think have just tremendous resonance with all the things that have been talked about the last two 
  days so many different points of resonance that it 's going to be difficult to bring them all up but i 'll try to do my best 
 ok  so these are
 lp records and they 've been replaced right they 've been swept away over the last two decades by these types of world flattening digitization technologies  right and i think it was best
 witnessed when thomas was playing the music as we came in the room today  what 's happened in the music world is there 's a culture or an ecosystem
  that 's been created that if you take some words from apple  the catchphrase that we create 
 rip  mix and burn what i mean by that is that anyone in the world is free and allowed to create new music and musical ideas anyone in the world is allowed to rip or copy musical 
  ideas use them in innovative ways  anyone is allowed to mix them in different types of ways draw connections between musical ideas  and people can burn them or create
  final products and and continue the circle  and what that 's done is it 's created like i said a vibrant community that 's very inclusive with people continually working to connect
 musical ideas  innovate them and keep things constantly up to date today 's hit single is not last year 's hit single  but i 'm not here to talk about music
  'm here to talk about books in particular textbooks and the kind of educational materials that we use every day
 in school has anyone here ever been to school ok does anybody
 realize there 's a crisis in our schools  around the world   i
 'm not going to spend too much time on that but what i want to talk about is some of the disconnects that that appear when an author publishes a book
  in fact the publishing process just because of the fact that it 's complicated it 's heavy books are expensive creates a sort of a wall between authors of books and the ultimate users of books be they teachers students
 or or just general readers and this is even more true if you happen to speak a language other than one of the world 's major languages and especially english  i 'm going to call these people below the barrier shutouts because they 're
  really shut out of the process of being able to share their knowledge with the world  and so what i want to talk about today is trying to take these ideas  that we 've seen in the musical culture and try to bring these towards 
  reinventing the way we think about writing books using them and teaching from them so that 's what i 'd like to talk about and really how we get from where we are now to to 
  where we need to go the first thing i 'd like you to do is a little thought experiment imagine taking all the world 's books ok everybody imagine books and imagine just tearing out the pages so
 liberating these pages and imagine digitizing them and then storing them in a vast interconnected global repository think of it as a massive itunes for for book type content
  and then take that material and imagine making it all open so that people can modify it play with it improve it  imagine making it free so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge and imagine
  using information technology so that you can
 update this content improve it play with it on a timescale that 's more on the order of seconds instead of years   instead of editions of a book coming out every two years 
  imagine them coming out every twenty five seconds so imagine we could do that and imagine we could put people into this  
 so that we could truly build an ecosystem with not just authors but all the people who could be or want to be authors in all the different languages of the world and i think if you could do this it would 
  be called  i 'm just going to refer to it as a knowledge ecosystem so really this is the dream
  so this is the dream in fact this dream is actually being realized over the last six and a half years  
 we 've been working really hard at rice university on a project called connexions and so what i 'd like to do for the rest of the talk is just tell you a little bit about what people are doing with connexions  which you 
  can kind of think of as the counterpoint to nicholas negroponte 's talk yesterday where they 're working on the the hardware of bringing education to the world
 open source tools
 and the content so that 's sort of to put it in perspective here
  so  create what are some of the people that are that are using these kind of tools well the first thing is there 's a
 community of engineering professors from cambridge to kyoto who are developing engineering content in in electrical engineering to develop what you can think of as a massive super textbook
  the entire area of electrical engineering and not only that it can be customized for use in each of their own individual institutions
 if people like kitty jones  a 
 private music teacher and mom from champagne  illinois  who wanted to share her fantastic music content with the world on how to teach kids how to play music
 her material is now used over
  hundred thousand times per month
  tremendous use in fact a lot of this use coming from united states k 12 schools because
 anyone who 's involved in a school scale back the first thing that 's cut is the music curriculum  and so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open free
  a lot of teachers are using this stuff  what about ripping what about copying reusing  a
 team of volunteers at the university of texas at el paso graduate students translating this engineering super textbook ideas  and within about a week  having 
  this be some of our most popular material in widespread use all over latin america and in particular in mexico because of the open extensible nature of this people volunteers and even companies that are translating materials
  into asian languages like chinese japanese and thai to spread the
 knowledge even further ok
 what about people who are mixing what does mixing mean mixing means building customized courses means building customized books   
 companies like national instruments who are
 embedding very powerful interactive simulations into the materials so that we can go way
  beyond our regular kind of textbook to an experience that that all the teaching materials are things you can actually interact with and play around with and actually learn as you do 
 we 've been working with teachers without borders who are very interested in mixing our materials 
 they 're going to be using connexions as their their platform to develop and deliver
 teaching materials for teaching teachers how to teach
  countries around the world  twb is currently in iraq training twenty thousand teachers supported by 
 to them this idea of being able to remix and customize to the local context is extraordinarily important  because just providing free content to people has actually been likened by people in the developing world to a kind of cultural imperialism
  that if you don 't empower people with the ability to 
  the material translate it into their own language and take ownership of it it 's not good  ok  other organizations we 've been working with 
 people know about uc merced it 's a new university in california in the central valley working very
 closely with community colleges they 're actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world
 in our system and they 're also trying to develop all of their software tools completely open source we 've been working with amd  which has a project called 
 which is trying to bring internet connectivity connectivity to fifty percent of the world 's population by two thousand and fifteen we 're going to be providing content to them in a whole range of different languages
  we 've also been working with a number of other organizations in particular 
 a bunch of the projects that are funded by hewlett foundation who have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content ok burn i think this is sort of  
 quite interesting burn is the idea of trying to create the physical instantiation of one of these
  and i think a lot of you received i think all of you received one of these music books in your
 gift pack a little present for you just
 to tell you quickly about it this is an engineering textbook it 's about three hundred pages long hardbound this costs
 anybody guess how much would it cost in a bookstore
 why does it cost twenty two dollars because it 's published on demand and it 's developed from this repository of open materials  if this book were to be published by a regular publisher  it would cost 
  at least one hundred one hundred and twenty two dollars   so what we 're seeing is moving this burning or publication process from the regular sort of
  customized to each individual class and published on demand very inexpensively either pushed out through amazon or published directly through
 an on demand press like qoop
 and i think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous
 area under this long tail in
  the harry potter end right at the left side we 're talking about
 books on hypergeometric partial differential equations books that might sell one hundred copies a year one thousand copies a year there is tremendous sustaining revenue
 under this long tail to sustain open projects like ours  but also to sustain this new emergence of of on demand publishers like
  who produced these two books and i think one of the things that you you should take away from this talk is that there 's an impending
  disintermediation that 's going to be happening in the publishing industry and it 's going to reach a crescendo over the next few years and i think that it 's for our benefit really and for the world 's benefit  
 ok  so what are the enablers what 's really making all of this happen there 's tons of technology
 and the only piece of technology that i really want to talk about is xml how many people know about xml oh
  so it 's the future of the web right it 's semantic
 representation of content  and what you can really think of xml in this case is it 's the packaging that we 're putting around these pages remember we took the book tore the pages out well what the xml is going to do is 
 it 's going to turn those pages into lego
  xml are the nubs on the lego that allow us to combine the content together in a myriad different ways and it provides us a a framework to to share content so 
  it lets you take this ecosystem  in its primordial state of all this content all the pages you 've torn out of books and create highly sophisticated learning machines books courses course packs  
  gives you the ability to personalize the learning experience to each individual student  so that every student can have a book or a course that 's that 's customized to their learning style 
 their context their language and the things that excite them  it lets you reuse the same materials in multiple different ways and surprising new ways  it lets you interconnect ideas  indicating how fields
  years ago because i teach the stuff in the red box and my day job  as chris said i 'm an electrical engineering professor i teach signal processing and my challenge was to 
  show that this math wow about half of you have already fallen fallen asleep just looking at the equation 
  that links technology that links really cool applications like like music synthesizers to
 tremendous economic opportunities but also governed by intellectual property  and the thing that i realized is there was no way that i as an engineer could write this book that would get all of this across we needed a community to do it and we needed
 new tools to be able to to interconnect these ideas
  and i think that really in a sense what we 're trying to do is make minsky 's dream come to a reality where you can imagine all the books in a library actually starting to talk to each other  and
  people who are teachers out here whoever taught you know this it 's the interconnections between ideas that that teaching is really all about 
 one of your new e texts is something that you 're going to be able to explore and experiment with
  so imagine your kid 's algebra textbook in seventh grade you can click on every single equation and bring up a little tool to be able to experiment with it  tinker with it  understand 
  it  because we really don 't understand until we do  the same type of mark up like mathml for chemistry imagine chemistry textbooks that actually understand the structure of how molecules are formed imagine music xml
 that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music play with it  understand it it 's no wonder that everybody 's getting into it right
  even the three wise men 
 ok  the second big enabler and this is where i told a big lie  the second big enabler is intellectual property  
  i got up here and i talked about how great the music culture is we can share and rip mix and burn but in fact that 's all illegal   and we would be accused of [ piracy ] for doing
 that  because this music has been propertized it 's now owned  much of it by big
  framework that makes sharing safe
 and makes it easily understandable and the inspiration here is taken from open source software things like linux
 and the gpl  the creative commons licenses how many people have heard of creative commons if you have not you must learn about it
  at the bottom of every piece of material in in connexions and in lots of other projects you can find their their logo  clicking on that logo takes you to an absolute
  document a deed that tells you exactly what you can do with this content in fact you 're free to share it to do all of these things to copy it to change it  even to make commercial use of it as long as you
  in academic publishing and much of educational publishing it 's really this idea of
 sharing knowledge and making impact that 's why people write not necessarily making bucks
  out there licensed with a creative commons license 
 not just text  but music images video  and there 's actually a tremendous uptake of the number of people that are actually licensing music
 to make it free for people who do this whole idea of of re sampling ripping mixing burning and sharing ok i 'd like
  with just
 the last few points so we 've built this idea of a commons people are are using it we get
 over five hundred thousand unique visitors per month just to our particular site
 mit opencourseware
  which is another large open content site gets a similar number of of hits but how do we protect this how do we protect it into the future and the first thing that people are probably thinking is quality control right because we 're saying that anybody can
  contribute things to this commons  anybody
 can contribute anything so that could be a problem   it didn 't take long until people started contributing materials for example on lingerie 
  which is actually a pretty good module the only problem is it 's plagiarized from a major french
  points to a
  website so this is
 a little bit of a problem so we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control and this is really where the idea of review and peer review comes in
 you come to ted why do you come to ted  
 because chris and his team have ensured that things are very very high quality
  and so we need to be able to do the same thing and we need to be able to design structures  and what we 're doing is designing social software
 to enable anyone to build their own peer review process and we call these things lenses and basically what they allow is anyone out there can develop their own peer review process  so that they can
 focus on the content in the repository that they think is is really important and you can think of ted as a potential lens
  saying you can really view this as as a call to action   connexions and open content is all about
 sharing knowledge all of you here are tremendously
 imbued with with tremendous amounts of knowledge and what i 'd like to do is invite each and every one of you to contribute to this project and and other projects of its type because i think together we can truly change the the landscape of education and educational publishing
