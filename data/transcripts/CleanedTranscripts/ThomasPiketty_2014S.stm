  very nice to be here tonight so i 've been working on the history of income and wealth distribution for the past fifteen years and one of the interesting lessons
  historical evidence is indeed that in the long run there is a tendency for the rate of return of capital to exceed
 the economy 's growth rate  
 and this tends to lead to high concentration of wealth  not infinite concentration of wealth but the higher the gap between r and g  the higher the level of inequality 
  of wealth towards which society tends to converge  so this is a key force that i 'm going to
  that this is not the only important force in the dynamics of income and wealth distribution  and there are many other forces that play an important role
 in the long run dynamics of income and wealth distribution also there is a lot of data that still needs to be collected we know a little bit more
 today than we used to know but we still know too little and certainly there are many different processes economic social
  that need to be studied more and so i 'm going to focus today on this simple
 force but
 that doesn 't mean that other important forces do not exist so most of the data i 'm going to present comes from this database that 's available online the world top incomes database 
  so this is the largest existing historical database on inequality  and this comes from the effort of over thirty scholars from several dozen countries
  so let me show you a couple of
 facts coming from this database and then we 'll return to r bigger than g  so fact number one is that there has been a big reversal in the ordering of income inequality between 
  the united states and europe over the past century  so back in one thousand nine hundred one thousand nine hundred and ten income inequality was actually
  be very clear  the main explanation for this is not r bigger than g it has more to do with changing supply and demand for skill  the race between education and 
  technology  globalization probably more unequal access to skills in the u s where you have very good very top universities but where the bottom part of the educational system is not as good so very unequal access to skills  
  unprecedented rise of top managerial compensation of the united states which is difficult to account for just on the basis of education so there is more going on here but i 'm not going to talk too much about this today because i want to focus on wealth inequality  
 let me just show you a very simple indicator about the income inequality part  so this is the share of total income going to the top ten percent  so you can see that one
  century ago
  it was between forty five and fifty percent in europe and a little bit above forty percent in the u s so there was more inequality in europe then there was a sharp decline
 during the first half of the 20th century and in the recent decade you can see that the u s has become more unequal than europe and this is
 the first fact i just talked about now the second fact
 is more about
  wealth inequality  and here the central fact is that wealth inequality is always a lot higher than income inequality  and also that
 wealth inequality although it has also increased in recent decades is still less extreme today than what it was a century ago  although the total quantity of wealth 
 relative to income has now recovered from the very large shocks caused by world war i the great depression world war
  so let me show you two graphs illustrating
 fact number two and fact number three so first if you look at the level of wealth inequality  this is
 the share of total wealth going to the top ten percent of wealth holders  so you can see the same kind of reversal between the u s and europe that we had before for income inequality  so wealth
 concentration was
 in europe than in the u s a century ago and now it is the opposite  
 but you can also show two things first  the general level of wealth inequality is always higher than income inequality  so remember for income inequality
 the share going to the top ten percent was between thirty and
  share is always between sixty and ninety percent okay so that 's fact number one and that 's very important for what follows wealth concentration is always a lot higher than income concentration 
 fact number two
 is that the rise in in wealth inequality in recent decades is still not enough to get us back to one thousand nine hundred and ten so the
  seventy percent of total wealth for the top ten  but the good news is that it 's actually better than one century ago  where you had ninety percent in europe going to the top ten so 
  today what you have is what i call the middle forty percent the people who are not in the top ten and who are not in the bottom fifty 
  twenty to thirty percent of total wealth national wealth  whereas they used
 to be poor a century ago when there was basically no wealth middle class so this is an important change and
 it 's interesting to see that wealth inequality
 has not fully recovered to 
 although the total quantity of wealth  has recovered okay so this is the total value
 of wealth relative to income and you can see that in particular in europe we are almost
  back to  the pre world war i level  so there are really two different
 parts of the story here  one has to do with the total quantity of wealth that we accumulate and there is nothing bad per se of course in accumulating a lot of wealth 
 and in particular if it is
 more diffuse and less concentrated  so what we really want to
  evolution of wealth inequality  and what 's going to happen in the future  
 how can we account for the fact that until world war i wealth inequality was so high and if anything was rising to even higher levels  and
 how can we think about the future  so let me come to some of the
 explanations and speculations about the future  let me first say that probably the best model to explain why wealth is so much
  more concentrated than income is a dynamic  dynastic model where individuals have a long horizon and accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons if people were accumulating wealth only for life cycle reasons  
 you know to be able to consume when they are old  
 then the level of wealth inequality should be more or less in line with the level of income inequality
  it will be very difficult to to explain why you have so much more wealth inequality than income inequality with a pure life cycle model so you need
 a story where people also care
 about wealth accumulation for other reasons so typically they want to transmit wealth to the next generation to their children or sometimes they want to accumulate wealth
  because of the prestige the power that goes with wealth so there must be other reasons for accumulating wealth than just life cycle to explain what we see in the data now
  in a large class of dynamic models of wealth accumulation with such dynastic motive for accumulating wealth 
 you will have all sorts of random  multiplicative shocks so for instance some families have a very large number of
  so the wealth will be divided some families have fewer children  you also have shocks to rates of return some families make huge capital gains some made
 bad investments so you will always have some mobility
 in the wealth process some people will move up some people will move down the important point is that in any such model for a given
 variance of such shocks the equilibrium level of wealth inequality will be a steeply rising
 function of r minus g
  reason why the difference between the rate of return to wealth and the growth rate is important
 is that initial wealth inequalities will be amplified at a faster pace with a bigger r minus g  so take a simple example  with r equals five percent 
  and g equals one percent wealth holders only need to reinvest one fifth of their capital income to ensure that their wealth rises as fast as the size
  so this makes it easier to build and perpetuate large fortunes because you can consume four fifths  assuming zero tax and you can just reinvest one fifth so of course some families
  will consume more than that some will consume less so there will be some mobility in the distribution but on average they only need to reinvest one fifth  so this allows
  you should not be surprised by the statement that r can be bigger than g forever because in fact this is what happened during most of the history of mankind  and this was in a way very obvious to everybody
 for a simple reason which is that growth was close to zero percent
 during most of the history of mankind growth was maybe zero point one zero point two zero point three percent but very slow growth of population and output per capita  whereas the rate of return
 on capital of course was not zero percent it was for land assets which was the traditional form of
 assets in preindustrial societies it was typically five percent 
  any reader of jane austen would know that if you want an annual income of one thousand pounds  you should have a capital value of twenty thousand
  r bigger than g was what allowed
 holders of wealth and assets
 to live off their capital income and to do something else something else in life than just to care about their own survival 
 now  one important conclusion
  of my historical research is that modern industrial growth
 did not change this basic fact as much as one might have expected 
 of course the growth rate following the industrial revolution rose 
 typically from zero to one to two percent but at the same time the rate of return to capital also rose so that the gap between the two
 did not really change  so during the 20th century
  you had a very unique combination of events first a
 very low rate of return due to the one thousand nine hundred and fourteen and one thousand nine hundred and forty five war shocks  destruction of wealth  inflation  bankruptcy during the great depression and all of this reduced the private rate of return to wealth to unusually low levels
 between one thousand nine hundred and fourteen and one thousand nine hundred and forty five and then in the postwar period  you had unusually high growth rate  partly
  due to the reconstruction  you know in germany in france in japan you had five percent growth rate between 
  and fifty and one thousand nine hundred and eighty largely due to reconstruction  and also due to very large demographic growth  the baby boom cohort effect  now  apparently that 's not going to last for very long or at least the population growth
 is supposed to decline in the future and the best projections we have
  growth is going to be closer to one to two percent rather than four to five percent so if you look at this these
 are the best estimates we have of world gdp growth and rate of return on capital average rates of return on capital so you can see that during most of the history of mankind 
 the growth rate was very small much lower than the rate of return  and then during the 20th century  it is really the population growth very high in the postwar period  and the
  process that brought growth to a smaller gap with the rate of return 
 here i use the united nations population projections
  so of course they are uncertain it could be that we all start having a lot of children in the future and 
 the growth rates are going to be higher but from now on these are the best
 projections we have and this will make global growth decline and
 gap
 between
 the rate of return go up now  the other
 unusual
 event during the 20th century was as i said  destruction 
 taxation of capital so this is the pre tax
 rate of return this is the after tax rate of return  and after destruction  and this is what brought
 the average rate of return after tax after destruction  below the growth
  rate during a long time period  but without the destruction  without the taxation  this would not have happened  so let me say that the balance between returns on capital 
 and growth depends on many different factors that are very difficult to predict  technology and the development of
  estate sector housing the energy sector  but it could be in the future  that we have a lot more robots in a number of sectors and that  this would be a bigger share of the 
  total capital stock that it is today well we are very far from this and from now what 's going on in the real estate sector the energy sector is much more important for the total capital stock and capital
  important issue is that there are scale effects in portfolio management together with financial complexity financial deregulation that make it easier to get higher rates of return for a large 
  portfolio  and this seems to be particularly strong for billionaires large capital endowments 
 up at six seven percent per year in real terms above inflation  whereas average income in the world average wealth in the world have increased at only two percent per year  
 and you find the same for large university endowments the bigger the initial endowments  the bigger the rate of return  now  what
 could be done
 the first thing is that i think we need more financial transparency  we know too little about
 global wealth dynamics so we need international transmission of bank information we need a global registry of financial assets more coordination on wealth taxation  
 and even wealth tax with a small tax rate will be a way to produce information so that then we can adapt our policies
 to whatever we observe and to some extent the fight against
  tax havens and automatic transmission of information is pushing us in this direction now there are other ways to redistribute wealth  which
 it can be tempting to use inflation  it 's much easier to print money than to write a tax code so that 's very tempting but sometimes you don 't know what you do with the money this is a problem 
 expropriation is very tempting just when you feel some people get too wealthy you just expropriate them  but this is not
  a very efficient way to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics so
 war is an even less efficient way so i tend to prefer progressive taxation  but of course history 
 history will invent its own best ways and it will probably involve a combination of all of these
  it 's impressive how you 're in command of your data of course but basically what you suggest is
 growing wealth concentration is kind of a natural tendency of capitalism  and
 if we leave it to its own devices it may threaten the system itself so you 're suggesting that we need to act to implement policies that
 redistribute wealth including the ones
 saw progressive taxation etc in the current political context how realistic are those how likely do you think that it is that they will be implemented thomas piketty 
 well you know i think if you look  look back through time the history of of income wealth and taxation is full of surprise so i am not
 terribly impressed by those who know in advance what will or will not happen i think one century ago
  many people would have said that progressive income taxation would never happen and then it happened  and even five years ago  
 many people would have said that bank secrecy will be with us forever in switzerland that switzerland was too powerful for the rest of the world  and then suddenly it took a few u s sanctions
 against swiss banks for a big change to happen and now we are moving toward more financial transparency
 it 's not that difficult to better coordinate politically we are going to have a treaty
 with half of the world gdp around the table with the u s and the european union so if half of the world gdp is not enough to make progress on financial transparency and
 minimal tax for multinational
  so i think
 these are not technical difficulties i think we can we can make progress if we have a more pragmatic approach to these questions and we have the proper sanctions on those who benefit from financial opacity bg one of the arguments
 against your point of view is that economic inequality is not only a feature of capitalism but is actually one of its engines  so we
  take measures to lower inequality and at the same time we lower growth potentially what do you answer to that tp yeah i think
 inequality is not a problem per se i think inequality up to a point can actually be useful for innovation and growth the problem is it 's a question of degree 
 when inequality gets too extreme then it becomes useless for growth and it can even become bad because it tends to lead to high perpetuation of inequality over time and low
 and for instance  the kind of wealth concentrations that we had in the 19th century and pretty much until world war i in every european country
 was i think not useful for growth this
 was destroyed by a combination of tragic events and policy changes  and this did not prevent growth from happening  and also extreme inequality can be
 bad for our democratic institutions if it creates very
  unequal access to political voice and the influence of private money in
 u s politics i think is a matter of of concern right now  so we don 't want to return to that kind of extreme pre world war i inequality
 having a decent share of the national wealth for the middle class is not bad for growth
  actually useful both for equity and efficiency reasons bg i said at the beginning that
 your book has been criticized some of your data has been criticized some of your choice of data sets has been criticized  you have been accused of cherry picking data to make your case what do you answer to that tp well
 i answer that i am very happy that this book is stimulating debate this
 is part of what it is intended for look  the reason why i put all the data online with all of the detailed computation is so that
  we can have an open and transparent debate about this  so i have responded point by point to every concern 
 let me say that if i was to rewrite the book today  i would actually conclude that the rise in wealth inequality particularly in the united states has been actually higher than what i report in my book there is a recent study by saez
  with new data which i didn 't have at the time of the book that wealth 
  has risen even more than what i report  and there will be other data in the future  some of it will go in different directions  
 look we put online almost every week
 new updated series on the world top income database and we will keep doing so in the future in particular in emerging
 countries  and i welcome all of those who want to contribute to this data collection process in fact
 i certainly agree
 that there is not enough transparency about wealth dynamics and a good way to have better data would be to have a wealth tax with a small tax rate to begin with so that we can all
 agree about this important evolution and adapt our policies to whatever
 we observe so taxation  is a source of knowledge  and that 's what we need the most right now
