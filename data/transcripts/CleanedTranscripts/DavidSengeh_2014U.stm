  i was born
 and raised in sierra leone a small and very beautiful country in west africa a country rich both in physical resources
 and creative
  rebel war in the ' 90s when entire villages were burnt down 
 an estimated eight thousand men  women and children had their arms and legs amputated during this time  
 as my family and i ran for safety when i was about twelve from one of those attacks i resolved that i would do
  everything i could to ensure that my own children would not go through the same experiences we had they would in fact be part of a sierra leone where war
 and amputation were no longer a strategy for gaining power  
 as i watched people who i knew loved ones  recover from this devastation one thing that deeply troubled me
  was that many of the amputees in the country would not use their prostheses the reason i would come to find out 
 was that their prosthetic sockets were painful because they did not fit well 
 the prosthetic socket is the part in which the amputee inserts their residual limb 
 and which connects to the prosthetic ankle  even in the developed world  it takes a period of three weeks to often years for a patient to get a comfortable socket
  ever  prosthetists still use conventional processes like molding and casting to create 
 prosthetic sockets 
 such sockets often leave intolerable amounts of pressure on the limbs of the patient  leaving them with pressure sores and blisters
  does not matter how powerful your prosthetic ankle is 
 if your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable you will not use your leg  and that is just simply unacceptable in our age 
 so one day when i met professor hugh herr about two and a half years ago and he asked me if i knew how to solve this problem i said no not yet 
 but i would love to figure it out
  at the mit media lab i designed custom prosthetic sockets quickly
 and cheaply
 that are more comfortable than conventional prostheses  
 i used magnetic resonance imaging to capture the actual shape of the patient 's anatomy then use finite element modeling to better predict the internal stresses and strains on the normal forces 
 and then create a prosthetic socket
  manufacture  we use a 3d printer to create a 
  prosthetic socket
 which relieves pressure where needed on the anatomy of the patient in short we 're using data
 to make novel sockets quickly and cheaply in a recent trial we just wrapped up at the media lab
  one of our patients a u s veteran who has been an amputee for about twenty years
 and worn dozens of legs said of one of our
 printed parts it 's so soft  it 's like walking on pillows  and it 's effing sexy
  in our age should not prevent anyone from living meaningful lives 
 my hope and desire is that the tools and processes we develop in our research group can be used to bring highly functional prostheses to those who need them 
 for me 
 a place to begin
 healing the souls of those affected by war and disease
 is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces for their bodies  
 whether it 's in sierra leone or in boston i hope
 this not only restores but indeed transforms their sense of human potential  thank you very much
