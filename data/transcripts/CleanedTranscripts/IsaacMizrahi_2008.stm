 a thing about sleeping i don 't sleep that much and i 've come to this thing about like not sleeping much as being a great virtue after years of kind of battling it as being a terrible detriment or something and now i really like sort of sitting up  
 you know but for years i 've been sitting up
  and i think that  like  my creativity is greatly motivated by this this kind of insomnia i lie awake i think thoughts  i walk aimlessly sometimes i used to walk more at night 
 i walk during the day and i follow people who i think look interesting 
 and sometimes actually once it was on page six in the post that i was cruising this guy like sort of whatever
  but i was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on and so i was following this guy 
 and i took a picture of his shoes and we thanked each other and just went on our way but i do that all the time  as a matter of fact i think a lot of my design
 ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye  because i feel like  
  there are so many images out there so many clothes out there and the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken of course
  or very very surprising and often i 'm driving in a taxi and i see a hole in a shirt or something that looks
 very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that i 'd never seen happen before  
 and so i 'd make the car stop and i 'd get out of the car and walk and see that that in fact there wasn 't a hole
  but it was a trick of my eye it was a shadow  you know  
 or if there was a hole i 'd think like oh damn there was actually someone thought of that thought already someone made that mistake already so i can 't do it anymore  i don 't know where inspiration comes from it does not come
 for me from research  i don 't get necessarily inspired by
  of fact one of the most fun things i 've ever ever done in my whole life was this christmas season
 at the guggenheim
 in new york i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band from juilliard and i did like you know the narrator and i read it 
 and i saw this really smart critic who i love this woman joan acocella who 's a friend of mine and she came backstage and she said oh  you know isaac did you know that  
 talking about stalinism and talking about
 and a bird and you know he ate the bird and then in the end you hear you know you hear the bird squeaking or something you know 
 so i don 't really know that i don 't really actually i do my own kind of research  you know  if i 'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th century opera or something like that 
 i will do a lot of research  because it 's interesting not because it 's what i 'm supposed to do i 'm very very very inspired by movies
  color of movies and the way light makes the colors light from behind the projection or light from the projection makes the colors look so impossible
 and anyway roll this little clip i 'll just show you i
  sit up at night and i watch movies and i watch women in movies a lot and i think about you know  their roles and about how you have to like
  what your daughters look at 
 because i look at the way women are portrayed all the time whether they 're kind of glorified in this way  
 or whether they 're kind of you know  ironically glorified
  or whether they 're you know  sort of denigrated or ironically denigrated  i go back to color all the time color is something
 that motivates me
 a lot
  it 's rarely color that i find in nature 
 although  you know  juxtaposed next to artificial color natural color is
 so beautiful so that  's what i do i study color a lot  but for the most part i think
  how can i ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of natalie wood how can i ever make anything as beautiful as greta garbo i mean that 's just not possible  you know
  and so that 's what makes me lie awake at night i guess you know  
 i want to show you i 'm also like a big i
 go to astrologers and tarot card readers often  and that 's another thing that motivates me a lot people say
 that an astrologer tells me to do something so i do it when i was about
 an astrologer told me that i was going to meet the man of my dreams and that his name was going to be eric right  
 so you know  for years i would go to bars and sort of anyone i met whose name was eric i was
 humping immediately or something 
  i had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago the last card he pulled which was representing my destiny was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane and you know sort of spats and this  you know  a minstrel singer  right  i want to show you this clip because i do this kind of crazy
  the name of the show is
 based on this story that i have to tell you about my mother  it 's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers i was dating this guy  right  and
 this has to do with being happy i swear i was dating this guy
 and
 it was going on for about a year
 right  and we were getting serious so we decided to invite them all to dinner our parents and we you know sort of introduced them to each other my mother was sort of
  very sensitive to his mother who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing you know homosexuality right  so my mother was a little offended she turned to her and she said 
 are you kidding they have the greatest life together they eat out they see shows 
  they see shows 
 that 's the name of the show they eat out they that 's on my tombstone when i die 
 he ate out he saw shows right
   so  in editing these clips i didn 't have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing
 at joe 's pub so you 'll have to like go check it out and come see me or something because it 's mortifying and yet
 it feels
  feels  i don 't know how to put this i feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing  you know  and
 at least at least  you know in my case because if i just do one thing all the time
 say that i do everything well  
 i just say that i do a lot of things that 's all and i kind of try not to look back  
 you know  except i guess that 's what staying up every night is about like  looking back and thinking  what a fool you made of yourself you know  
 but i guess that 's okay  right  
 because
 if you do many things you get to feel lousy about everything and not just one
  one you know you don 't master feeling lousy about one thing yeah exactly
 i will show you this this next thing speaking of costumes for operas i do work with different choreographers  i work with twyla tharp a lot  
 and i work with mark morris a lot who is one of my best friends   and i designed
 three operas with him and the most recent one
  very ingrained in the dance world since i was a teenager i went to performing arts high school where i was an actor and many of my friends were ballet dancers again i don 't know where 
 inspiration comes from  i don 't know where it comes from i started making puppets when i was a kid  maybe that 's where the whole inspiration thing started from puppets
  and then
 performing arts high school  there i was in high school meeting dancers and acting and somehow from there 
 i got interested in design i went to parsons school of design
 and then i began my career as a designer  
 i don 't really think of myself as a designer i don 't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer and frankly i don 't really know what to call myself i think of myself
  know what i think of myself as it 's just that 
 but i must say this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time that is what i think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer  you always have to be slightly bored with everything 
 and if you 're not you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything 
 but i
 i am really a little bored with everything i always say to my partner marisa gardini who books everything she books everything and she makes everything happen and she makes all the deals 
 and i always tell her that i find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program 
 too much time on computer bridge  which is you know like that 's so
 so somehow like about ten years ago i thought that the most unboring
  place in the world would be like a t v studio like for a day show some kind of day talk show because it 's all of these
 things that i love all kind of in one place and if you ever get bored you can look at another thing and do another thing and talk about it right  
 and so i had this t v show and that was a very very very big part of my process actually could you roll the clip please this is one of my favorite clips of rosie
  all right so now where should i position myself i want to stay out of the way  i don 't want to be okay  
 here we go do you get nervous ashleigh ashleigh doing what rod cutting hair  a cutting hair never never i don 't think there was ever a day where i cut hair i was nervous im you look so cute already by the way rod you
  you read about all these people who have a lot of money and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow like  really messed up  you know what i mean and
 there 's got to be some way to do that rosie  because just just because if you 're fabulously rich and fabulously famous does that mean you shouldn 't have kids because you know they 're going to end up getting messed up rod no but it means that your priority has to be their
 well being first i think  but you have to make the decision for yourself my kids are seven who the hell knows they 're going to be like fourteen and in rehab and they 're going to be playing this clip
  so by the way of all the most unboring things in the world right  i mean like making someone who 's already cute look terrible like that 
 that is not boring that is
 nothing if it 's not boring actually i read this great quote the other day which was
  makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you 're going to die right 
 and then i realized that was on my website and then it said like you know the quote was attributed to me and i thought oh i said something you know in an interview i forgot that i said that but it 's really true
 i want to show you this last clip because it 's going to be my last
  tell you that i cook a lot also i love to cook  
 and i often look at things as though they 're food like i say oh you know would you serve a rotten chicken then how could you serve you know a beat up old dress or something how could you show a beat up old dress  i always relate things 
 to kitchen ry and so
 i think that that 's what it all boils down to everything boils down to that so check this out this is what i 've been doing because i think it 's the most fun thing in the world it 's like this website  it 's got a lot of
  different things on it it 's a polymathematical website we actually shoot segments like t v show segments and
 it 's kind of my favorite thing in the world and it just began like in the beginning of february so who knows and again i don 't say it 's good i just think it 's not boring
  stop laughing it 's not funny just because i don 't know that whole that there 's no such thing as whole buttermilk sorry what chef well here 's the deal
  is cream and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water the liquid is actually that clear liquid if you 've ever overbeaten your whipped cream it 's actually buttermilk 
 and that 's what it was in the early days  and that 's what people used for baking and all sorts of things now the
  the reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious
