  when i first heard this theme  
 i thought well embracing otherness is embracing myself  
 and the journey to that place of understanding and acceptance has been an interesting one for me  and it 's given me
 an insight into the whole notion of self  which i think is worth sharing with you today  
 we each have a self  but i don 't think that we 're born with one 
 you know how newborn babies believe they 're part of everything they 're not separate  
 well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly it 's like that initial stage is
  over oneness  infancy  unformed primitive it 's no longer valid or real 
 what is real is separateness  and at some point in early babyhood 
 the idea of self starts to form our little portion of oneness is given a name is told all kinds of things about itself 
 and these details
  become facts  
 which go towards building ourselves our identity 
 and that self becomes the vehicle for navigating our social world  but the self is a projection
 based on other people 's projections is it who we really are or who we really want to be or should be 
 so this whole interaction
 with self and identity was a very difficult one for me growing up the self that i attempted to take out into the world was rejected over and over again  
 and my panic
 at not having a self that fit  and the confusion that came from my self being rejected created anxiety
  and hopelessness which
 kind of defined me for a long time 
 but in retrospect the destruction of my self was so repetitive that i started to see a pattern 
 the self changed  
 got affected  broken destroyed  but another one would evolve
 sometimes stronger  sometimes
  sometimes not wanting to be there at all the self was not constant  
 and how many times would my self have to die
 before i realized that it was never alive in the first place 
 i grew up on the coast of england in the ' 70s my dad is white from cornwall  and my mom is black
  even the idea of us as a family was challenging to most people but nature had its wicked way and brown babies were born  
 but from about the age of five  i was aware that i didn 't fit  
 i was the black atheist kid in the all white catholic school run by nuns i was an anomaly  
  was rooting around for definition and trying to to plug in 
 because the self likes to fit 
 to see itself replicated to belong 
 that confirms its existence and its importance  and it is important it has an extremely important function  without it we literally can 't interface with others  
 we can 't hatch plans
 and climb that stairway of popularity of success
  but my skin color wasn 't right  my hair wasn 't right my history wasn 't right my self
 became defined by otherness  which meant that in that social world i didn 't really exist  
 and i was other before being anything else even before being a girl  i was a noticeable nobody
 another world was opening up
 around this time performance and dancing 
 that nagging dread of self hood didn 't exist when i was dancing  i 'd literally lose myself  
 and i was a really good dancer  i would put all my emotional expression into my
  dancing  i could be in the movement
 in a way that i wasn 't able to be in my real life in myself 
 and at sixteen  i stumbled across another opportunity and i earned my first acting role in a film  
 i can hardly find the words to describe the peace i felt
 when i was acting
  my dysfunctional self could actually plug in to another self not my own  and it felt so good 
 it was the first time that i existed inside a 
 self
 one that i controlled that i steered that i gave life to 
 but the shooting day would end and
  i 'd return to my gnarly  awkward self  
 by nineteen  
 i was a fully fledged movie actor  but still searching for definition 
 i applied to read anthropology at university 
 dr phyllis lee
 gave me my interview  and
  i thought i had the answer to that one  and i said skin color so biology genetics she said 
 because thandie that 's not accurate because there 's actually more genetic difference between a black kenyan and a black ugandan
 than there is between a black kenyan and say a white
  because we all stem from africa so in africa there 's been more time to create genetic diversity 
 in other words race has no basis in biological or scientific fact 
 on the one hand result right  
 on the other hand my definition of self just lost a huge chunk of its credibility  but what was credible what is
  biological and scientific fact is that we all stem from africa
 in fact from a woman called mitochondrial eve who lived one hundred and sixty thousand years ago  
 and race is an illegitimate concept which our selves have created based on fear and ignorance  
  that feeling of otherness 
 my desire to disappear was still very powerful  i had a degree from cambridge 
 i had a thriving career  but my self was a car crash  
 and i wound up with bulimia and on a therapist 's couch and of course i did  
 i still believed my self was all i was  i still
  valued self worth above all other worth  
 and what was there to suggest otherwise  we 've created entire value systems and a physical reality to support the worth of self  
 look at the industry for 
  the jobs it creates  the revenue it turns over we 'd be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing  but it 's not
  's a projection which our clever brains create in order to cheat ourselves from the reality of death 
 but there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection
 and that thing is oneness our essence
  the self 's struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it 's connected to its creator
 to you and to me and that can happen with awareness
 awareness of the reality of oneness and the projection of self hood 
 for a start we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves
  it happens when i dance when i 'm acting i 'm earthed in my essence  and my self is suspended 
 in those moments i 'm connected
 to everything
 the ground  the air  the sounds the energy from the audience all my senses are alert and alive
 in much the same way as an infant might feel that feeling of oneness and when i 'm acting a
  role  i inhabit another self and i give it life for awhile  because when the self is suspended
 so is divisiveness
 and judgment  and i 've played everything from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery to secretary of state in two thousand and four  
 and no matter how other
 these selves might be
  related
 in me  and i honestly believe
 the key to my success as an actor and my progress as a person has been the very lack of self
 that used to make me feel so anxious and insecure  i always wondered why i could feel others
  i could recognize the somebody in the nobody  
 it 's because i didn 't have a self to get in the way  
 i thought i lacked substance  and the fact that i could feel others ' meant that i had nothing of myself to feel 
 the thing that was a source of shame
 was actually a source of enlightenment  and when i realized and really understood that
  my self is a projection and that it has a function a funny thing happened i stopped giving it so much authority 
 i give it its due  i take it to therapy  i 've become
 very familiar with its dysfunctional behavior  but i 'm not ashamed of my self in fact  i respect my self and its
  and over time
 and with practice  i 've tried to live
 more and more from my essence  and if you can do that incredible things happen 
 i was in congo in february dancing and celebrating with women who 've
 survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways
 destroyed because other brutalized psychopathic selves all over that
  beautiful land
 are fueling our selves ' addiction to ipods  pads and bling  
 which further disconnect ourselves from ever feeling their pain their suffering  their death because hey  
 if we 're all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life
  then we 're devaluing and desensitizing life 
 and in that disconnected state yeah  we can build factory farms with no windows  destroy marine life
 and use rape as a weapon of war 
 so here 's a note to self 
 the cracks have started to show in our constructed world 
 and oceans will continue to surge through the cracks and
 oil and blood  rivers of it crucially we haven 't been figuring out how to live in oneness
 with the earth and every other living thing  
 we 've just been insanely trying to figure out how to live with each other billions of each other only we 're not living with each
  our crazy selves are living with each other and perpetuating an epidemic of disconnection  
 let 's live with each other
 and take it a breath at a time if we can get under that heavy self  
 light a torch of awareness and find our essence  our connection to the infinite and every other living thing  
 we knew it from the day we were born
  let 's not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness it 's more a reality than the ones our selves have created 
 imagine what kind of existence we can have
 if we honor inevitable death of self  appreciate the privilege of life
 and marvel at what comes next
  awareness is where it begins  thank you for listening
