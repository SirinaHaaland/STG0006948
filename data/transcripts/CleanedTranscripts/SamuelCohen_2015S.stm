  hundred and one a woman called auguste was taken to a medical asylum in frankfurt 
 auguste was delusional and couldn 't remember even the most basic details of her life 
 her doctor was called alois 
 alois didn 't know how to help auguste
  but he watched over her until sadly she passed away in one thousand nine hundred and six 
 after she died alois performed an autopsy and found strange plaques and tangles in auguste 's brain the likes of which he 'd never seen before 
 now here 's the even more striking thing  
 if auguste had instead been alive today we could offer her no more help than alois was able to one hundred and fourteen years ago
 alois was dr alois alzheimer and auguste deter
 was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call alzheimer 's disease  since one thousand nine hundred and one medicine has advanced greatly  
 we 've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections many treatments for cancer  antiretrovirals for hiv statins for heart
  disease and much more  but
 we 've made essentially no progress at all in treating alzheimer 's disease  
 i 'm part of a team of scientists who has been working to find a cure for alzheimer 's for over a decade  so i think about this all the time 
 alzheimer 's now affects forty
  it will affect one hundred and fifty million people
 which by the way will include many of you 
 if you 're hoping to live to be eighty five or older  
 your chance of getting alzheimer 's will be almost one in two 
 in other words  
  'll spend your golden years either suffering from alzheimer 's or
 helping to look after a friend or loved one with alzheimer 's  
 already in the united states alone alzheimer 's care costs two hundred billion dollars every year 
 one out of every five medicare dollars get spent on alzheimer 's 
 it is today the most expensive disease and costs are projected to increase fivefold by two thousand and fifty as the baby boomer generation ages
 it may surprise you
 that put simply alzheimer 's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation  
 but we 've done relatively little to address it  
 today of the top ten causes of death worldwide  alzheimer 's is the only one
 we cannot prevent cure or even slow down we
  understand less about the science of alzheimer 's than other diseases
 because we 've invested less time and money into researching it 
 the us government spends ten times more every year on cancer research than on alzheimer 's despite the fact that alzheimer 's costs us more
 and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer the lack of resources
 stems from a more fundamental cause a lack of awareness 
 because here 's what few people know but everyone should 
 alzheimer 's is a disease and we can cure it 
 for most of the past one hundred and fourteen years everyone including scientists
  mistakenly confused alzheimer 's with aging  we thought that becoming senile was a normal and inevitable part of getting old  
 but we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an alzheimer 's patient
 to see the real physical damage caused by this disease  
 as well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities the damage to the brain caused by alzheimer 's significantly reduces life expectancy
 and is always fatal remember
 alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles in auguste 's brain a century ago  for almost a century we didn 't know much about these 
 today we know they 're made from protein molecules 
 you can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami  
 there are spots on the
 paper that are sticky 
 and when it folds correctly these sticky bits end up on the inside but sometimes things go wrong  
 and some sticky bits are on the outside 
 this causes the protein molecules to stick to each other forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles 
 that 's what we see in the brains of alzheimer 's patients 
 we 've spent the past ten years at the university of cambridge trying to understand how this malfunction works  
 there are many steps
 and identifying which step to try to block is complex
 like defusing a bomb  cutting one wire might do nothing  cutting others might make the bomb explore 
 we have to find the right step to block and then create a drug that does it  until recently  we for the most part have been cutting wires and hoping for the best
  but now we 've got together a diverse group of people
 medics biologists geneticists  chemists physicists  engineers and mathematicians  
 and together we 've managed to identify a critical step in the process
 and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease  
 now let me show you some of our latest results no one outside of our lab has seen these yet  
 let 's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms  so these
  are healthy worms  and you can see they 're moving around normally 
 these worms on the other hand have protein molecules sticking together inside them
 like humans with alzheimer 's  and you can see they 're clearly sick  but
 if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage then we see
  and they live a normal lifespan 
 this is just an initial positive result  
 but research like this shows us that alzheimer 's is a disease  that we can understand and we can cure after one hundred and fourteen years of waiting  
 there 's finally real hope for what can be achieved in the next ten or twenty years 
 but to grow that hope to finally beat alzheimer 's  we need help
  this isn 't about scientists like me it 's about you  we need you to raise awareness that alzheimer 's is a disease
 and that if we try we can beat it in the case of other diseases patients and their families have led the charge for more research
 and put pressure on governments the pharmaceutical industry scientists and regulators that was essential for advancing treatment for hiv in the late 
  we see that same drive to beat cancer  
 but alzheimer 's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves  
 and their families the hidden victims  caring for their loved ones night and day are often too worn out to go out and advocate for change  
 so 
 it really is down to you 
 alzheimer 's isn 't for the most part a genetic disease  everyone with a brain is at risk
 there are forty million patients like auguste who can 't create the change they need for themselves help speak up for them  
 and help demand a cure
