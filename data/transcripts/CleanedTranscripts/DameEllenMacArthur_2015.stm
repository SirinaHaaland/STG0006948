  when you 're a child  anything and everything is possible the challenge so often is hanging on to that as we grow up  
 and as a four year old i had the opportunity to sail for the first time  i will never forget
 the excitement
  as we closed the coast  i will never forget
 the feeling of adventure as i climbed on board the boat and stared into her tiny cabin for the first time  but the most amazing feeling
 was the feeling of freedom 
 the feeling that i felt when we hoisted her sails as a four year old child  it was the greatest sense of freedom that i could ever imagine 
 i made my mind up there and then that
  one day  somehow  i was going to sail around the world  
 so i did what i could in my life to get closer to that dream 
 age ten it was saving my school dinner money change every single day for eight years  i had mashed potato and baked beans which cost 4p each and gravy was free 
 every day i would pile up the change on the top of my money box  and when that pile reached a pound i would drop it in and
  off one of the one hundred squares i 'd drawn on a piece of paper  
 finally i bought a tiny dinghy  
 i spent hours sitting on it in the garden dreaming of my goal i read every book i could on sailing  
 and then eventually having been told by my school i wasn 't clever enough to be a vet  left school age seventeen
 to begin my apprenticeship in sailing so
  imagine how it felt just four years later
 to be sitting in a boardroom
 in front of someone who i knew could make that dream come true 
 i felt like my life depended on that moment  and incredibly he said yes  
 and i could barely contain my excitement as i sat in that first design meeting designing a boat on which i was going to sail solo nonstop around the world
  from that first meeting to the finish line of the race  it was everything i 'd ever imagined 
 just like in my dreams there were amazing parts and tough parts 
 we missed an iceberg by twenty feet  nine times i climbed to the top of her 90 foot mast we were blown on our side in the southern ocean but the sunsets  the wildlife and the remoteness
  after three months at sea age just twenty four i finished in second position 
 i 'd loved it so much so that within six months i decided to go around the world again  but this time not in a race 
 to try to be the fastest person ever to sail solo nonstop around the world  
 now for this i needed a different craft 
  more powerful 
 just to give that boat some scale i could climb inside her mast all the way to the top seventy five foot long  sixty foot wide 
 i affectionately called her moby  she was a multihull 
 when we built her no one had ever made it solo nonstop around the world in one though many had tried but whilst we built her a frenchman took a boat twenty five percent bigger than her
 and not only did he make it  but he took
  the record from ninety three days right down to seventy two 
 the bar was now much much higher  and these boats were exciting to sail this was a training sail off the french coast  
 this i know well because i was one of the five crew members on board five seconds
 is all it took from everything being fine to our world going black as the windows were thrust underwater and that five seconds goes quickly
 just see how far below those guys the sea is imagine that alone
 in the southern ocean plunged into icy water thousands of miles away from land  
 it was christmas day i was forging into the southern ocean underneath australia  the conditions were
  i was approaching a part in the ocean which was two thousand miles away from the nearest town 
 the nearest land was antarctica  and the nearest people would be those manning the european space station above me 
 you really are in the middle of nowhere  
 if you need help  and you 're still alive  it takes four days for a ship to get to you and then four days for that
  ship to get you back to port no helicopter can reach you out there and no plane can land  
 we are forging ahead of a huge storm  
 within it there was eighty knots of wind which was far too much wind for the boat and i to cope with the waves were already forty to fifty feet high  and the spray from the breaking crests was blown horizontally like snow in a blizzard 
 if we didn 't sail fast
  be engulfed by that storm and either capsized or smashed to pieces  
 we were quite literally hanging on for our lives and doing so on a knife edge  
 the speed i so desperately needed brought with it danger  
 we all know what it 's like driving a car twenty miles an hour thirty forty it 's not too stressful we can concentrate we can turn on the radio take that fifty
  accelerate through to eighty ninety one hundred miles an hour  now you have white knuckles and you 're gripping the steering wheel now take that car off road at night and remove the windscreen 
  wipers the windscreen the headlights and the brakes that 's what it 's like in the southern ocean 
 you could imagine it would be quite difficult to sleep in that situation  even as a passenger
  but you 're not a passenger  you 're alone on a boat you can barely stand up in 
 and you have to make every single decision on board  i was absolutely exhausted physically and mentally 
 eight sail changes in twelve hours the mainsail weighed three times my body weight  and after each change 
 i would collapse on the floor soaked with sweat with this freezing southern ocean air burning the back of my throat  
 but out there those lowest of the lows are so often contrasted with the highest of the highs a few
  days later we came out of the back of the low  against all odds we 'd been able to drive ahead of the record within that depression  
 the sky cleared  the rain stopped  and our heartbeat  
 the monstrous seas around us were transformed into the most beautiful moonlit mountains  it 's hard to explain  but you enter a different mode
 when you head out there
  boat is your entire world and what you take with you when you leave is all you have 
 if i said to you all now go off into vancouver and find everything you will need for your survival for the next three months that 's quite a task 
 that 's food fuel  clothes  even toilet roll and toothpaste 
 that 's what we do  and when we leave we manage it down to the last drop of diesel and the last packet of food 
  experience in my life
 could have given me a better understanding of the definition of the word finite what we have out there is all we have there is no more 
 and never in my life had i ever translated that definition of finite that i 'd felt on board to anything outside of sailing
 until i stepped off the boat at the finish line having broken that record
  suddenly i connected the dots our global economy is no different 
 it 's entirely dependent on finite materials we only have once in the history of humanity  
 and it was a bit like seeing something you weren 't expecting under a stone and having two choices  i either put that stone to one side
 and learn more about it or i put that stone back and i carry on with my dream job
 of sailing around the world  
 i chose the first 
 i put it to one side and i began a new journey of learning  speaking to chief executives  experts scientists economists to try to understand just how our global economy works 
 and my curiosity took me to some extraordinary places this photo was taken in the
  i was fascinated by coal fundamental to our global energy needs  but also very close to my family my 
 was a coal miner and he spent fifty years of his life underground  
 this is a photo of him  and when you see that photo you see someone from another era 
 no one wears trousers with a waistband quite that high in this day and age 
 but yet that 's me with my great grandfather and by the way
  are not his real ears 
 we were close  i remember sitting on his knee listening to his mining stories 
 he talked of the camaraderie underground  and the fact that the miners used to save the crusts of their sandwiches
 to give to the ponies they worked with underground  
 it was like it was yesterday  and on my journey of learning  i went to the world coal association website and there in the middle of the homepage it said
  have about one hundred and eighteen years of coal left 
 and i thought to myself well that 's well outside my lifetime and a much greater figure than the predictions for oil  but i did the math  
 and i realized that my great grandfather had been born exactly one hundred and eighteen years before that year  
 and i sat on his knee until i was eleven years old  and i realized it 's nothing
 in time  nor in history  and it made me make a decision
 i never thought i would make to leave the sport of solo sailing behind me
 and focus on the greatest challenge i 'd ever come across the future of our global economy and
 i quickly realized it wasn 't just about energy  it was also materials in two thousand and eight i picked up a scientific study looking at how many years we have of valuable materials to
  these figures couldn 't be exact but we knew those materials were finite  we only have them once and yet our speed that we 've used these materials has increased rapidly  
 exponentially 
 with more people in the world with more stuff we 've effectively seen one hundred years of price declines in those basic commodities erased in just ten years 
 and this affects all of us it 's brought huge volatility in prices so
  so that in two thousand and eleven  
 your average european car manufacturer saw a raw material price increase of five hundred million euros  wiping away half their operating profits through something they have absolutely no control over  
 and the more i learned  the more i started to change my own life i started traveling less doing less
  using less it felt like actually doing less was what we had to do  
 but it sat uneasy with me 
 it didn 't feel right  
 it felt like we were buying ourselves time  we were eking things out a bit longer  even if everybody changed it wouldn 't solve the problem it wouldn 't fix the system  
 it was vital in the transition but what fascinated me was in the transition to what  what could actually work 
 it struck me that the system itself the framework within which we live is fundamentally
  flawed  and i realized ultimately
 that our operating system  the way our economy functions the way our economy 's been built 
 is a system in itself at sea i had to understand complex systems  i had to take multiple inputs  i had to process them 
 and i had to understand the system to win  i had to make sense of it  
 and as i looked at our global economy i realized it
  is that system  but it 's a system that effectively can 't run in the long term  
 and i realized we 've been perfecting what 's effectively a linear economy for one hundred and fifty years 
 where we take a material out of the ground  we make something out of it and then ultimately that product gets thrown away and yes we do recycle some of it  
 but more an attempt to get out what we can at the end not by design 
  an economy that fundamentally can 't run in the long term and if we know that we have finite materials  
 why would we build an economy that would effectively use things up that would create waste 
 life itself has existed for billions of years and has continually adapted to use materials effectively it 's a complex system  but within it there is
  it 's not a linear economy at all but circular  
 and i felt like the child in the garden for the first time on this new journey i could see exactly where we were headed 
 if we could build an economy that would use things rather than use them up we could build a future that really could work in the long term  
 i was excited 
 this was something to work towards we knew exactly where we were headed we just had to work out how to get there
 and it was exactly with this in mind that we created the ellen macarthur foundation in september two thousand and ten 
 many schools of thought fed our thinking and pointed to this model industrial symbiosis performance economy  
 sharing economy biomimicry  and of course cradle to cradle design 
 materials would be defined as either technical or biological waste would be designed out entirely
 and we would have a system that could function absolutely
 in the long term  so what could this economy look like 
 maybe we wouldn 't buy light fittings but we 'd pay for the service of light and the manufacturers would recover the materials and change the light fittings when we had more efficient products 
 what if packaging was so nontoxic it could dissolve in water and we could ultimately drink it it would never become waste 
 what if engines were
 re manufacturable and we could recover the component materials and significantly reduce energy demand  
 what if we could recover components from circuit boards reutilize them and then fundamentally recover the materials within them through a second stage 
 what if we could collect food waste human waste what if we could turn that into fertilizer heat  energy ultimately reconnecting nutrients systems
 and rebuilding natural capital
  cars what we want is to move around  we don 't need to own the materials within them could cars become a service and provide us with mobility in the future 
 all of this sounds amazing  but these aren 't just ideas they 're real today  
 and these lie at the forefront of the circular economy what lies before us is to expand them and scale them up 
 so how would you shift from linear to circular
 the team and i at the foundation thought you might want to work with the top universities in the world with leading businesses within the world with the biggest convening platforms in the world  and with governments  
 we thought you might want to work with the best analysts and ask them the question can the circular economy decouple growth from resource constraints is the circular economy able
 to rebuild natural capital could the circular economy replace current chemical fertilizer use
  yes was the answer to the decoupling  but also yes we could replace current fertilizer use by a staggering two point seven times
 but what inspired me most about the circular economy
 was its ability to inspire young people 
 when young people see the economy through a circular lens  they see brand new opportunities on exactly the same horizon they can use their
  and knowledge to rebuild the entire system  
 and it 's there for the taking right now and the faster we do this the better so could we achieve this in their lifetimes is it actually possible  
 i believe yes  
 when you look at the lifetime of my great grandfather anything 's possible when he was born there were only twenty five cars in the world they had only just been invented
 when he was fourteen we flew for the first time in history now there are one hundred thousand charter flights every single day  
 when he was forty five we built the first computer many said it wouldn 't catch on but it did and just twenty years later we turned it into a microchip
 of which there will be thousands
  in this room here today  
 ten years before he died we built the first mobile phone it wasn 't that mobile to be fair  but now it really is  
 and as my great grandfather left this earth  the internet arrived  now we can do anything but more importantly  now we have a plan
