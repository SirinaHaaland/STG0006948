  i 'm a writer and a journalist  and i 'm also an insanely curious person  so in twenty two years as a journalist i 've learned how to do a lot of new things 
 and three years ago 
 one of the things i learned how to do was to become invisible  
 i became one of the working homeless
 i quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in february of that same year and decided to travel 
 his death hit me pretty hard and there were a lot of things that i wanted to feel and deal with while i was doing that 
 i 've camped my whole life and i decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip so i packed my cat my rottweiler
 and my camping gear into a one thousand nine hundred and seventy five chevy van and drove off into the sunset having fully failed to realize
 three critical things one that society equates living in a permanent structure even a shack with having value as a person 
 two i failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality
  let it three  i failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude not a lifestyle 
 at first living in the van was great i showered in campgrounds i ate out regularly  and i had time to relax and to grieve  
 but then the anger and the depression about my father 's death set in 
 my freelance job ended and i had to get a full time job to pay the bills
 what had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer  and it became impossible to park anywhere
  that i had a cat and a dog with me and it was really hot 
 the cat came and went through an open window in the van the doggy went into doggy day care  and i sweated
  whenever i could  i used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops or i washed up in
 in public rest rooms 
 nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below eighty degrees fahrenheit making it difficult or impossible to sleep  food rotted in the heat 
 ice in my ice chest melted within hours  and
 it was was pretty miserable
  couldn 't afford to find an apartment or couldn 't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the rottweiler and the cat and i refused to give them up 
 so i stayed in the van 
 and when the heat made me too sick to walk the fifty feet to the public restroom outside my
  van at night i used a bucket
 and a trash bag as a toilet 
 when winter weather set in the temperatures dropped below freezing and they stayed there  
 and i faced a whole new set of challenges  
 i parked
 a different place every night so i would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police i didn 't always succeed 
 but
 i felt out of control of my life  and i don 't know
 when or how it happened but the speed
 at which i went from being a talented writer and journalist
 to being a homeless woman living in a van took my breath away 
 i hadn 't changed my i q hadn 't dropped my talent 
  everything about me
 remained the same but i had changed somehow  
 i spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression and eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic  
 and i went i hadn 't bathed in three days i was as smelly
 and as depressed as anyone in line  i just wasn 't drunk or high  and when several of the homeless men realized that
  including a former university professor they said you aren 't homeless  why are you really here other homeless people didn 't see me as homeless but i did 
 then the professor listened to my story and he said 
 you have a job you have hope the real homeless don 't have hope a
 reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal  and i remember thinking if i killed myself
 no one would notice
 a friend told me shortly after that that she had heard that tim russert a nationally renowned journalist had been talking about me on national t v 
 an essay i 'd written about my father the year before he died
  in tim 's new book  and he was doing the talk show circuit and he was talking about my writing  
 and when i realized that tim russert  former moderator of meet the press was talking about my writing while i was living in a van in a wal mart parking lot 
 i started laughing you should too 
 i started laughing
 because it got to
  the point where was i a writer
 or was i a homeless woman  so i went in the bookstore  and i found tim 's book  
 and i stood there  and i reread my essay  and i cried because i
 was a writer  i was a writer  
 shortly after that i moved back to tennessee  i alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends  and i started writing again 
 by the summer of the following year i was a working journalist  i was winning awards
  awards  i was living in my own apartment i was no longer homeless  and i was no longer invisible
  i was living in a van in a
