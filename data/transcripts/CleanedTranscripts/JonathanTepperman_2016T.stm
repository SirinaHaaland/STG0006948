  the conventional wisdom about our world today is that this is a time of terrible decline  
 and that 's not surprising given the bad news all around us from isis to inequality
  and on and on 
 but here 's the thing and this may sound a little weird  
 i actually don 't buy this gloomy narrative 
 and i don 't think you should either  look it 's not that i don 't see the problems  i read the same headlines that you do 
 what i dispute is the conclusion that so many people draw from them  
  all screwed because the problems are unsolvable and our governments are useless  
 now  why do i say this it 's not like i 'm particularly optimistic by nature 
 but something about the media 's constant doom mongering with its fixation on problems and not on answers
 has always really bugged me  so a few years ago i decided  well  i 'm
  i should see if i can do any better by
 going around the world and actually asking folks if and how they 've tackled their big economic and political challenges  
 and what i found astonished me 
 it turns out that there are remarkable signs of progress out there  often in the most unexpected places  
 and they 've convinced me that our great global challenges may not be so unsolvable after all not only are there theoretical fixes
 those fixes have been tried they 've worked  and they offer hope for the rest of us  
 i 'm going to show you what i mean by telling you about how three of the countries i visited canada indonesia and mexico overcame three supposedly impossible problems 
 their stories matter because they contain tools the rest of us can use and not just for those particular problems
  for many others too 
 when most people think about my homeland  canada today if they think about canada at all they think
 cold they think boring they think polite they think we say sorry too much in our funny accents  and that 's all true
  because of its triumph over a problem currently tearing many other countries apart immigration 
 consider canada today is among the world 's most welcoming nations even compared to other immigration friendly countries 
 its per capita immigration rate is four times higher than france 's and its percentage of foreign born residents is double that of sweden
  ten times more syrian refugees in the last year than did the united states 
 and now canada is taking even more and yet if you ask canadians what makes them proudest of their country they rank
  in other words at a time when other countries are now frantically building new barriers to keep foreigners out canadians want even more of them in  
 now here 's the really interesting part canada wasn 't always like
  canada followed an explicitly racist immigration policy 
 they called it white canada and as you can see  they were not just talking about the snow 
 so how did that canada become today 's canada  
 well  despite what my mom in ontario will tell you the answer had nothing to do with virtue canadians
  inherently better than anyone else the real explanation involves the man who became canada 's leader in 
 pierre trudeau who is also the father of the current prime minister 
 the thing to know about that first trudeau is that he was very different from canada 's previous leaders  he was a french 
  speaker in a country long dominated by its english elite  he was an intellectual he was even kind of
  the guy did yoga  he hung out with the beatles and like all hipsters he could be infuriating at times  
 but he nevertheless pulled off one of the most progressive transformations any country has ever seen 
 his formula i 've learned involved two parts first canada threw out its old race based immigration rules and it replaced them with new
  ones that emphasized education 
 experience and language skills instead and what that did was greatly increase the odds that newcomers would contribute to the economy  
 then part two trudeau created the world 's first policy of official multiculturalism to promote integration
 and the idea that diversity was the key to canada 's identity
  years that followed ottawa kept pushing this message  
 but at the same time ordinary canadians soon started to see the economic the material benefits of multiculturalism all around them 
 and these two influences soon combined to create the passionately open minded canada of today 
 let 's now turn to another country and an even tougher problem islamic extremism
  in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight the people of indonesia took to the streets and overthrew their longtime dictator  suharto 
 it was an amazing moment  
 but it was also a scary one with two hundred and fifty million people indonesia is the largest muslim majority country on earth it
 's also hot huge and unruly
  made up of seventeen thousand islands where people speak close to a thousand languages  
 now  suharto had been a dictator and a nasty one  
 but he 'd also been a pretty effective tyrant  
 and he 'd always been careful to keep religion out of politics so experts feared that without him keeping a lid on things the country would explode 
 or religious extremists would take over and turn indonesia into a tropical version of iran
  and that 's just what seemed to happen
  at first 
 in the country 's first free elections in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine islamist parties scored thirty six percent of the vote  
 and the islands burned as riots and terror attacks killed thousands  
 since then however  indonesia has taken a surprising turn  while ordinary folks
 folks have grown more pious on a personal level i saw a lot more headscarves on a recent visit than i would have a decade ago
 the country 's politics have moved in the opposite direction indonesia is now a pretty decent democracy  
 and yet its islamist parties have steadily lost support from a high of about thirty eight percent in two thousand and four down to twenty five percent in two thousand and fourteen
  and while a few indonesians have recently joined isis their number is tiny  far fewer in per capita terms
 than the number of belgians  
 try to think of one other muslim majority country that can say all those same things in two thousand and fourteen i went to indonesia to ask its current president
  many other muslim states are dying 
 well what we realized he told me is that to deal with extremism we needed to deal with inequality first 
 see indonesia 's religious parties like similar parties elsewhere had tended to focus on things like reducing poverty and cutting corruption 
 so that 's what joko and his predecessors
  thereby stealing the islamists ' thunder 
 they also cracked down hard on terrorism  
 but indonesia 's democrats have learned a key lesson from the dark years of dictatorship  
 namely that repression only creates more extremism  
 so they waged their war with extraordinary delicacy 
 they used the police instead of the army  they only detained suspects if they had enough evidence  
 they held public trials  they even sent liberal imams into the jails to persuade
  the jihadists that terror is un islamic 
 and all of this paid off in spectacular fashion creating the kind of country that was unimaginable twenty years ago  
 so at this point 
 my optimism should i hope be starting to make a bit more sense  neither immigration nor islamic extremism are impossible to deal with 
 join me now on one last trip this time to mexico
  now of our three stories this one probably surprised me the most since as you all know the country is still struggling with so many problems 
 and yet a few years ago mexico did something that many other countries from france to india to the united states can still only dream of 
 it shattered the political paralysis that had gripped it for years 
 to understand how we need to rewind to the year two thousand
 when mexico finally became a democracy  rather than use their new freedoms
 to fight for reform mexico 's politicians used them to fight one another 
 congress deadlocked and the country 's problems drugs  poverty  crime corruption spun out of control 
 things got so bad that in two thousand and eight  the pentagon warned that mexico risked collapse
  two thousand and twelve this guy named enrique pea nieto somehow got himself elected president  
 now  this pea hardly inspired much confidence at first  
 sure he was handsome  
 but he came from mexico 's corrupt old ruling party the pri and he was
 a notorious
  in fact he seemed like such a pretty boy lightweight that women called him bombn sweetie at campaign rallies  
 and yet this same bombn soon surprised everyone
 by hammering out a truce between the country 's three warring political parties 
 and over the next eighteen months  they together passed an incredibly comprehensive set of reforms  
 they busted open mexico 's smothering monopolies  they liberalized its rusting energy sector
  they restructured its failing schools and much more 
 to appreciate the scale of this accomplishment  try to imagine the us congress passing immigration reform campaign finance reform and banking reform  now  try to imagine congress doing it all at the same time 
 that 's what mexico did 
 not long ago
 i met with pea and asked how he managed it all the president flashed me his famous twinkly smile 
 and told me that the short answer was 
 compromise of course i pushed him for details and the long answer that came out was essentially compromise compromise and more compromise 
 see pea knew that he needed to build trust early so he started talking to the opposition just days after his election to ward off pressure
  from special interests he kept their meetings small and secret  and many of the participants later told me that it was this intimacy  
 plus a lot of shared tequila that helped build confidence 
 so did the fact that all decisions had to be unanimous  and that pea
 even agreed to pass some of the other party 's priorities before his own as santiago creel an opposition senator put it to me
  look  i 'm not saying that i 'm special or that anyone is special  but that group that was special 
 the proof when pea was sworn in the pact held and mexico moved forward for the first time in years  
 bueno  so now we 've seen how these three countries overcame three of their great challenges  and that 's very nice for them
 right but
 what good does it do the rest of us  
 well in the course of studying these and a bunch of other success stories like the way rwanda pulled itself back together after civil war
 or brazil has reduced inequality or south korea has kept its economy growing faster and for longer than any other country on earth
  i 've noticed a few common threads  now  before describing them i need to add a caveat  i realize of course that all countries are unique so you can 't simply take what 
  worked in one  port it to another and expect it to work there too  nor do specific solutions work forever you 've got to adapt them as circumstances change  
  countries
 and in boardrooms and in all sorts of other contexts too 
 number one  embrace the extreme in all the stories we 've just looked at salvation came at a moment of existential peril  
 and that was no coincidence take canada when trudeau took office he faced two
  looming dangers 
 first though his vast underpopulated country badly needed more bodies its preferred source for white workers europe had just stopped exporting them as it finally recovered from world war ii 
 the other problem was that canada 's long cold war between its french and its english communities had just become a hot one  
 quebec was threatening to secede and canadians were actually killing other canadians over politics  now  countries face crises all the time
  's nothing special 
 but trudeau 's genius was to realize that canada 's crisis had swept away all the hurdles that usually block reform 
 canada had to open up it had no choice  
 and it had to rethink its identity  again  it had no choice  and that gave trudeau a
  to break the old rules and write new ones  and like all our other heroes  he was smart enough to seize it 
 number two there 's power in promiscuous thinking 
 another striking similarity among good  problem solvers is that they 're all pragmatists  
 they 'll steal the best answers from wherever they find them and they don 't let details like party or ideology
  sentimentality get in their way 
 as i mentioned earlier indonesia 's democrats were clever enough to steal many of the islamists ' best campaign promises for themselves  
 they even invited some of the radicals into their governing coalition  now  that horrified a lot of secular indonesians  
 but
 by forcing the radicals to actually help govern  it quickly exposed the fact that they weren 't any good at the job  and it got them mixed up in all of
  the grubby compromises and petty humiliations that are part of everyday politics  and that hurt their image so badly that they 've never recovered 
 number three please all of the people some of the time  
 i know i just mentioned how crises can grant leaders extraordinary freedoms  and that 's true
  often requires more than just boldness it takes showing restraint too just when that 's the last thing you want to do 
 take trudeau when he took office  he could easily have put his core constituency that is canada 's french community first  he could have pleased
 some of the people all of the time 
 and pea could have used his power to keep attacking the opposition as was traditional in mexico 
 yet he chose to embrace his enemies instead  while forcing his own party
  to compromise and trudeau pushed everyone to stop thinking in tribal terms and to see multiculturalism not language and not skin color as what made them quintessentially canadian 
 nobody got everything they wanted  but everyone got just enough
 that the bargains held  so at this point you may be thinking
  are out there like you keep insisting then
 why aren 't more countries already using them 
 it 's not like they require special powers to pull off i mean  none of the leaders we 've just looked at were superheroes 
 they didn 't accomplish anything on their own  and they all had plenty of flaws 
 take indonesia 's first democratic president abdurrahman wahid 
 this man was so powerfully uncharismatic
 that he once fell asleep
 in the middle of his own speech true story  
 so what this tells us is that the real obstacle is not ability  
 and it 's not circumstances  it 's something much simpler  
 making big changes involves taking big risks 
 and taking big risks is scary
  that fear requires guts  and as you all know gutsy politicians are painfully rare  
 but that doesn 't mean we voters can 't demand courage from our political leaders i mean that 's why we put them in office in the first place  
 and given the state of the world today there 's really no other option  
 the answers are out there but now it 's up to
  us to elect more women and men brave enough to find them to steal them and to make them work thank you
