  cover at the end about how a company called silk tripled their sales how an artist named jeff koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact 
 to how frank gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect and
 one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years a record label i started that had a cd called sauce 
 before i can do that i 've got to tell you about sliced bread and a guy named otto rohwedder 
 now  before sliced bread was invented in the  1910s
 i wonder what they said like the greatest invention since
 the telegraph or something but this guy named otto rohwedder invented sliced bread  and he focused like most
  inventors did on the patent part and the making part 
 and the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this that for the first fifteen years after sliced bread was available no one bought it no one knew about it  it was a complete and total failure  
 and the reason
 is
 that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread no one wanted
  it that the success of sliced bread like the success of almost everything we 've talked about at this conference is not always about
 what the patent is like or what the factory is like
 it 's about can you get your idea to spread or not 
 and i think that the way you 're going to get what you want or cause the change that you want to change to happen is to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread
  and it doesn 't matter to me whether you 're running a coffee shop or you 're an intellectual or you 're in business or you 're flying hot air balloons  i think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do 
 that what we are living in
 is a century of idea diffusion that people who can spread ideas regardless of what those ideas are win when
 i talk about it i usually
  pick business  because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation  and because it 's the easiest sort of way to keep score 
 but i want you to forgive me when i use these examples because i 'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do 
 at the heart of spreading ideas is tv and stuff like tv 
 tv and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way
  i call it the tv industrial complex the way the tv industrial complex works is you buy some ads  interrupt some people that gets you distribution you
 use the distribution you get to sell more products you take the profit from that
 to buy more ads and it goes around and around and around the same way that the military industrial complex worked a long time ago
 that model of and we heard it yesterday if we could only get onto the homepage of google
  if we could only figure out how to get promoted there 
 grab that person by the throat and tell them
 about what we want to do if we did that then everyone would pay attention and we would win
  well this  tv industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours i
 mean all of these products succeeded
  because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they weren 't expecting in a way they didn 't necessarily want with an ad over and over again until they bought
 it and the thing that 's happened
 is they canceled the tv industrial complex that just over the last few years what anybody who markets anything has discovered
 is that it 's not working the way that it used to this picture is really fuzzy  i apologize i had a bad cold when i
  the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child i go to the deli i 'm sick i need to buy some medicine 
 the brand manager for that blue product spent one hundred million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year one hundred million dollars interrupting me with tv commercials and magazine ads and spam 
  and coupons and shelving allowances and spiff all so i could ignore every single message 
  box because i always have and i 'm not going to invest a minute of my time
 to solve her problem because i don 't care 
 here 's a magazine called hydrate it 's one hundred and eighty pages about water 
 laughter articles about water  ads about water imagine what the world was like forty
  the saturday evening post and time and newsweek  now there are magazines about water new product from coke japan water salad 
 laughter coke japan comes out with a new product every three weeks  because they have no idea what 's going to work and what 's not 
  i couldn 't have written this better myself it came out four days ago i circled the important parts so you can see them here 
 with the voice of tom arnold  hoping that that will get people to go to arby 's and buy a roast beef sandwich 
 now i had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated tv commercial featuring tom arnold  that would get you to get in your car  drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich
  and he was right when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea the world revolves around me 
 me me me me my favorite person me  i don 't want to get email from anybody  i want to get memail 
 so consumers  
 and i don 't just mean people who buy stuff at the safeway  i mean people at the defense department who might buy something or people at you know the new yorker who might print your
  article consumers
 don 't care about you at all they just don 't care  part of the reason is they 've got way more choices than they used to and way less time 
 and in a world where we have too many choices and too little time the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff 
 and my parable here is you 're driving down the road and you see a cow and you
  keep driving because you 've seen cows before cows are invisible cows are boring who 's going to stop and pull over and say 
 oh  look a cow nobody 
 but if the cow was purple isn 't that a great special effect i could do that again if you want 
 if the cow was purple 
 you 'd notice it for a while  i mean if all cows were purple you 'd get bored with those
  the thing that 's going to decide what gets talked about what gets done what gets changed what gets purchased what gets built is is it
 remarkable 
 and remarkable is a really cool word  because we think it just means neat but it also means worth making a remark about 
 and that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going  that two of the hottest cars
  states is a 
 giant car big enough to hold a mini in its trunk people are paying full price for both and the only thing they have in common
 is that they don 't have anything in common every week the number one best selling dvd
  in america changes  
 it 's never the godfather it 's never citizen kane it 's always some
 third rate movie with some second rate star  but the reason it 's number one is because that 's the week it came out because it 's new because it 's fresh people saw it and said i didn 't know that was there and they noticed it two
 of the big success stories of the last twenty years in retail one sells things that are 
  and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them 
 the only thing they have in common is that they 're different we 're now in the fashion business no matter what we do for a living we
 're in the fashion business  and people in the fashion business know what it 's like to be in the fashion business they 're used to it 
 the rest of us have to figure out how to think that way how to understand that it 's not about interrupting people with big full page ads  
 or insisting on meetings with people  but it 's a totally different sort of process
  determines which ideas spread  and which ones don 't they sold a billion dollars ' worth of aeron chairs
 by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair they turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work 
 this guy lionel poilne the most famous baker in the world he died two and a half months ago  and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend
  he lived in paris last year he sold ten million dollars ' worth of french bread 
 every loaf baked in a bakery he owned by one baker at a time in a wood fired oven  
 and when lionel started his bakery the french pooh pooh ed it they didn 't want to buy his bread  it didn 't look like french bread it wasn 't what they expected it was
  it was remarkable  and slowly  it spread from one person to another person until finally  it became the official bread of three star restaurants in paris  now he 's in london and he ships by fedex all around the world 
 what marketers used to do is make average products for average people that 's what mass marketing is smooth out the edges go for the center that 
  's the big market they would ignore the geeks  and god forbid the laggards  it was
  all about going for the center 
 but in a world where the tv industrial complex is broken i don 't think that 's a strategy we want to use any more i think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people
  because they 're really good at ignoring you but market to these people because they care  
  and when you talk to them they 'll listen because they like listening it 's about them 
 and if you 're lucky they 'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve  and it 'll spread it 'll spread to the entire curve they have something i call otaku it 's a great japanese 
  word  it describes the desire of someone who 's obsessed to say drive across tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place because that 's what they do  they get
  to market an idea to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn 't have a constituency with an otaku 
 is almost impossible  
 instead you have to find a group that really desperately cares about what it is you have to say talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends there 's a hot sauce otaku  but there 's no mustard otaku  
 that 's why there 's lots and lots and lots of kinds of hot
  and not so many kinds of mustard not because it 's hard to make interesting mustard you could make interesting mustard
 but people don 't  because no one 's obsessed with it and thus no one tells their friends  krispy kreme has figured this whole thing out
 it has a strategy and what they do is they enter a city they talk to the people with the otaku  and then they spread through the city to the people who 've just crossed the street 
 this yoyo right here cost one hundred and twelve dollars  
 but it sleeps for twelve minutes not everybody wants it but they don 't care  they want to talk to the people who do
 and maybe it 'll spread these guys make the loudest car stereo in the world 
 it 's as loud as a seven hundred and forty seven jet you can 't get in the car 's got bulletproof glass because it 'll blow out the windshield otherwise  but the fact 
  remains that when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car  if they 've got the otaku or they 've heard from someone who does they go ahead and they pick this 
  sell to the people who are listening and just maybe those people tell their friends  so when steve jobs talks to fifty thousand people at his keynote
 who are all tuned in from one hundred and thirty countries watching his  two hour commercial that 's the only thing keeping his company in business it
 's that those fifty thousand people care desperately enough to watch a two hour commercial and then tell their friends 
  released in the last two years every one made a profit 
 how they only sell them on their website those people who buy them have the otaku and then they tell their friends  and it spreads and it spreads this hospital crib cost ten thousand dollars ten times the standard  
 but hospitals are buying it faster than any other model hard candy nail polish doesn 't appeal to everybody but to the people who love it  
 they talk about it like crazy this paint can right here
  saved the dutch boy paint company making them a fortune it costs thirty five percent more than regular paint because dutch boy made a can that people talk about because it 's remarkable  they didn 't just slap a new ad on the product they changed what it meant to build a paint product
 everyday two hundred and fifty thousand people go to this site  run by two volunteers  and i can tell you they are hard graders
  they didn 't get this way by advertising a lot they got this way by being remarkable  sometimes a little too remarkable  
 and this picture frame has a cord going out the back and you plug it into the wall my father has this on his desk  and he sees his grandchildren everyday 
  and every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk  and one person at a time the idea spreads these are not diamonds not really 
 they 're made from cremains after you 're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem oh 
 you like my ring  it 's my grandmother 
  business in the whole mortuary industry 
 but you don 't have to be ozzie osborne you don 't have to be super outrageous to do this what you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them a couple of quick rules to wrap up the first one is design is free when you get to scale 
 the people who come up with stuff that 's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them number two 
 the riskiest thing you can do now is be safe proctor
  gamble knows this right 
 the whole model of being proctor and gamble is always about average products for average people that 's risky  
 the safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes be remarkable  
 and being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do  very good is boring  very good is average it doesn 't matter whether you 're making
  a record album or you 're an architect  or you have a tract on sociology if it 's very good it 's not going to work because no one 's going to notice it 
 so my three stories silk put
 a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section  sales tripled why milk milk milk milk milk not milk 
 for the people who were there and looking at that section  it was remarkable  they didn 't triple their sales with advertising they tripled it by doing something remarkable
 that is a remarkable piece of art you don 't have to like it but a 40 foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of new york city is remarkable 
 frank gehry didn 't just change a museum he changed an entire city 's economy
 by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see 
  the portland city council or who knows where they said we need an architect can we get frank gehry
  because he did something that was at the fringes  and my big failure i came out with an entire 
 a record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in 
  this remarkable new format and i marketed it straight to people with
  what you need to do
 is figure out who does care 
 who is going to raise their hand and say i want to hear what you 're doing next and sell something to them 
 the last example i want to give you this is a map of soap lake washington as you can see if that 's nowhere  it 's in the middle of it
 but they do have a lake  
 and people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake  they don 't anymore so the founding fathers said we 've got some money to spend what can we build here and like most committees 
  they were going to build something pretty safe and then an artist came to them this is a true artist 's rendering he wants to build a
  center of town  that 's a purple cow  that 's something worth noticing i don 't know about you but if they build it that 's where i 'm going to go
