  years ago our ancestors were insignificant animals  
 the most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were unimportant  their impact on the world was not much greater than that of jellyfish or
  fireflies or woodpeckers 
 today in contrast  we control this planet 
 and the question is  how did we come from there to here  
 how did we turn ourselves from insignificant apes minding their own business in a corner of africa into the rulers of
  we look for the difference between us and all the other animals on the individual level  
 we want to believe i want to believe that there is something special about me 
 about my body about my brain that makes me so superior to a dog or a pig or a chimpanzee  
 but the truth is that on the individual level  i 'm embarrassingly similar
  similar to a chimpanzee 
 and if you take me and a chimpanzee and put us together on some lonely island and we had to struggle for survival to see who survives better  i would definitely place my bet on the chimpanzee 
 not on myself  and this is not something wrong with me personally
  i guess if they took almost any one of you and placed you alone with a chimpanzee on some island  the chimpanzee would do much better 
 the real difference between humans and all other animals is not on the individual level it 's on the collective level 
 humans control the planet because they are the only animals that can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers
  now there are other animals like the social insects  the bees the ants that can cooperate in large numbers  
 but they don 't do so flexibly their cooperation is very rigid 
 there is basically just one way in which a beehive can function and if there 's a new opportunity or a new
  the bees cannot reinvent the social system overnight 
 they cannot for example  execute the queen and establish a republic of bees or a communist dictatorship of worker bees 
 other animals like the social mammals the wolves the elephants the dolphins the chimpanzees
 they can cooperate much more flexibly  but they do so only in small numbers  because cooperation among chimpanzees is
  based on intimate knowledge one of the other i 'm a chimpanzee and you 're a chimpanzee and i want to cooperate with you i need to know you personally 
  what kind of chimpanzee are you are you a nice chimpanzee are you an evil chimpanzee are you trustworthy if i don 't know you  how can i cooperate
  that can combine the two abilities together and cooperate both flexibly and still do so in very large numbers is us homo sapiens  
 one versus one 
 or even ten versus ten chimpanzees might be better than us 
 but if you pit one thousand humans against one thousand chimpanzees
  the humans will win easily for the simple reason that a thousand chimpanzees cannot cooperate at all 
 and if you now try to cram one hundred thousand chimpanzees into oxford street or into wembley stadium or tienanmen square or the vatican 
 you will get chaos  complete chaos just imagine wembley stadium with one hundred thousand chimpanzees
  complete madness 
 in contrast humans normally gather there in tens of thousands  and what we get is not chaos usually  what we get 
 is extremely sophisticated and effective networks of cooperation 
  ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers  
 think even about this very talk that i 'm giving now  i 'm standing here in front of an audience of about three hundred or four hundred people 
 most of you are complete strangers to me 
 similarly  i don 't really know all the people who have organized and worked on this event  i don 't know
 the pilot and the crew members of the plane that brought me over here  yesterday to london  
 i don 't know the people who invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras which are recording what i 'm saying  
 i don 't know the people who wrote all the books and articles that i read in preparation for this talk 
 and i certainly don 't know all the people who might be
  watching this talk over the internet somewhere in buenos aires or in new delhi  
 nevertheless even though we don 't know each other  we can work together to create this global exchange of ideas 
 this is something chimpanzees cannot do they communicate
  but you will never catch a chimpanzee traveling to some distant chimpanzee band to give them a talk about bananas or about elephants or anything else that might interest chimpanzees 
 now cooperation is of course not always nice 
 all the horrible things humans have been doing throughout history and we have been doing some very horrible
  are a system of cooperation slaughterhouses are a system of cooperation concentration camps are a system of cooperation 
 chimpanzees don 't have slaughterhouses and prisons and concentration camps 
 now suppose i 've managed to convince you perhaps that yes  we control the world because we can cooperate flexibly in large numbers
 the next question that immediately arises in the mind of an inquisitive listener
 is how exactly do we do it  what enables us alone of all the animals to cooperate in such a way  
 the answer
 is our imagination  we can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers
 because we alone of all the animals on the planet can create and believe fictions fictional stories  
 and as long as everybody believes in the same fiction 
 everybody obeys and follows the same rules the same norms the same values 
 all other animals use their communication system only
 to describe reality 
 a chimpanzee may say look there 's a lion  let 's run away or look  there 's a banana tree over there  let 's go and get bananas 
 humans in contrast use their language not merely to describe reality  but also to create new realities fictional realities 
 a human can say
  above the clouds  and if you don 't do what i tell you to do when you die god will punish you and send you to hell 
 and if you all believe this story that i 've invented  then you will follow the same norms and laws and values  and you can cooperate 
 this is something only humans can do 
 you can never
  and you 'll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds so now give me this banana no chimpanzee will ever believe such a story 
 only humans believe such stories  which is why we control the world whereas the chimpanzees are locked up in zoos and research laboratories 
 now you may find it acceptable that yes
  the religious field  humans cooperate by believing in the same fictions  millions of people come together to build a cathedral or 
  a mosque or fight in a crusade or a jihad because they all believe in the same stories about god and heaven and hell  
 underlies all other forms of  mass scale human cooperation not only in the religious field take
 for example  the legal field 
 most legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights  but what are human rights
  human rights just like god and heaven are just a story that we 've invented they are not an objective reality  they are not some biological effect about homo sapiens  
 take a human being  cut him open look inside you will find the heart  the kidneys neurons hormones dna  but you won 't find any rights  
 the only place you find
  the stories that we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries  
 they may be very positive stories very good stories  but they 're still just fictional stories that we 've invented  
 the same is true of the political field  the most important factors in modern politics are states and nations
  but what are states and nations  they are not an objective reality  a mountain is an objective reality  you can see it  you can touch it  you can even smell it  
 but a nation or a state like israel or iran or france or germany this is just a story that we 've invented and became extremely attached to 
 the same is true of the economic field  
 the most important actors today in the global economy are companies and
  corporations many of you today perhaps work for 
 like google or toyota or mcdonald 's what exactly are these things 
 they are what lawyers call legal fictions  
 they are stories invented and maintained by the powerful wizards we call lawyers
  corporations do all day  mostly they try to make money  
 yet what is money  again money is not an objective reality  it has no objective value  
 take this green piece of paper the dollar bill  look at it it has no value  you cannot eat it  you cannot drink it  you cannot wear it  
 but then came along these master storytellers
 the big bankers  the finance ministers  the prime ministers and they tell us a very convincing story 
 look you see this green piece of paper it is actually worth ten bananas 
 and if i believe it and you believe it and everybody believes it it actually works i can take this worthless piece of paper 
 go to the supermarket give it to a complete stranger
  whom i 've never met before and get in exchange real bananas which i can actually eat 
 this is something amazing you could never do it with chimpanzees 
 chimpanzees trade of course yes  you give me a coconut i 'll give you a banana that can work  
 but you give me a worthless piece of paper and you except me to give you a banana no way what do you think i am a human
 money in fact is the most successful story ever invented and told by humans because it is the only story everybody believes 
 not everybody believes in god 
 not everybody believes in human rights  not everybody believes in nationalism  but everybody believes in money
  the dollar bill take
 even osama bin laden  
 he hated american politics and american religion and american culture  but he had no objection to american dollars he was quite fond of them actually 
 to conclude then we humans control the world because we live in a dual reality
 other animals live in an objective reality  
 their reality consists of objective entities  like rivers and trees and lions and elephants  
 we humans we also live in an objective reality  in our world too there are rivers and trees and lions and elephants  
 but over the centuries we have
  constructed on top of this objective reality
 a second layer of fictional reality 
 a reality made of fictional entities  like nations  like gods  like money  like corporations  
 and what is amazing is that as history
  fictional reality became more and more powerful so that today  the most powerful forces in the world are these fictional entities 
 today  the very survival of rivers and trees and lions and elephants depends on the decisions and wishes of fictional
  after sapiens you wrote another one and it
  in the book if i understand it correctly you argue that the amazing breakthroughs that
 we are experiencing right now not only will potentially make our lives better but
 they will create and i quote you new classes and new class struggles just as the industrial revolution did can you elaborate for us ynh yes
 in the industrial revolution we saw the creation of a new class of the
 urban proletariat and much of the political and social history of the last two hundred years involved what to do with this class and the new problems and opportunities 
 now we see the creation of a new massive class of useless people 
 as
 computers become better and better in more
  a distinct possibility that computers will out perform us in most tasks and will make humans redundant and then the big political and economic question 
 of the 21st century will be what do we need humans for or at least what do we need so many humans for bg do you have an answer in the book ynh 
  this doesn 't sound like a very appealing future bg ok so
 you 're basically saying in the book and now that for all the discussion about the growing evidence of significant economic inequality 
 we are just kind of at the beginning of the process ynh again it 's
 not a prophecy it 's
 seeing all kinds of possibilities before us one possibility is this creation of a new massive class of useless people
  possibility is the division of humankind into different biological castes with the rich being upgraded into virtual gods  
  and the poor being degraded to this level of useless useless people bg i feel there is another ted talk coming up in a year or two thank you
