  my first love was for the night sky 
 love is complicated you 're looking at a fly through of the hubble space telescope  ultra deep field one of the most distant images of our universe ever
  everything you see here is a galaxy  comprised of billions of stars each 
 and the farthest galaxy is a trillion trillion kilometers away  
 as an astrophysicist i have the awesome privilege of studying some of the most exotic objects in our universe 
 the objects that have captivated me from first crush throughout my career are supermassive hyperactive black holes 
 weighing one to ten
  billion times the mass of our own sun these galactic black holes are devouring material at a rate of upwards of one thousand times more than your average supermassive black hole 
 these two characteristics with a few others  make them quasars  at the same
  i study
 are producing some of the most powerful particle streams ever observed  
 these narrow streams called jets are moving at ninety nine point nine nine percent of the speed of light 
 and are pointed directly at the earth  
 these jetted
 hyperactive and supermassive black holes are called
  so special is that they 're some of the universe 's most efficient particle accelerators transporting incredible amounts of energy throughout a galaxy 
 here i 'm showing an artist 's conception of a blazar 
 the dinner plate by which material falls onto the black hole is called the accretion disc shown here in blue 
 some of that material is slingshotted around the black hole and accelerated to insanely high speeds in the jet
  shown here in white 
 although the blazar system is rare the process by which nature pulls in material via a disk and then flings some of it out via a jet is more common we
 'll eventually zoom out of the blazar system to show its approximate relationship to the larger galactic context 
 beyond the cosmic accounting
  accounting of what goes in to what goes out one of the hot topics in blazar astrophysics right now is where the highest energy jet emission comes from 
 in this image i 'm interested in where this white blob forms and if  as a result there 's any relationship between the jet and the accretion disc material 
 clear answers to this question were almost completely inaccessible until two thousand and eight
 when nasa launched a new telescope that better detects gamma ray light
 that is light with energies a million times higher than your standard x ray scan 
 i simultaneously compare variations between the gamma ray light data and the visible light data from day to day and year to year to better localize these gamma ray
  my research shows that in some instances these blobs form much closer to the black hole than we initially thought 
 as we more confidently localize where these gamma ray blobs are forming we can better understand how jets are being accelerated and ultimately reveal the dynamic 
  processes by which some of the most fascinating objects in our universe are formed 
 this all started as a love story and it still
  is 
 this love transformed me from a curious stargazing young girl to a professional astrophysicist hot on the heels of celestial discovery  
 who knew that chasing after the universe would ground me so deeply to my mission here on earth  
 then again  when do we ever know where love 's first flutter will truly take us  thank you
