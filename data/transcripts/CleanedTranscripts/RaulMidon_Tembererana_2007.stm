  it 's really quite an honor to to be here tonight and i 'm really glad that
 that i stayed here and listened because i
  i 've really been inspired  and
 i 'm going to play some songs for you tonight that are literally world premieres i 've been working on my on my new record and i 've never played these songs for anybody except the microphone 
 this is a song that that i wrote
 about
 the meaning of technology which goes perfectly
  with this
 gathering i started thinking about
 when i was in college especially as a blind person
 doing a research paper was a major undertaking 
 you had to go to the library see if you could get them to find the books for you you know footnotes and all that now you can just go on google
 look it up i wish i had that when i was in college
  a a song about we have all this but what are we going to do with it it 's called all the answers
  've ever played it
  a song that started out as a dream
 a childhood dream it was one of the titles that i was sort of thinking about calling my record except there 's a
  the song is based on what i think was my first childhood
 attempts to to think about invisible forces 
  was these dreams in which i would be running
  away from bad feelings is the only way i can put it
