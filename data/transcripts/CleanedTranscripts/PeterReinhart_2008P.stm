  this is a wheat bread a whole wheat bread  and
 it 's made with a new technique that i 've been playing around with and developing and writing about which for lack of a better name we call the epoxy method and i call it an epoxy method because it 's not very appetizing i understand that but
 but if you think about epoxy what 's epoxy
 's two resins that are sort of in and of themselves neither of which can make glue  but when you put the two together something happens a bond takes place  and you get this very strong powerful
 adhesive  well  in this technique what i 've tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread baking world the artisan bread baking community
  been trying to accumulate over the last twenty years or so since we 've been engaged in a bread renaissance in america and put it together to come up with
 a method
 that would help to take whole grain breads and let 's face it everyone 's trying to move towards whole grains we finally after forty years of knowing that wholegrain was a healthier option we 're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over and attempting to actually eat them
  for a wholegrain baker is you know how do you make it
 taste good because whole grain
 it 's easy with white flour to make a good tasting bread  white flour is sweet it 's mainly starch and starch when you break it down what is starch  it 's thank you sugar 
 yes  so a baker  and a good baker knows how to pull or draw forth the inherent sugar
  trapped in the starch with whole grain bread you have other obstacles you 've got bran which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber for the bran 
  is is fiber it 's got germ those are the good things but those aren 't the tastiest parts of the wheat so whole grain breads
  when we think of something as a health food we think of it as something we eat out of obligation not out of passion
 and love for the flavor and ultimately  the challenge of the the baker the challenge of every culinary student of every chef is to deliver flavor 
 flavor is king flavor rules i call it the flavor rule flavor rules and and you can get somebody to eat something that 's good for them once 
 but they won 't eat it again if they don 't like it  right so this is the challenge for this bread
 we 're going to try this at lunch and i 'll
 explain a bit more about it but it 's made not only with two types of pre doughs this attempt again at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before
 that is not leavened it 's just dough that is wet it 's hydrated dough we call the soaker that helps to start enzyme
  and enzymes are the secret kind of ingredient in dough that brings out flavor it starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch  that 's what enzymes are doing  and so if we can release some of those they become accessible to us
 in our palate they become accessible to the yeast as food  they become accessible to the oven for caramelization to give us a beautiful crust
  the other pre dough that we make is fermented our pre ferment and it 's made it can be a sourdough starter or what we call a biga or any other kind of
 pre fermented dough with a little yeast in it and that starts to develop flavor also and on day two we put those two pieces together  that 's the epoxy  
 and we 're hoping that sort of the enzyme piece of dough
 becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough and when we put them together and add the final ingredients we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain that 's the challenge
 of wheat let 's go back and look at these twelve stages i 'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them okay we 're going to start with the first stage 
 and this is this is what every student has to begin with everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is mise en place 
 which is just a french way of saying 
  in its place 
 first stage so in baking we call it scaling weighing out the ingredients stage two is mixing we take the ingredients and we mix them we have to develop the gluten there 's no gluten in flour there 's only 
  the potential for gluten here 's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy because we 've got glutenin and gliadin neither of which are strong enough to make
  and so we in the mixing process have to develop the gluten we have to activate the leaven or the yeast and we have to
 essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly then we get into fermentation the third stage which is really where the flavor develops  the yeast
 comes alive and starts eating the sugars creating carbon dioxide and alcohol
 essentially it 's burping and sweating which is what bread is it 's yeast burps and sweat and
  somehow  this is transformed the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food  and we 're going to explore that in a minute 
 but then quickly through the next few stages we after it 's fermented and it 's developed started to develop flavor and character we divide it into smaller units 
 and then we take those units and we shape them we give them a little pre shape usually a round or a little torpedo shape
  sometimes that 's called rounding and there 's a short rest period it can be for a few seconds it can be for twenty or thirty minutes we call that resting or benching then we go into final shaping 
 panning which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan this takes a second but it 's a
 distinctive stage it can be in a basket it can be
  a loaf pan but we pan it 
 and then stage nine
  the fermentation which started at stage three is continuing through all these other stages again developing more flavor the final fermentation takes place in stage nine we call it proofing 
 proofing means to prove that the dough is alive 
 and at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape and it goes into the oven stage ten three transformations take place in the oven 
 the sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust they give us that beautiful brown crust only
 the crust can caramelize it 's the only place that gets hot enough 
 inside  the proteins this gluten coagulates when it gets to about one hundred and sixty degrees the proteins all line up and they create structure the gluten structure what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread  
 and the starches when they reach about one hundred and eighty degrees  
 gelatinize
  and gelatinization is yet another
 oven transformation coagulation 
 caramelization and gelatinization when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that 's around them  they they kind of swell and then they burst and they burst and they spill their guts 
  into the into the bread so basically now we 're eating yeast sweats sweat burps and starch guts 
 as bread and stage eleven we call it cooling because we never really eat the bread right away there 's a little carry over baking  the proteins have to set up strengthen and firm up 
 and then we have stage twelve which the textbooks call packaging but my students call eating and so we 're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to
  in a few minutes we will
 try this and see if we have succeeded in fulfilling this baker 's mission of pulling out flavor but i want to go back now
 and revisit these steps and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation because i really believe that
 all things
 can be understood and this is not my own idea this goes back to the scholastics and to the ancients that all things can be understood on four levels the literal 
 the metaphoric or poetic level  the political or ethical level and
  ultimately  the mystical or sometimes called the anagogical level it
 's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal in fact dante says you can 't understand the three deeper levels unless you first understand
 the literal level  so that 's why we 're talking literally about bread  but let 's kind of look at these stages again from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level all in my quest for answering the question what is it about bread that 's so special
 and fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor because what happens
 is bread begins as wheat
 or any other grain but what 's wheat wheat is a grass that grows in the field and like all grasses at a certain point it puts out seeds  
 and we harvest those seeds and those are the wheat kernels now in order to harvest it i mean what 's harvesting it 's just a euphemism for
  killing  right i mean  that 's what 's harvest we say we harvest the pig you know  yes we slaughter you know yes that 's life  we harvest the wheat 
 and in harvesting it we kill it  now wheat is alive and as we harvest it it gives up its seeds 
 now at least with seeds we have the potential for future
 we can plant those in the ground  and we save some of those for the next generation  but most of those seeds
 get crushed
 and turned into flour  and at that point the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity it 's not only been killed  but it 's been denied any potential for creating future life
  so we turn it into flour  
 so as i said  i think bread is a transformational food the first transformation and by the way the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else
 radical not subtle not like hot water
 made cold or cold water turned hot but water boiled off and becoming steam that 's a transformation two different things well in this case the first transformation is
 alive
 to dead i 'd call that radical so we 've got now this this flour  and what do we do we add some water in stage
  stage one we weigh it in stage two we add water and salt to it  mix it together and we create something that we call clay it 's like clay  
 and we infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call leaven 
 in this case it 's yeast but yeast is leaven what does leaven mean leaven comes from the root word that means
 enliven
 to vivify to bring to life  
 by the way what 's the hebrew word for clay
 adam 
 you see the baker  in this moment has become in a sense sort of the god of his dough you know and his dough  
 well while it 's not an intelligent life form is now alive and we know it 's alive because in stage three 
 it grows growth is the proof of life  and while it 's growing all these literal transformations are taking place enzymes are breaking forth sugars yeast is eating sugar and
  and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol bacteria is in there eating the same sugars turning them into acids in other words personality and character 's being developed in this dough under the watchful gaze of the baker  
 and the baker 's choices all along the way determine the outcome of the product 
 a subtle change in temperature a subtle change in time it 's all about a balancing act between time temperature and ingredients
  's the art of baking  so all these things are determined by the baker  and the bread goes through some stages and characters develop and then we divide it and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units and each of 
  those units are given shape by the baker  and as they 're shaped they 're raised again all along proving that they 're alive and developing character
  to the oven it 's still dough nobody eats bread dough a few people do i think but not too many i 've met some dough eaters but
 it 's not the staff of life right bread is the staff of life but dough is what we 're working with and we take that dough to the oven 
 and it goes into the oven as soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of one hundred and forty degrees  it passes what we call the thermal death point 
  they think it 's the name of a video game  
 but it 's the thermal death point all life ceases there the yeast whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough to enliven it to vivify it in order to complete its mission which is also to turn this dough into bread 
 has to give up its life  so you see the symbolism at work it 's starting to come forth a little bit you know it 's starting to make sense to me
 what goes in is dough what comes out is
 or it goes in alive comes out dead 
 third transformation first transformation alive to dead second transformation dead brought back to life  third transformation alive to dead but dough
 to bread 
 or another analogy would be a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly  and it 's what comes out of the oven that is what we call
  the staff of life  this is the the product that that
 everyone in the world eats that is so difficult to give up
 it 's so deeply embedded in our psyches that that bread is used as a symbol for life it 's used as a symbol for
  and so as we get to stage twelve and we partake of that again completing the life cycle you
 we have a chance to essentially ingest that it nurtures us and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this 
 so this is what i 've learned from bread this is what bread has taught me in my journey and
 what we 're going to attempt to do with this bread here again is to use  in addition to
  everything we talked about this bread we 're going to call spent grain bread because as you know bread making is very similar to beer making 
 beer is basically liquid bread or bread is solid beer 
 and 
 they they 're invented around the same time i think beer came first and
 the egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep in
  it turned into bread
