  for the next few minutes we 're going to talk about energy and it 's going to be a bit of a varied talk i 'll try to spin a story about energy and oil 's a convenient starting place the talk will be broadly about energy but oil 's a good place to start
 and one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff you take about eight
 eight or so carbon atoms about twenty hydrogen atoms you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid very 
 and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels it 's great stuff  now  as far as it goes 
 there 's a lot of oil out there in the world  here 's my little pocket map of where it 's all located 
 a bigger one for you to look at but this is it this is the
  oil in the world geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is this is about one hundred trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today  
 now that 's just one story about oil  and we could end it there and say well oil 's going to last forever because well there 's just a lot of it but there 's actually more to
 story than that oh by the way if you think you 're very far from some of this oil one thousand meters below where you 're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world  
 come talk to me about it i 'll fill in some of the details if you want 
 so that 's one of the stories of oil  there 's just a lot of it 
 but what about oil where is it in the energy system  
 here 's a little snapshot of one hundred and fifty years of oil  and it 's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those one hundred and fifty years
  little secret i 'm going to tell you about 
 for the last twenty five years oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems 
 there was one kind of peak oil in one thousand nine hundred and eighty five when oil represented fifty percent of global energy supply now it 's about thirty five percent it 's been declining and i believe it will continue to
  probably peaked in two thousand and seven and is declining so oil is playing a less significant role
 every year  and so twenty five years ago  there was a peak oil just like in the 1920s there was a peak coal 
 and a hundred years before that there was a peak wood  
 this is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems and what 's been taking up the slack in the last few decades well a lot of natural gas
 and a little bit of nuclear for starters  and what goes on in the future well  i think out ahead of us a few decades is peak gas 
 and beyond that peak renewables now i 'll tell you another little very important
 story about this picture now i 'm not pretending that energy use in total isn 't increasing it is that 's another part of the story come talk to me about it we 'll fill in some of the
  details but there 's a very important message here 
 this is two hundred years of history and for two hundred years we 've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system 
 energy systems of the world becoming progressively year on year decade on decade century on century becoming less carbon intense and that continues into the future with the renewables that we 're developing today  reaching maybe thirty percent of primary energy
 by mid century 
 now that might be the end of the story okay we just replace it all with conventional renewables but i think actually there 's more to the story than that and to tell the next part of the story and this is looking out say two thousand one hundred
 and beyond what is the future of truly sustainable carbon free energy  well we have to take a little excursion and we
 'll start in central texas  here 's a piece of limestone i picked it up outside of marble falls texas
  four hundred million years old and it 's just limestone nothing really special about it  
 now here 's a piece of chalk i
 picked this up at mit it 's a little younger  
 and it 's different than this limestone  you can see that you wouldn 't build a building out of this stuff  and you wouldn 't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this yeah it 's very different no it 's not different it 's not different 
  what 's different is how the molecules are put together  
 now  if you think that 's kind of neat the story gets really neat right now  off the coast of california
 comes this  it 's an abalone shell  
 now  millions of abalone every year make this shell  oh by the way just in case you weren 't already guessing
  's calcium carbonate  
 it 's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this 
 but it 's not the same stuff it 's different  it 's thousands of times maybe three thousand times tougher
 than this and why because the lowly abalone
 is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers  making this beautiful iridescent
 mother of pearl very specialized material that the abalone
 every day every year this is pretty incredible stuff  all the same what 's different  how the molecules are put together 
 now what does this have to do with energy  
 here 's a piece of coal  and i 'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk  
 now  whether we 're talking about fuels or energy carriers or perhaps novel materials for batteries
  or fuel cells 
 nature hasn 't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn 't need to 
 nature didn 't need to because unlike the abalone shell the survival of a species didn 't depend on building those materials  until maybe now
 when it might just matter so when we think about the future of energy  imagine what would it be like
  like if instead of this we could build the energy equivalent of this
 just by rearranging the molecules differently 
 and so that is my story 
 the oil will never run out it 's not because we have a lot of it  
 it 's not because we 're going to build a bajillion windmills  it 's because  well  
 thousands of years ago
  people invented ideas they had ideas innovations technology and the stone age ended 
 not because we ran out of stones 
 laughter it 's ideas  it 's innovation it 's technology that will end the age of oil  long before we run out of oil  thank you very much
