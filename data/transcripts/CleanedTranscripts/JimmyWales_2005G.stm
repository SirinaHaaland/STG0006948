  charles van doren who was later a senior editor of britannica said
 the ideal encyclopedia should be radical it should stop being safe 
 but if you know anything about the history of britannica since one thousand nine hundred and sixty two it was anything but radical still a very completely safe  
 stodgy type of encyclopedia
  wikipedia on the other hand  begins with a very radical idea  and that 's for all of us to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet
 is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge and that 's what we 're doing  so wikipedia you just saw the little demonstration of it it
 's a freely licensed encyclopedia it 's written by thousands of
  volunteers all over the world in many many languages
 it 's written using wiki software which is the type of software he just demonstrated so anyone can quickly edit and save and it goes live on the internet immediately
 and everything about wikipedia is managed by virtually an all volunteer staff so
 when yochai is talking about new methods of organization he 's exactly describing wikipedia 
 and what i 'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works
 on the inside
  so wikipedia 's owned by the wikimedia foundation which i founded a nonprofit organization and our goal the core aim of the wikimedia foundation 
 is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet and so if you think about what that means it means a lot more than just building a cool website we 're really interested in all the issues of the digital divide
  poverty worldwide empowering people everywhere to have the information that they need to make good decisions and so we 're going to have to do a lot of work
 that goes beyond just the internet and so that 's a big part of why we 've chosen the free licensing model  because that empowers local entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to they can take our content and do anything they like with it you can copy it redistribute it and
 you can do it commercially or non commercially so there 's a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around wikipedia
 all over the world
  we 're funded by donations from the public  and one of the more interesting things about that is
 how little money it actually takes to run wikipedia  so yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was and
 i 'm going to tell you what the cost of wikipedia is but first i 'll show you how big it is so we 've got
 over six hundred thousand articles in english we 've got two million total
  articles across many many different languages  the biggest languages are german japanese french
 all the western european languages are quite big 
 but only around one third of all of our traffic to our web clusters to the english wikipedia  which is surprising to a lot of people a lot of people think in a very  english centric way on the internet 
  for us we 're truly global we 're in many many languages
 how popular we 've gotten to be we 're a top 50 website and we 're more popular than the new york times so this is where we get to yochai 's
 discussion this shows the growth of wikipedia we 're the blue line there and this is the new york times over there 
 and what 's interesting about this is the new york times website is a huge enormous corporate operation with i have no idea how many hundreds of employees 
 we have exactly one employee
  and that employee is our lead software developer and he 's only been our employee since
 january two thousand and five all the other growth before that 
 so the servers are managed by a ragtag band of volunteers all the editing is done by volunteers 
 and the way that we 're organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine people are always asking well who 's in charge
  and the answer is anybody who wants to pitch in it 's a very unusual and chaotic
 thing we 've got over ninety servers now in three locations these are managed by volunteer
 system administrators who are online i can go online any time of the day or night and see
 eight to ten people waiting for me to ask a question or something anything about the servers
  you could never afford to do this in a company you could never afford to have a standby crew of people twenty four hours a day
 and do what we 're doing at wikipedia  
 so we 're doing around one point four billion page views monthly so it 's really gotten to be a huge thing 
 and everything is managed by the volunteers and the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about five thousand dollars  and that 's essentially our main cost 
 we could actually do without the employee 
  brian because he was working part time for two years and full time at wikipedia so we actually hired him so he could get a life and
 go to the movies sometimes 
 so the big question when you 've got this really chaotic organization is  why isn 't it all rubbish why is the website as good as it is  
 first of all how good is it well it 's pretty good it isn 't perfect but it 's
  much better than you would expect given our completely chaotic model so when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me 
 you think oh this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish 
 but when we 've seen quality tests and there haven 't been enough of these
 yet and i 'm really encouraging people to do more 
 comparing wikipedia to traditional things we we win hands down so a german magazine compared german wikipedia which is
  much smaller than english to microsoft encarta and to brockhaus  multimedial 
 and we won across the board they hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality  and
 we were very pleased with that result  
 so a lot of people have heard about the wikipedia bush kerry controversy 
 the media has covered this somewhat extensively it started out with an article in red herring
  the reporters called me up and they i mean i have to say they spelled my name right
 but they they really wanted to say the bush kerry election is so contentious it 's tearing apart the wikipedia community 
 and so they quote me as saying they 're the most contentious in the history of wikipedia what i actually said is they 're not contentious at all  so it 's
 a slight misquote the articles were edited quite
  and it is true that we did have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions time magazine recently reported that 
 extreme action sometimes has to be taken and wales locked the entries on kerry and bush for most of two thousand and four 
 this came after i told the reporter that we
 had to lock it for
 occasionally a little bit here and there  
 so the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think we have within the wikipedia community are not really controversies at all
  on controversial topics are edited a lot but they don 't cause much controversy within the community  and the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality
 the real struggle is not between the right and the left that 's where most people assume but it 's between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the
  no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on either of those qualities  the actual truth about the specific bush kerry incident is that the
 articles were locked less than one percent of the time in two thousand and four  and it wasn 't because they were contentious it was just because
 there was routine vandalism which happens sometimes even on stage 
 sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly and i said
  say please don 't do that that 's not
 a good thing  so how do we do this how do we manage the quality control how does it work
  so there 's a few elements  mostly social policies
 and some elements of the software so the the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point of view
  this is something that i set down from the very beginning as a core principle of the community that 's completely not debatable
 it 's a social concept of cooperation  so we don 't talk a lot about truth and objectivity the reason for this is if we say we 're only going 
  to write the truth about some topic that doesn 't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write because i don 't agree with you about what 's the truth 
 any time there 's a controversial issue wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue  we should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it so this neutrality policy 
 is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done  
  cultural backgrounds 
 by having this firm neutrality policy which is non negotiable from the beginning we ensure that people can work together and that the entries don 't become simply a war back and forth between the left and the right 
 if you engage in that type of behavior you 'll be asked to leave the community
  so real time peer review every single change on the site goes to the recent changes page so as soon as he made his change it went
  that recent changes page was also fed into an irc channel which is an internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools 
 and people can get rss feeds they can get email notifications of changes
 and then users can set up their own personal watch list so my page is on quite a few volunteers ' watch lists because it is sometimes vandalized and
  what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly  and then
 they 'll just simply revert the change there 's a new pages feed for example so you can go to a certain page of wikipedia and see every new page as it 's created this is really important because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted 
 but also that 's some of the most interesting and fun things some of the new articles people will start an article on some interesting topic other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help and
 make it much better
  so we do have edits by anonymous users which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about wikipedia  
 so  chris was able to do his change he didn 't have to log in or anything he just went on the website and made a change but it turns out that only about eighteen percent of all the edits to the website are done 
  by anonymous users  and that 's a really important thing to understand the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very
  of maybe six hundred to one thousand people who are in constant communication and we have over forty irc channels forty mailing lists 
 all these people know each other they communicate we have off line meetings these are the people who are doing the bulk of the site and they are in a sense
  what they 're doing the standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality we don 't always meet those standards but that
  we 're striving for and so that tight community is who really cares for the site and these are some of the smartest people i 've ever met it 's my job to say that but it 's actually true 
 the type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun
 tend to be pretty smart people the tools and the software there 's lots of tools that allow us allow us meaning the community
  and to monitor all the work this is an example of a page history
 on flat earth and you can see some changes that were made what 's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see ok i understand now when somebody goes and looks at
 they see that someone an anonymous ip number made an edit to my page that sounds suspicious who is this person somebody looks at it they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place
  these words have changed things like this so that 's one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor the history of a page  
 another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open ended 
 most of the social rules and the and the methods of work are left completely open ended in the software all of that stuff is just on wiki pages and so there 's nothing in the software that enforces the rules 
 the example i 've got up here is the votes for deletion page
  it needs to be deleted cases like that the administrators just delete it there 's no reason to have a big argument about it but you can imagine there 's a lot of other areas where the question is is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia is the information verifiable is it a hoax is it true is it what 
 so we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to
  and so the method that arose organically within the community is the votes for deletion page 
 and in the particular example we have here it 's a film twisted issues and the first person says now this is supposedly a film  
 it fails the google test miserably the google test is you look in google and see if it 's there because if something 's not even in google it probably doesn 't exist at all it
 's not a perfect rule  but it 's a nice starting point for quick research  
  i found it i found it in a book ' film threat video guide
 the twenty underground films you must see ' so the next persons says clean it up somebody says i 've found it on imdb keep keep keep 
 and what 's interesting about this is that the software is these votes are just text typed into a page this is not really a vote so much as it is a
  now it is true that at the end of the day 
 an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say ok  eighteen deletes two keeps we 'll delete it but in other cases  this could be
 eighteen deletes and two keeps and we would keep it because if those last two keeps say wait a minute nobody else saw this but i found it in a book and i found a link to a page that describes it and i 'm going to clean it up tomorrow so please don 't delete
 it then it would survive  
  is a very famous wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work with vandalism hoaxes and votes for deletion his voice carries a lot of weight within the community because he knows what he 's doing  
 so how is all this governed people really want to know about  administrators things like that so
 the wikipedia governance model the governance of the community is a very confusing but
  workable mix of consensus meaning we try not to vote on the content of articles because the majority view is not necessarily neutral
 some amount of democracy all of the administrators these are the people who have the ability to delete pages that doesn 't mean that they have the right to delete pages they still have to follow all the rules
 but they 're elected by the
  sometimes people
 random trolls on the internet like to accuse me of handpicking the administrators to bias the content of the encyclopedia  i always laugh at this because i have no idea how they 're elected actually 
 there 's a certain amount of aristocracy you got a hint of that when i mentioned like rickk 's voice would carry a lot more weight than someone we don 't know
 i give this talk sometimes
 with angela who was just re elected to the board from the community to the board of the foundation with more than twice the votes of the person who didn 't make it
  and i always
 embarrass her because i say well angela for example could get away with doing absolutely anything within wikipedia  because she 's so admired and so powerful but the irony is of course that
 angela can do this because she 's the one person who you know would never ever break any rules of wikipedia and i also like to say she 's the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia so 
 and then there 's monarchy and that 's my role on the community
 laughter i was describing this in
 in berlin once and the next day in the newspaper the headline said i am the queen of england and that 's not exactly what i said but 
 the point is
 my role in the community within the free software world there
  so if you look at most of the major free software projects they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees is the
 benevolent dictator well
 i don 't like the term benevolent dictator and i don 't think that it 's my job or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of
 the future of all human knowledge compiled by the world it just isn 't
  but there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy a certain amount of sometimes we have to make a decision and we don 't want to get bogged down too heavily in
 formal decision making processes so as an example of 
  how this can be important we recently had a situation where a neo nazi website discovered wikipedia and they said oh well this is horrible this jewish
 conspiracy of a website and we 're going to get certain articles deleted that we don 't like and we see they have a voting process so we 're going to send
 we have forty thousand members and we 're going to send them over
 and they 're all going to vote and get these pages deleted well they managed to get eighteen people to show up that 's neo nazi math for you 
 they always think they 've got forty thousand members when they 've got eighteen but
 they they managed to get eighteen people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to
  delete a perfectly valid article of course the vote ended up being about eighty five to eighteen so there was no real danger to our democratic processes on the other hand people said 
 but what are we going to do i mean this could happen what if some group gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote 
 then i said well fuck it we 'll just change the rules that 's my job in the community to say we won 't allow our openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content and so as long as people
  trust me in my role then that 's a valid place for me of course because of the free licensing if i do a bad job the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave i can 't tell anyone what to do 
 so the final point here is that to understand how wikipedia works it 's important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work but we are not
 fanatical web anarchists in fact we 're very flexible about the
  social methodology because ultimately the passion of the community is for the quality of the work 
 not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it  thank you 
 applause ben saunders yeah hi ben saunders jimmy you mentioned
 impartiality being a key to wikipedia 's success it strikes me that
 much of the textbooks that are used
  our children are inherently biased have you found wikipedia being used
 by teachers and how do you see wikipedia changing education jimmy wales yeah so a lot of teachers are beginning to use wikipedia
 there 's a media storyline
 about wikipedia which i think is false it builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers
  and the storyline is there 's this crazy thing wikipedia but academics hate it and teachers hate it 
 and that turns out to not be true  
 the last time i got an email from a journalist saying why do academics hate wikipedia i sent it from my harvard email address because i was recently appointed a fellow there and i said well  
 they don 't all hate it 
 but i think there 's going to be huge impacts and we actually have a project that i 'm personally really excited about which is the wikibooks project which is an effort to
  create textbooks in all the languages and that 's a much bigger project it 's going to take twenty years or so to come to fruition
