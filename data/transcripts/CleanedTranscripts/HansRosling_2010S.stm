  i still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people  
 and that was in one thousand nine hundred and sixty 
  i 'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future  
 but i will not use digital technology as i 've done during my first five tedtalks instead i have progressed and i am today  
  launching a brand new analog teaching technology that i picked up from ikea 
  world one thousand nine hundred and sixty had one billion people  
 in the developing world  she said they had two billion people  
 and they lived away then there was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world in
 the industrialized world people
  and they had small families and their aspiration was to buy a car  and in one thousand nine hundred and sixty all swedes were saving to try to buy a volvo like this 
 this was the economic level at which sweden was but in contrast to this in the developing world  far away 
 the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day 
 they were saving
  able to buy a pair of shoes 
 there was an enormous gap in the world when i grew up 
 and this gap between the west and the rest has created a mindset of the world which we still use linguistically when we talk about the west and the developing world 
 but the world
  and it 's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that
 taxonomy of the world and to understand it and that 's what i 'm going to show you 
 because since one thousand nine hundred and sixty what has happened in the world up to two thousand and ten is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population just look how many 
 the world population has doubled
 since i went to school and of course
  economic growth
 in the west a
 lot of companies have happened to grow the economy so the western population moved over to here and now their aspiration is not only to have a car now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly 
 so this is where they are today  and the most successful of the developing
  they have moved on you know  and they have become emerging economies we call them  they are now buying cars  
 and what happened a month ago was that the chinese company geely they acquired the volvo company  
 and then finally the swedes understood that something big had happened in the world 
 so there they are and the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes
  they are still almost as poor as they were fifty years ago 
 the new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions the three billions here  which are also becoming emerging economies  
 because they are quite healthy relatively well educated and they already also have two to three children per woman  as those
  and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also  but
 this is the world we have today  no longer any gap 
 but the distance from the poorest here the very poorest to the very richest over here is wider than ever  
 but there is a continuous world from walking 
  are people on all levels  and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle  this is the new world we have today in two thousand and ten  
 and what will happen in the future  
 well  i 'm going to project into two thousand and fifty 
 i was in shanghai recently  and i listened to what 's happening in china and it 's pretty sure that
 they will catch up just as
  japan did 
 all the projections [ say that ] this one [ billion ] will [ only ] grow with one to two or three percent [ but this second ] grows with seven eight percent and then they will end up here  they will start flying  
 and these
 lower or middle income countries  the emerging income countries they will also forge forwards economically  and if  
  we invest in the right green technology so that we can avoid severe climate change  and energy can still be relatively cheap
 then they will move all the way up here  and they will start to buy electric cars  this is what we what we will find there 
 so what about the poorest two billion what about the poorest two billion here 
  we already have two to three children per woman family planning is widely used and population growth is coming to an end here [ among the poorest ] population is growing  
 so these [ poorest ] two billion will in the next decades increase to three billion and they will thereafter
 increase to four billion  there is nothing but a nuclear war of a kind we 've never seen that can stop this
 because we already have this [ growth ] in process  
 but if  and only if [ the poorest ] get out of poverty they get education they get improved child survival they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [ to live ] here  then population growth will stop in two thousand and fifty 
 we cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes
 because then we get continued population growth
 and let me show you why by converting back to the old time digital technology 
 here i have on the screen my country bubbles  every bubble is a country the size is population  the colors show the continent the yellow on there is the americas  dark blue is africa  brown is europe green is
  this light blue is south asia that 's india and this is china size is population  here i have children per woman two children four children six children eight children big families 
 small families the year is one thousand nine hundred and sixty  and down here child survival  the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school sixty percent seventy percent  eighty percent ninety and
  as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries but look this is the world my teacher talked about in one thousand nine hundred and sixty one billion western world here high 
 small families and all the rest the rainbow of developing countries with very large families and poor child survival 
 what has happened i start the world here we go can you see as the years pass by child survival is increasing they get soap hygiene education
  penicillin and then family planning family size is decreasing [ when ] they get up to 90 percent child survival  then families decrease and most of the arab countries in the middle east is falling 
  down there [ to small families ] look bangladesh catching up with india the whole emerging world joins the western world with good child survival and
  see the poorest billion those [ two ] boxes i had over here  
 they are still up here  and they still have a child survival of only seventy to eighty percent meaning that if you have six children born 
 there will be at least four who survive to the next generation  and the population will double in one generation  
  only way of really getting
 world population [ growth ] to stop is to continue to improve child survival to ninety percent that 's why investments by gates foundation unicef and aid organizations together 
  with national government in the poorest countries are so good because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world we can stop at nine billion if we do the right things
  child survival is the new green it 's only by child survival that we will stop population growth  
 and will it happen well i 'm not an optimist 
 neither am i a pessimist i 'm a very serious possibilist 
 it 's a new category where we take emotion apart and we just work analytically with the world  it can be done 
 we can have a much more just world with green technology
 and with investments to alleviate poverty  and global governance the world can become like this 
 and look at the position of the old west remember when this blue box was all alone  leading the world living its own life 
 this will not happen [ again ] the role of the old west in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world
  nothing more nothing less  but it 's a very important role do it well and get used to it thank you very much
