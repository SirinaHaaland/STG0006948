  so here 's the good news about families 
 the last fifty years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family 
 we have blended families adopted families  we have nuclear families living in separate houses and divorced families living in the same house  
 but through it all the family has grown stronger
 eight in ten say the family they have today is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in 
 now here 's the bad news nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed by the chaos of family life 
 every parent i know myself included  feels like we 're constantly playing defense just when our kids stop
  they start having tantrums just when they stop needing our help taking a bath they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying 
 and here 's the worst news of all our children sense we 're out of control  
 ellen galinsky of the families and work institute asked one thousand children if you were granted one wish about your parents what would it be 
 the parents predicted the kids would say  spending more time with them 
 they were wrong  the kids ' number one wish
  that their parents be less tired and less stressed  
 so how can we change this dynamic are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress  draw our family closer  
 and generally prepare our children to enter the world  
 i spent the last few years trying to answer that question traveling around
  meeting families talking to scholars experts ranging from elite peace negotiators to warren buffett 's bankers to the green berets 
 i was trying to figure out what do happy families do right
 and what can i learn from them to make my family happier i
 want to tell you about one family that i met and why i think they offer clues at seven p m on a sunday in hidden springs idaho
  six members of the starr family are sitting down to the highlight of their week  the family meeting 
 the starrs are a regular american family with their share of regular american family problems 
 david is a software engineer  eleanor takes care of their four children ages ten to fifteen 
 one of those kids tutors math on the far side of town one has lacrosse on the near side of town one has asperger syndrome one has adhd 
 we were living in complete chaos eleanor said  
 what the starrs did
  next though was surprising instead of turning to friends or relatives they looked to david 's workplace 
 they turned to a  cutting edge program called agile development that was just spreading from manufacturers in japan to startups in silicon valley 
 in agile workers are organized into small groups and do things in very short spans of time  so instead of having executives issue grand proclamations
 the team in effect manages itself  you have constant feedback you have daily update sessions you have weekly reviews you 're constantly changing 
 david said when they brought this system into their home  
 the family meetings in particular increased communication decreased stress  and made everybody happier to be part of the family
  when my wife and i adopted these family meetings and other techniques
 into the lives of our then five year old twin daughters it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born  and these meetings had this effect
 while taking under twenty minutes so what is agile and why why can it help with something that seems so different like families 
 in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three jeff sutherland was a technologist at a financial firm in new england he was very frustrated with how software got designed
  followed the waterfall method right in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down to programmers below  and no one had ever consulted the programmers
 eighty three percent of projects failed they were too bloated or too out of date by the time they were done 
 sutherland wanted to create a system where
 ideas didn 't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom and be adjusted in real time
 he read thirty years of harvard business review before stumbling upon an article in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six called the new new product development game 
 it said that the pace of business was quickening and by the way this was in one thousand nine hundred
 and eighty six and the most successful companies were flexible  it highlighted toyota and canon and likened their adaptable
  as sutherland told me we got to that article and said that 's it 
 in sutherland 's system companies don 't use large massive projects that take two years they do things in small chunks nothing takes longer than two weeks  
 so instead of saying you guys go off into that bunker and come back with a cell phone or a social network 
 you say you go off and come up with one element then bring it back let 's talk about it let 's adapt
  fail quickly 
 today agile is used in a hundred countries and it 's sweeping into management suites  
 inevitably people began taking some of these techniques and applying it to their families 
 you had blogs pop up and some manuals were written 
 even the sutherlands told me that they had an agile thanksgiving where you had one one group of people working on the food one setting the table and one greeting visitors at the door
  sutherland said it was the best thanksgiving ever 
 so let 's take one problem that families face  crazy mornings  and talk about how agile can help 
 a key plank is accountability so teams use information radiators these large boards in which everybody is accountable  
 so the starrs in adapting this to their home created a morning checklist
  in which each child is expected to tick off chores so on the morning i visited eleanor came downstairs  poured herself a cup of coffee sat in a reclining chair
 and she sat there kind of amiably talking to each of her children as one after the other they came downstairs  checked the list made themselves breakfast  checked the list again 
  put the dishes in the dishwasher  rechecked the list fed the pets or whatever chores they had checked the list once more gathered their belongings and made their way to the bus 
 family dynamics i have ever seen 
 and when i strenuously objected this would never work in our house our kids needed way too much monitoring  eleanor looked at me 
 that 's what i thought she said i told david ' keep your work out of my kitchen ' but i was wrong 
 so i turned to david so why does it work he said you can 't underestimate the power of doing this 
 and he made a checkmark he said in the workplace adults love it with kids it 's heaven
 the week we introduced a morning checklist into our house  it cut parental screaming in half 
 but the real change didn 't come until we had these family meetings so following the agile model we ask three questions what worked well in our family this week  what didn 't work well and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead 
 everyone throws out suggestions and then we pick two to focus on 
  suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters ' mouths  what worked well this week  
 getting over our fear of riding bikes making our beds  what didn 't work well our math sheets or
 greeting visitors at the door 
 like a lot of parents 
 our kids are something like bermuda triangles like thoughts and ideas go in but none ever comes out i mean at least not that are revealing this gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts
 but the most surprising part was when we turned to what are we going to work on in the week ahead you
 know the key idea of agile is that teams essentially manage themselves and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids 
 our kids love this process so they would come up with all these ideas you know greet five visitors at the door this week get an extra ten minutes of reading before bed
 kick someone  lose desserts for a month  it turns out by the way
  our girls are little stalins we constantly have to kind of dial them back  
 now look naturally there 's a gap between their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week  
 but the truth is it didn 't really bother us it felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that wouldn 't light up their world for many years to come 
 three years later our girls are almost eight now we 're still holding these meetings my wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom
 so what did we learn  
 the word agile entered the lexicon in two thousand and one when jeff sutherland and a group of designers met in utah and wrote a 12 point agile manifesto  
 i think the time is right for an agile family manifesto  i 've taken some ideas from the starrs and from many other families i met  
  i 'm proposing three planks plank number one  adapt all the time 
 when i became a parent i figured you know what we 'll set a few rules and we 'll stick to them 
 that assumes as parents we can anticipate every problem that 's going to arise  we can 't
  what 's great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to what 's happening to you in real time  
 it 's like they say in the internet world if you 're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago you 're doing the wrong thing parents can learn a lot
 but to me adapt all the time means something deeper too 
 we have to break parents out of this straitjacket that the only ideas we can try at home are ones that come from
 shrinks or self help gurus or other family experts the truth is their ideas are stale whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas
  a few examples let 's take the biggest issue of all family dinner  
 everybody knows that having family dinner with your children is good for the kids but for so many of us it doesn 't work in our lives 
 i met a celebrity chef in new orleans who said no problem i 'll just time shift family dinner  i 'm not home can 't make family dinner we 'll have family breakfast we 'll meet for a bedtime snack we 'll make sunday meals more important 
 and the truth is recent research backs
 it turns out there 's only ten minutes of productive time in any family meal 
 the rest of it 's taken up with take your elbows off the table and pass the ketchup you can take that ten minutes and move it to any part of the day and have the same benefit 
 so time shift family dinner that 's adaptability an environmental psychologist
  if you 're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface you 'll be more rigid if you 're sitting on a cushioned chair you 'll be more open 
 she told me when you 're discipling your children sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface the conversation will go better 
 my wife and i actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations because i was sitting above in the power position 
 so move where you sit that 's adaptability  
 the point is there are all these new ideas out there we 've got to hook them up with
  parents so plank number one  adapt all the time be flexible be open minded let the best ideas win 
 plank number two  empower your children 
 our instinct as parents is to order our kids around  it 's easier and frankly we 're usually right there 's a reason that few systems have been more waterfall
  over time than the family  
 but the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible  enlist the children in their own upbringing 
 just yesterday we were having our family meeting and we had voted to work on overreacting 
 so we said okay  give us a reward and give us a punishment okay so one of my daughters threw out you get five minutes of overreacting time all week  so we kind of liked that 
 but then her sister started working the system she said do i get one
  or can i get ten 30 second overreactions 
 i loved that spend the time however you want  now give us a punishment  okay  if we get fifteen minutes
 of overreaction time that 's the limit every minute above that we have to do one pushup 
 so you see this is working now look this system isn 't lax there 's plenty of parental authority going on but we 're giving them practice becoming
  independent which of course is our ultimate goal 
 just as i was leaving to come here tonight one of my daughters started screaming the other one said overreaction overreaction 
 and started counting and within ten seconds it had ended to me that is a certified agile miracle
 and by the way  research backs this up too children who plan their own goals
 set weekly schedules  evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex and take more control over their lives  
 the point is we have to let our children succeed on their own terms  and yes on occasion fail on their own terms 
 i was talking to warren buffett 's banker and he was chiding me for not letting my children
 make mistakes with their allowance and i said but what if they drive into a ditch
 it 's much better to drive into a ditch with a $ six allowance than a 
  salary or a $ six million inheritance so the bottom line is empower your children  plank number three tell your story 
 adaptability is fine  but we also need bedrock  jim collins the
  told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common they preserve the core they stimulate progress  
 so agile is great for stimulating progress  but i kept hearing time and again you need to preserve the core  so how do you do that 
 collins coached us on doing something that businesses do which is define your mission and identify your core values  
 so he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement 
 we did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat we had a pajama
 i made popcorn 
 actually i burned one so i made two 
 my wife bought a flip chart and we had this great conversation like what 's important to us what values do we most uphold  and we ended up with ten statements 
 we are travelers not tourists we don 't like dilemmas  we like solutions again
 research shows that parents should spend less time worrying about what they do wrong
 and more time focusing
  on what they do right  worry less about the bad times and build up the good times 
 this family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right 
 a few weeks later we got a call from the school one of our daughters had gotten into a spat and suddenly we were worried like do we have a mean girl on our hands and we didn 't really know what to do so we called her into my
  the family mission statement was on the wall and my wife said so anything up there seem to apply and she kind of looked down the list and she said 
 bring people together suddenly we had a way into the conversation 
 another great way to tell your story is to tell your children where they came from 
 researchers at emory gave children a simple what do you know test 
 do you know where your grandparents were born do you know where your parents went to high school do you know anybody in your family who had a
 difficult situation an illness and they overcame it 
 the children who scored highest on this do you know scale had the highest self esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives 
 the do you know test was the single biggest predictor of emotional health and happiness 
 as the author of the study told me children who have a sense of
 they 're part of a larger narrative have greater
 self confidence so my final plank is tell your story  spend time retelling the story of your family 's positive moments
 and how you overcame the negative ones if you give children this happy narrative you give them the tools to make themselves
 happier  
 i was a teenager
  i first read anna karenina and its famous opening sentence all happy families are alike  each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way 
 when i first read that i thought that sentence is inane of course all happy families aren 't alike 
 but as i began working on this project i began changing my mind  
 recent scholarship has allowed us for the first time to identify the building blocks that successful families have 
 i 've mentioned just three
  here today  adapt all the time
 empower the children  tell your story 
 is it possible all these years later to say tolstoy was right  the answer i believe is yes 
 when leo tolstoy was five years old his brother nikolay came to him and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness on a little green stick  
 which he had hidden in a ravine
 on the family 's estate in russia  if the stick were ever found all humankind would be happy 
 tolstoy became consumed with that stick  but he never found it in fact he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden 
 he still lies there today  covered in a layer of green grass
  that story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that i learned 
 happiness is not something we find it 's something we make almost anybody who 's looked at well run organizations
 has come to pretty much the same conclusion greatness is not a matter of circumstance it 's a matter of choice  
 you don 't need some grand plan 
  need a waterfall you just need to take small steps accumulate small wins  keep reaching for that green stick 
 in the end this may be the greatest lesson of all what 's the secret to a happy family
