  three of my family members were gruesomely murdered in a hate crime  
 it goes without saying that it 's really difficult for me to be here today  but my brother deah 
  don 't give me much of a choice  i 'm hopeful that by the end of this talk you will make a choice  and join me in standing up against hate 
 it 's december twenty seven two thousand and fourteen the morning of my brother 's wedding day  
 he asks me to come over and comb his hair in preparation for his wedding photo shoot
  an american kid in dental school ready to take on the world 
 when deah and yusor have their first dance  i see the love in his eyes her reciprocated joy  and my emotions begin to overwhelm me 
 i move to the back of the hall and burst into tears and the second
  towards me buries me into his arms and rocks me back and forth  even in that moment when everything was so distracting he was attuned to me 
 he cups my face and says suzanne i am who i am because of you
 thank you for everything  i love you 
 about a month later i 'm back home in north carolina for a short visit and on the last evening i run upstairs to deah 's room
  eager to find out how he 's feeling being a newly married man 
 with a big boyish smile he says i 'm so happy  i love her she 's an amazing girl and she is 
 at just twenty one she 'd recently been accepted to join deah at unc dental school 
 she shared his love for basketball  and at her urging they started their honeymoon off attending their favorite team
  i mean check out that form i
 'll never forget that moment sitting there with him how free he was in his happiness my littler brother
  kid had become and transformed into an accomplished young man he was at the top of his dental school class  and alongside
  was involved in local and international community service projects dedicated to the homeless and refugees including a dental relief trip they were planning for syrian refugees in turkey
 razan at just nineteen  used her creativity as an architectural engineering student to serve those around her 
 making care packages for the local homeless among other projects 
 that is who they were
 standing there that night  i take a deep breath and look at deah and tell him i have never been more proud of you than i am in this moment 
 he pulls me into his tall frame hugs me goodnight and i leave the next morning without waking him to go back to san francisco 
 that is the last time i ever hug him  
 ten days later i 'm on call at san francisco general
  hospital when i receive a barrage of vague text messages expressing condolences  confused i call my father who calmly intones there 's been a shooting in deah 's neighborhood in chapel hill it 's on lock down that 's all we know 
 i hang up and quickly google shooting in chapel hill one hit comes up quote three people were
  shot in the back of the head and confirmed dead on the scene something in me just knows  i fling out of my chair and faint onto the gritty hospital floor wailing  
 i take the first red eye out of san francisco numb and disoriented  i walk into my childhood home and faint into my parents ' arms sobbing 
 i then run up to deah 's room as i did so many times before just looking for him  
 only to find a void that will never be filled
  investigation and autopsy reports eventually revealed the sequence of events 
 deah had just gotten off the bus from class razan was visiting for dinner already at home with yusor 
 as they began to eat they heard a knock on the door when
 deah opened it 
 their neighbor proceeded to fire multiple
  the girls were heard screaming  
 the man turned towards the kitchen and fired a single shot into yusor 's hip immobilizing her  
 he then approached her from behind pressed the barrel of his gun against her head and with a single bullet lacerated her midbrain 
 he then turned towards razan who was screaming for her life and execution style with a single bullet
 to the back of the head
 killed her on his way out he shot deah one last time a bullet in the mouth
 for a total of eight bullets two lodged in the head  two in his chest and the rest in his extremities
  were executed in a place that was meant to be safe their home for months this man had been harassing them
 knocking on their door  brandishing his gun on a couple of occasions his facebook was cluttered with anti religion posts
 yusor felt particularly threatened by him 
 as she was moving in 
 he told yusor and her mom that he didn 't like the way they looked 
 in response yusor 's mom told her to be kind to her neighbor that as he got to know them he 'd see them for who they were
 i guess we 've all become so numb to the hatred that we couldn 't have ever imagined it turning into fatal violence  
 the man who murdered my brother turned himself in to the police shortly after the murders  saying he killed three kids
 over a parking
  the police issued a premature public statement that morning echoing his claims without bothering to question it or further investigate it turns out
 there was no parking dispute  there was no argument no violation  
 but the damage was already done 
 in a 24 hour media cycle the words parking dispute had already become the go to sound bite  
  i sit on my brother 's bed and remember his words the words he gave me so freely and with so much love i am who i am because of you 
 that 's what it takes for me to climb through my crippling grief and speak out i cannot let my family 's deaths be diminished to a segment that is barely discussed on local news 
 they were murdered by their neighbor because of their faith  because of a piece of cloth they chose to don on their heads  because they were visibly muslim
 some of the rage i felt at the time was that if roles were reversed  and an arab muslim
  or muslim appearing person had killed three white american college students
 in their home what would we have called it a terrorist attack when white men commit acts of violence in the us
 they 're lone wolves  mentally ill or driven by a parking dispute  
 i know that i have to give my family voice  and i do the only thing i know how 
 i send a facebook message to everyone i know in media a
 couple of hours later in the midst of a chaotic house overflowing with friends and family our neighbor neal comes over
 sits down next to my parents and asks what can i do 
 neal had over two decades of experience in journalism  
 but he makes it clear that he 's not there in his capacity as journalist  but as a neighbor who wants to help 
 i ask him what he thinks we should do given the bombardment of local media interview requests he offers to set up
 a press conference at a
  even now i don 't have the words to thank him 
 just tell me when and i 'll have all the news channels present he said he did for us what we could not do for ourselves in a moment of devastation 
 i delivered the press statement still wearing scrubs from the previous night  and in under twenty four hours from the murders i 'm on cnn being interviewed by
  the following day major newspapers including the new york times chicago tribune published stories about deah yusor and razan 
 allowing us to reclaim the narrative and call attention the mainstreaming of anti muslim hatred  
 these days it feels like islamophobia is a socially acceptable form of bigotry 
 we just have to put up with it and smile the nasty stares  the palpable
  fear when boarding a plane  the random pat downs at airports that happen ninety nine percent of the time 
 it doesn 't stop there 
 we have politicians reaping political and financial gains off our backs  
 here in the us we have presidential candidates like donald trump casually calling to register american muslims and ban muslim
  immigrants and refugees from entering this country it is no coincidence that hate crimes rise in parallel with election cycles 
 just a couple months ago khalid jabara 
  christian was murdered in oklahoma by his neighbor a man who called him a filthy arab this man was previously jailed for a mere eight months after attempting
  over khalid 's mother with his car 
 chances are you haven 't heard khalid 's story  because it didn 't make it to national news  
 the least we can do is call it what it is a hate crime  the least we can do is talk about it 
 because violence and hatred doesn 't just happen in a vacuum 
 not long after coming back to
  the senior on rounds in the hospital when one of my patients looks over at my colleague gestures around her face and says san bernardino 
 referencing a recent terrorist attack  
 here i am having just lost three family members to islamophobia having been a vocal advocate within my program on how to deal with such 
 and yet silence i was disheartened  humiliated days later rounding on the same patient she looks at me and says
  people are killing people in los angeles 
 i look around expectantly again silence  
 i realize that yet again  i have to speak up for myself  
 i sit on her bed and gently ask her have i ever done anything but treat you with respect and
  have i done anything but give you compassionate care 
 she looks down and realizes what she said was wrong and in front of the entire team she apologizes and says i should know better i 
 i receive this kind of treatment all the time 
 many of us experience microaggressions on a daily basis  odds are you may have experienced it whether for your race
  religious beliefs we 've all been in situations where we 've witnessed something wrong and didn 't speak up maybe we weren 't equipped with the tools to respond in the moment  
 maybe we weren 't even aware of our own implicit biases 
 we can all agree that bigotry is unacceptable  but when we see it 
 because it makes us uncomfortable but stepping right into that discomfort
  means you are also stepping into the ally zone 
 there may be over three million muslims in america that 's still just one percent of the total population 
 martin luther king once said in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies  but the silence of our friends
  so what made my neighbor neal 's allyship so profound 
 a couple of things  
 he was there as a neighbor who cared  but he was also bringing in his professional expertise and resources when the moment called for it 
 others have done the same 
 larycia hawkins drew on her platform as the first tenured african american professor at wheaton college to wear a hijab in solidarity with muslim women who face discrimination every day
  as a result  she lost her job  
 within a month she joined the faculty at the university of virginia where she now works on pluralism  race faith and culture  
 reddit cofounder  alexis ohanian demonstrated that not all active allyship needs to be so serious  
 he stepped up to support a 15 year old muslim girl 's mission to introduce a hijab
  it 's a simple gesture  but it has a significant subconscious impact on normalizing and humanizing muslims  
 including the community as a part of an us instead of an other the
 editor in chief of women 's running magazine just put the first hijabi to ever be on the cover of a us fitness
  these are all very different examples of people who drew upon their platforms and resources in academia tech and media to actively express their allyship 
 what resources and expertise do you bring to the table 
 are you willing to step into your discomfort and speak up when you witness hateful bigotry will you be neal 
 many neighbors appeared in this story  and you in your respective communities all have a muslim neighbor
 colleague or friend your child plays with at school reach out to them let them know you stand with them in solidarity 
 it may feel really small but i promise you it makes a difference  
 nothing will ever
 but when we raise our collective voices that is when we stop the hate
