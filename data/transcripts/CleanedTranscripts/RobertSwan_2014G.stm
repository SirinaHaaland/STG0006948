  let 's go south 
 all of you are actually going south  this is the direction of
  and if you go eight thousand kilometers
 out of the back of this room you will come to as far south as you can go anywhere on earth  the pole itself 
 now i am not
 an explorer i 'm not an environmentalist i 'm actually just a
  and these photographs that i 'm showing you here
 are dangerous they are the ice melt of the south
 and north poles  and ladies and gentlemen we need to listen
 to what these places are telling us  
 and if we don 't  we will end up with our own survival situation here on planet
 i have faced
 these places and to walk across a melting ocean of ice is without doubt the most frightening thing
 that 's ever happened to me 
 antarctica is such a hopeful place
  it is protected by the antarctic treaty signed in
  ladies and gentlemen people already
 far up north from here in the arctic are already taking advantage
 of this ice melt
 taking out resources from areas already
 that have been covered in ice for the last ten twenty thirty thousand one hundred thousand years 
 can they not join the dots
 and think why is the ice actually melting
  is such an amazing place the antarctic  and i have worked hard for the last 
  years
 on this mission to make sure that what 's happening up here in the north does never happen  cannot happen
  where did this all begin it began for me at the age of eleven check out that haircut it 's a bit odd and at
 the age of eleven  i was inspired by the real explorers to want to try to be the first to walk to both poles  i found it
 incredibly inspiring
 that the idea of becoming a polar traveler went down pretty well with girls at parties
  when i was at university that was a bit more inspiring and after years seven years of fundraising seven years of being told no  seven years of being told by my family
 to seek counseling and psychiatric help  
 eventually three of us found ourselves marching to the south
  geographic pole on the longest unassisted march ever made anywhere on earth in history in this photograph we are standing in 
  an area the size of the united states of america and we 're on our own we have no radio communications no backup 
  ninety percent
 of all the world 's ice 
 seventy percent of all the world 's fresh water we 're standing on it this is the power
 of antarctica  on this journey we faced the danger of crevasses  intense cold so cold
 that sweat turns to ice inside your clothing your teeth can
  crack water can freeze in your eyes let 's just say it 's a bit chilly 
 and after seventy desperate days we arrive at the south pole we had done it  
 but something happened to me on that 70 day journey in 
  that brought me here  and it hurt
  in seventy days through damage our faces blistered out the skin ripped off and
 we wondered why  and when we got home we were told by nasa
 that a hole in the ozone had been discovered above the south pole and we 'd walked underneath it the same year it had been discovered
  we now head north sixty days  every step away from the safety of land across a frozen ocean it was desperately cold again here 's me coming
  in from washing naked at minus sixty celsius  and if anybody ever says to you
 disaster strikes 
 the arctic ocean melts beneath our feet four months before it ever had in history  and we 're one thousand kilometers from 
  safety the ice is crashing around us  grinding and i 'm thinking 
  realized we as a world are in a survival situation 
 and that feeling has never gone away for twenty five long years back then we had to march
 or die  and we 're not some tv survivor program when things go wrong for us  it 's life or death and our brave
  daryl who would become the first american to walk to the north pole his heel dropped off from frostbite two hundred klicks out he must keep going 
 he does and after sixty days on the ice we stood at the north pole we had done it  
  and sadly on return home it was not all fun  
 i became very low to succeed at something is often harder
 than actually making it happen  i was empty  lonely  financially destroyed
  i was without hope  but hope came in the form of the great jacques cousteau and he inspired me to take on the 
  mission being jacques he gave me clear instructions engage the world leaders  talk to industry and business  and above all rob 
 inspire young people because they will choose the future of the preservation of antarctica  for the world leaders we 've been to
 every world earth summit all three of them with our brave yacht 
 twice to rio  once in ' ninety two once in two thousand and twelve and for the earth summit in johannesburg  we made the longest
 overland voyage ever made with a yacht  thirteen thousand kilometers
 around the whole of southern africa doing our best to inspire over a million young people in person about 
 and about their environment for the last eleven years  we have taken over one thousand people
  people from industry and business women and men from companies students from all over the world down to antarctica 
 and during those missions  we 've managed to pull out over one thousand five hundred tons of twisted metal left in antarctica that took eight years  and i 'm so proud of it because
 we recycled all of it back here in south america  i have been inspired ever since i could
  walk to recycle by my mum here she is and my mum 
 my mum is still recycling and as she is in her
  when mum was born the population of our planet
 was only one point eight billion people 
 and talking in terms of billions  we have taken young people from industry and business from india from china  these are 
  nations and will be hugely important in the decision about
  the preservation of the antarctic  unbelievably  we 've engaged and inspired women to come from the middle east often
  for the first time they 've represented their nations in antarctica  fantastic people so inspired to look after antarctica
  you 've got
 to first engage people with this extraordinary place  
 form a relationship  form a bond form some love  
 it is such a privilege to go to antarctica i can 't tell you i feel so lucky  and i 've been 
  times in my life and all those people who come with us return home as great champions not only for
  antarctica  but for local issues back in their own nations let 's go back to where we began 
 the ice melt of the north and south poles and
 it 's not good news 
 nasa informed us six months ago
 that the western antarctic ice shelf is now disintegrating huge
  areas of ice look how big antarctica is even compared to here
 huge areas of ice are breaking off from antarctica the size of small nations  
 and nasa have calculated
 that the sea level will rise  it is definite 
 by one meter in the next one hundred years the same time that my mum has
  been on planet earth it 's going to happen and i 've realized that the preservation of antarctica
 and our survival here on earth are linked  
 and there is a very simple solution if we are using more renewable energy in the real world if we are being more efficient with the energy
  here running our energy mix in a cleaner way  there will be no financial reason
 to go and exploit antarctica  it won 't make financial sense and if we manage our energy better  
 we also may be able to slow down
  maybe even stop this great ice melt that threatens us it 's a big challenge  and what is our response to it  
 we 've got to go back
 one last time and at the end of next year we will go back to the south geographic pole  
 where we arrived thirty years ago on foot  and retrace our steps
  six hundred kilometers 
 but this time only using renewable energy to survive we will walk across those icecaps which far down below are melting  
 hopefully inspiring some solutions on that issue 
 this is my son  barney  he is coming with me he is
 committed to walking side by side with his father
  father and what he will do is to translate these messages
 and inspire these messages
 to the minds of future young leaders  i 'm extremely proud of him  good on him barney  
 ladies and gentlemen a survivor and i 'm good a survivor
  sees a problem
 and doesn 't go 
 a survivor sees a problem and deals with that problem before it becomes a threat  we have 
  years to preserve the antarctic  we all own it  we all have responsibility
 the fact that nobody owns it maybe means that we can succeed antarctica is a moral line in the snow  and on one side of that line we should fight  
 fight hard for this one beautiful pristine place left alone on earth i know it 's possible we are going to do it  
 and i 'll leave you with these words
 from goethe  i 've tried to live by them 
 if you can do 
 or dream you can 
 begin it now for boldness has genius power
 and magic in it good luck to you all  thank you very much
