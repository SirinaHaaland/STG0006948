  an ancient proverb that says it 's very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room
 especially when there is no cat i find this a particularly apt
 description of science and how science works
 bumbling around in a dark room  bumping into things  trying to figure out what shape this might be what that might be there are reports of a cat somewhere around 
 they may not be reliable they may be and so forth and so on  now i know this is different than the way most people think about science science we generally are told is a very well ordered mechanism for understanding the world for gaining facts for gaining data 
  use this thing called the scientific method and we 've been doing this for fourteen generations or so now and the scientific method is a set of rules for getting hard cold facts out of the data  
 i 'd like to tell you that 's not the case  so there 's the scientific method but what 's really going on
  so what is the difference then between the way
 i believe science is pursued and the way it seems to be perceived  so this difference first came to me in some ways in my dual role at columbia university where i 'm both a professor and run a laboratory
 in neuroscience where we try to figure out how the brain works we do this by studying the sense of smell the sense of olfaction
  and in the laboratory it 's a great pleasure and fascinating work and exciting to work with graduate students and post docs and think up cool experiments to understand how this sense of smell works and how the brain might be working and well 
 frankly it 's kind of exhilarating  
 but at the same time it 's my responsibility to teach a large course to undergraduates on the brain
  and that 's a big subject and it takes quite a while to organize that and it 's quite challenging and it 's quite interesting  but i have to say it 's not so exhilarating  
 so what was the difference well the course i was and am teaching is called cellular and molecular neuroscience
  lectures full of all sorts of facts it uses
  principles of neural science by three famous neuroscientists this book
 comes in at one thousand four hundred and fourteen pages  it weighs a hefty seven and a half pounds just to put that in some perspective that 's
 the weight of two normal human brains 
 so i began to realize by the end of this course that the students maybe were getting the idea that we must know everything there is to know about the brain
  that 's clearly not true  and they must also have this idea i suppose that what scientists do is collect data and collect facts and stick them in these big books and
 that 's not really the case either when i go to a meeting after the meeting day is over and we collect in the bar over a couple of beers with my colleagues  we never talk about what we know  
 we talk about what we don 't know  we talk about what still has to get done what 's so
  critical to get done in the lab  indeed this was i think best said by marie curie who said that one never notices what has been done but only what remains to be done  this was in a letter to her brother after obtaining her second graduate degree i should say i have
 to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of marie curie because i am convinced that that glow behind her is not
  it is true that her papers are to this day stored in a basement room in the 
  in a concrete room that 's 
  scholar and you want access to these notebooks you have to put on a full radiation hazmat suit so it 's
 pretty scary business 
 nonetheless this is what i think we were leaving out of our courses and leaving out of of the interaction that we have with the public as scientists the
 this is the stuff that 's exhilarating and interesting it is if you will  the ignorance that 's what was missing so i thought well maybe i should teach a course on ignorance  
 something i can finally excel at perhaps for example  so i did start teaching this course on ignorance and it 's been quite interesting and i
  like to tell you to go to the website you can find all sorts of information there  it 's wide open
  and it 's been really quite an interesting time for me to meet up with other scientists who come in and talk about what it is they don 't know now i use this word ignorance of course to be at least in part intentionally provocative 
 because ignorance has a lot of bad connotations and i clearly don 't mean any of those so i don 't mean stupidity i don 't mean a callow callow indifference to fact or reason or data  the ignorant are clearly unenlightened
  unaware  uninformed and present company today excepted often occupy elected offices it seems to me  
 that 's another story perhaps  i mean a different kind of ignorance i mean a kind of ignorance that 's less pejorative a kind of ignorance that comes from a communal gap in our knowledge something that 's just not there to be known or isn 't known well enough yet or we can 't make
  the kind of ignorance that 's maybe best summed up in a statement by james clerk maxwell perhaps the greatest physicist between newton and einstein who said thoroughly conscious ignorance is the prelude to every real advance in science i think it
 's a wonderful idea thoroughly conscious
 ignorance  
 so that 's the kind of ignorance that i want to talk about today but of course the first thing we have to clear up is what are we going to do with all those facts so it is true that science piles up at an alarming rate  we all have this sense that science is this mountain of
  facts this accumulation model of science as many have called it 
 and it seems impregnable it seems impossible how can you ever know all of this and indeed  the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate in two thousand and six there were one point three million papers published there 's about a two and a half percent yearly growth rate and so
 last year we saw over
  a half million papers being published divide that by the number of minutes in a year and you wind up with three new papers per minute  so i 've been up here a little over ten minutes i 've already lost three papers 
 i have to get out of here actually i have to go read  so what do we do about this well the fact is that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect if you will  we just don 't worry about it in a way the facts are
  you have to know a lot of stuff to be a scientist that 's true  but knowing a lot of stuff doesn 't make you a scientist you need to know a lot of stuff to be a lawyer or an accountant or an electrician or a carpenter  
 but in science  knowing a lot of stuff is not the point knowing a lot of stuff is there to help you get
 to more ignorance  so knowledge is a big subject  but i would say ignorance is a bigger one  
 so this leads us to maybe think about a little bit about some of the models of
  science that we tend to use and i 'd like to disabuse you of some of them so one of them a popular one is that scientists are patiently putting the pieces of a puzzle together to reveal some grand scheme 
  or another this is clearly not true for one with puzzles  the manufacturer has guaranteed that there 's a solution 
  so i think the puzzle model doesn 't work another popular model is that science is busy unraveling things the way you unravel the peels of an onion so peel by peel you take away the layers of the onion to get at some fundamental kernel of truth i don 't think that 's the way it works either 
 another one a kind of popular one is the iceberg idea that we only see the tip of the iceberg but
  underneath is where most of the iceberg is hidden but all of these models are based on the idea of a large body of facts that we can somehow or another
 get completed we can chip away at this iceberg and figure out what it is or we could just wait for it to melt i suppose these days but one way or another we could get to the whole iceberg right  
 or make it manageable but i don 't think that 's the case i think what really happens in science is a model more like the magic well where no matter how many buckets you take out there 's always another bucket of water to be had or my particularly favorite one
  one with the effect and everything  the ripples on a pond so if you think of knowledge being this ever expanding ripple on a pond  
 the important thing to realize is that our ignorance the circumference of this knowledge also grows with knowledge  so the knowledge generates ignorance  this is really 
  well said i thought by george bernard shaw this is actually part of a toast that he delivered to celebrate einstein at a dinner celebrating einstein 's work
 in which he claims that science just
 creates more questions than it answers [ science is always wrong it never solves a problem without creating ten more ] i find that kind of glorious  and i think he 's precisely right  plus it 's a kind of job security 
 as it turns out he kind of cribbed that from the philosopher immanuel kant who a hundred years earlier had come up with this idea of question propagation that every answer begets more questions i love that term question propagation this idea of questions
  out there  so i 'd say the model we want to take is not that we start out kind of ignorant and we get some facts together and then we gain we gain knowledge it 's rather kind of the other way around really 
 what do we use this knowledge for what are we using this collection of facts for we 're using it to make better ignorance to come up with if you will
  not all the same scientists argue about this all the time  sometimes we call them bull sessions  sometimes we call them grant proposals  but nonetheless it
 's what the argument is about it 's the ignorance it 's the what we don 't know  it 's what makes a good question  
 so how do we think about these questions i 'm going to show you a graph that that shows up quite a bit on happy hour posters in various science departments 
 this graph asks
  relationship between what you know and how much you know about it  so what you know you can know anywhere from nothing to everything of course and how much you know about it can be anywhere from a little to a lot
  so
 let 's put a point on the graph there 's an undergraduate doesn 't know much but they have a lot of interest they 're interested in almost everything  now
  you look at a master 's student a little further along in their education and you see they know a bit more but it 's been narrowed somewhat and finally you get your ph d where it turns out you know a tremendous amount about almost nothing 
 what 's really disturbing is the trend line that goes through that
 because of course when it dips below the zero axis there it gets into a negative area that 's where you find people
  the important thing here is that this can all be changed this whole view can be changed by just changing the label on the x axis so instead of how much you know about it we could say what can you ask about it 
 so yes you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist but the purpose of knowing a lot of stuff
 is not just to know a lot of stuff that just makes you a geek  right  knowing a lot of stuff the purpose is to be able to ask lots of questions to be able to frame thoughtful interesting
  questions  because that 's where the real work is let me give you a quick idea of a couple of these sorts of questions i 'm a neuroscientist so how would we come up with a question in neuroscience because it 's not always quite so 
 straightforward so for example we could say well what is it that the brain does well one thing the brain does it moves us around we walk around on two legs
  not that interesting so instead maybe we want to choose something a little more complicated to look at how about the visual system
 there it is the visual system i mean we love our visual systems we do all kinds of cool stuff indeed there are over twelve thousand neuroscientists who work on the visual system 
 from the retina to the visual cortex in an attempt to understand not just the visual system but to also understand how general principles of how the brain
  might work but now here 's the thing 
 our technology has actually been pretty good at replicating what the visual system does  we have tv  we have movies we have animation we have photography  
 we have pattern recognition all of these sorts of things they work differently than our visual systems in some cases  but nonetheless we 've been pretty good at making a technology work like our visual system  
  or another a hundred years of robotics you never saw a robot walk on two legs because robots don 't walk on two legs because it 's not such an easy thing to do 
 a hundred years of robotics and we can 't get a robot that can move more than a couple steps one way or the other you ask them to go up an inclined plane and they fall over turn around and they fall over it 's a serious problem  so what is it that 's
  most difficult thing for a brain to do what ought we to be studying perhaps it ought to be walking on two legs or the motor system i 'll
 give you an example from my own lab my own particularly smelly question  since we work on the sense of smell  but here 's a diagram of
 five molecules and sort of a chemical notation these are just plain old molecules but if you sniff those molecules up these two little holes in the front of your face you will have in your mind the distinct impression of a rose if there 's a real rose there those molecules will be the ones
 even if there 's no rose there you 'll have the memory of a molecule how do we turn molecules into perceptions  
 what 's the process by which that could happen here 's another example two very simple molecules again in this kind of chemical notation it might be easier to visualize them this way so the gray circles are carbon 
  atoms the white ones are hydrogen atoms and the red ones are oxygen atoms now these two molecules differ by only one carbon atom and two little hydrogen
  that ride along with it and yet one of them heptyl acetate has the distinct odor of a pear and hexyl acetate is unmistakably banana  
 so there are two really interesting questions here it seems to me one is how can a simple little molecule like that create a perception in your brain that 's so clear as a pear or a banana  and
  how the hell can we tell the difference between two molecules that differ by a single carbon atom  
 i mean that 's remarkable to me clearly the best chemical detector on the face of the planet and you don 't even think about it do you 
 so this is a favorite quote of mine that takes us back to the ignorance and the idea of questions i like to quote because i think dead people shouldn 't be excluded from the conversation
 and i also think it 's important
  to realize that the conversation 's been going on for a while by the way so erwin schrodinger a great quantum physicist and i think philosopher points out how you have to abide by ignorance for an indefinite 
  period of time and it 's this abiding by ignorance that i think we have to learn how to do this is a tricky thing this is not such an easy business 
  in the age of google and wikipedia the business model of the university and probably secondary schools is simply going to have to change  we just can 't sell facts for a living anymore they 're available 
 with a click of the mouse or if you want to you could probably just ask the wall one of these days wherever they 're going to hide the things that tell us all this stuff  so what do we have to do we have to give our students a taste 
  for the boundaries for what 's outside that circumference for what 's outside the facts what 's just beyond the facts
  facts 
 how do we do that well one of the problems of course  turns out to be testing  we currently have an educational system
 which is very efficient but is very efficient at a rather bad thing so in second grade all the kids are interested in science the girls and the boys  they like to take stuff apart  they have great curiosity  they like to investigate things they go to science museums they like to
 play around they 're in second grade  
 they 're interested  but by 11th or 12th grade fewer than ten percent of them
 have any interest in science whatsoever let alone a desire to go into science as a career  so we have this remarkably efficient system
 for beating any interest in science out of everybody 's head is this what we want
  think this comes from what a teacher colleague of mine calls the bulimic method of education 
 you know you can imagine what it is we just jam a whole bunch of facts down their throats over here and then they puke it up on an exam over here and everybody goes home with no added intellectual heft whatsoever 
 this can 't possibly continue to go on  so what do we do well the geneticists i have to say have an interesting maxim they live by geneticists always say you
  always get what you screen for  and that 's meant as a warning  
 so we always will get what we screen for and part of what we screen for is in our testing methods well 
 we hear a lot about testing and evaluation and we have to think carefully when we 're testing whether we 're evaluating or whether we 're weeding  whether we 're weeding people out whether we 're making some cut
  evaluation is one thing you hear a lot about evaluation in the literature these days in the educational literature but evaluation really amounts to feedback and it amounts to an opportunity for trial and error it amounts to
 a chance to work over a longer period of time with with this kind of feedback 
 that 's different than weeding and usually i have to tell you when people talk about evaluation evaluating students evaluating teachers  evaluating schools
  evaluating programs  that they 're really talking about weeding  and that 's a bad thing because then you will get what you select for 
 which is what we 've gotten so far so i 'd say what we need is a test that says what is x and the answers are i don 't know because no one does or what 's the question even better or you know what i 'll look it up
 i 'll ask someone  i 'll phone someone  i 'll find out because that 's what we want people to do and that 's how you evaluate them and maybe for the advanced placement classes it could be here 's the 
  answer what 's the next question that 's the one i like in particular so let me end with a quote from william butler yeats who said education is not about filling buckets
