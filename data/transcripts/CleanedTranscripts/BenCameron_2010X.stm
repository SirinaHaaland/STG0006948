  i am a cultural omnivore one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an ipod
 an ipod that contains wagner and mozart pop diva christina aguilera  country singer josh turner gangsta rap artist kirk franklin concerti symphonies and more and more
  voracious reader a reader who deals with ian mcewan down to stephanie meyer i have read the twilight tetralogy 
 and one who lives for my home theater 
 a home theater where i devour dvds video on demand and a lot of television for me law & order svu tina fey and thirty rock and judge judy the people
  i 'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions especially my passion for judge judy 
 and you 'd fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us 
 but i 'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life a passion for the live professional performing arts 
 performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire yes but jazz as well modern dance opera
  theater and more and more and more
 frankly it 's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology  
 while we initially heralded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems  
 we now realize that the internet is if anything too effective in that regard  
 depending on who you read an arts organization or an artist who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer now competes with between three and
  five thousand different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day  
 we now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time 
 five years ago  gen xers spent twenty point seven hours online and tv the majority on tv gen yers spent even more twenty three point eight hours
  arrives at college already having spent twenty thousand hours online and an additional ten thousand hours playing video games
 a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined  
  we 're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption  
 thanks to the internet we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it delivered to our own doorstep 
 we can shop at three in the morning or eight at night ordering jeans tailor made for our unique body types
  expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts which have set curtain times 
 set venues attendant inconveniences of travel parking and the like simply cannot meet 
 and we 're all acutely aware what 's it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony  opera or ballet ticket 
 when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet twenty four hours a day for ninety nine cents a song or for free 
 these are enormous questions for those of us that work in this terrain but as particular as they feel
  to us we know we 're not alone 
 all of us are engaged in a seismic fundamental realignment of culture and communications 
 a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry the magazine industry the book and publishing industry and more  
 saddled in the performing arts as we are by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming
 locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the  19th century
 and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues where we charge exorbitant prices  many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of tower records and ask
  everyone i talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of adrienne rich who in
 dreams of a common language wrote we are out in a country that has no language no laws  
 whatever we do together is pure invention the maps they gave us are out of date
 by years 
 and for those of you who love the arts aren 't you glad you
  brink of our own annihilation i prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation a reformation like the religious reformation of the 16th century 
 the arts reformation like the religious reformation is spurred in part by technology with indeed  the printing press really leading the charge on the religious
  both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion internal  self doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models  
 and at heart both reformations i think were asking the questions who 's entitled to practice  how are they entitled to practice and indeed  do we need anyone to intermediate 
  for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine  
 chris anderson someone i trust you all know editor in chief of wired
  magazine and author of the long tail really was the first for me to nail a lot of this 
 he wrote a long time ago you know thanks to the invention of the internet 
 web technology minicams and more  the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history  
 in the 1930s
  if any of you wanted to make a movie you had to work for warner brothers or or rko because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more 
 and now who in this room doesn 't know a fourteen year old hard at work on her second third or fourth movie 
 laughter similarly  the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history  again in the ' 30s warner brothers
  rko did that for you now go to youtube facebook you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom 
 this double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market 
 a time when anyone is a potential author  
 frankly what we 're seeing now in this environment is a massive time when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting  
 but the number of arts participants people who
  write poetry who sing songs who perform in church choirs is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations 
 this group  others have called the pro ams amateur artists doing work at a professional level you see them on youtube in dance competitions film festivals and more  
 they are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary  while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy
  of our traditional institutions  ultimately we now live in a world defined not by consumption  but by participation 
 but i want to be clear  
 just as the religious reformation did not spell the end to the formal church or to the priesthood  i believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance 
 they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity not
  opulence of dignity and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home 
 but to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community is by far too shortsighted  
 and indeed while we 've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional the single most exciting development in the last five to ten years
 has been the rise of the
  professional hybrid artist 
 the professional artist who works not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage but most frequently around women 's rights or human rights or on global warming issues or aids relief 
  for more not out of economic necessity but out of a deep organic conviction that the work that she or he is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment
  's dance world is not defined solely by the royal winnipeg ballet or the national ballet of canada  but by liz lerman 's dance exchange a 
  professional dance company whose dancers range in age from eighteen to eighty two 
 and who work with genomic scientists to embody the dna strand and with nuclear physicists at cern
  today 's professional theater community is defined not only the shaw and stratford festivals  but by the cornerstone theater of los angeles
 a collective of artists that after nine eleven  brought together ten different religious communities the baha 'i the catholic the muslim  the jewish  even the native american and the gay and lesbian communities of faith 
 helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play where they explored the differences in
  faith and found commonality as an important first step toward 
  healing  
 today 's performers like rhodessa jones work in women 's prisons  helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration while today 's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and more
  i think rather than being annihilated the performing arts are poised on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been 
 you know we 've said for a long time we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town and absolutely i hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community 
 generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy  dollars spent in restaurants or on parking at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes the piano
  tuner who tunes the instruments and more  
 but the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward especially in industries we can 't even imagine yet  
 just as they have been central to the ipod and the computer game industries which few if any of us could have foreseen ten to fifteen years ago  
 business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence  the ability to listen deeply to have empathy
 to articulate change to motivate others the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter  
 especially now 
 as we all must confront the fallacy of a market only orientation  uninformed by social conscience 
 we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters and especially characters of the young
  people who all too often are subjected to bombardment of sensation rather than digested experience
 ultimately especially now in this world where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws  in reality tv that thrives on humiliation 
 and in a context of analysis
 where the thing we hear most repeatedly day in day out in the united states in every train station every bus station every plane station is ladies and gentlemen  please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest to you 
 when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion 
 the arts whatever they do whenever they call us
  invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity god
 knows if we ever needed that capacity in human history  we need it now 
 you know we 're bound together 
 not i think by technology  entertainment and design but by common cause  
 we work to promote healthy vibrant societies to ameliorate human suffering
  to promote a more thoughtful  substantive  empathic world order 
 i salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work whatever your purpose may be 
 i promise you the hand of the doris duke charitable foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come  and i thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon
