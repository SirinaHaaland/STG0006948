  'm going to talk about the power of a word jihad 
 to the vast majority of practicing muslims jihad is an internal struggle
  against vice  sin  temptation lust greed it is a struggle to try and live a life that is
 set by the moral codes written in the koran  
 in that original idea the concept of jihad is as important to muslims
 as the idea of grace is to
  christians it 's a very powerful word jihad  if you look at it in that respect and there 's a certain
 almost mystical resonance to it and that 's the reason why for hundreds of years muslims everywhere have named their children jihad  their daughters
 as much as their sons in the same way that say christians name their daughters
  my people name our daughters bhakti which means in sanskrit  spiritual worship  
 but there have always been in islam a small group a minority  
 who believe that jihad is not only an internal struggle but also an external struggle against forces that would threaten the faith or the faithul 
 and some of these people believe that in that struggle it is sometimes okay
  take up arms  
 and so the thousands of young muslim men who flocked to afghanistan in the  1980s to fight against the soviet occupation of a muslim country  
 in their minds they were fighting a jihad  
 they were doing jihad  and they named themselves the mujahideen which is a word that comes from the same root
  forget this now but back then
 the mujahideen were celebrated in this country  
 in america  we thought of them as as holy warriors who were taking the good fight to the ungodly communists 
 america gave them weapons gave them money gave them support encouragement  
 but within that group a tiny smaller group a minority within a minority within a minority were coming up with a new
  new and dangerous
 conception of jihad  and in time this group would come to be led by osama bin laden 
 and he refined the idea his idea of jihad was a global war of terror  
 primarily targeted at the far enemy at the crusaders from the
  and the things he did in the pursuit of this jihad were so horrendous so monstrous  and had such great impact that his definition
 was the one that stuck 
 not just here in the west  we didn 't know any better  we didn 't pause pause to ask  we just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers were
 calling what they did jihad then that 's what jihad must mean but it wasn 't just
  us even in the muslim world 
 his definition of jihad began to gain acceptance 
 a year ago i was in tunis  
 and i met the the imam of a very small mosque an old man fifteen years ago he named his granddaughter jihad  
 after the old meaning he hoped that a name like that would inspire her to live
 a spiritual life but he told me that
  after nine eleven 
 he began to have second thoughts  
 he worried that if he called her by that name especially outdoors  outside in public  
 he might be seen as endorsing bin laden 's idea of jihad  
 on fridays in his mosque he gave sermons trying to reclaim the meaning of the word  
 but his congregants  the people who came to
  mosque  they had seen the videos  they had seen pictures of the planes going into the towers the towers coming down  
 they had heard bin laden say that that was jihad  and claimed victory for it and so the old imam worried that
 his words were falling on deaf ears no one was paying attention  
 he was wrong some people were paying attention but for the wrong reasons the united states
  this point was putting pressure on all its arab allies including tunisia to stamp out extremism in their societies  
 and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs
 of the tunisian intelligence service  they had never paid him any attention before old man small mosque
 but now they began to pay visits  and sometimes they would drag him in for questions and always the same question
  you name your granddaughter
 jihad  why do you keep using the word jihad in your friday sermons 
 do you hate americans what is your connection to osama bin laden 
 so to the tunisian intelligence agency and organizations like it all over the arab world 
  bin laden 's definition
 had become institutionalized that was the power
 of that word that he was able to do and it filled this this old imam it filled him with great sadness 
 he told me that of bin laden 's many crimes this was in his mind one that didn 't get enough attention that he took this word this
  he didn 't so much appropriate it as kidnapped it and debased it and corrupted it
 and turned it into something it was never meant to be  and then persuaded all of us that it always was
 a global jihad  but 
 the good news is that the global jihad is almost over as bin laden defined it
  it was dying well before he did  and now it 's on its last legs  opinion polls from all over the muslim world show that there is very little interest
 among muslims
 in a global holy war against the west against the the far enemy  the supply of of young men willing to
 fight and die for this cause is dwindling  
 the supply of money just as important more important perhaps the supply of money to this activity is also dwindling the wealthy fanatics who were previously
 sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous 
 what does that mean for us in the west does it mean we can break out the champagne  
 wash our hands of it  disengage  sleep easy at night
  is not an option  because if you let local
 jihad survive  it becomes international jihad  and so there 's now a lot of different
 violent jihads all over the world in somalia in mali in nigeria 
 in iraq in afghanistan pakistan  there are groups that claim to be
 the inheritors of the legacy of osama bin laden  they use his rhetoric 
 they even use the brand name he created for his jihad  so there is now an al qaeda in the
 islamic maghreb there 's an al qaeda in the arabian peninsula there is an al qaeda in mesopotamia 
  there are other groups in nigeria boko haram in somalia al shabaab and they
 all pay homage to osama bin laden but if you look closely  
 they 're not fighting a global jihad they 're fighting battles over much narrower issues  
 usually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism  or it 's a power struggle more often than not it 's a power struggle in
  even a small region within one country  occasionally they will go across a border from iraq to syria 
  from mali to algeria from somalia to kenya but they 're not fighting a global jihad against some far enemy  
 but that doesn 't mean
 that we can relax i was in yemen
  it 's the home of the last al qaeda franchise
 that still aspires
 to attack america  attack the west it 's old school al qaeda 
 you may remember these guys they are the ones who tried to send the underwear bomber here and they were using the internet to try and instigate
 violence among american muslims  but they have been distracted recently last year they took control over a portion of southern
  and then the yemeni military got its act together and ordinary people rose up against
 these guys and drove them out and since then most of their activities most of their attacks have been directed at yemenis 
 so i think we 've come to a point now where we can say that just like all politics all jihad is local  
 but that 's still not reason
 for us to disengage  because we 've seen that movie before
  before  in afghanistan  when those mujahideen defeated the soviet union we disengaged  
 and even before the fizz had gone out of our celebratory champagne  
 the taliban had taken over in kabul  and we said local jihad
  and then the taliban gave the keys of kandahar to osama bin laden he made it our problem 
 local jihad  if you ignore it becomes global jihad again 
 the good news is that it doesn 't have to be  
 we know how to fight it now  we have the tools we have the knowhow  
 and we can take the lessons we 've learned from
 fight against global jihad the victory against global jihad  and apply those
 to local jihad  what are those lessons 
 we know who killed bin laden  seal team six 
 do we know do we understand  who killed bin ladenism  who ended the global jihad  
 there lie the answers to the solution to local jihad  who killed bin
  let 's start with bin laden himself 
 he probably thought nine eleven was his greatest achievement  in reality  it was the beginning of the end for him  
 he killed three thousand innocent people and that filled the muslim world with horror and revulsion
 and what that meant was that his his idea of jihad could never become mainstream  
 he condemned himself to operating on the lunatic fringes of his own community
  nine eleven didn 't empower him  it doomed him  
 who killed bin ladenism  abu musab  al zarqawi killed it  he was the
 especially sadistic head of al qaeda in iraq who sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack not americans
 but iraqis muslims  
  sunni as well as shiites any claim that al qaeda had to being protectors of islam against the western crusaders
 was drowned in the blood
 of iraqi muslims  who killed
 osama bin laden  the seal team six  who killed bin ladenism  al jazeera did al jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations
  television stations in a lot of these countries
 which were designed to keep information from people 
 al jazeera brought information to them 
 showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion exposed the hypocrisy of osama bin laden and al qaeda 
 and allowed them gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclusions
  who killed bin ladenism  the arab spring did because it showed a way for young muslims to bring about change
 in a manner that osama bin laden with his limited imagination could never have conceived  
 who defeated the global jihad  the american military did the american soldiers did  with their allies fighting in faraway battlefields
 and perhaps a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it 
 so all these factors and many more besides we don 't even fully understand some of them
 yet these came together
 to defeat a monstrosity as big as bin ladenism  the
  you needed this group effort now not all of these things will work in local jihad  the american military is not going to march into nigeria to take on boko haram  
 and it 's unlikely that seal team six will rappel into the homes of al shabaab 's leaders and take them out 
 but many of these other factors
 that were in play are now even stronger than before half the work is already done  we don 't have to reinvent the wheel
  the notion of violent jihad in which more muslims are killed than any other kind of people is already thoroughly discredited  we don 't have to go back to that 
 satellite television and and the internet
 are informing and empowering young muslims in exciting new ways  
 and the arab spring has produced governments many of them islamist governments who
  know that for their own self preservation they need to take on the extremists in their midsts  
 we don 't need to persuade them but we do need to help them because
 they haven 't really come to this place before the good news again is that
 a lot of the things they need we already have and we are very good at giving
  not just money  but expertise  technology knowhow 
 private investment  
 fair terms of trade  medicine  education  
 technical support for training for their police forces to become more effective for their anti terror forces to become more
 efficient
  we 've got plenty of these things some of the other things that they need
 we 're not very good at giving  maybe nobody is time patience subtlety understanding
 these are harder to give i live in new york now just this week posters have gone up in subway stations in new york that describe jihad as savage
  we can say that
