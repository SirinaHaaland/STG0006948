  so this right here
 is the tiny village of elle close to lista it 's right at the southernmost tip of norway 
 and on january two this year an elderly guy who lives in the village  he went out to see what
  was cast ashore during a recent storm  
 and on a patch of grass right next to the water 's edge  he found a wetsuit  
 it was grey and black  and he thought it looked cheap out
 of each leg of the wetsuit there were sticking two white bones  
 it was clearly the remains of a human being 
 and usually
  norway  dead people are identified quickly  so the police started searching through missing reports from the local area national missing reports and looked for accidents with a possible connection 
 they found nothing so they ran
 a dna profile  and they started searching internationally through interpol nothing  
 this was a person that nobody seemed to be missing  it was an invisible life
 heading for a nameless grave  
 but then after a month  the police in norway got a message from the police in the netherlands 
 a couple of months earlier  they had found a body in an identical wetsuit and they had no idea who this person was 
 but the police in the netherlands managed to trace the
  that was sewn in the suit  so they were then able to tell
 that both wetsuits were bought by the same customer
 at the same time october seven  two thousand and fourteen in the french city of calais by the english channel  
 but this was all they were able to figure out the customer paid cash there was no surveillance footage from the shop 
  became a cold case  
 we heard this story and it triggered me and my colleague photographer tomm christiansen and we of course had the obvious question who were these people 
 at the time i 'd barely heard about calais  but it took about two or three seconds to figure out calais is basically known for two things it
 's the spot in continental europe closest to britain  
 and a lot of migrants and refugees are staying in this camp and are
  trying desperately to cross over to britain  
 and right there was a plausible theory about the identity of the two people  and the police made this theory as well  
 because if you or i or anybody else with a firm connection to europe goes missing off the coast of france people would just know 
 your friends or family would report you missing the police would come search for you  the media would know and there would be pictures of you on lampposts it 's difficult to disappear without
  but if you just fled the war in syria  and your family if you have any family left don 't necessarily know where you are and you 're staying here illegally
 amongst thousands of others who come and go every day  well  if you disappear one day nobody will notice  
 the police won 't come search for you because nobody knows you 're gone  
 and this is what happened to shadi omar
  and tomm went to calais for the first time in april this year  and after three months of investigation we were able to tell the story about how these two young men fled the war in syria  
 ended up stuck in calais  bought wetsuits and drowned in what seems to have been an attempt to swim across the english channel in order to reach england  
 it is a story about the fact that
  everybody has a story everybody is someone  but it is also a story about what it 's like to be a refugee in europe today  
 so this is where we started our search  this is in calais 
 right now between three thousand five hundred and five thousand people are living here under horrible conditions it has been dubbed the worst refugee camp in europe  
 limited access to food  limited access to water  limited access to health care  disease and infections are widespread  
 and they 're all stuck here because
  they 're trying to get to england in order to claim asylum  and they do that by hiding in the back of trucks headed for the ferry or the eurotunnel 
 or they sneak inside the tunnel terminal at night to try to hide on the trains  
 most want to go to britain because they know the language and so they figure it would be easier to restart their lives from
  they want to work they want to study they want to be able to continue their lives 
 a lot of these people are highly educated and skilled workers  if you go to calais and talk to refugees you 'll meet lawyers politicians  engineers  graphic designers farmers soldiers you 've got the whole spectrum
  but who all of these people are
 usually gets lost in the way we talk about refugees and migrants because we usually do that in
  so you have sixty million refugees globally about half a million have made the crossing over the mediterranean into europe so far this year  and roughly four thousand are staying in calais but
 these are numbers and the numbers don 't say anything about who these people are where they came from or why they 're here 
 and first i want to tell you about one of them 
  we first heard about him after being in calais the first time looking for answers to the theory of the two dead bodies  
 and after a while we heard this story about a syrian man who was living in bradford in england 
 and had been desperately searching for his nephew mouaz for months  and it turned out the last time anybody had heard anything from mouaz was october seven  two thousand and fourteen that was the same date the wetsuits were bought  
 so we flew over there and we met the uncle and we did dna samples of him
 and later on got additional dna samples from mouaz 's closest relative who now lives in jordan  
 the analysis concluded the body who was found in a wetsuit on a beach in the netherlands was actually mouaz al balkhi 
 and while we were doing all this investigation we got to know mouaz 's story  he was born in the syrian capital of damascus in
  in a middle class family and his father in the middle there is a chemical engineer who spent eleven years in prison for belonging to the political opposition in syria 
 while his father was in prison mouaz took responsibility and he cared for his three sisters  they said he was that kind of guy mouaz studied to become
 an electrical engineer at the university of damascus  so a couple of years into the syrian war  the family fled damascus and went to the neighboring
  country jordan 
 their father had problems finding work in jordan and mouaz could not continue his studies so he figured ok the best thing i can do to help my family would be to go somewhere where i can finish my studies
 and find work so he goes to turkey in turkey  he 's not accepted at a university  
 and once he had left jordan as a refugee he was not allowed to reenter  so then he decides to head for
  the uk where his uncle lives 
 he makes it into algeria  walks into libya  pays a people smuggler to help him with the crossing into italy by boat and from there on he heads to dunkirk  the city right next to calais by the english channel 
 we know he made at least twelve failed attempts to cross the english channel by hiding in a truck  but at some point  he must have given up all hope
  the last night we know he was alive  he spent at a cheap hotel close to the train station in dunkirk  we found his name in the records  and he seems to have stayed there alone  
 the day after  he went into calais  
 entered a sports shop a couple of minutes before eight o 'clock in the evening  along with shadi kataf 
 they both bought wetsuits and the woman in the shop was the last person we know of to have seen them alive
 we have tried to figure out where shadi met mouaz but we weren 't able to do that 
 but they do have a similar story  
 we first heard about shadi after a cousin of his living in germany 
 had read an arabic translation of the story made of mouaz on facebook  so we got in touch with him 
  was also raised in damascus  he was a working kind of guy  he ran a tire repair shop and later worked in a printing company  
 he lived with his extended family but their house got bombed early in the war  
 so the family fled to an area of damascus known as camp yarmouk  
 yarmouk is being described as the worst place to live on planet earth they 've been bombed by
  military they 've been besieged  they 've been stormed by isis and they 've been cut off from supplies for years 
 there was a un official who visited last year  and he said they ate all the grass so there was no grass left out
 of a population of one hundred and fifty thousand only eighteen thousand are believed to still be left in yarmouk  
 shadi and his sisters got out the parents are still
  stuck inside  
 so shadi and one of his sisters  they fled to libya
  this was after the fall of gaddafi  but before libya turned into full blown civil war  
 and in this last remaining sort of stability in libya  shadi took up scuba diving
 and he seemed to spend most of his time underwater  he fell completely in love with the ocean
 so when he finally decided that he could no longer be in libya  
 late august two thousand and fourteen  he hoped to find work as a diver when he reached italy 
 reality was not that easy 
 we don 't know much about his travels because he had a hard time communicating with his family but we do know that he struggled  
 and by the end of september  he was living on the streets somewhere in france
  october seven  he calls his cousin in belgium and explains his situation he said i 'm in calais i need you to come get my backpack and my laptop i
 can 't afford to pay the people smugglers to help me with the crossing to britain  but i will go buy a wetsuit and i will swim 
 his cousin of course tried to warn him not to but
 shadi 's battery on the phone went flat  and his phone was never switched on again
 what was left of shadi was found nearly three months later 
 eight hundred kilometers away in a wetsuit on a beach in norway  
 he 's still waiting for his funeral in norway  and none of his family will be able to attend  
 many may think that the story about shadi 
  but i don 't agree to me this is a story about two questions that i think we all share 
 what is a better life and what am i willing to do to achieve it 
 and to me and probably a lot of you a better life would mean being able to do more of what we think of as meaningful whether that be spending more time with your family and friends travel 
  to an exotic place or just getting money to buy that cool new device or a pair of new sneakers
 this is all within our reach pretty easily  
 but if you are fleeing a war zone  the answers to those two questions are dramatically different 
 a better life is a life in safety  it 's a life in dignity 
 a better life means not having your house bombed 
 not fearing being kidnapped it means being able to send your children to school go to university or just find work to be able to provide for yourself
  and the ones you love a better life would be a future of some possibilities compared to nearly none  and that 's a strong motivation  
 and i have no trouble imagining that after spending weeks or even months
 as a second grade citizen living on the streets or in a horrible makeshift camp
 with a stupid racist name like the jungle
 most of us would be willing to do just about anything 
 if i could ask shadi and mouaz the second they stepped into the freezing waters of the english channel 
 they would probably say this is worth the risk 
 because they could no longer see any other option and
  but that 's the reality of living as a refugee in western europe in two thousand and fifteen 
 thank you bruno giussani 
 thank you anders  this is tomm christiansen who took most of the pictures you have seen and they 've done reporting together tomm 
 you two have been back to calais recently
  this was the third trip it was after the publication of the article what has changed what have you seen there tomm christiansen the first time we were in calais it was about one thousand five hundred refugees there 
 they had a difficult time but they were positive they had hope  the last time  the camp has grown  maybe four or five thousand people it
 seemed more permanent
  the refugees have stayed for a longer time  and
 the french government has managed to seal off the borders better so now
 the jungle is growing  along with the despair and and hopelessness among 
  you planning to go back  and continue the reporting tc yes bg anders
  i 'm a former journalist and to me it 's amazing that in the current climate of slashing budgets and publishers in crisis
 dagbladet has consented so many resources for this story  which tells a lot about newspapers taking the responsibility but how did you sell it to your editors anders
 fjellberg it wasn 't easy at first  because
 we weren 't able to know what we actually could figure out 
 as soon as it became clear that we actually could be able to identify who the first one was we basically got
  the message that we could do whatever we wanted just travel wherever you need to go do whatever you need to do just
 get this done bg that 's an editor taking responsibility the story by the way has been translated and published across
 several european countries and certainly will continue to do and we want to read the updates from you  thank you anders
