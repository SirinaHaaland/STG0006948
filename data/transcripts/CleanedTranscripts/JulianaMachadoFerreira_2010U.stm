  illegal wildlife trade in brazil
 is one of the major threats against our fauna especially birds  and mainly to supply the pet market
 with thousands of animals taken from nature every month  and transported far from their
  origins to be sold mainly in rio de janeiro and so paulo  
 it is estimated that all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in brazil withdraw from nature
 almost   thirty eight million animals every year a business worth almost two billion dollars 
 the police intercepts these huge cargos with live animals
  intended to supply the pet market  or they seize the animals directly from the people 's houses  
 and this is how we end up every month with thousands of seized animals  
 and for us to understand what happens with them  we 're going to follow brad 
 in the eyes of many people after the animals are seized they say
  yay  justice has been served the good guys arrived  took the cute mistreated animals from the hands of the evil traffickers  and everyone lived happily ever after 
 but did they 
 actually no  and this is where many of our problems begin because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals 
 in brazil they are usually
  first sent to governmental triage facilities in which most of the cases the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers 
 in two thousand and two these centers received 
  thousand animals of which thirty seven thousand were birds and the police estimates that we seize
 seize only five percent of what 's being trafficked  some lucky ones and among them brad
 go to serious rehabilitation centers after that and in these places they are cared for 
 they train their flying  they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature 
 and they are able to socialize with others from the same species 
 but then what the brazil ornithological society so now
  we 're talking only birds
 claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature 
 therefore it would be too risky to release these animals  both for the released and for the natural populations  
 they also claim that we spend too many resources in their rehabilitation
  only in the state of so paulo  only in two thousand and six  but some researchers  myself included
 some ngos and some people from the brazilian government
  believe there is an alternative 
 we think that if and when the animals meet certain criteria concerning their health  behavior  inferred origin and whatever we know about the natural populations 
 then technically responsible releases are possible both
  of the individual  and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems  because we will be returning genes for these populations which could be important for them
 in facing environmental challenges
 and also we could be returning potential seed dispersers  predators  preys  etc
  all of these were released by us on the top the turtles are just enjoying freedom

  this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release and on the bottom my personal favorite the little male over there four hours after his release he was together with a wild female 
 so this is not new people have been doing this around the world  but it 's still a big issue in brazil we believe we have performed responsible releases
  we 've registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks 
 so these genes are indeed going back to the populations
