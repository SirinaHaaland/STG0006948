  that you are a product designer and you 've designed a product a new type of product  called the human immune system 
 you 're pitching this product to a
  let 's call him bob  i think we all know at least one bob right 
 how would that go 
 bob  i 've got this incredible idea for a completely new type of personal health product  it 's called the human immune system  
 i can see from your face that you 're having some problems with this don 't worry i know it 's very complicated i don 't want to take you through the
  i just want to tell you about some of the amazing features of this product 
 first of all it cleverly uses redundancy by having millions of copies of each component leukocytes white blood cells
 before they 're actually needed to create a massive buffer against the unexpected  
 and it cleverly leverages diversity by having not just leukocytes but b cells  t cells  natural killer cells
  the components don 't really matter the point is that together this diversity of different approaches
 can cope with more or less anything that evolution has been able to throw up 
 and the design is completely modular 
 you have the surface barrier of the human skin you have the very rapidly reacting innate immune system and then you have the highly targeted
 immune system  the point is that if one system fails  another can take over creating a virtually foolproof system  
 i can see i 'm losing you bob but stay with me because here
 is the really killer feature  the product is completely adaptive  it 's able to actually develop
 targeted antibodies to threats
  that it 's never even met before 
 it actually also does this with incredible prudence  
 detecting and reacting to every tiny threat  and furthermore  remembering every previous threat  in case
 they are ever encountered again what i 'm pitching you today is actually not a stand alone product  the product is embedded
  embedded in the larger system of the human body and it works in complete harmony with that system 
 to create this unprecedented level of biological protection so bob just tell me honestly what do you think of my product and
 bob may say something like  i sincerely appreciate the effort and passion that have gone
 into your presentation blah blah blah
  it 's total nonsense  
 you seem to be saying that the key selling points of your product are that it is inefficient and complex  
 didn 't they teach you 80 20 
 and furthermore you 're saying that this product is siloed  
 it overreacts makes things up as it goes along and is actually designed for somebody else 's benefit i 'm sorry to break it to you but i don 't
  think this one is a winner
  if we went with bob 's philosophy  i think we 'd actually end up with a more efficient immune system and efficiency is always important in the short term 
 less complex more efficient more bang for the buck  who could say no to that unfortunately 
 there 's one very tiny problem and that is that the user of this product you or i would probably die within
 one week of the next winter  when we encountered a new strain of the influenza virus  i first became interested
 in biology and business  and longevity and resilience  when i was asked a very unusual question
 by the ceo of a global tech company and the question
  what do we have to do to make sure that our company lasts one hundred years 
 a seemingly innocent question but actually it 's a little trickier than you might think 
 considering that the average us public company now
 can expect a life span
 of only thirty years that is less than half of the life span that its employees can expect to enjoy now
  you were the ceo of such a company  
 badgered by investors and buffeted by change  we might forgive you for not even worrying too much about what happens thirty years out  
 but here 's something that should keep you awake at night  
 the probability that your company will not be around in five year 's time on average
  is now a staggering thirty two percent that 's a one in three chance
 that your company will be taken over or will fail within just five years  
 let 's come back to our tech ceo 's question where better to turn for advice
 than nature that 's been in the business of life and death for longer than any company
  as a lapsed biologist  i decided to immediately call a real biologist  my friend simon levin  
 professor of biology and mathematics at princeton university 
 together  we looked at a variety of biological systems  
 ranging from natural tropical rainforests through to managed forests and fisheries  
 and we asked ourselves the question what makes these systems
 resilient and enduring
 and what we found
 was that the same six principles that we saw underpinning the miracle of the human immune system actually cropped up again and again  
 from redundancy
 through to embeddedness in fact we saw these principles not only in biologically enduring systems  we also found them being very characteristic of
  like the roman empire and the catholic church believe it or not we also went on to look at business and found that these very same properties
 also characterized businesses that were resilient and long lived and we noted their absence
 from ones which were short lived 
 let 's first take a look at what happens when the corporate immune system collapses
  this beautiful building is part of the  shitennoji temple complex in osaka japan in fact  it 's one of the oldest temples in japan 
 it was built by a korean artisan because at the time  japan was not yet building temples and this korean artisan went on to found a
  in fact it became the oldest continuously operating company in the world so how is kong gumi doing today 
 not too well i 'm afraid  it borrowed very heavily during the bubble period of the japanese economy to invest in real estate and when the bubble burst
  burst  it couldn 't refinance its loans  the company failed  and it was taken over
 by a major construction company  
 tragically after forty generations of very careful stewardship by the kong family 
 kong gumi succumbed to a spectacular lapse in the ability to apply a principle of prudence
  speaking of company failures we 're all familiar
 with the failure of kodak  the company that declared bankruptcy in january two thousand and twelve 
 much more interesting however is the question why did fujifilm same
  same pressures from digital technology same time why was fujifilm able to survive and flourish  
 fujifilm used its capabilities in chemistry material science and optics
 to diversify into a number of areas  
 ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals to medical systems to biomaterials some of these diversification attempts failed
  but in aggregate  it was able to adapt its portfolio
 sufficiently
 to survive and flourish  
 as the ceo mr komori put it the strategy succeeded because it had more pockets and drawers than the rivals  
 he meant of course that they were able to create more options than the rivals  
 fujifilm survived because it
  applied the principles of prudence diversity
 and adaptation 
 a catastrophic factory fire like the one we see here completely wiped out in one evening  the only plant
 which supplied toyota with valves for car braking systems  the ultimate test of resilience
  car production ground to a screeching halt 
 how was it then that toyota was able to recover car production 
 can you imagine how long it took just five days  from having no braking valves to complete recovery in five days  
 how was this possible toyota managed its network of suppliers in such a collaborative
  manner
 that it could work very quickly and smoothly with suppliers to repurpose production  
 fill the missing braking valve capacity
 and have
 car production come online again 
 toyota applied the principles of modularity of its supply network embeddedness in an integrated system
 and the functional redundancy to be able to repurpose
 smoothly existing capacity 
 now fortunately  
 few companies succumb to catastrophic fires  but we do read in the newspaper every day about companies succumbing
 to the disruption of technology  
 how is it then that the consumer optics giant essilor is able to avoid technology disruption and even profit from it
  and yes technology disruption is not only a big deal in software and electronics  
 essilor carefully scans the competitive environment
 for potentially disruptive technologies it acquires those technologies very early before they 've become expensive or competitors have mobilized
  and it then develops those technologies itself even at the risk of failure
 or the risk of self disruption 
 essilor stays ahead of its game and has delivered spectacular performance for over forty years by using the principles of prudence
 and adaptation  
 ok if these principles are so powerful you might be thinking why are they not commonplace in business why do we not use these words every day
 well change has to first start in the mind if we think back to our pitch to bob 
 in order to apply the principles that underpin the miracle of the human immune system  
 we first need to think differently about business  
 now typically when we think about business  we use what i call mechanical thinking 
 we set goals  we analyze problems we construct
 and we adhere to plans and more than anything else  we stress efficiency and short term performance now
 don 't get me wrong this is a splendidly practical and effective way of addressing relatively simple challenges in relatively stable environments it
 's the way that bob and probably many of us myself included process most
  faced with every day in fact  it was a pretty good mental model for business overall until about the
 when the conjunction of globalization
 and a revolution in technology and telecommunications made business far more dynamic and unpredictable 
 but what about those more dynamic and unpredictable situations that we now increasingly face  
 i think in addition
 to the mechanical thinking we now need to master the art
  of biological thinking 
 as embodied by our six principles 
 in other words  we need to think more modestly and subtly about when and how we can shape 
 rather than control 
 unpredictable and complex situations  
 it 's a little like the difference between throwing a ball
 and releasing a bird
 the ball would head in a straight line probably towards the intended target and the bird certainly would not 
 so what do you think sounds a little impractical a little theoretical perhaps 
 not at all every small entrepreneurial company
 naturally thinks and acts biologically
 why because it lacks the resources to shape its environment through brute force it lacks the scale to buffer change 
 and it 's constantly thinking about the tough odds for a start up to survive 
 now the irony is of course that every large company started off as a small entrepreneurial company  but along the way somewhere many have lost this ability to
  think and act biologically they need to rejuvenate their ability to think biologically
 in order to survive and thrive in today 's environment 
 so let 's not just think about short term performance every company i know spends plenty of time
 thinking about the central question of strategy how good is our competitive game
  addition let 's also consider the second more biological and equally important question how long will that game last  thank you very much
