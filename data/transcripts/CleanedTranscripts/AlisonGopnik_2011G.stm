  going on in this baby 's mind  
 if you 'd asked people this thirty years ago  most people including psychologists would have said that this baby was irrational  illogical egocentric that he couldn 't take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect
  in the last twenty years developmental science has completely overturned that picture  
 so in some ways we think that this baby 's thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists  let me give you just one example of this 
 one thing that this baby could be thinking about that could be going on in his mind is trying to figure out what 's going on in the mind of that other baby 
 after all one of the things
  that 's hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling  
 and maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn 't actually exactly like what we think and feel anyone who 's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get 
 we wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people now the question
  is how could we ask them 
 babies after all can 't talk  and if you ask a three year old to tell you what he thinks what you 'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that 
 so how do we actually ask them the question well it turns out that the secret was broccoli  
 what we did betty rapacholi who was one of my students and i was actually to give the babies two
  bowls of food one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers  now all of the babies even in berkley like the crackers and don 't like the raw broccoli 
 but then what betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl  
 and she would act as if she liked it or she didn 't so half the time she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn 't like
  the broccoli just like a baby and any other sane person  but half the time what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go mmmmm 
 broccoli i tasted the broccoli mmmmm 
 and then she would take a little bit of the crackers and she 'd go eww yuck 
 crackers  i tasted
  as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted we did this with fifteen and eighteen month old babies 
 and then she would simply put her hand out and say can you give me some 
 so the question is what would the baby give her what they liked or what she liked 
 and the remarkable thing was that eighteen month old babies just barely walking and talking would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers  but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli
  on the other hand fifteen month olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli like they couldn 't figure this out 
 but then after they stared for a long time they would just give her the crackers  what they thought everybody must like 
 so there are two really remarkable things about this the first one is that these little eighteen month old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature that we don 't always
  want the same thing  and what 's more they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted  
 even more remarkably though the fact that fifteen  month olds didn 't do this suggests that these eighteen month olds had learned this deep profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were fifteen months old 
 so children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought  and this
  is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last twenty years that 's actually demonstrated it 
 the question you might ask though is why do children learn so much and how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time i mean 
 after all if you look at babies superficially they seem pretty useless and actually in many ways they 're worse than useless because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive
 but if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies 
 it turns out that there 's actually an answer if we look across many many different species of animals not just us primates but also including other mammals birds  even
 marsupials like kangaroos and wombats it turns out that there 's a relationship
 between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are 
 and sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there on one side is a new caledonian crow and crows and other corvidae  ravens rooks and so
  are incredibly smart birds they 're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects and this is a bird on the cover of science who 's learned how to use a tool to get food 
 on the other hand we have our friend the domestic chicken  and chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps  so they 're very 
 very good at pecking for grain and they 're not much good at doing anything else  
  they depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths
 for as long as two years which is a really long time in the life of a bird  whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months 
 so childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of science and the chickens end up in the soup pot 
 there 's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to
  knowledge and learning  well what kind of
 explanation could we have for this  
 well some animals like the chicken seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well  so they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment 
 other creatures like the crows aren 't very good at doing anything in particular  but they 're extremely good at learning about laws of different environments  and of course
  we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows  we have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal we 're smarter we 're more 
  flexible we can learn more we survive in more different environments we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space 
 and
 at least until they 're twenty three we 're still popping those worms into those little open mouths all
 right why would we see this correlation  well an idea is that that strategy that learning strategy is an extremely powerful great strategy for getting on in the world  but it has one big disadvantage 
 and that one big disadvantage is that until you
  actually do all that learning you 're going to be helpless  so you don 't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself a slingshot or maybe a 
  spear might work which would actually be better you want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up 
  we don 't have to do anything all we have to do is learn 
 and then as adults we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world  
 so one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species  
 so they 're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas  and we 're production and marketing we
  to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and
 actually put them to use 
 another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups  we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species 
 kind of like caterpillars and butterflies except that they 're actually the brilliant
 butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring and we 're the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow grownup adult path  
 if this is true if these babies are designed to learn and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning that 's what they 're for
 we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms  
 and in fact the baby 's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet  but real computers are actually getting to be a lot
  better  and there 's been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently and it all depends on the ideas of this guy  the reverend thomas bayes who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century  
 and essentially what bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize
  the way that scientists find out about the world  
 so what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with they go out and test it against the evidence 
 the evidence makes them change that hypothesis then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth  
 and what bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that and that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now 
 and some ten years ago  i suggested that babies might be doing the same thing  so if
  you want to know what 's going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes  i think it actually looks something like this this is reverend bayes 's notebook so i think those babies are actually making complicated
  calculations with conditional probabilities that they 're revising to figure out how the world works all
  if you ask even grownups about statistics they look extremely stupid how could it be that children are doing statistics 
 so to test this we used a machine that we have called the blicket detector this is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others and using this very simple machine 
  my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world  let me mention just one that we
 did with tumar kushner my student 
 if i showed you this detector you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector  
 but actually this detector works in a bit of a strange way  because if you wave a block over the top of the detector something you wouldn 't ever think of to begin with 
 the detector will actually activate two out of three times  whereas  if you do
  the likely thing put the block on the detector it will only activate two out of six times
  so the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence it looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy  so we did just this 
 we gave four year olds this pattern of evidence and we just asked them to make it go and sure enough  the four 
  these are four year olds they 're just learning how to count  
 but unconsciously they 're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure  
 and the other interesting thing is that they 're using that evidence to get to an idea get to a hypothesis about the world that seems very unlikely to begin with 
 and in studies we 've just been doing in my lab similar studies we 've show that four  year olds are actually
 better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task  
 so in these circumstances the children are using statistics to find out about the world  but after all scientists also do experiments  and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments when children do experiments we call it getting into
  there 's been a bunch of interesting
 studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program here 's one from cristine legare 's lab what cristine did was use our blicket detectors  
 and what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn
 't  and then she showed them an anomaly  and what you 'll
 see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes
  now this is his next idea he told the experimenter
  to try putting it out onto the other location  not working either
  particularly adorable
  and articulate little boy  but what cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical if you look at the way children play when you ask them to explain something what they really do is do a series of experiments 
 this is actually pretty typical of four year olds 
 well what 's it like to be this kind of creature what 's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes  well if you go back to those psychologists and
  a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all  and i think just the opposite is true  i think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults  
 now here 's what we know about how adult consciousness works  and adults ' attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight  so what happens for adults is we decide that something 's 
  relevant or important we should pay attention to it our consciousness of that thing that we 're attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid  and everything else
  sort of goes dark 
 and we even know something about the way the brain does this so what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex the sort of executive part of our brains sends a signal that makes a 
  little part of our brain much more flexible more plastic better at learning and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains  so we have a
  if we look at babies and young children we see something very different i think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness 
 so babies and young children are very bad
 at narrowing down to just one thing  but they 're very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once  
 and if you actually look in their brains you see that they 're flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at
  inducing learning and plasticity  and the inhibitory parts haven 't come on yet  
 so when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention what we really mean is that they 're bad at not paying attention  so they 're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that 's important  
 that 's the kind of attention the kind of consciousness that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to
 well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults  i think the best thing is think about cases where we 're put in a new situation that 
  we 've never been in before when we fall in love with someone new or when we 're in a new city for the first time 
  the months of being a walking talking  faculty  meeting attending zombie back home  
 and by the way that coffee that wonderful coffee you 've been drinking downstairs actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters  so what 's it like to be a baby it 's like being in love in paris for the first time after you 've had
  fantastic way to be but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o 'clock in the morning 
 now it 's good to be a grownup i don 't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are it 's good to be a grownup we can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves  
 and it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into
  babies think like adults do but if what we want is to be like those butterflies to have
 open learning  imagination creativity innovation maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children
