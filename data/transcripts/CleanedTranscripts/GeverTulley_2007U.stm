  five dangerous things you should let your children do i don 't have children i borrow my friends ' children so 
 take all this advice with a grain of salt  i 'm gever tulley
 i 'm a contract computer scientist by trade but i 'm the founder of something called the tinkering school
  it 's a summer program which aims to help kids learn how to build the things that they think of so we build a lot of things and
 i do put power tools into the hands of
  if you 're thinking about sending your kid to tinkering school they do come back bruised scraped and bloody  
 you know  we live in a world that 's subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations there doesn 't seem to be
 any limit
 on how crazy child safety regulations can get we put suffocation
  every piece of plastic film manufactured in the united states or for sale with an item in the united states 
 we put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot  
 and we seem to think that any
 item sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of ten  so
 where does this trend stop when we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object every
  pokey bit in the world then
 the first time that kids come in contact with anything sharp or
 not made out of round plastic they 'll hurt themselves with it so 
 as the boundaries of what we determine as the safety zone
 grow ever
  we cut off our children from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact with the world
 around them  
 and despite all of our best efforts and intentions 
 kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can in whatever environment they can 
 so despite the provocative title this presentation is really about safety
  some simple things that we can do to raise our kids to be
 creative  confident and in control of the environment around them  and
 what i now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress the
 book is called fifty dangerous things this is five dangerous things thing number one play with fire  
 learning to control
 one of the most
 elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment in any child 's
 personal history whether we remember it or not  it 's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious
 things these mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity to play with it so playing with
  this is like one of the great things
 we ever discovered fire 
 from playing with it  they learn some basic principles about fire about intake combustion exhaust these are the three working elements of fire that you have to have for a good 
 controlled fire  
 and
 you can think of the open pit fire as a laboratory you don 't know what they 're going to learn from playing with it let them fool around with it on their own terms and
 trust me  they 're going to learn things
 that you can 't get out of playing with dora the explorer toys 
 laughter number two own a pocketknife pocketknives are kind of drifting out of our cultural consciousness  which i think is a terrible thing
  first pocketknife is like the first universal tool that you 're given you know  it 's a spatula  it 's a pry bar it 's a screwdriver and it 's a blade yeah  
 and
 it 's a powerful and empowering tool and in a lot of cultures they give knives like as soon as they 're toddlers they have knives
  are inuit children
 cutting whale blubber
  i first saw this in a canadian film board film when i was ten  and it left a lasting impression to see babies playing with knives and it shows that
 kids can develop an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age you lay down a couple of very simple rules
 always cut away from your body  keep the blade sharp  never force it and these are things kids can understand and practice with and yeah they 're going to cut
 i have some terrible scars on my legs from where i stabbed myself but you know they 're young they heal fast 
 number three throw a spear  it turns out that
 our brains are actually wired for throwing things and
 like muscles if you don 't use parts of your brain they tend to atrophy over time
 but when when you exercise them any given muscle adds strength to the whole system and that applies to your brain too so
 practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes which have to do with visual acuity
  helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability 
 and throwing is a combination of analytical and physical skill so it 's very good for that kind of
  those are great number [ four ] deconstruct appliances  there is a world of interesting things inside your dishwasher
  next time you 're about to throw out an appliance don 't throw it out take it apart with your kid or send him to my school and we 'll take it apart with them  
  even if you don 't know what the parts are  puzzling out what they might be for is a really good
 practice for the kids to get
 sort of the sense that
 they can take things apart and no matter how complex they are they can understand parts of them  and that means that eventually they can understand all of them it 's a sense of knowability
 that something is knowable so
 these black boxes that we live with and take for granted are actually
 complex things made by other people and you can understand them
 number five two parter break the digital millennium copyright act 
 laughter there are laws
 beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things that we own in this case digital media
 it 's a very simple exercise
  buy a song on itunes write it to a
 cd  
 then rip the cd to an mp3 and play it on your very same computer you 've just broken a law  technically the riaa could come and prosecute you 
 it 's an important lesson for kids to understand that some of these laws
 get broken by accident and that laws have to be interpreted that 's something we often talk about with the kids
  when
 we 're fooling around with things and breaking them open and taking them apart and using them for other things and
 also when we go out and drive a car  driving a car is
 is a really empowering act for a young child so this is the alternate 
 for those of you who aren 't comfortable actually breaking the law
  can drive a car with your child
  this is a great stage for a kid  this happens about the same time that they get latched onto things like dinosaurs these big
 things in the outside world that they 're trying to get a grip on a car is a similar object and they can get in a car and drive it 
  gives them a handle on a world in a way
 that they don 't often have access to and it 's perfectly legal find a big empty lot make sure there 's nothing in it and that
 it 's on private property  and let them drive your car it 's very safe actually  and it 's fun for the whole family
