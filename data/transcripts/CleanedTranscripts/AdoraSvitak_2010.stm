  to start with a question when was the last time you were called childish for kids like me being called childish can be a frequent occurrence  every time we 
  make irrational demands exhibit irresponsible behavior or display any other signs of being normal
  american citizens we are called childish  
 which really bothers me after all take a look at these events  
 imperialism and colonization world wars  george w bush ask yourself who 's responsible adults 
 now  what have kids done well anne frank touched millions with her powerful account of the holocaust ruby bridges helped
  to end segregation in the united states 
 and most recently charlie simpson helped to raise one hundred and twenty thousand pounds for haiti on his little bike  so as you can see evidenced by such examples 
  age has absolutely nothing to do with it the traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults 
  when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking thank
 then again  who 's to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren 't exactly what the world needs maybe you 've had grand plans before but stopped
  that won 't benefit me 
 for better or worse we kids aren 't hampered as much when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things 
 kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were free a kind of utopia  
 how many of you still dream like that and believe in the possibilities  
 sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of utopian ideals
  be a burden  because you know that if everything were free then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos 
 on the other hand we kids still dream about perfection 
 and that 's a good thing because in order to make anything a reality you have to dream about it first 
 in many ways  our audacity to imagine
 imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility for instance the museum of glass in tacoma washington my home state yoohoo washington 
 has a program called kids design glass and kids draw their own ideas for glass art the resident artist said they got some of their best ideas from 
  the program because kids don 't think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes they just think of good ideas  
  or maybe italian vases  but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that into the realm of brokenhearted snakes and bacon boys 
 who you can see has meat vision 
 now  our inherent wisdom doesn 't have to be insider 's knowledge kids already do a lot of learning from adults
  we have a lot to share i think that adults should start learning from kids now
 i do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd teachers and students and i like this analogy it shouldn 't be a teacher at the head of the class  telling students do this do that 
 the students should teach their teachers 
 learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal  
 the reality unfortunately is a little different and it has a lot to do with trust or a lack of it now if you don 't trust someone you place
  restrictions on them right if i doubt my older sister 's ability to pay back the ten percent interest i established on her last loan i 'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back 
 true story by the way now 
 adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards
  don 't do that don 't do this in the school handbook to restrictions on school internet use 
 as history points out regimes become oppressive when they 're fearful about keeping control and although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes 
 kids have no or very little say in making the rules when really the attitude should be reciprocal meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population 
  often underestimate kids ' abilities we love challenges but when expectations are low trust me we will sink to them  
 my own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister 
 okay so they didn 't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that 
 but my dad did read to us about aristotle and pioneer
  lots of other kids were hearing the wheels on the bus go round and round well we heard that one too but pioneer germ fighters totally rules 
 i loved to write from the age of four and when i was six my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with microsoft word thank you bill gates and thank you ma  
 i wrote over three hundred short stories on that little
  i wanted to get published  
 instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published or saying wait until you 're older my parents were really supportive 
 many publishers were not quite so encouraging 
 one large children 's publisher ironically said that they didn 't work with children children 's publisher not working with children
  one publisher action publishing was willing to take that leap and trust me and to listen to what i had to say they published my first book flying fingers you see it here 
 and from there on it 's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools keynoting to thousands of educators and finally today speaking to you i appreciate your attention
  because to show that you truly care you listen 
 but there 's a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults 
 kids grow up and become adults just like you 
 or just like you really  the goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult but rather better adults than you have been which may be a little challenging
  the way progress happens is because new generations and new eras grow and develop and become better than the previous ones it 's the reason we 're not in the dark ages anymore 
 no matter your position or place in life it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away 
 adults and fellow tedsters you need to listen and learn from kids and trust us
  and expect more from us 
 you must lend an ear today  because we are the leaders of tomorrow  which means we 're going to take care of you when you 're old and senile  no just kidding 
 no really we are going to be the next generation the ones who will bring this world forward and in case you don 't think that this really has meaning for you remember that cloning is possible and that involves going through childhood
  again in which case you 'll want to be heard just like my generation  now  the world needs opportunities
 for new leaders and new ideas kids need opportunities to lead and succeed 
 are you ready to make the match because the world 's problems shouldn 't be the human family 's heirloom thank you
