  by reciting a poem 
 oh beloved dentist your rubber fingers in my mouth your voice so soft and muffled
  i 'm going to be putting the right side of your brains through a fairly serious workout you
 're going to see a lot of imagery  and it 's not always connected to what i 'm talking about  so i need you to kind of split your brains in half and let the images flow over one side and listen to me on the other  
 so i am one of those people with a
  transformative personal story six years ago  after twenty years in graphic design and typography  
 i changed the way i was working and the way most graphic designers work
 to pursue a more personal approach to my work 
 with only the humble attempt to simply make a living doing something that i loved  but something weird happened
  i became bizarrely
 popular my current work seems to resonate with people in a way that has
 so taken me by surprise that i still frequently wonder what in the hell is going on and i 'm slowly coming to understand that the appeal of what i do
  may be connected to why i do it these days i call myself a graphic artist
 so where my work as a graphic designer was to follow strategy my work now follows
 my heart and my interests with the guidance of my ego
 to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client
  this is heresy in the design world the ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design  
 but i find that for myself 
 without exception the more i deal with the work as something of my own as something that is personal 
 the more successful it is as something that 's compelling 
  so i exist somewhat outside of the mainstream of design thinking 
 where others might look at measurable results  i tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities like does it bring joy 
 is there a sense of wonder and does it invoke curiosity 
 this is a scientific diagram by the way  i don 't have time to explain it but it has to do with dna and rna so i have a particular imaginative approach to
  visual work the things that interest me when i 'm working
 are visual structure  surprise and anything that requires figuring things out 
 so for this reason i 'm particularly drawn to systems and patterns  
 i 'm going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works this is a piece that i did for the guardian newspaper in the  u k they have a magazine that they
  call g2 and this is for their puzzle special in two thousand and seven  and puzzling it is 
 i started by creating a series of tiling units  
 and these tiling units i designed specifically so that they would contain parts of letterforms within their shapes
 so that i could then join those pieces together to create letters and then words within the
 abstract patterning  
 but then as well i was able to just flip them rotate them and combine them in different ways to create either regular patterns or abstract patterns 
 so here 's the word puzzle again  
 and here it is with the abstract surrounding  and as you can see
  it 's extremely difficult to read 
 but all i have to do is fill certain areas of those  letterforms and i can bring those words out of the background pattern  
 but maybe that 's a little too obvious 
 so then i can add some color in with the background and add a bit more color in with the words themselves  and this way  working with the art director i 'm able to bring it to just 
  the right point that it 's puzzling for the audience they can figure out that there 's something they have to read
 but it 's not impossible for them to read 
 i 'm also interested in working with unusual materials and common materials in unusual ways 
 so this requires figuring out how to get the most out of something 's innate properties
 and also how to bend it to my will so ultimately my goal is to create something unexpected
  to this end  i have worked in sugar for stefan sagmeister three time ted speaker  
 and this project began essentially on my kitchen table  
 i 've been eating cereal for breakfast all of my life 
 and for that same amount of time i 've been spilling sugar on the table and just kind of playing with it with my fingers 
 and eventually i used this technique to create a piece
  of artwork and then i used it again to create six pieces for stefan 's book things in my life i 've learned so far 
 and these were created without sketches just freehand by putting the sugar down on a white surface and then manipulating it to get the words and designs out of it 
 recently i 've also made some rather highbrow baroque borders out of lowbrow pasta
  and this is for a chapter that i 'm doing in a book and the chapter is on honor  
 so it 's a little bit unexpected but in a way it refers to the macaroni art that children make for their parents or or they make in school and give to their parents which is in itself a form of honor  
 this is what you can do with some household tinfoil
  's what i can do with some household tinfoil 
 i 'm very interested in wonder in design as an impetus to inquiring 
 to say i wonder is to say i question  i ask and to experience wonder is to experience awe  
 so i 'm currently working on a book which
  plays with both senses of the word 
 as i explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in a visual display of rather peacock like grandeur 
 the world is full of wonder  but the world of graphic design for the most part is not  
 so i 'm using my own writings as a kind of testing ground for a book that has an interdependency between word and image
 as a kind of seductive force  
 i think that one of the things that religions got right was the use of visual wonder to deliver a message  
 i think this true marriage of art and information is woefully underused in adult literature  
 and i 'm mystified as to why visual wealth is not more commonly used to enhance intellectual wealth
  when we look at works like this we tend to associate them with children 's literature  
 there 's an implication that ornamental graphics detract from the seriousness of the content  
 but i really hope to have the opportunity to change that perception 
 this book is taking rather a long time  
  i 'm nearly done for some reason i thought it would be a good idea to put an intermission
 in my talk  and this is it just to give you and me a moment to catch up 
 so i do these valentines i 've been sending out valentines
 on a fairly large scale since two thousand and five these are my valentines from
  two thousand and five and two thousand and six  and i started by doing
 just a single image like this and sending them out to each person but in two thousand and seven i got the cockamamie idea to
 each valentine for everyone on my mailing list i reduced my mailing list to one hundred and
  i drew each person their own unique valentine
 and put their name on it and numbered it and signed it and sent it out believe it or not i devised this as a timesaving
 method  
 i was very busy in the beginning of that year and i didn 't know when i was going to find time to design and print a single valentine and i thought that i could kind of do this piecemeal as i was traveling 
 it didn 't exactly
 work out that way  there 's a longer story to this  but
 i did get them all done in time and they were extremely well received  i got an almost one hundred percent response rate 
 laughter and those who didn 't respond will never receive anything from
  i took a more conceptual approach to the valentine  i had this idea that i wanted people to receive
 a kind of mysterious love letter like a found fragment in their mailbox 
 i wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me something that caused them to wonder what on earth this thing was
  and
 i specifically wrote four pages that don 't connect there were four different versions of this and i wrote them
 so that they begin in the middle of a sentence  end in the middle of a sentence  and they 're on the one hand universal  so i avoid
 specific names or places  but on the
  so i wanted people to really get the sense that they had received something that could have been a love letter to them and i 'm just going to read one of them to you 
 you 've never really been sure of this  but i can assure you that this quirk you 're so self conscious of is intensely endearing 
 just please accept that this piece of you escapes with your smile  and those of us who notice are happy to catch it in passing 
 time spent with you is like chasing and
  catching small birds but without the scratches and bird shit 
 that is to say  your thoughts and words flit and dart  disconcertedly elusive at times but when caught and examined
 ahh  such a wonder  such a delightful reward there 's no passing time with you only collecting
 the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation and at the same time release
  release 
 impossible  i don 't think so 
 i know this makes you embarrassed i 'm certain i can see you blushing  
 but i just have to tell you because sometimes i hear your self doubt and it 's so crushing to think that you may not know how truly wonderful you are how inspiring and delightful and really truly the most completely
  so valentine 's day is coming up in a couple of days  and these are currently arriving in mailboxes all around the world 
 this year  i got what i really have to say is a rather brilliant idea 
 to
  laser cut my valentines out of used christmas cards
 so i solicited friends to send me their used christmas cards  and
 i made five hundred of these each one of them is completely different  i 'm just really really thrilled with them  i don 't have that much else to say but 
 they turned out really really well i do spend a lot of time on my work
  and one of the things that i 've been thinking about recently is what is worth while 
 what is it that 's worth spending my time on and my life on in this way 
 working in the commercial world this is something that i do have to struggle with at times  and yes sometimes i 'm swayed by money  
 but ultimately i don 't consider that a worthy goal 
 what makes something worthwhile for me
  is the people i work for or with the conditions i work under and the audience that i 'm able to reach  
 so i might ask who is it for what does it say and what does it do 
 you know i have to tell you it 's really difficult for someone like me to come
  ideas and technologies 
 and it 's very very common for designers and people in the visual arts
 to feel that we 're not contributing enough or worse that all
  we 're doing is contributing to landfill here i am i 'm showing you some
 pretty visuals and talking about aesthetics  
 but i 've come to believe that truly imaginative visual work
 is extremely important in society just in the way that i 'm inspired by books and magazines of all kinds
 conversations i have movies  so i also think when i put visual work out there into the mass media 
 work that is interesting unusual intriguing work that maybe opens up that sense of inquiry in the mind 
 that i 'm seeding the imagination of
  the populace and you just never know who is going to take something from that and turn it into something else 
 because inspiration is 
 so a piece of mine may inspire a playwright
 or a novelist or a scientist  
 and that in turn may be the seed that inspires a doctor or a philanthropist or a babysitter  
 and this isn
  something that you can quantify or track or measure  and we tend to undervalue things in society that we can 't measure  
 but i really believe that a fully operating rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination
 flowing and cycling and growing
 so that 's why i do what i do and why i spend so much time and effort on it 
 and why i work in the commercial public sphere as opposed to the isolated  private sphere of fine art 
 because i want as many people as possible to see my work notice it be drawn into it and be able to take something from
  it and i actually really feel that it 's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time
 on this earth in this way  and i thank you for allowing me to show it to
