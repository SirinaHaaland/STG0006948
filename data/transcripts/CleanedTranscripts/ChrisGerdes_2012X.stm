  many of you have ever gotten behind the wheel of a car when you really shouldn 't have been driving 
 maybe you 're out on the road for a long day and you just wanted to get home  you were
  but you felt you could drive a few more miles 
 maybe you thought  i 've had less to drink than everybody else  i should be the one to go home  or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere 
 does this sound familiar to you now in those situations wouldn 't it be great if there was a button on your dashboard
 that you could push and the car would get you home safely now that 's been the promise
  the autonomous vehicle  and it 's been the dream since at least one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine when general motors showcased this idea at their futurama booth at the world 's fair 
 now it 's been one of those dreams that 's always seemed about twenty years in the future
 now  two weeks ago that dream took a step forward when the state of nevada granted google 's self driving car the very first license for an autonomous vehicle  
 clearly establishing that it 's legal for them to test it on the roads in
  nevada  
 now california 's considering similar legislation  
 and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in vegas 
 laughter now in my lab at stanford we 've been working on autonomous cars too but with a slightly different spin on things
  you see we 've been developing robotic race cars cars that can actually push themselves to the very limits of physical performance  
 now  why would we want to do such a thing well there 's two really good reasons for this 
 first 
 we believe that before people turn over control to an autonomous car that autonomous car should be at least as good as the very best human drivers  
 now  if you 're like me and the other seventy percent of the population who know that we
 you understand
 that 's a very high bar
 there 's another reason as well 
 just like race car drivers can use all of the friction between the tire and the road all of the car 's capabilities to go as fast as possible 
 we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid any accident we can 
 now you may push the car to the limits not because you 're driving too fast but because you 've hit an icy patch of road
  conditions have changed in those situations  we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident
 that can physically be avoided
  i must confess there 's kind of a third motivation as well  you see  i have a passion for racing 
 in the past i 've been a race car owner a crew chief and a driving coach  although maybe not at the level that you 're currently
  expecting one of the things that we 've developed in the lab we 've developed several vehicles
 is what we believe is the world 's first autonomously drifting car it 's another one of those categories where maybe there 's not a lot of competition
  around corners it can get sideways like a rally car driver  always able to take the tightest curve even on slippery  changing surfaces never spinning out 
 we 've also worked with volkswagen oracle on shelley an autonomous race car that has raced at one hundred and fifty miles an hour through the bonneville salt flats  
 gone around thunderhill raceway park in the sun the wind and the rain
  rain  and navigated the one hundred and fifty three turns and twelve point four miles of the pikes peak hill climb route in colorado
 with nobody at the wheel 
 i guess it goes without saying that we 've had a lot of fun doing this
 but in fact  there 's something
  else that we 've developed in the process of developing these autonomous cars  we have developed a tremendous appreciation
 for the capabilities of human race car drivers 
 as we 've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform  we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts  and we discovered
 their human counterparts are amazing
 now  
 we can take a map of a race track  we can take a mathematical model of a car and with some iteration  we can actually find the fastest way around that track  
 we line that up with data that we record from a professional driver  
 and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable 
  there are subtle differences here  
 but the human race car driver is able to go out and drive an amazingly fast line without the benefit of an algorithm that compares the trade off between going as fast as possible in this corner and shaving a little bit of time off of the straight over here 
 not only that they 're able to do it lap after lap after lap they 're able to go out and consistently do
  pushing the car to the limits every single time it 's extraordinary
 to watch  you put them in a new car and after a few laps they 've found the fastest line in that car and they 're off to the races 
 it really makes you think we 'd love to know what 's going on inside their brain so as researchers that 's what
 we decided to find out 
 we decided to instrument not only the car  but also the race car driver 
 to try to get a glimpse into what was going on in their head as they were doing this 
 now this is dr lene harbott applying electrodes to the head of john morton 
 john morton is a former can am and imsa driver who 's also a class champion at le mans fantastic driver  and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research
  she 's putting electrodes on his
  head so that we can monitor the electrical activity in john 's brain as he races around the track  
 now  clearly we 're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track  however neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this 
 for instance the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves in contrast
  theta waves are associated with a lot of cognitive activity like visual processing things where the driver is is thinking quite a bit  
 now we can measure this  and we can look at the relative power between the theta waves and the alpha waves this gives us a measure of mental workload how much the driver is actually challenged cognitively at any point along the track  
 now we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the
  track  so we headed down south to laguna seca laguna seca is a legendary raceway about halfway between salinas and monterey it has a curve there called the corkscrew now the corkscrew is a chicane followed by a quick right handed turn as the road drops three stories  
 now  the strategy for driving this as explained to me was you aim for the bush in the distance  and as the road falls away you realize it was actually the top of a tree
  thanks to the revs program at stanford we were able to take john there and put him behind the wheel of a one thousand nine hundred and sixty porsche abarth carrera  life is way too short
 for boring cars  so here you see john on the track he 's going up the hill oh somebody liked that
 and you can see actually his mental workload
  you can see his actions as he approaches now watch he has to downshift  and then he has to turn left
 look for the tree  and down 
 not surprisingly you can see this is a pretty challenging task  you can see his mental workload spike as he goes through this as you would expect with something that requires this level of complexity 
 but what 's really interesting
 is to look at areas of the track where his mental workload doesn 't
  take you around now to the other side of the track turn three  and john 's going to go into that corner and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out he 's going to have to correct for that with steering  
 so watch as john does this here watch the mental workload and watch the steering the car begins to slide out  dramatic maneuver to correct it and no change whatsoever
 in the mental workload not a challenging task
  our data processing on this is still preliminary  but it really seems that these phenomenal feats that the race car drivers are performing are instinctive  
 they are things that they have simply learned to do it requires very little mental workload for them to perform these amazing feats 
 and their actions are fantastic this is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel to catch the car
 in this situation
 now this has given us tremendous insight and inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles we 've started to ask the question can we make them a little less algorithmic
 and a little more intuitive can we take this reflexive action that we see from the very best race car drivers introduce it to our cars
  and maybe even into a system that could get onto your car in the future that would take us a long step along the road to autonomous vehicles that drive as well as the best humans  
 but it 's made us think a little bit more deeply as well 
 do we want something more from our car than to simply be a chauffeur 
 do we want our car to perhaps be a partner 
 a coach  someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential 
  the technology not simply replace humans  but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition
 that we 're all capable of 
 so as we move forward into this technological future i want you to just pause and think of that for a moment 
 what is the ideal balance of human and machine  and as we think about that let 's take inspiration
 from the absolutely amazing capabilities of the human body
 and the human mind thank you
