  and raised in north korea  
 although my family constantly struggled against poverty  i was always loved and cared for first 
 because i was the only son and the youngest of two in the family
  but then the great famine began in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four i was four years old  my sister and i would
 go searching for firewood starting at five in the morning
 and come back after midnight i would wander the streets searching for food  and i remember seeing a small
  tied to a mother 's back eating chips and wanting to steal them from him  
 hunger is humiliation hunger is hopelessness for a hungry child politics and freedom
 are not even thought of on my ninth birthday  my parents couldn 't give me any food to
 eat but even as a child i could feel the heaviness in their hearts
  over a million north koreans died of
 starvation in that time 
 and in two thousand and three when i was thirteen years old  my father became one of them  
 i saw my father wither away and die 
 in the same year  my mother disappeared one day  and then my sister told me that she was going to china to earn money
  but that she would return with money and food soon 
 since we had never been separated  and i thought we would be together forever
 i didn 't even give her a hug when she left 
 it was the biggest mistake i have ever made in my life  but again  i didn 't know it was going to be a long goodbye 
 i have not seen my mom
 or my sister since then 
 suddenly i became an orphan and homeless 
 my daily life became very hard but very simple  
 my goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash  but that is no way to survive  
  not be the solution so i started to steal from food carts
 in illegal markets  sometimes  i found small jobs
 in exchange for food 
 once  i even spent two months in the winter working in a coal mine  thirty three meters underground
 without any protection for up to sixteen hours a day  i was not
  uncommon many other orphans survived this way  or worse
 when i could not fall asleep
 from bitter cold or hunger pains  
 i hoped that the next morning my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food 
 that hope kept me alive
  i don 't mean big  grand hope i mean the kind of hope that made me believe
 that the next trash can had bread even though it usually didn 't 
 but if i didn 't believe it i wouldn 't even try  and then i would die hope kept me alive 
  i told myself no matter how hard things got still i must live 
 after three years of waiting for my sister 's return  
 i decided to go to china to look for her myself  
 i realized
 i couldn 't survive much longer this way  i knew the journey would be risky  but i would be risking my life
  either way i could die of starvation like my father in north korea  or at least i could try
 for a better life by escaping to china 
 i had learned that many people tried to cross the border to china
 in the nighttime to avoid being seen north korean border guards often shoot and kill people
  trying to cross the border without permission chinese soldiers
 will catch and send back north koreans  where they face severe punishment
  i decided to cross during the day  first because i was still a kid
 and scared of the dark  second because i knew i was already taking a risk
  and since not many people tried to cross during the day  i thought i might be able to cross without being seen by anyone  
 i made it to china on february fifteen  two thousand and six  i was sixteen years old  
 i thought things in china would be easier  since there was more food  
 i thought more people would help me  but it was harder than
  living in north korea  because i was not free  i was always worried about being caught and sent back 
 by a miracle  some months later i met someone who was running an underground shelter for north koreans 
 and was allowed to live there
 and eat regular meals for the first time in many years
 later that year an activist helped me escape china and go to the united states as a refugee  
 i went to america without knowing a word of english  yet my social worker told me that i had to go to high school  
 even in north korea  i was an f
  i barely finished elementary school  and i remember i fought in school more than once a day  textbooks and the library were not my playground  
 my father tried very hard to motivate me into studying  but it didn 't work at one point  my father gave up on me
  hurt me deeply  but nevertheless my level of motivation still didn 't
 change before he died 
 so in america it was kind of ridiculous that they said i should go to high school  
 i didn 't even go to middle school  i decided to go just because they told me to without trying much 
 but one day i came
  home
 and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner  
 and during dinner  i wanted to have one more wing  
 but i realized there were not enough for everyone so i decided against it 
 when i looked down at my plate  i saw the last chicken wing  that my foster father had given me his 
 i was so happy
  looked at him sitting next to me he just looked back at me very warmly  but said no words  
 suddenly i remembered my biological father 
 my foster father 's small act of love reminded me of my father who would love to share his food with me
 when he was hungry even if he was starving
 i felt so suffocated that i had so much food in america  yet my father died of starvation 
 my only wish that night was to cook a meal for him  
 and that night i also thought of what else i could do to to honor him  
 and my answer was to promise to myself that i would study hard
 and get the best education in
  america to honor his sacrifice  
 i took school seriously  
 and for the first time ever in my life i received an academic award for excellence and made dean 's list
 from the first semester in high school
  is personal hope is something that no one can give to you 
 you have to choose to believe in hope you have to make it yourself  
 in north korea i made it myself hope brought me to america
 but in america  i didn 't know what to do because i had this overwhelming freedom 
 my foster father at that dinner gave me a direction 
 and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in america  
 i did not come here by myself  i had hope but
  hope by itself is not enough many people helped me along the way to get here 
 north koreans are fighting hard to survive 
 they have to force themselves to survive have hope to survive  
 but they cannot make it without help 
 this is my message to you have hope
 for yourself  but also help each other 
 life can be hard for everyone  wherever you live 
 my foster father didn 't intend to change my life in the same way you may also change someone 's life with
  smallest act of love 
 a piece of bread can satisfy your hunger  
 and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive  but i confidently believe that
 your act of love and caring
 can also save another joseph 's life and change
 thousands of other josephs
  who are still having hope to survive
 personal and special story with us i know
 you haven 't seen your sister for you said it was almost exactly a decade  and in the off chance that she may be able to see this we wanted to give you an opportunity to
 send her a message joseph kim in korean ah you can do english then korean as well jk okay i 'm not
