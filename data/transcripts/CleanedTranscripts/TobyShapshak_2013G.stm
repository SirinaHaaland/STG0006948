  let me start by asking you a question just with a show of hands who has an iphone  
 who has an android phone  
 who has a blackberry  who will admit in public to having a blackberry 
 and let me guess how many of you when you
  arrived here like me went and bought a pay as you go sim card  
 yeah i
 'll bet you didn 't even know you 're using african technology pay as you go was a technology or an idea pioneered in africa by a company called vodacom
 a good fifteen years ago  
 and now  like franchising pay as you go is one of the most dominant forces of of economic activity in the world so i 'm going to talk about
  innovation in africa which i think is the purest form innovation out of necessity  
 but first i 'm going to ask you some other questions you don 't have to put your hands up these are rhetorical 
 why did nikola tesla have to invent the alternating current that powers the lights in this building or the
 the city that we 're in why did henry ford have to invent the production line to produce these fords that came in anything as long as they were black
  and why did eric merrifield have to invent the dolos 
 blank stares that is what a dolos looks like and in the background you can see robben island this is a small dolos and
 eric merrifield is the most famous inventor you 've never heard of 
 a storm ripped up the harbor in a small south african town called east london and
  while he was watching his kids playing with toys made from oxen bones called dolosse he had the idea for this it 's a bit like a huge jumping jack  and they have used this in every harbor in the world as a breakwater 
 the global shipping economy would not be possible without african technology like this  so
 whenever you talk about africa you have to put up this picture of
 the world from space and people go look it 's the dark continent 
 actually it isn 't what it is is a map of innovation and it 's really easy to see where innovation 's going on 
 all the places with lots of electricity it
 is because everybody 's watching television or playing angry birds 
 so
 where it 's happening is in africa now this is real innovation not the the way people have expropriated the word to talk about launching new products 
 this is real innovation and i define it as problem solving people are solving real problems in africa
 because we have to because we have real problems and when we solve real problems for people we solve them for the rest of the world at the same time 
 so
 in california everybody 's really excited about a little square of plastic that you plug into a phone and you can swipe your credit card  and people say we 've liberated the credit card from the point of sale terminal
  why do you even need a credit card 
 in africa  we 've been doing that for years and we 've been doing it on phones like this this is a picture i took at a place called kitengela about an hour south of nairobi 
 and the thing that 's so remarkable about the payment system that 's been pioneered in africa called m pesa is that it works on phones like this 
 you can pay bills with it you can buy your groceries you can pay your kids ' school fees and i 'm told you can even bribe customs officials 
 something like 
 million dollars a day is transacted through m pesa 
 forty percent of kenya 's gdp moves through m pesa using phones like this  and you think this is just a feature phone actually it 's the
  smartphone of africa  
 it 's also a radio  and it 's also a torch and more than anything else it has really superb battery life  
 why  because that 's what we need we have really severe energy problems in africa by the way you can update facebook and send gmail from a phone like this  
 so
 we have found a way to use the available technology to send money via
 which is a bit like a check system for the mobile age 
 i come from johannesburg which is a mining town it 's built on gold this is a a picture i instagrammed earlier  and
 the difference today is that the gold of today is mobile if you think about the the railroad system in north america and how that worked 
 first came the infrastructure then came the industry around it the brothels
 it 's a bit like the internet today right  and everything else that that worked with it 
 bars saloons etc the gold of today is mobile and mobile is the enabler that makes all of this possible so what are some of the things that you can do with it well this is by a guy called bright simons from ghana and what you do is you take
 medication something that some people might spend their entire month 's salary
  off the code and you send that to an sms number  and it tells you if that is legitimate or if it 's expired really simple  really effective
 in kenya there 's a service called  icow which just sends you really important information about how to look after your dairy the dairy business in kenya is a $ four hundred and
  and the difference between a subsistence farmer and an abundance farmer is only a couple of liters of milk a day  and if you can do that you can rise out of poverty really simple using a basic phone 
 if you don 't have electricity  no problem we 'll just make it out of old bicycle parts using a windmill as william kamkwamba did 
 there 's another great african that you 've heard that 's busy
  the automobile industry in the world he 's also finding a way to reinvent solar power and the electricity industry in north america and if he 's lucky he 'll get us to mars  
 hopefully in my lifetime 
 he comes from pretoria the capital of [ south africa ] about fifty kilometers from where i live  so back to joburg which is sometimes called egoli which means 
 city of gold and not only is mobile the gold of today
  i don 't believe that the gold is under the ground i believe we are the gold like you 've heard the other economists say  
 we are at the point where china was when its boom years began and that 's where we 're going so
 you hear the west talk about innovation at the edge well of course it 's happening at the edge because in the middle everybody 's updating facebook 
 or worse still they 're trying to understand facebook 's privacy
  settings 
 this is not that catchy catchphrase  this is
 innovation over the edge  
 so people like to call africa a  mobile first continent  
 but actually it 's mobile only so while everybody else is doing all of
  those things we 're solving the world 's problems  so there 's only one thing left to say
