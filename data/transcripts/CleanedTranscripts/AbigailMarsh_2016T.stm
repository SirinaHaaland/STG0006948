  like the actor idris elba or at
 least he did twenty years ago  i don 't know anything else about him  except that he once saved my life by putting his own life in danger 
 this man ran across four lanes of freeway
  traffic in the middle of the night to bring me back to safety
 after a car accident that could have killed me  and the whole thing left me really shaken up obviously  but it also left me with this kind of
 burning  gnawing need to understand why he did it 
 what forces within him caused him to make the choice that i owe my life to to risk his own life to save the life of a stranger in other words
  are the causes of his or anybody else 's capacity for altruism  
 but first let me tell you what happened that night i was nineteen years old and driving back to my home in tacoma washington down the interstate five freeway  
 when a little dog darted out in front of my car  
 and i did exactly what you 're not supposed to do which is swerve to avoid it  
 and i discovered why you 're not supposed to do that 
 i hit the dog anyways and that sent the car
  into a fishtail  and then a spin across the freeway  until finally it wound up in the fast lane of the freeway
 faced backwards into oncoming traffic
 and then the engine died  
 and i was sure in that moment that i was about to die too  but i didn 't because of the actions of that one brave man
 who must have made the decision within a fraction of a second of seeing my
  stranded car to pull over and run across four lanes of freeway traffic in the dark
 to save my life and then after he got my car working again and got me back to safety and made sure i was going to be all right
  he drove off again he
 never even told me his name  
 and i 'm pretty sure i forgot to say thank you 
 so before i go any further
  i really want to take a moment to stop and say thank you to that stranger i
 tell you all of this because the events of that night changed the course of my life to some degree
  i became a psychology researcher and i 've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
  does it come from and how does it develop and what are the extreme forms that it can take these questions are really important to understanding basic aspects of human social nature 
 a lot of people and this includes everybody from philosophers and economists to ordinary people
 believe that human nature is fundamentally selfish that we 're only ever really motivated by our own welfare  but if that 's true why do some people
  people like the stranger who rescued me do selfless things like helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselves  
 answering this question requires exploring the roots of extraordinary acts of altruism 
 and what might make people who engage in such acts different than other people  
 but until recently very little work on this topic had been done 
 the actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent
  definition of altruism  which is a voluntary costly behavior motivated by the desire to help another individual 
 so it 's a selfless act intended to benefit only the other what could possibly explain an action like that 
 one answer is compassion obviously which is a key driver of altruism  but then the question becomes why do some people seem to have more of it than others
  and the answer may be that the brains of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways  
 but to figure out how i actually started from the opposite end 
 with psychopaths 
 a common approach to understanding basic aspects of human nature like the desire to help other people is to study people in whom that desire is missing  
 and psychopaths are exactly such a group
 psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins  
 and it results in a personality that 's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial and sometimes very violent behavior 
 once my colleagues and i at the national institute of mental health conducted some of the first ever brain imaging research of psychopathic
  and our findings and the findings of other researchers now have shown that people who are psychopathic pretty reliably exhibit three characteristics  
 first although they 're not generally insensitive to other people 's emotions they are insensitive to signs that other people are in distress  
 and in particular they have difficulty recognizing fearful facial expressions like this one 
 and fearful expressions convey urgent need and emotional distress  and they usually elicit compassion and a desire to help
  people who see them so it makes sense that people who tend to lack compassion also tend to be insensitive to these cues 
 the part of the brain that 's the most important for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala 
 there are very rare cases of people who lack amygdalas completely  and they 're profoundly impaired in recognizing fearful expressions  
 and whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes in amygdala
  activity when they look at fearful expressions
  to these expressions sometimes they don 't react at all which may be why they have trouble detecting these cues  
 finally  psychopaths ' amygdalas are smaller than average by about eighteen or twenty percent  so
 all of these findings are reliable
  and they 're very interesting  but remember that my main interest is not understanding why people don 't care about others it 's understanding why they do 
 so the real question is could extraordinary altruism  which is the opposite of psychopathy
 in terms of compassion and the desire to help other people emerge from a brain that is also the opposite of psychopathy a sort of
  better able to recognize other people 's fear  
 an amygdala that 's more reactive to this expression and maybe larger than average as well 
 as my research has now shown all three things are true  
 and we discovered this by testing a population of truly extraordinary altruists these are people who have given one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger  
 so these are people who have volunteered
  to undergo major surgery so that one of their own healthy kidneys can be removed
 and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they 've never met and may never meet why would anybody do this is a very common question  
 and the answer may be that the brains of these extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics  
 they are better at recognizing other people 's fear  they 're literally better at detecting when somebody else is in distress
  this may be in part because their amygdala is more reactive to these expressions  and remember this is the same part of the brain that we found was underreactive in people who are psychopathic  
 and finally their  amygdalas are larger than average as well by about eight percent  
 so together what these data suggest is the existence of something like a caring continuum in the world
 that 's anchored at the one end by people who are highly psychopathic  and at the other by people who are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism
  should add that what makes extraordinary altruists so different
 is not just that they 're more compassionate than average they are 
 but what 's even more unusual about them is that they 're compassionate and altruistic not just towards people who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family
  right because to have compassion for people that you love and identify with is not
 extraordinary truly extraordinary altruists
  extends way beyond that circle even beyond their wider circle of acquaintances to people who are outside their social circle altogether  
 total strangers just like the man who rescued me  
 and i 've had the opportunity now to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors how it is that they manage to generate such a wide circle of compassion
 that they were willing to give a complete stranger their kidney  and i found it 's a really difficult
  question for them to answer  i say 
 how is it that you 're willing to do this thing when so many other people don 't you
 're one of fewer than two thousand americans who has ever given a kidney to a stranger what is it that makes you so special 
 and what do they say 
 they say nothing
  there 's nothing special about me  i 'm just the same as everybody else 
 and i think that 's actually a really telling answer  because it suggests that the circles of these altruists don 't look like this 
 they look more like this they have no center 
 these altruists literally don 't think of themselves as being at the center of anything as being better or more inherently important
  than anybody else when i asked one altruist why donating her kidney made sense to her she said because it 's not about me 
 another said 
 i 'm not different  i 'm not unique  your study here is going to find out that i 'm just the same as you i think the best description for this amazing lack of 
 is humility  which is that quality that in the words of st augustine makes men as angels  and why is that
  because if there 's no center of your circle there can be no inner rings or outer rings nobody who is more or less worthy of your care and compassion than anybody else  
 and i think that this is what really distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person  
 but i also think that this is a view of the world that 's attainable by many and maybe even most people
  and i think this because at the societal level  expansions of altruism and compassion are already happening everywhere 
 the psychologist steven pinker and others have shown that all around the world people are becoming less and less accepting of suffering in ever widening circles of others  
 which has led to declines of all kinds of cruelty and violence from animal abuse to domestic violence to capital punishment  
 and it 's led to increases in all kinds of
  a hundred years ago people would have thought it was ludicrous how normal and ordinary it is for people to donate their blood and bone marrow to complete strangers today 
 is it possible that a hundred years from now people will think that donating a kidney to a stranger is just as normal and ordinary as we think donating blood and bone marrow is today  
 maybe 
 so what 's at the root of all these amazing changes
  in part it seems to be
 increases in wealth and standards of living  
 as societies become wealthier and better off people seem to turn their focus of attention outward 
 and as a result all kinds of altruism towards strangers increases from volunteering to charitable donations and even altruistic kidney donations 
 but
 all of these changes also yield a strange and paradoxical result  which is that even as the world is becoming a better
  more humane place which it is there 's a very common perception that it 's becoming worse and more cruel  which it 's not 
 and i don 't know exactly why this is but i think it may be that we now just know so much more about the suffering of strangers in distant places  
 and so we now care a lot more
 about the suffering
  those distant strangers  but what 's clear is the kinds of changes we 're seeing show
 that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature as cruelty and violence maybe even more so 
 and while some people do seem to be inherently more sensitive to the suffering of distant others  
 i really believe that the ability to remove oneself from the center of the circle
 and expand the circle
  of compassion outward to include even strangers is within reach for almost everyone  thank you
