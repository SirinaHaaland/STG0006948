  the rights of citizens the future of the internet  
 so i would like to welcome to the ted stage the man behind those revelations ed snowden
  remote location somewhere in russia
 controlling this bot from his laptop  so he can see what the bot can see 
 ed welcome to the ted stage what can you see as a matter of fact
  some questions for you you 've been called many things in the last few months you 've been called
 a whistleblower a traitor a hero  what words would you describe yourself with
  we should be struggling with 
 who i am really doesn 't matter at all if i 'm the worst person in the world 
 you can hate me and move on what really matters here are the issues what really matters here is the kind of government we want the kind of internet we
 want the kind of relationship between people and societies 
 and that 's what i 'm hoping
 the debate will move towards and we 've seen that increasing over time if i had to describe myself  i wouldn 't use words like
  year ago you were stationed in hawaii working as a consultant to the 
 as a sysadmin you had access to their systems  and you began
 revealing certain classified documents to some handpicked journalists leading the way to june 's revelations now what propelled you to do
  things that need to be done  and things that help everyone 
 but there are also things that go too far  there are things that shouldn 't be done and decisions that were being made in secret without the public 's awareness
  public 's consent and without even our representatives in government having knowledge of these programs 
 when
 i really came to struggle with these issues  i thought to myself how can i do this in the most responsible way  that maximizes the public benefit
  and out of all the solutions that i could come up with 
 out of going to congress  when there were no laws there were no legal protections for a private employee a
 contractor in intelligence like 
 there was a risk that i would be buried along with the information and the public would never find out but the first amendment of the united states constitution guarantees us a free press for a reason 
 and that 's to enable
  an adversarial press to challenge the government  
 but also to work together with the government 
 to have a dialogue and debate about how we can inform the public about matters of vital importance
 without putting our national security at risk and by working with journalists by giving
  rather than trusting myself to make the decisions about publication  we 've had a robust debate with a deep investment by the government
 that i think has resulted in a benefit for everyone and the risks that 
  been threatened  the risks that have been played up by
  have never materialized we 've never seen any evidence of even a single instance of specific harm
  that i 'm comfortable with the decisions that i made
 ca so let me show the audience a couple of examples of of what you revealed if we could have a slide up and ed  i don 't know whether you can see the slides are here  this is a slide of the prism program  and maybe
  that allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping mass surveillance of the entire country 's phone records things like that
 you 're talking to when you 're talking to them 
 these are all metadata events prism
 is about content  
 it 's a program through which the government could compel corporate america it could deputize corporate america
 to do its dirty work
  even though some of these companies did resist even though some of them i believe yahoo was one of them challenged them in court they all lost  because it was never tried by an open court they were only tried by a secret court 
 and something that we 've seen something about the prism program that 's very concerning to me is there 's been a talking point in the u s government where they 've said fifteen federal
  have reviewed these programs and found them to be lawful but what they don 't tell you
 is those are secret judges in a secret court
 based on secret interpretations of law
 that 's considered thirty four thousand warrant requests over thirty three years  
 and in thirty three years only rejected eleven government requests
  that we want deciding what the role of corporate america in a free and open internet should be 
 ca now this slide that we 're showing here shows the dates in which different technology companies internet companies are
 alleged to have have joined the program and where data collection began from them now they have denied collaborating collaborating with the nsa
  own slides refer to it as direct access what that means to an actual
 someone like me who was working as an intelligence analyst
 targeting  chinese cyber hackers things like that in hawaii is the provenance of that data is directly from
  this stuff away 
 now each company handles it different ways  some are responsible some are somewhat less responsible but the bottom line is when we talk about how this information
 is given  it 's coming from the
  not stolen from the lines 
 but there 's an important thing to remember here even though companies pushed back even though companies demanded hey  let 's do this through a warrant process let 's do this 
 where we actually have some sort of legal review some sort of basis for handing over these users ' data 
  to the data center communications between google to itself
 and yahoo to itself  so even these companies that are cooperating in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner with the nsa 
 the nsa isn 't satisfied with that and because of that we need our companies to work very hard
 represent the interests of the user and also advocate for the rights of the users 
 and i think over the last year we 've seen the companies that are named on the prism slides take great strides to do that  and i encourage them to continue ca 
 what more should they do
 es the biggest thing that an internet company in america can do today  
 right now without consulting with lawyers to protect the rights of users worldwide
  enable ssl 
 web encryption on every page you visit  the reason this matters is today if you go to look at a copy of 
 the nsa can see a record of that 
 the russian intelligence service can see a record of that the chinese service can see a record of that the french service the german service the services
  andorra they can all see it because it 's unencrypted the world 's library is amazon com 
 but not only do they not support encryption by default  you cannot choose to use encryption when browsing through books  this is something that we need to change not just for amazon
  that 'll increase the privacy and the rights that people enjoy worldwide ca ed come with me to this part of the stage  i want to show you the next slide here this
 is a program called boundless informant  what is that es so i 've got to give credit
  for using appropriate names on this this is one of my favorite nsa cryptonyms 
 boundless informant is a program that the nsa hid from congress 
 the nsa was previously asked by congress was there any ability that they had to even give a rough ballpark estimate
 of the amount of american communications that were being intercepted  they said no
  we don 't track those stats and we can 't track those stats we can 't tell you
 how many communications we 're intercepting around the world because to tell you that would be to invade your privacy  
 now i really appreciate that sentiment from them  but the reality when you look at this slide is not only do they have the capability 
 the capability already exists it 's already in place the nsa has its own internal
  what boundless informant tells us is more communications are being intercepted
 in america about americans than there are in russia about russians  i 'm not sure that 's what an intelligence agency should be aiming
 there was a story broken in the washington post again from your data  the headline says  nsa broke privacy rules thousands of times per year 
 tell us about that es 
 we also heard in congressional testimony last year  it was an amazing thing for someone like me
 who
  that there had been no abuses  that there had been no violations of the nsa 's rules  
 when we knew this story was coming  
 but what 's especially interesting about this  about the fact that the nsa has violated their own rules their own laws thousands of times in a single year  including one event by itself one event out of those two thousand seven hundred and
  that affected more than three thousand people in another event they intercepted all the calls in washington d c by accident
  what 's amazing about this this report that didn 't get that much attention is the fact that not only were there two thousand seven hundred and seventy six abuses  
 the chairman of the senate intelligence
  dianne feinstein had not seen this report
 until the washington post contacted her asking for comment on the
 report and she then requested a copy from the nsa and received it 
 but had never seen this before that what does that say about the state of oversight in american intelligence when the chairman of the senate intelligence committee has no idea that the rules are being broken thousands of
  this why should we care about all this surveillance honestly  i mean look if you 've done nothing wrong you 've got nothing to worry about 
 what 's wrong with that point of
 your rights matter
 because you never know when you 're going to need them 
 beyond that it 's a part of our cultural identity not just in america  
 but in western societies and in democratic societies around the world 
 people should be able to pick up the phone and to call their  family people should be able to send a text message to
  people should be able to buy a book online  they should be able to travel by train they should be able to buy an airline ticket without wondering about how these events are going to look
 to an agent of the government possibly not even your government
 years in the future how they 're going to be misinterpreted and what they 're going to think your intentions were 
 we have a right to privacy we require warrants to be based on probable cause or some kind of individualized suspicion
  because we recognize that trusting
 anybody  any government authority with the entirety of human communications in secret and without oversight
 is simply too great a temptation to be ignored ca 
 some people are furious at what you 've done i heard a quote recently from dick cheney
 who said that
 julian
  assange was a flea bite  edward snowden is the lion that bit the head off the dog  
 he thinks you 've committed one of the worst acts of betrayal in american history  
 what would you say to people who think that es 
 dick cheney 's really something
  julian assange was doing some of his greatest work dick cheney was saying he was going to end governments worldwide  the skies were going to
 ignite and the seas were going to boil off and now he 's saying it 's a flea bite
  so we should be suspicious about the same sort of overblown claims of damage to national security
 from these kind of officials but
 let 's assume that these people really believe this i would argue that they have kind of a narrow conception of
  prerogatives of people like dick cheney
 do not keep the nation safe  the public interest
 is not always the same as the national interest going to war with people who are 
 in places that are not a threat doesn 't make us safe and that applies whether it 's in iraq or
  any other company out there
 is a part of our society  it 's a part of our interconnected world there are ties of fraternity that
 bond us together  and if we destroy these bonds by undermining the standards
  nations and citizens all around the world expect us to abide by ca but
 it 's alleged that you 've stolen one point seven million documents it seems only a few hundred of them have been shared with journalists so far are there more revelations to come es 
 there are absolutely more revelations
  the most important reporting to be done is yet to come
 want to ask you about this particular revelation come
 and take a look at this  i mean this is a story which i think for a lot of the techies in this room is the single most shocking thing that they
  that i believe they 're named this way is because they target our own infrastructure  they 're programs through which the nsa intentionally misleads
 corporate partners  they tell corporate partners that these are safe standards they say hey  we need to work with you to secure
 secure your systems  but in reality they 're giving bad advice to these
 companies that makes them degrade the security of their services they 're building in backdoors that not only the nsa can exploit  
 but anyone else who has time and money to research and find it
 can then use to let themselves in to the world 's communications 
 and this is really dangerous because if we lose a single standard  
 if we lose the trust of something like ssl which was specifically targeted by the
  a less safe world overall we won 't be able to access our banks and we won 't be able to access
 commerce
 without worrying about people monitoring those communications or subverting them for their own ends ca and do those same decisions also potentially
 open america up to
  traditionally worn two hats they 've been in charge of offensive operations that is hacking but they 've also been in charge of defensive operations 
  and traditionally they 've always prioritized defense over offense based on the principle that american secrets are simply worth more 
 if we hack a chinese business and steal their secrets  if we hack a government office in berlin and steal their secrets  
 that has less value
 to the american people
 than making sure that the chinese can 't get access to our secrets  
 so by reducing the security of our communications they 're not only putting the world
 at risk they 're putting america at risk in a fundamental way  because intellectual property is the basis the foundation of our
  you will see that that 's unfounded  and you don 't have to take my word for it because
 we 've had the first open court the first federal
  to be briefed on these things and now has the desire to be 
 has produced bills to reform it and two independent white house panels who reviewed all of the classified evidence said these programs have never 
  stopped a single terrorist attack that was imminent in the united states 
 i say no  and all three branches of the american government say no as well ca i mean do you think there 's a deeper motivation for them than the war against terrorism es i 'm sorry
 i couldn 't hear you say again ca sorry do you think there 's a deeper motivation for them
 other than the war against terrorism es yeah  the bottom line is that terrorism has always been what we in the intelligence world
  terrorism is something that provokes an emotional response that allows people to
 rationalize authorizing powers and programs that they wouldn
 programs the nsa asked for these authorities back in the 1990s 
 they asked the fbi to go to congress and make the case the fbi went to congress and did make the case  but congress and
  people said no they said 
 it 's not worth the risk to our economy they said it 's worth too much damage to our society  to justify the gains but what we saw is in the post 9 eleven era  
 they used secrecy and they used the justification of terrorism
 to start these programs in secret without asking congress  without asking the american people and it 's that kind of government behind closed doors that we need
 to guard ourselves against because it makes us less safe and it offers no value ca
 okay come with me here for a sec because i 've got a more personal question for you  speaking of terror
  most people would find the situation you 're in right now
 in russia pretty terrifying you
  what the treatment that bradley manning got chelsea manning as now is 
 and there was a story in  buzzfeed saying that there are people in the intelligence community who want you dead
 how are you coping with this how are you coping with the fear  es  it 's no mystery that there are governments out there
  that i go to sleep every morning thinking about what i can do for the american people 
 i don 't want to harm my government i want to help my government
 but the fact that they are willing to completely ignore due process
 these are things that we need to work against as a society and say hey this is not appropriate 
 we shouldn 't be threatening dissidents we shouldn 't be criminalizing journalism  
 and whatever part i can do to see that end i 'm happy to do despite the risks ca so i
 'd actually like to get some feedback from the audience here because i know there 's widely differing reactions to edward snowden
  suppose you had the following two choices right you could view what he did as fundamentally a reckless act that has endangered america
 or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act that will work towards america and the world 's  long term good those are the two
  i 'm curious to see who 's who 's willing to vote with the first of those that this was a reckless act there
 are some hands going up some hands going up it 's hard to put your hand up when
 the man is standing right here but i see them es i can see you ca 
 and who goes with the second choice the fundamentally heroic act 
 and i think it 's true to say that there are a lot of people who didn 't show a hand
 i think
 are still thinking this through because it seems to me that the debate around you doesn 't split along traditional political lines it 's not left or right it 's not really about pro government libertarian 
 or not just that  part of it is almost a generational issue  you 're part of a generation that grew up with the internet and it seems as if
 you you become offended at almost
 a visceral level when you see something done that you think will harm the internet is there some truth to that es
 i think it 's very true this is not a left or right issue our basic freedoms  and when i say our i don 't just
  and to people who have seen and enjoyed a free and open internet it 's up to us to preserve that liberty for the next generation to enjoy and if we
 don 't change things 
 if we don 't stand up to make the changes we need to do
  have heard similar language recently from the founder of the world wide web who i actually think is
 with us sir tim berners lee tim actually would you like to come up and say do we have a microphone for tim
  i think you 've read the proposal that sir tim has talked about about a new magna carta to
  take back the internet is that something that makes sense es absolutely
 i mean my generation i grew up not just thinking about the internet  but i grew up in the internet
  and although i never expected to have the chance to defend it in
 such a direct and practical manner and
 almost avatar manner i think there 's something poetic about the fact that one of the sons of the internet
 has actually become close to the internet
 as a result of their political expression  and i believe that
 a magna carta for the internet is exactly what we need  we need to encode our values
 not just in writing but in the structure of
 and it 's something that i hope  i invite everyone in the audience 
 not just here in vancouver but around the world to join and participate in ca 
 do you have a question
  stepping back and thinking  what would you think would be the best that we could achieve
 from all the discussions that we have about the about the web we want
  go i think that 's a question that 's really only limited by what we 're willing to put into it i think the internet that we 've enjoyed in the past
 has been exactly what
 we as not just a nation but as a people around the world need and
 by cooperating by engaging not just the technical parts of society but as you said the
  users  the people around the world who contribute through the internet through social media 
 who just check the weather who rely on it every day as a part of their life to champion that we
 'll get not just the internet we 
  a better internet a better now something that we can use to build a future that 'll be better not just than what we hoped
  for but anything that we could have 
 it 's thirty years ago that ted was founded 
 a lot of the conversation since then has been along the lines that
 actually george orwell got it wrong  it 's not big brother watching us we through the power of the web and transparency are now watching big brother 
 your revelations kind of drove a stake through the heart of that rather optimistic view
  but
 you still believe there 's a way of of doing something about that  and you do too es right so
 there is an argument to be made that the powers of big brother have increased enormously
  there was a recent legal article
  which is that our expectation of privacy
 is violated
 when the capabilities of government surveillance have become cheaper by an order of magnitude  
 and each time that occurs we need to revisit and rebalance our privacy rights 
 now that hasn 't happened since the government 's
  and that 's why we 're in the problem that we 're in today  but
 there is still hope  because the power of individuals have also been increased by technology i am living proof
 that an individual can go head to head against the most powerful adversaries and the most powerful intelligence agencies around the world
  i think that 's something that we need to take hope from and we need to build on to make it accessible not just to technical experts but to ordinary citizens around the world  journalism is not a crime communication is
 and we should not be monitored in our everyday activities ca i 'm not quite sure how you shake the hand of a bot  but i imagine it
  the new york times recently called for an amnesty for you  would you welcome the chance to come back to america
  principles that have been the foundation of this project have been the public interest
 and the principles that underly the journalistic establishment in the united states and around the world 
 and
 i think if
 the press is now saying we support this  this is something that
  happen that 's a powerful argument but it 's not the final argument and i think that 's something that public should decide 
 but at the same time the government has hinted that they want some kind of deal
 that they want me to compromise the journalists with which i 've been working to come back and i want to make it very clear
 that i did not do this to be safe i did this to do what was
  and i 'm not going to stop my work in the public interest just to benefit myself ca 
 in the meantime  courtesy of the internet  and this technology
  you 're here back in north america not quite the u s 
  the mission is ideas worth spreading if you could encapsulate it in a single idea what is your idea worth spreading right now at this moment
  would say the last year has been a reminder
 that
 democracy may die behind closed doors  but we as individuals are born behind those same closed doors  and we don 't have to give up
 our privacy to have good government we don 't have to give up our liberty to have security
  and i think by working together we can have both open government and private lives  and i look forward to working with everyone around the world
