  thirteen trillion dollars in wealth has evaporated over the course of the last two years  
 we 've questioned the future of capitalism  we 've questioned the financial industry  we 've looked at our government oversight
  we 've questioned where we 're going  and yet at the same time this very well may be a seminal moment in american history an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in america 
 i 'm calling this the great unwind 
 and the idea is a simple simple idea which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action consumers who represent
  percent of the gdp of america have actually started just like banks and just like businesses
 to unwind their leverage in daily life to remove themselves from the liability and risk that presents itself as they move forward 
 so to understand this and i 'm going to stress this it 's not about the consumer being in retreat the consumer is empowered to understand this we 'll step back and look at what
  the last year and a half  so if you 've been gone this is the cliffsnotes on what 's happened in the economy 
 unemployment up housing values down equity markets down commodity prices are like this if you 're a mom trying to manage a budget  and oil was one hundred and fifty dollars a barrel last 
  summer and it 's somewhere between fifty and seventy do you plan vacations how do you buy what 's your strategy in your household 
  currency valuations health care all these issues facing us you put them all together mix them up in a bouillabaisse and you have consumer confidence that 's basically a ticking time bomb 
 in fact  let 's go back and look at what caused this crisis because the consumer all of us in our daily lives actually contributed a large part to the problem  
 this is something i call the 50 20 paradox it took us fifty years to reach annual savings ratings of almost ten percent fifty years 
 do you know what this was right here
  was world war ii do you know why savings was so high 
 there was nothing to buy unless you wanted to buy some rivets  what happened though over the course of the last twenty years  we went from a ten percent savings rate to a negative 
  savings rate  because we binged  we bought extra large cars supersized everything we bought remedies
  restless leg syndrome all these things together basically created
 a factor where the consumer drove us headlong into the crisis that we face today the personal 
  ratio basically went from 
 to one hundred and thirty five percent in the span of about fifteen years 
 so consumers got over leveraged and of course our banks did as well as did our federal government this is an absolutely
  to two thousand and nine and what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education future children in our households 
  so if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout what you can see is if you stack up dollar bills first of all three hundred and sixty thousand dollars is about the size of a five foot four
  but if you stack it up you see this amazing staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out so this is the first three hundred and fifteen billion 
 but i read this fact the other day that one trillion seconds equals thirty two thousand years  so if you think about that the context the casualness with which we talk about trillion dollar bailout here and trillion there we are stacking ourselves up for long term leverage  
  consumers have moved they are taking responsibility  what we 're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate in fact eleven straight months of savings have happened since the beginning of the crisis we 're working our way back up to that ten percent 
 also remarkably in the fourth quarter spending dropped to its lowest level in sixty two years almost a three point seven percent decline  
 visa now reports that more people are using debit cards than
  so we 're starting to pay for things with money that we have and we 're starting to be much more careful about how we save and invest  
 but that 's not really the whole story because this has also been a dramatic time of transformation and you 've got to admit over the last year and a half consumers have been doing some weird things it 's pretty pretty staggering what we 've lived through 
 if you take into account that eighty percent of all americans were born after world war ii this was essentially our
  and so as a result  some crazy things have happened i 'll
 give you some examples let 's talk about dentists  vasectomies guns and shark attacks 
 dentists report molars people grinding their teeth coming in and reporting that they 've had stress so there 's an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced
 gun sales according to the fbi who does background checks are up almost twenty five percent since january  
 vasectomies are up
  according to the cornell institute
  and lastly  but a very good point hopefully not related to the former point i just made which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from two thousand and three
 does anybody know why 
 no one 's at the beach so there 's a bright side to everything  
 but seriously  what we see happening and the reason i want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the
  consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out what i mean by that is we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption 
 right if you think about the last
 three decades the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the ' 90s to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in
  but the one thing holding them back is the ability to discriminate by restricting their demand consumers can actually align their values with their spending and drive capitalism and business to not just be about more but to be about better
  we 're going to explain that right now 
 based on y & r 's brandasset valuator proprietary tool of vml and young & rubicam  we set out to understand what 's been happening in the crisis with the consumer
  we found a couple of really interesting things we 're going to go through four value shifts that we see driving new consumer behaviors that offer new management principles  
 the first cultural value shift we see is this tendency toward something we call liquid life 
 this is the movement from americans defining their success on having things to having liquidity because the less excess that you have around you the more nimble and fleet of foot you are 
  consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously makes you look a little bit anti fashion
 the management principle is dollars and cents  
 so let 's look at some examples of this dclass consumption that falls out of this value the first thing is something must be happening when p diddy vows to tone down his bling 
 but seriously we also have this phenomenon on madison avenue and in other places where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary
  paper bags to hide the brand purchases  we see high end haggling in fashion today high end haggling for luxury and real estate  
 we also see just a relaxing of ego and sort of a dismantling of artifice  this is a story on the yacht club that 's all basically blue collar blue collar yacht club where you can join  but you 've got to work in the boatyard as
  condition of membership we also see the trend toward tourism that 's a little bit more 
 agritourism going to vineyards and going to farms  and then we also see
 this movement forward from dollars and cents what businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets is really interesting a couple things that are kind of cool one is 
 figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer they found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month
  less at the end of the month  so they started to change their packaging larger packs at the beginning of the month  smaller packaging at the at the end of the month  
 really interestingly too was the san francisco giants  they 've just instituted dynamic pricing it takes into account everything from the pitcher match ups to the weather to the team records in setting prices for the consumer  
 another quick example of these types of movements
  the rise of zynga 
 zynga has risen on the consumer 's desire to not want to be locked in to fixed cost  again this theme is about variable cost variable living so micro payments have become huge  
 and lastly some people are using hulu as a device to get rid of their cable bill 
 so really clever ideas there that are being taken ahold of and that marketers are starting to understand 
 the second of the four values is this movement toward ethics and fair play we see that play itself out with empathy and respect the consumer is demanding it
  and as a result  businesses must provide not only value but values increasingly consumers are looking at the culture of the company at their conduct in the marketplace  
 so we see with empathy and respect lots of really hopeful things come out of this recession i
 'll give you a few examples one is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods and increased emphasis on your neighbors
  really lousy thing which has been unemployment is a rise in volunteerism that 's been noted in our country  
 we also see the phenomenon some of you may have boomerang kids these are boomerang alumni where universities are actually reconnecting with alumni and helping them with jobs sharing skills and retraining  
 we also talked about character and professionalism  we had this miracle on the hudson in
  and suddenly sully has become a key name on babycenter 
 so from a value and values standpoint what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways microsoft is doing something wonderful they are actually vowing to retrain 
  two million americans with it training  using their existing infrastructure to do something good 
 kind of shun the idea of bosses  but they also talk about the fact that their executives all of their expense reports are put onto their company intranet for everyone to see  complete transparency
  think twice before you have that bottle of wine 
 the third of the four laws of post crisis consumerism is about durable living  we 're seeing in our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon not a sprint they 're digging in and looking for ways to
  extract value out of every purchase they make  
 witness the fact that americans are holding on to their cars longer than ever before nine point four years on average in march a record  
 we also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for america did you know that sixty eight percent of americans now carry a library card the highest percentage ever in our nation 's history  
 so what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge
  continuing education is up everything is focused on betterment training development and moving forward  we also see a big diy movement 
 i was fascinated to learn that thirty percent of all homes in america are actually built by owners that includes cottages and the like but thirty percent people are getting their hands dirty rolling up their sleeves
  they want these skills 
 we see it with the phenomenon of raising backyard hens chickens and ducks and when you work out the math 
 they say it doesn 't work but the principle is there it 's about being sustainable and taking care of yourself 
 then we look at the high line in new york city an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure for something good which is a brand new park in in new york city  
 so what brands can do and companies is pay dividends to
  be a brand that lasts offer transparency  promise you 're going to be there beyond today 's sale perfect example of that is patagonia patagonia 's footprint chronicles basically
  goes through and tracks every product they make and gives you social responsibility  and helps you understand the ethics behind the product they make  
  for your student education 
 or the interesting company sunrun i love this company they 've created a consumer collective where they put solar panels on households and create a consumer based utility where the electricity they generate is basically pumped back out into the marketplace  so 
  consumerism that we see is this movement about
  return to the fold it 's incredibly important right now trust is not parceled out as we all know it 's now about connecting to your communities connecting to your social networks in my book 
 i talked about the fact that seventy two percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company versus fifteen percent on advertising 
  's look at a couple of quick examples  
 the artisanal movement is huge everything about locally derived products and services supporting your local neighborhoods whether it 's cheeses  wines and other products 
 also this rise of local currencies realizing that it 's difficult to get loans in this environment you 're doing business with people you trust in your local markets so this rise of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon  
  and then they did a recent report
 i thought was fascinating they actually started in certain communities in the united states  to publish people 's electricity usage and what they found out is when that was available for public record  the people 's electricity usage in those communities dropped 
 then we also look at the idea of cow pooling which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic
  that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled 
 and then there 's this other really interesting movement in california which is about carrot mobs  the traditional thing would be to boycott right have a stick  well why not have a carrot so these 
  are consumers organizing pooling their resources to incentify companies to do good
  organize it you need to harness it you need to give it meaning 
 and there 's lots of really interesting examples here 
 first is just the rise of the fact that zagat 's has actually moved out of and diversified from rating restaurants into actually rating health care  
 so what credentials does zagat 's have well  they have a lot because it 's their network
  so that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more elastic 
 then you look at the phenomenon of kogi
  this kogi doesn 't exist it 's a moving truck it 's a moving truck through l a and the only way you can find it is through twitter 
 or you look at johnson & johnson 's momversations a phenomenal blog that 's been built up where j & j basically is
  tapping into the power of mommy bloggers allowing them to create a forum where they can communicate and connect and it 's also become a very very valuable advertising revenue for j & j as well 
 this plus the fact that you 've got phenomenal work from ceos from ford to zappos connecting on twitter creating an open environment  allowing their employees to be part of the process rather than hidden behind walls you
  total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt all because the consumer is demanding it 
 so when we look at this and step back what i believe is that the crisis that exists today
 is definitely real it 's been tremendously powerful for consumers but at the same time this is also a tremendous opportunity
 the chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin crisis equals opportunity
 what we 're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for
  them to actually lead us forward out of this recession  
 so we believe that values driven spending will force capitalism to be better  it will drive innovation it will make longer lasting products it will create better more intuitive 
  customer service and it will give us the opportunity to connect with companies that share the values that we share
