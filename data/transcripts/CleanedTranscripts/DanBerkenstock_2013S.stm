  five years ago  
 i was a ph d student living two lives 
 in one i used nasa supercomputers to design next generation spacecraft  
 and in the other i was a data scientist looking for potential smugglers of sensitive nuclear technologies
  as a data scientist i did a lot of analyses  mostly of facilities  industrial facilities around the world 
 and i was always looking for a better canvas to tie these all together and
 one day i was thinking about how all data has a location  and i realized that the answer had been staring me in the face  although i was a
  i hadn 't thought about using satellite imagery
 in my work 
 now like most of us i 'd been online i 'd see my house so i thought i 'll hop in there and i 'll start looking up some of these facilities  
 and what i found really surprised me 
 the pictures that i was finding were years out of date  and because of that it had relatively little relevance to the work that i was doing today  
 but i was intrigued i mean satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff
  are millions and millions of sensors surrounding us today  but there 's still so much we don 't know on a daily basis how much oil is stored in all of china 
 how much corn is being produced 
 how many ships are in all of our world 's ports now in theory all of these questions could be
  answered by imagery but not if it 's old  and if this data was so valuable  then how come i couldn 't get my hands on more recent pictures 
 so the story begins over fifty years ago with the launch of the first generation of u s government photo reconnaissance satellites 
 and today  there 's a handful of the great great grandchildren of these early cold war machines which are now operated by private companies and from which the vast majority of satellite imagery that you and i
  see on a daily basis comes  
 during this period launching things into space just the rocket to get the satellite up there has cost hundreds of millions of dollars each  
 and that 's created tremendous pressure to launch things infrequently
 and to make sure that when you do you cram as much functionality in there as
  all of this has only made satellites bigger and bigger and bigger and more expensive  
 now nearly a billion with a b dollars per copy  
 because they are so expensive there aren 't very many of them because there aren 't very many of them the pictures that we see on a daily basis tend to be old  
 i think a lot of people actually understand this anecdotally  but in order to visualize just how sparsely our planet is collected some friends and i put
 of the thirty million pictures that have been gathered by these satellites between two thousand and two thousand and ten 
 as you can see in blue  huge areas of our world are barely seen less than once a year  
 and even the areas that are seen most frequently those in red are seen at best once a quarter 
 now as
 aerospace engineering grad students this chart cried out to us as a challenge
  these things have to be so expensive  does a single satellite really have to cost the equivalent of three seven hundred and forty seven jumbo jets 
 wasn 't there a way to build a smaller simpler new satellite design that could enable more timely imaging
 i realize that it does sound a little bit crazy that we were going to go out and just begin designing satellites but fortunately we
  had help 
 in the late  1990s a couple of professors proposed a concept for radically reducing the price of putting things in space this was hitchhiking small satellites alongside much larger satellites 
 this dropped the cost of putting objects up there by over a factor of one hundred 
 and suddenly we could afford to experiment to take a little bit of risk and to realize a lot
  of innovation  and a new generation of engineers and scientists mostly out of universities began launching these very small
  satellites called  cubesats and these were built with electronics obtained from radioshack instead of lockheed martin  
 now it was using the lessons learned from these early missions that my friends and i began a series of sketches of our own satellite design and
 i can 't remember a specific day where we made a conscious decision that we were actually going to go out and build these things but once we got that idea in our minds of the world 
  as a dataset of being able to capture millions of data points on a daily basis describing the global economy of being able to unearth billions of connections between them that had never before been found 
 on anything else  
 and so we moved into a cramped  
 windowless office in palo alto  and began working to take our design from the drawing board into the lab
 the first major question we had to tackle was just how big to build this thing in space  size
  and we had worked with these very small breadbox sized satellites in school  but as we began to better understand the laws of physics we found that the quality of pictures those satellites could take was very limited 
 because the laws of physics dictate that the best picture you can take through a telescope is a function of the diameter of that telescope and these satellites had a very small very constrained volume  
 and we found that the best picture we would have been able to get looked something like this
  frankly it was just too blurry to see the things that make satellite imagery valuable 
 so about three or four weeks later  we met a group of engineers randomly who had worked on the first private imaging satellite ever developed  
 and they told us that back in the 1970s the u s government had found a powerful
 optimal tradeoff
 that in taking pictures at right about one meter resolution being able to see objects one meter
  in size they had found that they could not just get very high quality images but get a lot of them at an affordable price 
 from our own computer simulations we quickly found that one meter really was the minimum viable product to be able to see the drivers of our global economy 
 for the first time being able to count the ships and cars and shipping containers and trucks that move around our world on a daily basis while conveniently still not being able to see
 individuals 
 we had found our compromise we would have to build something larger than the original breadbox  now more like a mini fridge but we still wouldn 't have to build a pickup truck 
 so now we had our constraint the laws of physics dictated the absolute minimum sized telescope that we could build 
 what came next was making the rest of the satellite as small and as simple as possible  basically a flying telescope with
  four walls and a set of electronics smaller than a phone book that used less power than a one hundred watt lightbulb 
 the big challenge became actually taking the pictures through that telescope  traditional imaging satellites use a line scanner  similar to a xerox machine 
 and as they traverse the earth they take pictures scanning row by row by row to build the complete image  now people use these because they get a lot of light
 which means less of the noise you see in a low cost cell phone image 
 the problem with them is they require very sophisticated pointing 
 you have to stay focused on a 50 centimeter target from over six hundred miles away while moving at more than seven kilometers a second which requires an awesome degree of complexity 
 so instead we turned to a new generation of video sensors  originally created for use in night vision goggles
 instead of taking a single high quality image  we could take a videostream of individually noisier frames  
 but then we could recombine all of those frames together into very high quality images using sophisticated pixel processing techniques here on the ground 
 at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system and
 we applied this technique to many of the other systems on the satellite as well
  by day our design evolved from cad to prototypes to production units 
 a few short weeks ago  we packed up skysat one put our signatures on it and waved goodbye for the last time on earth 
 today  it 's sitting in its final launch configuration
 ready to blast off in a few short weeks and soon we 'll turn our attention to launching a
  constellation of twenty four or more of these satellites and beginning to build the scalable analytics that will allow us to unearth the insights in the petabytes of data we will collect 
 so why do all of this why build these satellites well it turns out
 imaging satellites have a unique ability to provide global
  and providing that transparency on a timely basis is simply an idea whose time has come 
 we see ourselves as pioneers of a new frontier  and beyond economic data unlocking the human story moment by moment 
 for a data scientist that just happened to go to space camp as a kid it just doesn 't get much better than that
