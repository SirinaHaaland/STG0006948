  the most complex problems in our time
 can be solved with simple techniques  if we are able to dream 
 as a child  i discovered that creativity is the key to cross
 from
 dreams to reality 
 i learned this from my grandmother dr ruth tichauer 
 a jewish refugee that settled in the heart of the andes 
 that
 is how i grew up  encouraged to see beyond any limitation  
 so part of my education included helping her in remote
 indigenous communities i cherish those memories because they helped me to understand life outside the city 
 a life
 with a lot of possibilities  without barriers  as language or culture  during those trips my grandmother used to recite a kipling poem
 go and find it go and look behind the mountains  something lost
 behind the mountains  lost and waiting for you go 
 in the coming years i became a medical student 
 one of every hundred children born worldwide has some kind
  of heart disease  there 's a part of this problem
 i think i can solve the part of this problem
 i have spent my life my life working on the problem starts
 during pregnancy  the fetus needs to survive inside the mother
  depends on communication
 between the systemic and the pulmonary blood at the moment of birth this communication needs to stop 
 if it doesn 't close the baby has a hole in the heart it is caused by prematurity and
  we know today
 is that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes  
 as you can see in the chart the frequency
 of this kind of hole dramatically increases with altitude
  seem desperate to breathe to close the hole major surgery used to be the only solution 
 one night my friend malte were camping in the amazon region 
 the only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch then came a moment of inspiration
  used the branch as a mold for our first invention the holes in children 's hearts can be closed with it a
 coil is a piece of wire wrapped
 onto itself it maybe doesn 't look so fancy to you now  but that was our first successful attempt
  to create a device for this major problem 
 in this video we can see how a very tiny catheter takes the coil to the heart 
 the coil then closes the hole  after that moment of inspiration  there came a very long
 time of effort
 developing a prototype in vitro and in vivo studies
  if it works can save lives 
 i returned from germany to bolivia  thinking that wherever we go  we have the opportunity to make a difference 
 with my wife and partner dr alexandra heath  we started to see
  successfully treating patients with our coil  we felt really enthusiastic  but we live
 in a place that is twelve thousand feet high and 
 the patients there need a special device to solve their heart condition  
 the hole in altitude patients is different because the orifice between the arteries
  is larger most patients cannot afford to be treated on time and they die  
 the first coil
 could successfully treat only half of the patients in bolivia  the search started
  went back to the drawing
 board  
 after many trials and with the help of my grandmother 's indigenous friends in the mountains  
 we obtained a new device 
 for centuries indigenous women told stories by weaving complex patterns on looms and
 an unexpected skill helped us for the new device 
 we take this traditional
 method of weaving and make a design made by a smart material
 that records shape 
 it seems
 this time the weaving allows us to create a seamless device that doesn 't rust
 because it 's made of
  can change by itself into very complex structures by a procedure that took decades to develop  
 as you can see the device enters the body through the natural channels 
 doctors have only to close the catheter through the hole our device expands  places itself and closes the hole
  we have this beautiful delivery system
 that is so simple to use because it works by itself 
 no open surgery was necessary 
 as doctors we fight with diseases that take a long time and effort to heal
  if they do this is the child from before  after the procedure  as you can see 
 as you can see  once the device is in place  the patient is one hundred percent healed 
 from start to finish the whole procedure takes only thirty minutes
  that 's very rewarding from the medical and human point of view  we are so proud that some
 of our former patients are part of our team
 a team thanks to added close interaction with
  we have only one idea the best solutions need to be simple  
 we lost the fear of creating something new 
 the path it 's not easy many obstacles arise all the time  but we receive strength
 from our patients 
  our creativity our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind 
 not because of cost
 or access so we have to start a foundation with
 model  we will give one device for free to make sure that
  that every child is treated  we are in many countries now  but we need
 to be everywhere this whole thing began with one impossible idea
 as will continue it really
  is left behind
