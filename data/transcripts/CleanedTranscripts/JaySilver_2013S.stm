  someone just mentioned macgyver because that was like  i loved it and when i was seven i taped a fork to a drill and i was like
  worked really well there
  and you know it had a profound effect on me it sounds silly but i i thought okay the way the world works
 can be changed and it can be changed by me in these small ways  and my relationship to especially human made objects which someone else said they work like this well i can
 say they work a different way a little bit  and so  about twenty years later i didn 't realize the full effect of this but i went to costa rica
 and i stayed with these guaym natives there  and they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them and they could make beds out of
 trees and they could i watched this woman for three days i was there  she was peeling this palm frond apart these little threads off of it  and she 'd roll the threads together and make little
 thicker threads like strings and she would weave the
  together and as the materiality of this exact very bag formed before my eyes over those three days 
 the materiality of the way the world works of reality kind of started to unravel in my mind because i realized
 that this bag and these clothes and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener everything
  you have is made out of
 either a tree or a rock or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to maybe a more complicated one but still everything was made that way  and so i had to start studying 
 who is it that 's making these decisions who 's making these things how did they make them what stops us from making them because this is how reality is created  
 so i started right away  i was at mit media lab and i was studying
 the maker movement and makers
  and i started in nature  because i saw these guayms doing it in nature  and there just seems to be less barriers  so i went
 to vermont to not back to school camp where there 's unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out and willing to try anything so i said let 's go into the woods near this stream and just put 
  stuff together  you know make something i don 't care geometrical shapes just grab some junk from around you we won 't bring anything with us 
  and the shape of an oak leaf being made by other small oak leaves being put together 
 a leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass 
 the materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it and after about forty five minutes you get really intricate projects 
  like leaves sorted by hue so you get a color fade and put in a circle like a wreath 
  he said this is fire i call this fire and someone asked him how do you get those sticks to stay on that tree 
 and he 's like i don 't know but i can show you 
 and i 'm like wow that 's really amazing he doesn 't know but he can show you so his hands know and his intuition knows but sometimes what we know gets in the way of what could be 
  we think we already know how something works  so we can 't imagine how it could work we know how it 's supposed to work  so we can 't suppose all the things that could be possible 
 so
 kids don 't have as hard of a time with this 
 and i saw in my own son i gave him this book  i 'm a good hippie dad so i 'm like okay you 're going to learn to love the moon  i 'm going to give you some
  're nonrectilinear cactus building blocks so it 's totally legit but he doesn 't really know what to do with these i didn 't show him  
 and so he 's like okay i 'll just mess around with this this is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest just going to
 try to put them in shapes and push on them and stuff and before long he 's kind of got this mechanism where you can almost launch and catapult
 objects around and he enlists us in helping him and at this point i 'm starting to wonder
  what kind of tools can we give people especially 
 who know too much 
 so that they can see the world as malleable so they see themselves as agents of change in their everyday lives 
 because the most advanced scientists are really just kind of pushing the way the world itself works pushing what matter can do the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium and any sufficiently complicated task whether you 're a cook or a carpenter or you 're raising a child
  anything that 's complicated
 comes up with problems that aren 't solved in the middle of it and you can 't do a good job getting it done unless you can say okay well we 're just going to have to refigure this i don 't care
 that pencils are supposed to be for writing i 'm going to use them a different way so let me show you a little demo
  this is a little piano circuit right in here  and this is an
  ordinary paintbrush that i smashed it together with and so with some ketchup  
 and then i can kind of 
 and that
  this is not what 's awesome what 's awesome is what happens when you give the piano circuit to people 
 a pencil is not just a pencil look what it has in the middle of it 
 that 's a wire running down the middle and not only is it a wire if you take that piano circuit you can thumbtack into the middle of a pencil  
 you can lay out wire on the page too and get electrical current to run through it 
 and so you can kind of hack a pencil just by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical
  circuit  and the electricity runs through your body too  and then you can take the the little piano circuit off the pencil you can make one of these brushes
 just on the fly all you do is connect to the bristles and the bristles are wet so they conduct  
 and the person 's body conducts and leather is great to paint on 
 and then you can start hooking to everything even the kitchen sink the metal in the sink is conductive
  flowing water acts like a theremin or a violin 
 and you can even hook to the trees anything in the world is either conductive or not conductive and you can use those together  
 so 
 i took this to those same teens because those teens are really awesome and they 'll try things that i won 't try i don 't even have access to a facial piercing if i wanted to
  and this
 young woman she made what she called a hula looper and as the hula hoop traveled around her body  
 she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there you can see her pointing to it in the picture 
 and every time the hula hoop would smush against her body it would connect two little pieces of copper tape and it would make a sound and the next sound and it would loop the same sounds over and over again 
 i ran these workshops everywhere in taiwan at an art museum this
  made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from taiwan and some electrical tape and hot glue  and professional designers were making artifacts with this thing strapped onto it and
  big companies like intel or smaller design firms like ideo or startups like bump were inviting me to give workshops just to practice this idea of smashing electronics and everyday objects
  then we came up with this idea
 to not just use electronics but let 's just smash computers with
 everyday objects and see how that goes over and so i just want to do a quick demo  
 so this is the makey makey circuit and i 'm just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you so i 'll just plug it in 
 and now it 's on by usb and i 'll just hook up the forward arrow  
 you guys are facing that way so i 'll hook it to this one
 and i 'll just hook up a little ground wire to it  and now if i touch this piece of pizza the slides that i showed you before
 should go forward  and now if i hook up this wire just by connecting it to the left arrow i 'm kind of programming it by where i hook it up
  now i have a left arrow and a right arrow  so i should be able to go
  and so we 're like we gotta put a video out about this because no one really believed that this was important or meaningful
 except me and like one other guy so we made a video to prove that there 's lots of stuff you can do 
 you can kind of sketch with play doh and just google for game controllers
  just ordinary play doh nothing special and you can literally draw joysticks and just find pacman on your computer and then just hook it up
 noises and you know
 the little plastic drawers you can get at target well if you take those out they hold water great but you can totally cut your toes so
 yeah just be careful  
 you know the happiness project where the experts are setting up the piano stairs  and how cool that is well i think it 's cool but we should be doing that stuff ourselves it shouldn
 't be a set of experts engineering the
  way the world works  we should all be participating
 in changing the way the world works together  aluminum foil everybody has a cat get
 a bowl of water this is just photo booth on your mac os  hover the mouse over the take a photo button and you 've got a little cat photo booth  and so we needed hundreds of people to buy this  if hundreds of people didn 't buy this we couldn 't put it on the market  
 and so we put it up on kickstarter and
 hundreds of people bought it in the first
  day  and then thirty days later eleven thousand people had backed the project  and then what the best part is we started getting a flood of
 videos in of people doing crazy things with it so this is the star spangled banner by eating lunch including drinking listerine  
 and we actually sent this guy materials we 're like we 're sponsoring you man you 're like a pro maker
  these guys at the exploratorium are playing house plants as if they were drums  
 and dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways  
 and then this brother look at this diagram see where it says sister i love when people put humans
 on the diagram i always add humans to any any technical if you 're drawing a technical
  diagram put a human in it  
 and this kid is so sweet he made this trampoline slideshow advancer for his sister so that on her birthday she could be the star of the show jumping on the trampoline to advance the slides 
 and this guy rounded up his dogs and he made a dog piano 
 and this is fun and what could be more useful
  than feeling alive and fun but it 's also very serious because
 all this accessibility stuff started coming up where people can 't use computers necessarily like this dad who wrote us his son has cerebral palsy and he can 't use a normal keyboard  and so his dad
 couldn 't necessarily afford to buy all these custom controllers  and so with the makey makey he planned to make these gloves to allow him to navigate the web  
 and a huge eruption of discussion around
 accessibility came and we 're really excited about that we didn 't plan for that at all
 and then all these
 professional musicians started using it like at coachella just this weekend
 jurassic five was using this onstage  and this d j is just from brooklyn right around here and he put this up last month  and i love the carrot on the turntable
 and when this started to get serious i thought i 'd better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in because otherwise people are going to be getting this and they 're going to be turning into agents of creative change and governments 
  will be crumbling and i wouldn 't have told people  so i thought i 'd better warn them and i also put this little surprise when you open the lid of the box it says the world is a construction kit 
  mess around this way i think that in some small ways you do start to see the landscape of your everyday life a little bit more like something you could express yourself with 
 and a little bit more like you could participate in designing the future of the way the world works
 and so next time you 're on an escalator and you drop an m & m by accident you know maybe that 's an m & m surfboard 
 not an escalator so don 't pick it up right away maybe take some more stuff
  i used to want to design a utopian society or or a perfect world or something like that 
 but as i 'm kind of getting older and kind of messing with all this stuff i 'm realizing
 that my idea of a perfect world really can 't be designed by one person or even by a million experts it 's really going to be seven billion pairs of hands  each following their own
  each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens and that 's the world i really want to live in thank you
