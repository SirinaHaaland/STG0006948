  so recently we heard a lot about how social media helps empower protest  and that 's true  
 but after more than a decade of studying and participating in multiple social movements 
 i 've come to realize that the way technology empowers social movements can
  also paradoxically help weaken them this is not inevitable  but overcoming it requires diving deep into what makes success possible
 over the long term and the lessons apply in multiple domains  
 now take turkey 's  gezi park protests july two thousand and thirteen which i went back to study in the field 
 twitter was key to its organizing it was everywhere in the park
  well along with a lot of tear gas it wasn 't all high tech  
 but the people in turkey had already gotten used to the power of twitter because of an unfortunate incident about a year before when military jets had 
 bombed and killed thirty four kurdish smugglers near the border region 
  newsrooms and waited for the government to tell them what to do one frustrated journalist could not take this anymore he purchased his own plane ticket and went to the village where this had occurred  
 and he was confronted by this scene a line of coffins coming down a hill relatives wailing 
 he later he told me how overwhelmed he
  and didn 't know what to do so he took out his phone like any one of us might  and snapped that picture and tweeted it out 
 and voila 
 that picture went viral
 and broke the censorship and forced mass media to cover it 
 so when a year later turkey 's gezi protests happened it started as a protest about a park being razed
 it got a little ridiculous at times when things were so intense when cnn international was broadcasting live
 from istanbul  cnn turkey instead was broadcasting a documentary on penguins  
 now i love penguin documentaries but that wasn 't the news of the day an angry viewer put his two screens together and snapped that picture and that one
  too went viral and since then people call turkish media the penguin media 
 but this time people knew what to do they just took out their phones and looked for actual news  better  they knew to go to the park
 and take pictures and participate and share it more on social media digital connectivity was used for everything from food to donations
  organized partially with the help of these new technologies  
 and using internet to mobilize and publicize protests actually goes back a long way  
 remember the zapatistas  the peasant uprising in the southern chiapas region of mexico led by the masked
  global attention thanks to the internet or consider seattle ' ninety nine when a multinational grassroots effort
 brought global attention
 to what was then an obscure organization the world trade organization 
 by also utilizing these digital technologies to help them organize 
 and more recently movement after movement has shaken country after country  the arab uprisings
  from bahrain to tunisia to egypt and more
  facebook page can become the hub of a massive mobilization  amazing  
 but think of the moments i just mentioned  
 the achievements they were able to have their outcomes are not really proportional to the size and energy they inspired 
 the hopes they rightfully raised are not really matched by what they were able to
 have as a result in the end and this raises a question 
 as digital technology makes things easier for movements why haven 't successful outcomes become more likely as well  
 in embracing digital platforms for
 activism and politics are we overlooking some of the benefits of doing things the hard way now i believe so
  i believe that the rule of thumb is easier to mobilize does not always mean easier to achieve gains  now 
 to be clear technology does empower in multiple ways  it 's very powerful 
 in turkey  i watched four young college students organize a countrywide
  that became the central hub for uncensored news in the country  in egypt  i saw another four young people
 use digital connectivity to organize the supplies and logistics for ten field hospitals very large operations  during massive clashes near tahrir square
 in two thousand and eleven  and
 i asked the founder of this effort called tahrir supplies how long it took him to go from when he had the idea to when he got started 
 five minutes he said  five minutes  and he had no training or background in logistics or think of the occupy movement which rocked the world in two thousand and eleven  
 it started with a single email
 from a magazine adbusters to ninety thousand subscribers in its list 
  about two months after that first email there were in the united states six hundred ongoing occupations and protests
 less than one month after the first physical occupation in zuccotti park a global protest was held
 in about eighty two countries nine hundred and fifty cities it was one of the largest global protests ever organized now
 compare that to what the civil rights movement had to do in
 nine hundred and fifty five alabama
 to protest the racially segregated bus system  
 which they wanted to boycott they 'd been preparing for many years and decided it was time to swing into action after rosa parks was arrested 
 but how do you get the word out tomorrow we 're going to start the boycott when
 you don 't have facebook
  none of that so
 they had to mimeograph fifty two thousand leaflets by sneaking into a university duplicating room and working all night  secretly  
 they then used
  organizations that  criss crossed the city to distribute those leaflets by hand  and the logistical tasks were daunting because
  these were poor people they had to get to work boycott or no so a massive carpool was organized  
 again by meeting no texting no twitter no facebook they had to meet almost all the time to keep this carpool going 
 today it would be so much easier we could create a database available rides and
 what rides you need have the database coordinate and use texting we wouldn 't have to meet all that much 
 but again consider this the civil
  rights movement in the united states navigated a minefield of political dangers  faced repression
 and overcame  won major policy concessions navigated and innovated through risks  
 in contrast  three years after occupy sparked that global conversation about inequality the policies that fueled it are still in place
  europe was also rocked by 
  but the continent didn 't shift its direction  in embracing these technologies are we overlooking
 some of the benefits of slow and sustained 
 to understand this i went back to turkey about a year after the gezi protests and i interviewed a range of people
  from activists to politicians 
 from both the ruling party and the opposition party and movements i found that the gezi protesters were despairing 
 they were frustrated and they had achieved much less than what they had hoped for this echoed what i 'd been hearing around the world from many other
 protesters that i 'm in touch with 
 and i 've come to realize that part of the problem is that today 's protests have become a bit like climbing mt everest
 with the help of sixty sherpas  and the internet is our sherpa 
 what we 're doing is taking the fast routes
 and not replacing the benefits of the slower work because you see the kind of work that went into organizing all those daunting
  tedious logistical tasks
 did not just take care of those tasks 
 they also created the kind of organization that could think together collectively and make hard decisions together create consensus and innovate and maybe even more crucially  keep going together through differences 
 so when you see
  when you look at that picture where this is the march where martin luther king gave his famous i have a dream speech one thousand nine hundred and sixty three 
 you don 't just see a march and you don 't just hear a powerful speech you also see
 the painstaking long term work that can put on that march and if you 're in power you realize you have to take the
  capacity signaled by that march not just the march  but the capacity signaled by that march seriously  
 in contrast  when you look at occupy 's global marches that were organized in two weeks you see a lot of discontent  but you don 't necessarily see teeth that can bite over the long term 
 and crucially the civil rights movement innovated tactically from
 boycotts to lunch counter sit ins to pickets to marches to freedom rides
  today 's movements scale up very quickly without the organizational base that can see them through the challenges  
 they feel a little like startups that got very big without knowing what to do next  and they rarely manage to shift tactically because they don 't have the depth of capacity to weather such transitions now 
  the magic is not in the mimeograph
  it 's in that capacity to work together think together collectively  which can only be built over time with a lot of work 
 to understand all this 
 i interviewed a top official from the ruling party in turkey and i ask him how do you do it they too use digital technology extensively so that 's not it
  he told me he said the key is he never took sugar with his tea i
 said what has that got to do with anything  
 well he said his party starts getting ready for the next election the day after the last one and he spends all day every day meeting with voters in their homes in their wedding parties circumcision ceremonies
  and then he meets with his colleagues to compare notes 
 with that many meetings every day with tea offered at every one of them which he could not refuse  because that would be rude  
 he could not take even one cube of sugar per cup of tea because that would be many kilos of sugar he can 't even calculate how many kilos and at
 that point i realized why he was speaking so fast 
 we had met in the afternoon and he was already way
 two major elections within a year of the gezi protests with comfortable margins  to be sure governments have different resources to bring to the table it 's not the same game  but the differences are instructive  
 and like all such stories this is not a story just of technology it 's what technology allows us to do converging with what we want to do 
 today 's social movements want to operate informally
  do not want institutional leadership they want to stay out of politics because they fear corruption and cooptation they have a point  modern representative democracies are being strangled in many countries by powerful interests 
 but operating this way makes it hard for them to sustain over the long term and exert leverage over the system which leads to frustrated protesters dropping out
  and even more corrupt politics 
 and politics and democracy without an effective challenge hobbles  because the causes that have inspired the modern
 recent movements are crucial  
 climate change is barreling towards us 
 inequality is stifling human growth and potential and economies  authoritarianism is choking many countries we need
  movements to be more effective now some people have argued that the problem is today 's movements
 are not formed of people who take as many risks as before
  and that is not true from gezi to tahrir to elsewhere  i 've seen people put their lives and livelihoods on the line it
 's also not true as malcolm gladwell claimed that today 's protesters form weaker virtual ties
 they come to these protests just like before 
 with their friends  existing networks  and sometimes they do make new friends for life  i still see the friends that i made in those zapatista convened global protests more than a decade ago 
 and the bonds between strangers are not worthless when i got 
  people i didn 't know helped me and one another instead of running away
 in tahrir i saw people protesters working really hard to keep each other safe and protected and digital awareness raising is great because changing minds is the bedrock of changing politics  
 but movements today
 have to move beyond participation at great scale very fast and figure out how
  develop strong policy proposals create consensus figure out the political steps and relate them to leverage because all these good intentions and bravery and sacrifice by itself are not going to be enough
  over the long term
