  arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us and yet i stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably
  never been a more exciting moment to be alive  
 because of some of technologies we 've been talking about because of the resources the skills and certainly the surge of talent we 're seeing all around the world  with the mindset to create change 
 and we 've got a president
 who sees himself as a global citizen who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower but that we 've got to engage in a different way with the world 
 and by definition every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul
 a global citizen you work on the front lines and you 've seen the best and the worst that
 human beings can do for one another and to one another 
 and no matter what country you live or work in you 've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of  even in their most ordinariness  
 today
 there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty how best we release their
  energies on the one hand we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out and on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid 
 and what i want to talk about is something that compliments both systems we call it patient capital  
  and say and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty  
 rampant corruption they use mobutu as metaphor  and their policy prescription is to
 make government more accountable focus on the capital markets  
 invest don 't give anything away on the other side as i said there are those who say the problem is that we need more money that when it comes to the rich
 and we 'll hand a lot of aid  but when it comes to our poor brethren we want little to do with it they point to the successes of aid  
 the eradication of smallpox and the distribution of tens of millions of
 malaria bed nets and
 antiretrovirals both sides are right  and the problem is that neither side is listening to the other  even more problematic they 're not listening to poor
  people themselves after twenty five years of working on issues of poverty and innovation it 's true that there are probably no more 
 individuals on the planet than low income people they must navigate markets daily  making 
 dozens and dozens to move their way through society  and yet if a single catastrophic health
 problem impacts their family they could be put back into poverty sometimes for generations  and so we need both the market and we need aid 
 patient capital
 works between  and tries to take the best of both 
 it 's money that 's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare water housing alternative energy
  thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity  
 but as individual customers consumers clients people who want to make decisions in their own lives patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for 
  risk a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment to use
  the market as the best listening device that we have and the expectation of below market returns  but outsized social impact  
 it recognizes that the market has its limitation  and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global 
  economy to include all people now entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons 
  they tend to work in markets where people make one two three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level  
 second the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure no roads to speak of sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption 
 third  they are often creating markets  even if you 're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages  it is something new  and so
  people have seen
 so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time takes a lot of patience 
 it also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance not only to build the systems  the business models that allow us to reach low income people 
  in a sustainable way  but to connect those business to other markets to governments to corporations real
  partnerships if we want to get to scale 
 i want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation in two thousand and two i met this incredible entrepreneur named amitabha sadangi from india who 'd been working for twenty years with some of the poorest farmers
 on the planet and he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low income farmers altogether despite the fact that two hundred million farmers
  alone in india make under a dollar a day  
 they were creating subsidies either for large farms or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use rather than that the farmers wanted to use at
 the same time amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in israel
  it was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant  and it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green  
  but the market also had bypassed low income farmers because these systems were both too expensive  and they were constructed for fields that were too large  the average small village farmer works on two acres or less  
  farmers themselves  because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have  
 and he used three fundamental principles the first one was miniaturization 
 the drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre  
 even if he had two because it was too frightening  given all that he had at stake
  be extremely affordable in other words that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest or else they wouldn 't take the risk 
 and third  it had to be what amitabha calls infinitely expandable 
 what i mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre the farmers could buy a second and a third and
  as of today ide india  amitabha 's organization has sold over three hundred thousand farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average but this didn 't happen overnight 
 in fact when you go back to the beginning there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day 
 that were known to be some of the most risk averse people on the planet
 and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors
  agriculture  and so we needed grants  and he used significant grants to research to experiment to fail to innovate and try again  
 and when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers that 's when patient capital could come in and we helped him build a company 
 for profit 
  that would build on ide 's knowledge and start looking at sales and exports  and be able to tap into other kinds of capital  
 secondarily  we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries  and so we met dr sono khangharani in pakistan  
 and while again you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in india into pakistan  just to get the permits 
 over time we were able to start a
  with with dr sono who runs a large community development organization in the thar desert which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country 
 and though that company has just started  our assumption is that there too we 'll see the impact on millions  
 but drip irrigation isn 't the only innovation we 're starting to see these happening all around the
  textile manufacturing has worked in partnership with us with unicef with the global fund to create a factory that now employs seven thousand people mostly women  and they produce twenty million lifesaving bednets for africans around the world  
 lifespring hospital is a joint venture between acumen and the government of india to bring quality  affordable
  it 's been so successful that it 's currently building a new hospital every thirty five days  
 and one thousand two hundred and ninety eight ambulances decided that it was going to
 reinvent a completely broken industry building an ambulance service in bombay that would use the technology of google earth 
 a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form
 so that in the terrorist attacks of november they were the first responder  and are now beginning to scale because of partnership they 've just won four government contracts to build off their one hundred ambulances and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies
 in india this idea of scale is critical  because we 're starting to see
  these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people all of the ones i discussed
 have reached at least a quarter million people but that 's obviously not enough 
 and it 's where the idea of partnership becomes so important  whether it 's by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets government itself or partner 
  with major corporations there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation 
  he recently authorized the creation of a social innovation fund to focus on what works in this country and look at how we can scale it and i would submit that it 's time to consider a global 
  innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations not only for their country but ones that we can use in the developed world as well  invest
  perspective 
 when we think about new approaches to aid it 's impossible not to talk about pakistan  
 we 've had a rocky relationship with that country and in all fairness  the united states has not always been a very reliable partner 
 but again i would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things
  if we take that notion of a global innovation fund  
 we could use this time to invest not directly in government though we would have government 's blessing nor in international experts  but in the many
  existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful
  created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country 
 and tasneem siddiqui who developed a way called incremental housing where he has moved forty thousand slum dwellers into safe  affordable community housing  educational 
 initiatives like dil and the citizen foundation that are building schools across the country  
  alternatives to the taliban 
 i 've invested in pakistan for over seven years now and those of you who 've also worked there can attest that pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population 
 and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature  
 president kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible
 make violent revolution inevitable
  say that the converse is true 
 that these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the seventy percent of pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day  
 provide real pathways to hope  
 and as we think about how we construct aid for pakistan  while we need to strengthen the judiciary build greater stability  we also need to think about lifting those
  leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world 
 on one of my last visits to pakistan i asked dr sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the thar desert 
 and we left karachi one morning before dawn it was about one hundred and fifteen degrees  and we drove for eight hours along this
  lots of heat very little discussion because we were exhausted and finally at the end of the journey  i could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon  and as we got closer  its significance became apparent 
 that there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall  because one of the poorest farmers on earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life 
 his name was raja and
  he had kind twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father  
 and he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn 't taken his twelve children and fifty grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about fifty cents a
  because he was building these crops  
 and with the money he earned he could stay this year and for the first time ever in three generations his children would go to school 
 we asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons and he said of course i will  because i don 't want them discriminated against
 anymore 
 when we think about solutions to poverty  we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity because at the end of the day
  is more important to the human spirit than wealth  
 and what 's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity because that is where dignity really starts  
 martin luther king said that love without power
 is anemic and sentimental and that power
  without love is reckless and abusive 
 our generation has seen both approaches tried  and often fail  
 but i think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power 
 for that is what we 'll need as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us and to finally
  extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet  
 the time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions a cross sector is now 
 i can only talk from my own experience  but in eight years of
 running acumen fund  i 've seen the power of patient capital not only to
 inspire innovation
 and risk taking  but to truly build systems that have created more than twenty five thousand jobs and delivered
 tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet  i know it works but i know that many other kinds of innovation also work
