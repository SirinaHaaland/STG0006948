  it sure used to be a lot easier to be from iceland because until a couple of years ago people knew hardly anything about us  and i could basically come out here and say only good things about us
 but in the last couple of years
 we 've become infamous for a couple of things first of course the economic meltdown 
 it actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on ebay 
 ninety nine pence was the starting price and no reserve  then
 there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of
  none of your media got it right 
 but i 'm not here to share these stories about these two things exactly i 'm here to tell you the story of audur capital  which is a financial firm founded by me and kristin who you see in the picture
 in the spring of two thousand and seven just over a year before the economic
  why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector
 leave to found a financial services firm well let it suffice to say
 that we felt a bit
 overwhelmed with testosterone  and i 'm not here to say that men are to blame
 for the crisis and what happened in my country  but i can surely tell you that in my country much like on wall street and the city of london and elsewhere men
 were at the helm of the game of the financial sector  
 and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems 
 so we decided a bit fed up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn 't sustainable to found a financial services firm based on our values
  values 
 and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance raised quite a few eyebrows in iceland we weren 't known as the typical 
 women women in iceland up until then  so it was almost like coming out of the closet
 to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business
  would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then  
 and we got a great group of people to join us principled people with great skills and investors with a vision and values to match ours  
 and together we got through the eye of the financial storm in iceland without taking any direct losses to
  our equity or to the funds of our clients 
 and although i want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that and also there 's a factor of luck and timing
 we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values  so let me share with you our values  
 we believe in risk awareness what does that mean  
 we believe that you should always understand the risks that you 're taking  and we will not invest in things we don 't understand
 not a complicated thing  
 but in two thousand and seven at the height of the sub prime and all the complicated financial structures it was quite opposite to the reckless 
 behaviors that we saw on the market  we also believe in 
 telling it as it is using simple language that people understand telling people about the
  downsides as well as the potential upsides  
 and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter like our lack of belief in the sustainability of the icelandic financial sector that already we had months before the collapse hit us  
 and although we do work in the financial sector  where excel is king  
 we believe in emotional capital  and we believe that doing emotional
  due diligence
 is just as important as doing financial due diligence it
 is actually people that make money and lose money 
 not excel spreadsheets 
 last but not least  we believe in profit
  with principles we care how we make our profit so while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers we are willing to do it with a long term view  
 and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter  so we like to see profits  plus
 positive social and environmental benefits when we invest 
 but it wasn 't just about the values although we are convinced that they matter it was also about a business opportunity  it 's the female trend
  and it 's the sustainability trend that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come 
 the whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men 
 it is actually about women being different from men bringing different values and different ways to the table so what do you get you get better
  and you get less herd behavior and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results  
 but one has to wonder now that we 've had this financial sector collapse upon us in iceland and by the way  europe
 looks pretty bad right now and many would say that you in america are heading for some more trouble as well 
 now that we 've had all that happen and we have all this data out there telling us that it 's much better
 to have diversity around
 decision making tables  will we see business and finance change  will government change  
 well i 'll give you my straight talk about this 
 i have days that i believe  but i have days that i 'm full of doubt 
 have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us 
 einstein said that this was the definition of insanity
 to do the same things over and over again  hoping for a different outcome  
 so i guess the world is insane because i see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again  hoping that this time it 's not going to collapse upon us 
 i want to see more revolutionary
  i remain hopeful like ted i believe in people  and i know that consumers are becoming more conscious  and they are going to start voting with their wallets 
  and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside  if they don 't do it from the inside  
  viking age  
 and i want to tell you when i first realized that women matter to the economy and to the society i was seven it happened to be my mother 's birthday october 
 women in iceland took the day off from work or from home they took the day off  and nothing worked
  they marched into the center of reykjavik  and they put women 's issues onto the agenda  
 and some say this was the start of a global movement for me it was the start of a long journey  
 but i decided that day to matter  
 five years later iceland elected vigdis finnbogadottir as their president first female to become
  single mom a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breasts removed  and at one of the campaign sessions she had one of
 her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn 't become president
 she was a woman  and even half a woman
  that night she won the election  because she came back not just because of his crappy behavior but she came back
  i 'm actually not going to breastfeed the icelandic nation i 'm going to lead it 
 so i 've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced 
  who i am and where i am today  but in spite of that i went through the first ten or fifteen years of my career mostly in denial of being a woman  started in corporate america  
  that it was just about the individual that women and men would have just the same opportunities  
 but i 've come to conclude lately that it isn 't like that we are not the same and it 's great 
 because of our differences we create and sustain life so we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge the final thought i want to leave with you is that
  fed up with this tyranny of either or choices in life either it 's men or it 's women 
 we need to start embracing the beauty of balance  so let 's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there and let 's start thinking about
  doing good business that 's how we change the world that 's the only sustainable future
