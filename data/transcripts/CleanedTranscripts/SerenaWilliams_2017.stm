  no doubt you guys are like me you saw the release of serena in that great yellow bathing suit last week and when i saw it all i could think of was
 gosh why couldn 't she have waited til we sat onstage for ted i was very selfish i know  so i asked you about that picture and you said
 nobody was supposed to see that picture what do you mean serena williams well actually it was an accident  
 i was on vacation just taking some time for myself and i have this thing where
  i 've been
 checking my my status and
 taking pictures every week to see how far along i 'm going gk and sharing it with friends maybe sw no actually i have just been saving it  and i didn 't really tell a lot of people to be quite honest
  and i 'd been saving it and you know how social media is you press the wrong button and gk and there it was sw 
 so thirty minutes later my phone doesn 't ring that much and thirty
  i missed like four calls and i 'm like that 's weird and then i picked it up and i was like oh no
  but it was a good moment i was gonna wait literally just five or six more days that 's ok gk i know because it was weird serena because it only said twenty weeks  so it 's not like there was a whole lot of information on it sw exactly so that 's what i 've been doing all this time i 've been
 just tracking it eighteen nineteen every week i 'd just take a picture and save it
  really is ok when you heard the news were you excited were you afraid were you worried that you were pregnant i mean sw so i heard it
 two days before the  the beginning of the australian open which is one of the biggest grand
  i wasn 't quite sure what to think but i just knew that at that moment it was really important for me to just focus right there at the australian open and
 i was definitely not sure what
 to do i was like can i play i know it 's very dangerous maybe sometimes in the first
 twelve weeks or so so i had a
  did you play differently that game knowing you were pregnant sw i
  i 've been so fortunate and so i haven 't 
 but they get really tired and they get really stressed out and i had to really take all that energy put it in a paper bag so to say and throw it away because i really felt like i didn 't have time to deal with
 any extra emotions any extra
  pregnant or not no one knew and i was supposed to win that tournament as i am every tournament that i show up i am expected to win  
 and if i don 't win it 's actually much bigger news gk yeah when you don 't win that 's a big story sw yes  so for me i had to really take anything negative and any emotions that i was feeling at that point
 and kind of just bottle them up and really figure out what the next step for me to do was
  you have a lot of support you have a lot of love even when i was coming here people stopped me at the airport i was saying to the flight attendant the pilot guess where i 'm going they said oh my god we 're so glad she 's pregnant but then you always have these cranky yankees on the way over here  somebody was telling me about ilie nastase 
 who said some very unkind inappropriate dare i say racial things you have responded to him
 i 'm not even going to dignify what he said but you responded why did you respond sw well i think there are very inappropriate comments and not only that i 've been really supportive of my peers
  and the people that i 've worked with 
 i 've been a pro for almost twenty years and so for me it 's really important to hold women up and it 's something that these young women they 'll come to the locker room they 'll want to take pictures with me 
 and for me it 's just like i want to be able to be a good leader and a good example for them so not only not only did he
  my peers i felt it was important for us to stand up for each other and to stand up for myself  
 and at that point it was really important for me to say  like i 'm not afraid  i 'm not going anywhere but  this is inappropriate
 and there 's time and there 's a place for everything and that really wasn 't the time and the place gk we cut the part where you said you 're not going anywhere because you 'll be thirty six in september baby 's coming
  and your coach said age is always important but in tennis it 's very important but he has no doubt that you 're coming back have you thought am i coming back will i take some time off  i know the women on the tour are saying how long does it take to have a baby two years
 will she be gone what are you thinking sw well i 'm always trying to defy the odds you know so for me everything is really mental 
 i definitely plan on coming back i 'm not done yet i 'm really inspired by my sister she 's a year older than me and that 's something that if she 's still playing i know i can
 and there 's so many roger federer he 's a little bit older than me and he 's still winning everything so i 'm like 
 i know i can do that too
 so that 's been so inspiring to me especially recently  and i know that it 's something i want to do and my story is definitely not over yet i was talking to my coach about it  
 and we were talking about how
 this is just a new part of my life
  baby 's going to be in the stands and hopefully cheering for me not crying too much gk no you wrote a beautiful
 letter to your baby yesterday that you said from the oldest mommy to the youngest one to the oldest to the youngest  i can 't wait for you to get here a lot of people feel that i saw you about a year ago because i think about your life serena  you 've had three life changing things
  be honest with you i
  he 's into technology gk he 's a
 very very nice guy i like him very much so how did he succeed when others have failed how was he the one that you knew this is the one for me sw 
 well
 i 'm not going to say that but
  very loving and he 's very kind and my mom says he 's very considerate and when she said that to me i was like you know he really is and
 it 's the little things that really make a huge difference
  in our show last year i was running around like crazy because i do everything for the show and everything for it so i was running around like crazy and
 he it was a simple gesture of this shirt that he had and he just
 wanted to make sure that i had the same one and it was it 's it 's a weird story  it was better in person i promise gk was it a wonderful
  if you like it then you ought to put a ring on it were
 you feeling pressure to get married did you know it was coming sw yeah  i actually never felt pressure to get married and i can 't say i 'm the marrying type of person i really
 love my life  i love my freedom i heard that kind of changes  but i love
 everything that i do and i love my career and i always felt like i didn 't want anything to interfere with that i 've actually been so
 career oriented and in fact 
 when he proposed i was almost angry  not almost i was angry because it was right in the middle of my training season  and i said i gotta win the australian open  i can 't fly to rome because he wanted to take me to rome and i said i can 't 
 i gotta win but that 's how focused i was gk this is a girl that says no i can 't go to rome ok 
  but i was really focused on on reaching my goals and i knew at that point there was one player that i wanted to pass i wanted to pass steffi graf 's record and that really meant a lot to me and
 when i put my mind to something i really am determined to reach it no matter what  gk you know you said that for you i 've heard you say that winning is addictive to you sw it is gk what do you mean 
 sw i feel like winning for me is superaddictive
  i feel like once you experience it you always want to get that feeling again  and when i won my first championship i was only seventeen years old but i never forgot that feeling 
 and i feel like every time i win one  i want to reach that feeling of your first championship there 's really no feeling in the world like
  is a wonderful experience so for me
 i 've always felt like i loved that feeling and
 obviously i don 't like the feeling of losing i feel like gk no in fact people close to you say you 're a very bad loser sw i 'm not the best loser gk that you 're very very very bad listen
 no athlete no champion likes to lose i get that but they say when it comes to losing you are very very very bad at
  i 'm always curious about the dynamic between you and venus because everybody that knows you and has followed the story knows that you two are very close  and you always bring your a game in whatever you do but i often wonder when you 're playing her 
 do you bring your a game because you want to do something for her or do you bring your a + + game because you want to crush her 
 is it harder for you playing her
  like playing myself because we grew up playing each other we grew up practicing together and it was something that has been difficult because she 's my toughest opponent she 's tall she 
  's fast she hits hard like me she serves like me it 's really like playing a wall gk she knows you sw she knows where i 'm hitting the ball before i hit it so
  not very easy but it 's really about 
 when i go out there i really have to shut down my mind and i have to say to myself you know what i 'm just playing a great player 
 but today i have to be better i don 't care who it is if it 's my sister or it 's my friend 
 today is the day i have to show up and i have to be better and i have to want it more than anyone else
 at this moment anywhere on this world gk so
  never on the court do you fall back for venus because you know it was always
 venus and serena sw yes gk and now baby sister has surpassed older sister do you feel guilt about that do you feel joy in that is that a difficult 
  position for you sw i don 't feel anything in there in my life it still and forever is always going to be venus and serena she 's
 really low quality pictures or else i would have shared them of her pushing me in a stroller on a tennis court and she always took care of me i used to spend all of my allowance money on the ice cream truck and stuff 
 and
 she would take her money and give it to me to me at school and make sure i had something to eat and she would go without and that 's the kind of person she actually is
  since i 've always known her
 so we always have this incredible respect for each other and this incredible love and i think it 's important for people to realize you can be successful but you can still have a wonderful relationship on the court we are mortal enemies but the second we shake hands
  that 's for seventh grade when you did the blah blah blah you never have any moment like that sw i feel like she should have those moments
 because she 's never done anything bad to me but i 'm the youngest i 'm the younger sister gk serena she
 's never done anything bad to you really i have three sisters i can think of some stuff i 've done bad sw 
 unless she brainwashed me to forget them 
  the love you have for her i know is very pure i know that sw yes gk i know that sw we were always brought up to be superclose and we are incredibly close not only her i have
 three other sisters as well  and we were always so close gk 
 so before a big match the two of you don 't get together and say look we 're going to go out there and there 's nothing sw well it 's funny before the australian open  we were in the locker room together and
  always pick on her so i pulled out my camera while she was changing i started taking pictures of her which is totally inappropriate  
 but she was so mad at me she 's like serena stop and i was just laughing at her but that 's the kind of relationship
 that we have and like i said the second we step on the court it was like  
 we were definitely mortal enemies  but the second we stepped off and moments before
  there 's never been anybody like you when you think about it  never been anybody who has intersected gender and race the way you have 
 the dominance that you have and the scrutiny that you have and when you were growing up did you say i want to be like that because now little girls are looking at you saying i want to be like that
  i want to be like that for you sw well it 's interesting and i 'm glad you brought that up for me when i grew up i always wanted to be the best  and i said
 if you want to be the best you 've got to emulate the best so when i started to go on tour when i was really young i would see steffi graf i would see monica seles and i would even see pete sampras
  and i would see what they did and i noticed that steffi and monica didn 't really talk to a lot of the other players
 they kind of were on their own and they were just so focused and i would see pete sampras the technique that he did and i was like i want to do that so i did that 
  and i felt that to be the best and if you want to be the best  you have to hang around people and you have to look at people that are the best because you 're not going to be the best if you 're looking at someone that 's not at the top level gk people say nobody works as hard as you
 's what i heard sw people say oh she 's talented she 's athletic actually i wasn 't i was really small for my age i grew up when i got older  
 and i had to work really hard and i think one of the reasons why i fight so hard and i work so hard is because i was really really really small gk yeah  
 you are no longer small
  but i was small when i was really young for whatever reason i think venus maybe ate all the
 wheaties gk you know the other thing people talk about is your body your body brings men and women to their knees
  and i mean in a good way a lot has been made about your body it 's a work of art  it 's masculine  it 's glorious 
 there 's never been anything like it
  you have body issues when you were growing up have you always been comfortable with your body sw it 's interesting because when you 're a teenage female growing up in the public eye  
 it is a lot of scrutiny that you face and as any female that 's a teenager i definitely was not comfortable in my body i didn 't like it  i didn 't understand why i had muscles 
  and i stopped lifting weights i was like i 'm not going to do this but then after i won the us open i realized that my body helped me reach goals that i wanted to reach and i wanted to be happy
  with it and i was so appreciative of it i 'm always healthy i 'm really fortunate and superblessed and i felt like
 not only am i happy with my body but i want other people and other young girls that have experienced what i 've experienced
 to be happy with themselves so whatever people say masculine whatever too much too little i 'm ok with it as long
  i know you learn a lot from winning but what have you learned from losing 
 sw i hate to lose but i think losing has brought me here today the only reason i am who i am is because of my losses 
 and some of them are extremely painful but i wouldn 't take any of them away  because
 every time i lose  it takes a really long time for me to lose again because i learn so much from it
 i encourage everyone that i talk to i 'm like listen  if you lose or if something happens not in sports in business or in school learn from it  
 don 't live in the past live in the present and don 't make the same mistakes in the future that 's something that i always try to live by gk now you 're planning a wedding and i want to know is it a destination wedding in 
  the catskills or poconos or are you going to do it in florida what are you thinking
  big or small sw 
 we 're thinking medium size we don 't want to do too big but then we 're like ok we can 't say no to this person this person so we 're thinking medium size and we 're just thinking my personality is a lot of fun hopefully you can see that today i 'm not too serious gk
 and you like
 and the next chapter for serena williams is what
  have a baby and i 'm going to stay fit and kind of come back and play tennis and
 keep working on my fashion line that 'll be really fun gk do you know if it 's a boy or girl sw i don 't i have a feeling of one or the other
