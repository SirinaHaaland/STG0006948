  i spend when i get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen and none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn 't been for saddam
  hussein i 'll
 tell you what happened i went to the united nations as an ambassador and it was after the gulf war and i was an instructed ambassador  and
 the cease fire had been translated into a series of sanctions resolutions  and my instructions were to say perfectly terrible things about saddam hussein constantly  
 which he deserved he had invaded another country  
 and so all of a sudden a poem appeared in the papers in
  baghdad comparing me to many things but among them an unparalleled serpent 
 and so i happened to have a snake pin  so i wore it when we talked about iraq 
 and when i went out to meet the press they zeroed in said why are you wearing that snake pin i said because saddam hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent and then i thought well this is fun so i went out
 and
 i bought a lot of pins that would in fact
  reflect what i thought we were going to do on any given day so that 's how it all started pm so how large is the collection ma pretty big 
 it 's now traveling at the moment it 's in indianapolis but it was at the smithsonian  and it goes with a book that says read my pins pm 
 so
  a good idea i remember when you were
 the first woman
 as secretary of state and there was a lot of conversation always about what you were wearing how you looked
 the thing that happens to a lot of women especially if they 're the first
 in a position  so how do you feel about that the whole ma well it 's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing
  but people did pay attention to what clothes i had what was interesting was that before i went up to new york as u n ambassador i talked to jeane kirkpatrick who 'd been ambassador before me and she 
  said you 've got to get rid of your professor clothes go out and look like a diplomat so that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping  
  got criticized over that and no guy ever gets criticized but that 's the least of it pm it
 is for all of us men and women finding our ways of defining our roles 
 and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world and shape the future
 how did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the
  rest of the world and also how you felt about yourself as a mother a grandmother  nurturing and so how did you handle that ma well the interesting part was i was asked 
 what it was like to be the first woman secretary of state a few minutes after i 'd been named and i said well i 've been a woman for sixty years but i 've only been secretary of state for a few minutes
  woman and so what happened and i think there will probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this
 i went to my first meeting first at the u n and that 's when this all started because that is a very male
 organization and i 'm sitting there there are fifteen members of the security council so fourteen men
 sat there staring at me and i thought well you know how we all are you want to get the feeling of the
  room and do people like me and will i really say something intelligent 
 and all of a sudden i thought well wait a minute i am sitting behind a sign that says ' the united states ' and if i don 't speak today then the voice of the united states will not be heard 
 and it was the first time that i had that feeling that i had to step out of myself in
  reluctant female mode and decide that i had to speak on behalf of our country and so
 that happened more at various times but i really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman
 i think we are a lot better at personal relationships
 and then have the capability obviously of telling it like it is when it 's necessary  but i have to tell you i have my youngest granddaughter when she turned seven last year 
 said to her mother my daughter
  so what 's the big deal about grandma maddie being secretary of state only girls are secretary of state
 which you do frequently
 how do you assess this global narrative around the story of women and girls where are we ma 
 i think we 're slowly changing but obviously there are whole pockets in countries where nothing is different and therefore it means that we have to remember that while 
 many of us have had huge opportunities and pat you have been a real leader in in your field is that
 there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women and so what i have felt 
 and i have looked at this from a national security issue when i was secretary of state i decided that women 's issues had to be central to american foreign policy
  not just because i 'm a feminist but because i believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered that
 values are passed down the health
 situation is better education is better there is greater economic prosperity so i think that it behooves us
 those of us that live in various countries where we do have economic and political voice that we need to help other women and i
  really dedicated myself to that both at the u n and then as secretary of state pm and did you get pushback
 from making that a central tenant of foreign policy ma from some people i think that they thought that it was a soft issue the bottom line that i decided was actually women 's issues are the hardest issues 
 because they are the ones that have to do with life and death in so many
 aspects and because
  as i said it is really central to the way that we think about things now for instance some of the wars that took place when i was
 in office a lot of them the women were the main victims of it 
 for instance when i started there were wars in the balkans  the women in bosnia were being
  we then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal to deal specifically
 with those kinds of issues and by the way one of the things that i did at that stage was i had just arrived at the u n and when i was there there were one hundred and eighty three countries 
  in the u n now there are one hundred and ninety two but it was one of the first times that i didn 't have to cook lunch myself so i said to my assistant invite the other women
  and i thought when i 'd get to my apartment that there 'd be a lot of women there i get there and there are six other women out of one hundred and eighty three so the countries that had women representatives were canada 
  kazakhstan philippines trinidad tobago jamaica  lichtenstein and me  
  we lobbied on behalf of women 's issues so we managed to get two women judges on this war crimes tribunal  and then what happened was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war that it was against
  that in many cases certainly in the western world women are evolving into more leadership positions 
 and even other places some barriers are being brought down  but there 's still so much violence still so many problems 
 and yet we hear there are more women at the negotiating tables now you were at those negotiating tables when
  you one voice maybe one or two others do you believe and can you tell us why there is going to be a significant shift
 in
 things like violence and peace and conflict and resolution on a sustainable basis ma well
 i do think when there are more women that
  the tone of the conversation changes and also the goals of the conversation change  but it doesn 't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run 
  by women if you think that you 've forgotten high school but
 the bottom line is that
 there is a way when there are more women at the table that there 's an attempt to develop some understanding so for instance what i did when i
  went to burundi we 'd got tutsi and hutu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in rwanda  
 and so i think the capability of women to put themselves i think we 're better about putting ourselves into the other guy 's shoes and having more empathy i think it helps in
  terms of the support if there are other women in the room when i was secretary of state there were only thirteen other women foreign ministers
  and so it was nice when one of them would show up for instance she is now the president of finland but tarja halonen was the foreign minister of finland and 
 at a certain stage head of the european union  and it was really terrific because one of the things i think you 'll understand we went to
  a meeting and the men in my delegation when i would say well i feel we should do something about this and they 'd say what do you mean you feel and so
 then
 tarja was sitting across the table from me and all of a sudden we were talking about arms control and she said well i feel we should do this and my male colleagues kind of got it all 
  of a sudden but i think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of
  think is really important  a lot of national security policy isn 't just about foreign policy but it 's about budgets  military budgets and how the debts of countries work out so
 if you have women in a variety of
 foreign policy posts they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries pm so how do we get
 this balance we
  looking for then in the world more women 's voices at the table more men who believe that
 the balance is best 
 ma well i think one of the things i 'm chairman of the board of an organization called the national democratic institute that works to support women candidates i think that we need 
  to help in other countries to train women to be in political office to
  out how they can in fact develop political voices i think we also need to be supportive when businesses are being created and just make sure 
  that women help each other now i have a saying that i feel very strongly about because
 aren 't your children suffering because you 're not there all the time 
 and i think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty in fact i think guilt is every woman 's middle name  
 and so i think what needs to happen is we need to help each other  and my motto is that there 's a special place in hell for women who don 't help
  secretary albright i guess you 'll be going to heaven
