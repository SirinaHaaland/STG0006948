  how is sync connected to happiness and it occurred to me that
 for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing
 we like to dance together we like singing together  and so if you 'll put up with this i would like to
 enlist your
  help with a first experiment today the experiment is
 and i notice by the way that when you applauded that you did it in a typical north american way that is you were raucous and incoherent
 you were not organized  it didn 't even occur to you to clap in unison 
 do you think you could do it i would like to
 see if this audience would no  you haven 't practiced as far as i know
  can you get it together to clap in sync whoa
 now that 's what we call emergent behavior 
 so i didn 't expect that but i mean i expected you could synchronize it didn 't occur to me you you 'd increase your frequency  it 's interesting
 so what do we make of that first of all we know that you 're all brilliant  
 this is a room full of intelligent people highly sensitive some trained musicians out there 
 is that what enabled you to synchronize so to put the question a little more seriously
  let 's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did for spontaneous
  synchronization 
 do you need for instance to be as smart as you are 
 do you even need a brain at all
 just to synchronize  do you need to be alive
  i mean that 's a spooky thought right inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves  it 's real in fact
 'll try to explain today that that sync is maybe one of if not one of the most perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature  it extends from the subatomic scale
 to the farthest reaches of the cosmos  it 's a deep tendency toward order in nature that that
  opposes what we 've all been taught about entropy i mean i 'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong it 's not but there is a countervailing force in the universe the tendency towards spontaneous order  
 and so
 that 's our theme now to get into that 
 let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately when you hear that that we 're talking about synchrony in nature  which is the
 the glorious example of
 birds
  or fish swimming in organized schools so
 these are not particularly intelligent creatures and yet as we 'll see they exhibit beautiful ballets this is
 from a bbc show called
  avoid predators to confuse predators let me be
 quiet for a second
  could be possible we
 're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony 
 these creatures are not choreographed they 're choreographing themselves and
 only today is science starting to figure out how it works
 i 'll show you a computer model made by iain couzin a researcher at oxford that shows how swarms work
 there are just three simple rules 
 first all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors  second all the individuals have a tendency to line up 
 and third they 're all attracted to each other  but they try to keep a small distance apart 
 and when you build those three rules in automatically you start to see swarms that look very much like fish schools or
  or bird flocks 
 now fish like to stay close together about a body length apart 
 birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart but except for that difference 
 the rules are the same for both now
 all this changes when a predator enters
 there 's a fourth rule 
 when a predator 's coming 
 get out of the way 
 here on the model you see the predator attacking
 the prey move out in random directions and then the rule of
  attraction brings them back together again
 so there 's this constant splitting and reforming  
 and you see that in nature 
 keep in mind that although it looks as if
 each individual is acting to cooperate what 's really going on is a kind of selfish darwinian
  is scattering away at random to try to save its scales
 or feathers  that is out of the
 desire to save itself each creature is following these rules and that leads to something that 's safe for all of them even though it looks like they 're thinking as a group
  might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm so you can think of several as i say if
 you 're in a swarm your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group  there are many
  in the
 example with the starlings with the birds when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them that actually waves of panic can propagate 
 sending messages over great distances you 'll see let 's
 see it 's coming up
 possibly at the very end maybe
  can be sent over half a kilometer away in a very short time through this mechanism  
 yes it 's happening here see if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm it
 's beautiful the birds are are we sort of understand we think 
 from that computer model what 's going on as i say it 's just those three simple rules plus the one about watch out for predators
  there doesn 't seem to be anything mystical about this we don 't however really understand at a mathematical level i 'm a mathematician we would like to be able to understand better  
 i mean i showed you a computer model but a computer is not understanding a computer is in a way just another experiment  
 we would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works and to understand you know 
 exactly where this organization comes from how do the rules give rise to the
  there is one case that we have begun to understand better and it 's the case of fireflies
  if you see fireflies in north america like so many north american sorts of things they tend to be independent operators they ignore each other  
 they each do their own thing flashing on and off  paying no attention to their neighbors  
 but in southeast asia places like thailand or malaysia or borneo
 there 's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies you can see it every
  night along the river banks
  the trees mangrove trees are filled with fireflies communicating with light 
 specifically it 's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together in perfect synchrony 
 to reinforce a message to the females  and the message as you can imagine is come hither  
 mate with me
  you can get a sense this is a single frame 
 then on and then off
 a 30th of a second there and then watch this whole river bank  and watch how precise the synchrony is 
 on more on and then off
 the combined light from these beetles these are actually tiny beetles is so bright that fishermen 
  out at sea can use them as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers
  no one believed them we don 't see anything like this in europe or in the west
  and for a long time even after it was documented it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it  
 or you
 know a human being 's tendency to see patterns where there are none but i hope you 've convinced yourself now with this nighttime video that they really were very well
 well the issue then is do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order and i 've already hinted that the answer is no  
 well  you don 't have to be a whole creature you can even be just a single cell like take for instance your pacemaker cells in your heart right now they 're keeping you alive every beat of your heart
  this crucial region the sinoatrial node  which has about ten thousand independent cells that would each beep have an electrical rhythm a voltage up and down
 to send a signal to the ventricles to pump  now  your pacemaker is not a single cell it 's this democracy of ten thousand cells that all have to fire in unison for the pacemaker to work correctly 
 i don 't want to give you the idea that synchrony is always a good idea if you have epilepsy  there is an instance of billions of brain cells
  or at least millions  discharging in pathological concert so this tendency towards order is not always a good thing
  you don 't have to be alive you don 't have to be even a single cell if you look for instance at how lasers work 
 that would be a case of atomic synchrony 
 in a laser what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here is that this light is incoherent many different colors
 and different frequencies sort of like the way you clapped initially
 but if you were a laser  it would be rhythmic applause it would be all atoms pulsating in unison emitting light of one color one frequency
  now comes the very risky part of my talk  which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize
  hold your breath for me what i have here are two empty water bottles  
 this is not keith barry doing a magic trick this is a klutz
 just playing with some water bottles i have some metronomes here 
 can you hear that
  it 's the world 's smallest metronome the
 well i shouldn 't advertise anyway  so this is the world 's smallest metronome i 've set it on the fastest setting  and i 'm going to now take another one set to the same setting
 we can try this first if i just put them on the table together  there 's no reason for them to synchronize and they probably won
  what i 'm hoping is that they might just drift apart because their frequencies aren 't perfectly the same 
 right they did they were in sync for a while but then they drifted apart
 and the reason is that they 're not able to communicate now you might think that 's a bizarre idea how can metronomes communicate
  well  they can communicate through mechanical forces  
 so i 'm going to give them a chance to do that i also want to wind this one up a bit how can they communicate i 'm going to put them on a movable platform  which is the 
 guide to graduate study at cornell
 here it is let 's see if we can get this to work 
 my wife pointed out to me that it will work better if i put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over 
 all right so there we go  let 's see 
 ok i 'm not trying to cheat let me start them out of sync no hard to even do that
  but this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order
 sometimes has unexpected consequences  and a clear case of that was something that happened in london in the year two thousand 
 the millennium bridge was supposed to be the pride of london a beautiful new
 footbridge erected across the thames first river crossing in over one hundred years in london  there was a big
  competition for the design of this bridge  and the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team in the ted spirit actually of an architect
 perhaps the greatest architect in the united kingdom lord norman foster
 working with an an artist a sculptor sir anthony caro  and an engineering firm 
  and together they submitted a design based on
 lord foster 's vision  which was he remembered as a kid reading flash gordon comic books  
 and he said that when flash gordon would come to an abyss he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber he would shoot his light saber across the abyss  
 making a blade of light and then scamper across on this blade of light 
 he said that 's the vision i want to give to london i want a blade of light across the thames 
 so they built the
  blade of light  and
 it 's a very thin ribbon of steel the world 's probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is with cables
 that are out on the side you 're used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top
 these cables were on the side of the bridge like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the thames that 's what 's holding up this bridge 
  everyone was very excited to try it out on opening day thousands of londoners came out and something happened 
 and within two days the bridge was closed to the public  so i want to first show you some interviews
 with people who were on the bridge on opening day who will describe what happened
  could definitely there was something going on sideways it felt maybe
  at least six six to eight inches
  deliberately push your feet out sideways and
  probably the number of people on it interviewer were they deliberately walking in step  or anything like that man no they just had to conform to the
 movement of the bridge steven strogatz all right so that already gives you a hint of what happened think of the bridge
 as being like this platform think of the people as being like
  you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome but after all we do
 walk like i mean we oscillate back and forth as we walk  and especially if we start to walk like those people did right they all showed this strange
 sort of skating gait that they adopted once the bridge started to move  and so let me show you now the footage of the bridge  but also after you see the bridge on opening day you 'll see an interesting clip of work done by
 a bridge engineer at cambridge named allan mcrobie
 who figured out what happened on the bridge and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was it was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop between the way the people walked 
 and the way the bridge began to move that engineers knew nothing about actually i think the first person you 'll see is the
  i felt i was disappointed about it  we 'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge  and we 'd analyzed it  we 'd
 checked it to codes to heavier loads than the codes and here it was doing something that
  people apparently rocking from side to side in unison not only with each other  but with the bridge  this synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge  
 but how could the crowd become synchronized was there something special about the millennium bridge that caused this effect this was to be the focus of the investigation
  you reckon mimics the action of the real bridge am it captures a lot of the physics yes interviewer right so if we get on it we should be able to wobble it yes  
 allan mcrobie is a bridge engineer from cambridge who wrote to me suggesting that a bridge simulator
  to wobble in the same way as the real bridge provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length am this one 's only a couple of tons so it 's fairly easy to get going
 just by walking interviewer well it 's certainly going now am it doesn 't have to be a real dangle just walk it starts to go interviewer it
 's actually quite difficult to walk 
 you have to be careful where you put your feet down don 't you because
 if you get it wrong it just throws you off your feet am it certainly affects the way you walk
 normally on it interviewer
 no if you try and put one foot in front of another it 's moving your feet away from under you am yes interviewer so you 've got to put your feet out sideways  
 so already the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way as our witnesses walked on the real bridge
 just walk normally  
 it 's really intriguing because
 none of these people is trying to drive it  they 're all having some difficulty walking  
 and the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step  but then of course everyone is driving the bridge
  you can 't help it you 're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step  and therefore to drive it to move further ss 
 all right well with that from the
 ministry of silly walks maybe i 'd better end  
 i see i 've gone over but i hope that you 'll go outside and see the the world in a new way to see all the amazing synchrony around us thank you
