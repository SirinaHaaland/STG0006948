  i 'm going to talk to you today about laughter  
 and i just want to start by thinking about the first time i can ever remember noticing laughter this is when i was a little girl i would 've been about six  and i came across my parents
  they were laughing  they were laughing very very hard they were lying on the floor laughing  they were screaming with laughter  
 i did not know what they were laughing at but i wanted in i wanted to be part of that and i kind of sat around at the edge going hoo hoo 
 now incidentally 
 what they were laughing at was a song which people used to sing  which was based around signs in toilets on trains telling you what you could and
  could not do in toilets on trains  and the thing you have to remember about the english is of course we do have an immensely sophisticated sense of humor at the
 time though i didn 't understand anything of that i just cared about the laughter and actually 
 as a neuroscientist i 've come to care about it again  and it is a really weird thing to do what i 'm going to do now is just play some examples of real human beings laughing
 the sound people make and how odd that can be and in fact how primitive laughter is as a sound it 's much more like an animal call than it is like speech  so here we 've got some laughter for you the first one is pretty joyful
  i need him to breathe there 's a point in there where i 'm just like you 've got to get some air in there mate because he just sounds like he 's breathing out
  and finally we have this is a human female laughing  and laughter can take us to some pretty odd places in terms of making noises
  kind of with her i have no idea now to understand laughter  you have to look at a part of the body that psychologists and neuroscientists don 't normally spend much time looking at which is the
  seem terribly exciting but actually you 're all using your ribcage all the time what you 're all doing at the moment with your ribcage and don 't stop doing it is breathing  
 so you use the intercostal muscles the muscles between your ribs 
 to bring air in and out of your lungs just by expanding and contracting your ribcage and if i was to put a strap around the outside of your chest called a breath belt and
 just look at that movement you see a
 rather gentle sinusoidal movement so that 's breathing you 're all doing
  don 't stop 
 as soon as you start talking  
 you start using your breathing completely differently  so what i 'm doing now is you see something much more like this in talking you use very fine movements of the ribcage to squeeze the air out and in fact we 're the only animals that can do this it 's why we can talk at all 
 now  both talking and breathing has a mortal enemy  
 and that enemy is laughter because what happens when you laugh is those same muscles start to contract very regularly and you get this very marked
 sort of zig zagging and that 's just squeezing the air out of you it literally is that basic a way of making a sound you could be
 stamping on somebody it 's having the same effect you 're just squeezing air out and each of those contractions ha gives you a sound  and as the contractions run together  you can get these spasms and that 's when you start getting
  in terms of the science of laughter there isn 't very much but it does turn out that pretty much everything we think we know about laughter is wrong  
 so it 's not at all unusual for example to hear people to say humans are the only animals that laugh nietzsche thought that humans are the only animals that laugh in fact you find laughter throughout the mammals it 's been well described and well observed in primates
 but you also see it in rats and wherever you find it humans primates rats
 you find it associated with things like tickling that 's the same for humans 
 you find it associated with play  and all mammals play  
 and wherever you find it it 's associated with interactions so robert provine who has done a lot of work on this has pointed out
  times more likely to laugh if you are with somebody else than if you 're on your own 
 and where you find most laughter is in social interactions like conversation so if you ask human beings when do you laugh they 'll talk about comedy and they 'll talk about humor and they 'll talk about jokes if you look at when they laugh they 're laughing with their friends 
 and when we laugh with people we 're hardly ever actually laughing at jokes  you are laughing to show
  you understand them that you agree with them that you 're part of the same group as them you 're laughing to show that you like them you might even love them  you 're doing all that at the same time as talking to them and the laughter is doing a lot of that emotional work for you  
 something that robert provine has pointed out as you can see here and the reason why we were laughing when we heard those funny laughs at the start and why i was laughing when i found my parents laughing  
 is that it 's an enormously behaviorally contagious effect  you can catch laughter from somebody else and you are more likely to catch laughter off somebody else if you
  know them  so it 's still modulated by this social context  you have to put humor to one side and think about the social meaning of laughter because that 's where its origins lie  
 now something i 've got very interested in is different kinds of laughter  and we have some neurobiological evidence
 about how human beings vocalize that suggests there might be two kinds of laughs that we have so it seems possible that
  the neurobiology for helpless  involuntary laughter  like my parents lying on the floor screaming about a silly song 
 might have a different basis to it than some of that more polite social laughter that you encounter which isn 't horrible laughter  but it it 's behavior somebody is doing as part of their communicative act to you  part of their interaction with you they are choosing to do this
  in our evolution we have developed two different ways of vocalizing involuntary vocalizations are part of an older system than the more voluntary vocalizations like the speech i 'm doing now  so we might imagine that laughter might actually have two different roots  so i 've been looking at this in more detail 
 to do this  we 've had to make recordings of people laughing and we 've had to do whatever it takes to make people laugh  and we got those same people to produce more posed social laughter so imagine your
  laughing because you like your friend but not
 really because the joke 's all that 
 so i 'm going to play you a couple of those i want you to tell me if you think this laughter is real laughter or if you think it 's posed so is this involuntary laughter or more voluntary laughter
  was helpless laughter and in fact 
 to record that all they had to do was record me watching one of my friends listening to something i knew she wanted to laugh at and i just started doing this
 what you find is that people are good at telling the difference between real and posed laughter they seem to be different things to us
  similar with chimpanzees chimpanzees laugh differently if they 're being tickled than if they 're playing with each other and we might be seeing something like that here  involuntary laughter tickling laughter  being different from social laughter 
  they 're acoustically very different the real laughs are longer  they 're higher in pitch when you start laughing hard  you start squeezing air out from your lungs under much higher pressures than you could ever produce voluntarily for example i could never pitch my voice that high to sing
 also you start to get these sort of contractions and weird whistling sounds all of which mean that real laughter is extremely easy or feels extremely easy to spot  in contrast  posed laughter 
 we might think it sounds a bit fake actually it 's not it 's actually an important social cue we use it a lot we 're choosing to laugh in a lot of
  seems to be its own thing so for example  you find  nasality in posed laughter that kind of ha ha ha ha ha sound
 that you never get you could not do if you were laughing involuntarily so they do seem to be genuinely these two different sorts of things we took it into the scanner to see how brains respond when you hear laughter 
 and when you do this
 this is a really boring experiment we just played people real and posed laughs we didn 't tell them it was a study on laughter  we put other sounds in there to distract them  and all they 're doing is lying listening to sounds we don 't
 nonetheless when you hear real laughter and when you hear posed laughter the brains are responding completely differently significantly differently  what you see in the regions in blue  which lies 
  in auditory cortex are the brain areas that respond more to the real laughs  and what seems to be the case when you hear somebody laughing involuntarily  you hear sounds you would never hear in any other
  and it seems to be associated with greater auditory processing of these novel sounds in contrast when you hear somebody laughing
 in a posed way what you see are these regions in pink  which are occupying brain areas associated with mentalizing thinking about what somebody else is thinking and i think what that means 
  is even if you 're having your brain scanned which is completely boring and not very interesting when you hear somebody going 
  you 're trying to work out why they 're laughing laughter is always meaningful you are always trying to understand it in context even if as far as you are concerned at that point in time it has not necessarily anything to do with you  you still want to know why those people are laughing  
 now we 've had the opportunity to look at how people hear real and posed laughter across the age range  so this is an online experiment we ran with the royal society  and here we just asked people two questions 
 first of all they heard some laughs and they had to say how real or posed do these laughs sound the real laughs are shown in red and the posed laughs are shown
  in blue  what you see is there is a rapid onset as you get older  you get better and better and better at spotting real laughter so six year olds are at chance they can 't really hear the difference 
 by the time you are older you get better but interestingly  you do not hit peak performance in this dataset until you are in your late 30s and early
  you don 't understand laughter fully by the time you hit puberty  you don 't understand laughter fully by the time your brain has matured at the end of your teens you 're learning about laughter throughout your entire early adult life 
 if we turn the question around and now say not what does the laughter sound like in terms of being real or posed but we say how much does this laughter make you want to laugh how contagious is this laughter to you  
 we see a different profile  and here  the younger you are
  the more you want to join in when you hear laughter  remember me laughing with my parents when i had no idea what was going on you really can see this  now everybody  young and old finds the real laughs more contagious than the posed laughs 
 but as you get older  it all becomes less contagious to you  now  either we 're all just becoming really grumpy as we get older  
  behavior about which a lot of our
 lay assumptions are incorrect  
 but i 'm coming to see that actually there 's even more to laughter than it 's an important social emotion we should look at because it turns out people are phenomenally nuanced in terms of how we use laughter there
 's a really lovely set of studies coming out from robert levenson 's lab in california where he 's doing a longitudinal study with couples he gets married couples men and women  into the lab
  and he gives them stressful conversations to have while he wires them up to a polygraph so he can see them becoming stressed so you 've got the two of them in there  and he 'll say to the husband tell me something that your wife does 
 that irritates you and what you see is immediately just run that one through your head briefly you and your partner
  you can see physically people become more stressed what he finds is that the couples who manage that feeling of stress
 with laughter  positive emotions like laughter  not only immediately become less stressed  they can see them physically feeling better  they 're dealing with this unpleasant situation better together  
 they are also the couples that report high levels of satisfaction in their relationship and they stay together for longer  so in fact  when you look at close relationships
  laughter is a phenomenally useful index of how people are regulating their emotions together we 're not just emitting it at each other to show that we like each other we 're making ourselves feel better together  
 now i don 't think this is going to be limited to romantic relationships i think this is probably going to be a characteristic of close emotional relationships such as you might have with friends 
 which explains my
  a youtube video of some young men in the former east germany on making a video to promote their heavy metal band  and it 's extremely macho and the mood is very serious and i want you to notice what happens in terms of laughter
 when things go wrong and how quickly that happens and how that changes the mood
  friends are already laughing they are already laughing hard
  the thing i really like about that is it 's all very serious until he
  jumps onto the ice and as soon as he doesn 't go through the ice  but also there isn 't blood and bone everywhere  his friends start laughing  
 and imagine if that had played him out with him standing there going no seriously heinrich i think this is broken we wouldn 't enjoy watching that that would be stressful or if he was running around with a visibly broken leg laughing and his friends are 
  going heinrich i think we need to go to the hospital now that also wouldn 't be funny the fact that the laughter works  it gets him from a painful embarrassing difficult situation  into a funny situation into what we 're actually enjoying there  
 interesting use and it 's actually happening all the time for example i can remember  something like this happening at my father 's funeral  we weren 't jumping around on the ice in our underpants we 're not canadian 
 these events are always difficult i had a relative who was being a bit difficult my mum was not in a good place and i can remember finding myself just before the whole thing started
 telling this story about something that happened in a 1970s sitcom  and i just thought at the time i
 don 't know why i 'm doing this and what i realized i was doing was i was coming up with something from somewhere i could use to make her laugh
 together with me 
 it was a very basic reaction to find some reason we can do this we can laugh together we 're going to get through this we 're going to be okay  and in fact all
  doing this all the time you do it so often you don 't even notice it 
 everybody underestimates how often they laugh  and you 're doing something when you laugh with people that 's actually letting you access a really ancient evolutionary system 
 that mammals have evolved to make and maintain social bonds and clearly to regulate emotions to make ourselves feel
  it 's not something specific to humans it 's a really ancient behavior which really helps us regulate how we feel and makes us feel better  
 in other words when it comes to laughter  you and me baby ain 't nothing but mammals
