  am going to speak about corruption but i would like to
 juxtapose
 two different things one is the large global economy the large globalized
  the other one is the small and very limited capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions
 to govern to shape  this economy  because there is
 this
 this asymmetry  which
 creates basically failing governance failing governance in many areas in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of
  the environment in the area of exploitation of women and children  in the area of
 climate change in all the areas in which we really need
 a capacity to reintroduce the primacy of politics into
  in a worldwide
 arena 
 and i think corruption 
 and the fight against corruption and the impact of corruption is probably one of the most interesting ways to illustrate
 what i mean with this failure of governance  let me talk about my own experience  i used to work as
 the director of the world bank office in nairobi for
  africa  
 at that time  i noticed that corruption  that grand corruption  that systematic corruption  
 was undermining everything we were trying to do 
 and therefore  i began to not only try to protect
 the work of the world bank our own projects our own programs against corruption  but in general i thought
  a system to protect the people in this part of the world
 from the ravages of corruption 
 and as soon as i started this work 
 i received a memorandum from the world bank  from the legal department first in which they said you are not allowed to do this you are meddling in the internal affairs of our
  this is forbidden by the charter of the world bank so i want you to stop your doings in the meantime i was
 chairing donor meetings for instance  in which the various donors  and many of them like to be
 in nairobi it is true it is one of the unsafest
 cities of the world but they like to be there because the other cities are even less
  and in these donor meetings i noticed that many of the worst projects which were put forward by our clients by the governments 
 by promoters  
 many of them representing suppliers from the north
 that the worst projects were realized first  
 let me give you an example a huge power project three hundred million dollars 
 to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable and one of the
  most beautiful areas of
 western kenya  
 and we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits 
 it had no clients nobody would buy the the electricity there nobody was interested in irrigation projects 
 to the contrary we knew that this project would destroy the environment it would
  which were the basis for the survival of
 nomadic groups the samburu and
 the turkana in this area so everybody knew this is a not a useless project this is an absolute damaging a terrible project
 not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars  and the siphoning off
 of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like
  schools like hospitals and so on 
 and yet we all rejected this project  
 none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it and it was the first project to be implemented  
 the good projects which we as a donor community would take under our wings  they took years you know you had
 too many studies and
 very often they didn 't succeed  but these bad projects
  were absolutely damaging for the economy for many generations for the environment for thousands of families who had to be resettled they were suddenly put together by consortia of banks 
 of supplier agencies of
 insurance agencies like in germany  hermes  and so on and they came back very very quickly driven by an unholy alliance between
 the
 powerful elites in the countries there
 and the suppliers from the north 
 now these suppliers were our big companies they were the actors of this global market which i mentioned in the beginning 
 they were the siemenses of this world  
 coming from france from
  from japan from canada from germany and they were systematically driven by systematic large scale corruption  
 we are not talking about
 fifty thousand dollars here or one hundred thousand dollars there  or one million dollars there  no we are talking about ten million twenty million dollars
 on the swiss bank accounts on the bank accounts of liechtenstein of
 the president
  this was the reality which i saw and not only one project like that i saw  i would say  over the years i worked in africa i saw hundreds of projects like this  
 and so i became convinced
 that it is this systematic corruption
 which is perverting economic policy making in these countries which
  the conflicts for the violence for the desperation in many of these countries
  that we have today more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line that we have
 more than a billion people without proper drinking water in the world  twice that number
 more than two billion people without sanitation and so on and the consequent illnesses of
  mothers and children  
 still  child mortality of more than ten million people every year children dying before they are five years old 
 the cause of this is to a large extent grand corruption  
 now why did the world bank
 not let me do this work
  found out afterwards  after i left under a big fight the world bank 
 the reason was that the members of the world bank thought that foreign bribery was okay  including germany  
 in germany foreign bribery was allowed it was even tax deductible 
 no wonder that most of the most important international operators in germany  but also in france and the uk and scandinavia everywhere systematically bribed not all of
 and
 this is
 the phenomenon which i call failing governance  
 because when i then came to germany and started this little ngo here in berlin  at the villa borsig 
 we
 were told you cannot stop our german exporters from bribing  because we will
  we will lose to the french we will lose to the swedes we 'll lose to the japanese and therefore there was a indeed a prisoner 's dilemma  which made it very difficult
 for an individual company an individual exporting country to say we are not going to continue this
 deadly  disastrous habit of
 large companies to bribe
  so this is what i mean with
 a failing governance structure  because even the powerful government which we have in germany comparatively 
 was not able to say we will not allow our companies to bribe abroad 
 they needed help  
 and the large companies themselves have this dilemma  
 many of them didn 't want to bribe many of the german companies for instance believe that they are really producing a
 at a good price so they are very competitive they are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors are  but
 they were not allowed to show their strengths  because the world was
 eaten up by grand corruption  and
 this is why i 'm telling you this civil society rose
  occasion  we had this small ngo transparency international they began to think of
 an escape route from this prisoner 's dilemma  and
 we developed concepts of collective action  
 basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table explaining to all of them
 how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop bribing
 and to make a long story short we managed to eventually
 get germany to sign together with the other oecd countries and a few other exporters in 
 a convention  under the auspices of the oecd which obliged everybody to change their laws
  in doing this we had to sit together
 with the companies  we had here in berlin  at the aspen institute on the wannsee  we had sessions with about twenty captains of industry  
 and we discussed with them
 what to do about international bribery  in the first session we had three sessions over the course of two years and president von
 weizscker by the way  chaired one of the sessions the first one to take the fear away from the
 entrepreneurs who were not used to deal with non governmental organizations  and
 in the first session they all said this is not bribery what we are doing this is customary there this is what these other cultures demand they even applaud it
  says this today and so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing  
 but in the second session they admitted already that they would never do this what they are doing in these other countries 
 here in germany  or in the u k and so on  cabinet ministers would admit this and in the final
  at the aspen institute we had them all sign an open letter to the kohl government at the time requesting that they participate in the oecd convention  
 and
 this is in my opinion an example of soft power because we we were able to convince them that they had to go with us  we had a longer term
 time perspective  we had a broader  geographically much
  constituency we were trying to defend and that 's why the law has changed that 's why siemens is now in the trouble they are in and that 's why 
 in some other countries the oecd convention is not yet properly enforced and again civil societies breathing down the neck of the establishment 
 in london for instance where the
  got away with a huge corruption case  which the
 serious fraud office tried to prosecute 
 one hundred million british pounds every year for ten years to one particular official of one particular friendly country 
 who then bought for for forty four billion pounds of military equipment  
 this case  they are not prosecuting in the uk why because they consider this as
 contrary to the security interest of the people of great britain civil society is
  pushing civil society is trying to to get a solution to this problem 
 also in the u k and also in japan  which is not properly enforcing  and so on in germany we are pushing the ratification of the un convention  which is a subsequent convention  
 we are germany is not ratifying why because
 it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of
 deputies in germany we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe
 a civil servant  but you are allowed to bribe a deputy  
 this is  under german law allowed  
 and the members of our parliament don 't want to change this and this is why they can 't sign the u n convention against foreign bribery one of they very very few
  we managed to get on the books with about one hundred and sixty countries all over the world  i see my time is ticking  let me just try to
 draw some conclusions from what has happened  i believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting
  one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance 
 by now the united nations is totally on our side the world bank has turned from saulus to paulus
  under wolfensohn they became i would say the strongest anti corruption agency in the world 
 most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against
 bribery and so on and this is possible because
  society joined
 the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem  in the development of remedies in the implementation of reforms  
 and then later in the monitoring of reforms 
 of course  if civil society organizations want to play that role they have to grow into
 this responsibility not all civil society
  organizations are
 good 
 the ku klux klan is an ngo so we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself  
 they have to have a much more
 transparent financial governance they have to have a much more participatory governance in many civil society
  we also need much more competence of civil society leaders this is why we have set up the governance school and the center for civil society here in berlin  because we believe
 most of our educational and research institutions in germany and continental europe in general do not focus enough yet 
 on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society  
 but what i 'm saying from my very practical
  civil society does it right and and joins the other actors in particular governments governments and
 their international institutions but also large international actors in particular those which have committed themselves to corporate social responsibility
 then in this magical triangle
 between civil society government and private sector there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better
