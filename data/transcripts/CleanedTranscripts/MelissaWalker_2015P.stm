  military service member deployed to afghanistan 
 you are responsible for the lives of hundreds of men and women  and your base is under attack  
 incoming mortar rounds are exploding
  all around you 
 struggling to see through the dust and the smoke  you do your best to assist the wounded and then crawl to a nearby bunker  
 conscious but dazed by the blasts you lay on your side and attempt to process what has just happened 
 as you regain your vision you see a bloody face staring
  back at you the image is terrifying  but you quickly come to understand it 's not
 real 
 this vision continues to visit you multiple times a day and in your sleep  
 you choose not to tell anyone for fear of losing your job or being seen as weak  
 you give the vision a name
  bloody face in bunker  and call it  bfib for short  
 you keep  bfib locked away in your mind  secretly haunting you for the next seven years 
 now close your eyes 
 can you see
  you 're beginning to see the face of the invisible wounds of war  commonly known as post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury  
 while i can 't say i have post traumatic stress disorder  i 've never been a stranger to it 
 when i was a little girl i would visit my grandparents every summer 
 it was my grandfather who introduced me to the effects of combat on the psyche
 my grandfather was serving as a marine in the korean war a bullet pierced his neck and rendered him unable to cry out 
 he watched as a corpsman passed him over declaring him a goner  and then leaving him to die 
 years later after his physical wounds had healed and he 'd returned home he rarely spoke of his experiences in waking life
 but at night i would hear him shouting obscenities from his room down the hall 
 and during the day i would announce myself as i entered the room careful not to startle or agitate him 
 he lived out the remainder of his days isolated and tight lipped never finding a way to express himself 
 and i didn 't yet have the tools to guide him
 i wouldn 't have a name for my grandfather 's condition until i was in my 20s 
 seeking a graduate degree in art therapy  i naturally gravitated towards the study of trauma 
 and while sitting in class learning about post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd for short 
 my mission to help service members who suffered like my grandfather began to take
  form 
 we 've had various names for post traumatic stress throughout the history of war  
 homesickness  soldier 's heart  
 shell shock thousand yard stare for instance  and while i was pursuing my degree a new war was raging
  and thanks to modern body armor and military vehicles service members were surviving blast injuries they wouldn 't have before  
 but the invisible wounds were reaching new levels  and this pushed military doctors and researchers to try and truly understand the effects that traumatic brain injury
 and ptsd have on the brain  
 due to advances in technology and neuroimaging we now know there 's an actual shutdown in the broca
  's or the speech language area of the brain after an individual experiences trauma 
 this physiological change or speechless terror as it 's often called 
 coupled with mental health stigma the fear of being judged or misunderstood  possibly even removed from their current duties has led to the invisible struggles of our servicemen and women
  generation after generation of veterans have chosen not to talk about their experiences and suffer in solitude  
 i had my work cut out for me when i got my first job as an art therapist at the nation 's largest military medical center walter reed 
 after working for a few years on a locked in patient psychiatric unit i eventually transferred to the
  national intrepid center of excellence nicoe which leads tbi care for active duty service members 
 now i believed in art therapy  but i was going to have to convince service members  big tough strong manly military men 
 and some women too to give art making as a
 psychotherapeutic intervention a try the results have been nothing short of spectacular  
 vivid  symbolic artwork is being created by our servicemen and women  and every work of art tells a story 
 we 've observed that the process of art therapy bypasses the speech language issue with the brain
 art making accesses the same sensory areas of the brain that encode trauma
  can use the art making to work through their experiences in a nonthreatening way 
 they can then apply words to their physical creations  reintegrating the left and the right hemispheres of the brain 
 now we 've seen this can work with all forms of art
 drawing  painting collage but what seems to have the most impact is
 finally these invisible wounds don 't just have a name they have a face 
 and when service members create these masks it allows them to come to grips  literally with their trauma 
 and it 's amazing how often that enables them to break through the trauma and
  that was a real experience for one of my patients  and when he created his mask he was able to let go of that haunting image  
 initially it was a daunting process for the service member but eventually he began to think of bfib as the mask not his internal wound and he would go to leave each session he would hand me the mask and
  in a box to further contain him  and when the service member went to leave the nicoe he chose to leave  bfib behind 
 a year later  he had only seen bfib twice  and both times bfib was smiling and the service member didn 't feel anxious 
 now whenever that service member is haunted by some traumatic memory he continues to paint every time he paints these disturbing images
  them less
 or not at all 
 philosophers have told us for thousands of years that the power to create is very closely linked to the power to destroy  
 now science is showing us that the part of the brain that registers a traumatic wound
 can be the part of the brain where healing happens too  and art therapy is showing us how to make that connection
  we asked one of our service members to describe how  mask making impacted his treatment  and this is what he had to say service member you
 sort of just zone out into the mask you zone zone out into the drawing  and for me it just released
 the block  so i was able to
 do it  and then when i looked at it after two days
  here 's the puzzle and then from there it just soared  i mean from there my treatment just when
 out of out of sight because they were like kurt explain this  explain this and
 for the first time in twenty three years i could actually talk about stuff openly to like anybody  i could talk to you about it right now if i wanted to  because it
 unlocked it it 's just amazing  and it allowed me to put
  of ptsd and
 tbi stuff together in one place that has never happened before  
 sorry melissa walker over the past five years we 've had over one thousand masks
 made it 's pretty
  i wish i could have shared this process with my grandfather but i know that he would be thrilled
 that we are finding ways to help today 's and tomorrow 's service members heal  
 and finding the resources within them
 that they can call upon to heal themselves  thank you
