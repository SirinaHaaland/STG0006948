  i 'm a contemporary artist and i show in art galleries and museums
 i show a number of photographs and films but i also make television programs books and some advertising
  all with the same concept  and it 's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture  and the importance of the image celebrity is born of photography 
 i 'm going to start with
 how i started with this concept seven years ago  when princess diana died 
 there was a sort of a standstill in britain the moment of her death and people
 decided to mourn
 her death in a sort of mass way
 fascinated by this phenomenon  so i wondered could one erase the image of diana actually quite crudely and physically  so i got a gun and started to shoot at the image of diana  
 but i couldn 't erase this from my memory and certainly it was not being erased from
 public psyche momentum was being built the press wrote about her death in rather i felt pornographic
 ways like which bit of artery left which bit of body and how did she die in the back of the car and i was intrigued by this sort of
 mass voyeurism  so i made these rather gory images  i
 went on
 wondering whether i could actually replace her image  
 so i got a look alike of diana and posed her in the right positions and angles
 and
 created something that was in or existed in the public imagination so people were wondering was she going to marry dodi was she in love with him was she pregnant did she want his baby was she pregnant when she died
  so i created this image of
  diana dodi and their imaginary mixed race child and this image
 came out which caused a huge public outcry at the time  i then went on to make
 more comments on the media and press imagery  so i started making reference to media imagery
 made it grainy  shot
  through doorways and so on and so forth to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism 
 so this is an image of diana looking at camilla kissing her husband  and this was a sequence
 of images  
 and this gets shown in art galleries like this as a sequence 
 and similarly with the di dodian baby imagery this is another art gallery installation i 'm particularly interested in
 how you can 't rely on your own perception this is jane smith
 and jo bloggs for instance but you think it 's camilla and the queen 
 and i 'm fascinated how what you think is real isn 't necessarily real  and the camera can lie  and it makes it very
  the mass bombardment of imagery to
 tell untruths  so i continued to work on this project of how
 photography seduces us
 and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter  and at the same time it removes us from the real
  and this acts as a sort of titillating
 thing so the photograph becomes this teaser and incites
 desire and and voyeurism what you can 't have you want more in the photograph the real subject doesn 't exist so it makes you want that person more 
 and that is
  celebrity magazines work now  the more
 pictures you see of these celebrities  the more you feel you know them  but you don 't know them and you want to know them further 
 of course the queen
 goes to her stud often to watch her horses
  watch her horses and
  in england there 's an expression you can 't imagine the queen on the loo so i 'm trying to penetrate that well
 here is the image
  all this imagery was creating a lot of fuss and i was cited as a disgusting artist
 the press were writing about this
  giving full pages about how terrible this was 
 which i found very interesting that it was going full
  cycle i was making comments about the press and about how we know
 facts and information only by media because we don 't know the real people very few of us know the real people
 but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing effectively my filthy work  so
  these are broadsheets tabloids debates were being had all about this work films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work  politicians were getting involved
 all sorts of things great headlines 
 then suddenly
  it started to get on front pages i was being asked and paid to do front covers suddenly i was becoming sort of acceptable  which i found
 also
  one moment it was disgusting journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me  saying my work was wonderful and the next minute
 there were terrible headlines about me  but then this changed
 suddenly i then started to
 work for magazines and newspapers this was for example an image that went into tatler this was
 another newspaper image it was an april fool actually and to this
  day some people think it 's
 real i was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day and they were saying there 's this great image of the queen sitting outside william hill they thought it was real  
 i was exploring at the time the hyperbole of icons and
 diana and marilyn and the importance of celebrity in our lives how they wheedle their way into the collective psyche without us even knowing
 and how that should happen
  i explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself there 's me as diana i look like
 the mass murderer myra hindley i think in this one and
 me as the queen  
 i then continued on to make a whole body of work about marilyn the biggest icon of all and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so
  forth and only showing certain angles to create a reality that obviously is completely constructed  this
 is the look alike so the crafting elements of this is
 completely enormous she looks nothing like marilyn but by the time we 've made her up
 and put wigs and makeup on she looks exactly like marilyn to the extent
  that her husband couldn 't recognize her or recognize this look alike in these photographs which i find quite interesting so
 all this work is getting shown in art galleries then i made a book i was also making a tv series for the bbc at the time  stills from the tv series went into
 this book  but
  there was a real legal problem because it looks real  but how do you get over that because obviously it 's making a comment about our
 culture
 right right now that we can 't tell what 's real how do we know when we 're looking at something whether it 's real or not
  so
 from my point of view it 's important to publish it but at the same time it does cause a confusion intentional on my behalf but
  problematic for any outlet that i 'm working with so
 a big disclaimer is
 put on everything that i do and i made narratives about all the european or brit
 celebrities and comments about our public figures
  tony blair get up to in private with his fashion guru  and also dealing with the perceptions that are put about
 obviously the british public i think would prefer william to
 charles on the throne  and it 's
 that that wish or that desire that i suppose i 'm dealing with in my work i 'm not really interested in the celebrity
 themselves  i 'm interested in the the perception of the celebrity 
  i did an advertising campaign for schweppes which is coca cola and so that was
 very interesting in terms of
 the legalities it 's highly commercial  but it was a difficulty for me because this is my artwork should i do advertising
  i made sure the work
 was not compromised in any way and that the integrity of the work remained the same  but the meanings changed in the sense that
 with the logo on you 're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product and that 's all you 're doing when you take the logo off you 're opening up the
  when you are advertising
  this image is quite interesting actually because i think we made it three years ago  and it 's camilla in her wedding dress  which  again nearly got re used now
  recently prior to her
 wedding tony blair and cherie and again
  legalities we had to be very careful it 's obviously a very big commercial company and so this little shh it 's not really them was
 put on the side of the imagery 
 and margaret thatcher visiting jeffery archer in jail  i then was asked by selfridges to do
 a series of windows for them  so i built a sauna bath
  in one of their windows and created little scenes
 live scenes with look alikes inside the windows and the windows were all steamed up so it 's tony blair reading and practicing his speech i 've got them doing yoga inside 
  there with carole caplin sven making out with ulrika jonsson who he was having an affair with
  this was a huge success for them because the imagery got shown in the press the day after in every single newspaper broadsheets and tabloids it was a bit of 
  a road stopper  which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the
  so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly all this imagery and the press were
 interviewing and i was signing my book 
 further imagery i 'm making a new book now with taschen that i 'm working on really for
 a sort of global market my previous book was only for the u k 
  i suppose i come from a sort of 
  background with serious intent  and then suddenly my work is funny  and
 i think it doesn 't really matter that
 my work is considered humorous in a way i think it 's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through imagery
  it 's an extremely fast way of getting information it 's extremely difficult if it 's constructed correctly and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery imagery 
 this image for example is sort of 
 because it exactly sums up what elton may be doing in private  and also what might be happening with saddam hussein and
 george bush
  reading the koran upside down 
 for example  george bush target practice shooting at bin laden and michael moore and then you change the photograph he 's shooting at and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible laughter
 tony blair
 being used as a mounting block
  and rumsfeld and bush laughing with some abu ghraib photos behind and
 the seriousness 
 or the intellect of bush 
 and also commenting on the behind the scenes well as we know now what goes on in prisons 
 and in fact george bush and tony blair are having great fun
 during all of this 
  based on the perception we have of the celebrities 
 what jack nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life and the fact that he tried to he had a bit of road rage and
 golf clubbed a driver
 the other day i mean it 's extremely difficult to find these look alikes so i 'm constantly going up to people
  people to come and be in one of my photographs or films and sometimes asking the real celebrity mistaking them for someone who just looks like
 the real person which is highly embarrassing laughter
 i 've also been working with the guardian on a topical basis a page a week
 in their newspaper which has been very interesting working topically so  jamie oliver and school dinners
 bush and blair having difficulty getting alongside muslim culture  the whole of the hunting issue and the royal family refusing to
 stop hunting
 and the tsunami issues and obviously harry blair 's views on gordon brown  which i find very interesting
  condi and bush this image i 've decided to show
 having a reservation about it i made it
 a year ago
  and just how meanings change and there were a terrible thing that has happened  but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that 
 that 's why this image was made one year ago
  leave you with these clips to have
  and
