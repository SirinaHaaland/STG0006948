  was asked to come here and speak about creation
 and i only have fifteen minutes and i see they 're counting already  and i can in fifteen minutes i think i can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of
  how we cope with creation while creation sometimes seems a bit un graspable or even pointless creativity is always meaningful 
 see for instance in this picture  you know creation is what
 put that dog in that picture and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on
  his hindquarters when
 you think about you know  creativity has a lot to do with causality too you know  when i was a teenager i was a creator  
 i just did things then i became an adult and started knowing who i was and tried to maintain that persona i became creative
  i actually did a book and a
  that i could track exactly looks like all the craziest things that i had done all my drinking all my parties they followed a straight line that brings me to the point that actually i 'm talking to you at this moment
  though it 's actually true you know  the reason i 'm talking to you right now is because i was born in brazil
 if i was born in monterey probably would be in brazil you know 
 i
 was born in
  under a climate of
 political distress  and i was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way in a sort of a semiotic black market  
 you couldn 't really say what you wanted to say you had to invent ways of doing it  you didn 't trust information very much 
 that led me to another step of why i 'm here today is because i really liked media of all kinds i was a media junkie  
 and eventually got involved with advertising my first job in brazil was actually to develop
 a way to improve the readability of
 billboards  
 and based on speed angle of approach and actually blocks of text
  it was very actually it was a very good study  and got me a job in an ad agency  and they also decided that
 i had to
 to give me a very ugly plexiglas trophy for it and another point why i 'm here is that the day i went
  to pick up the plexiglas trophy i rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life 
 picked the thing didn 't have any friends  on my way out i had to break a fight apart somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles they
 were in tuxedos and fighting it was very ugly and also
 advertising people do that all the time and i
 well what happened is when i went back
  to my car the guy who got hit
 decided to grab a gun i don 't know why he had a gun and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor the first person was wearing a black tie a tuxedo
  it was me 
 luckily it wasn 't fatal 
 as you can all see 
 and even more luckily  the guy said that he was sorry and i bribed him for compensation money otherwise i press charges
  and that 's how with this money i paid for a
 ticket to come to the united states in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three and that 's
 very the basic reason i 'm talking to you here today  because i got shot well 
 when
 i started working with my own work i decided that i shouldn 't do images you know i became i took this very iconoclastic approach
 when i decided to go into advertising i wanted to do  i wanted to airbrush naked people on
 ice for whiskey commercials that 's what i really wanted to do but i they didn 't let me do it so i just you know they would only let me do other things 
 but i wasn 't into selling whiskey i was into selling ice
  the first works were actually objects it was kind of a mixture of found object
  design and advertising  and i called them relics  they were displayed first at stux gallery in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three 
 this is the clown skull is a remnant of a race of a
 very evolved race of entertainers they lived in brazil long time ago 
 this is the ashanti joystick unfortunately it has become obsolete because it was designed for atari platform
  the works maybe for the next ted i 'll bring it  the rocking podium 
 this is the pre columbian coffeemaker 
 actually the idea came out of an argument that i had at starbucks that i insisted that i wasn 't having colombian coffee the coffee
  the entire encyclopedia britannica bound in a single volume for travel purposes 
 and the half tombstone for people who are not dead yet 
 i wanted to take that into
  the realm of images  and i decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts 
 so i decided to do work with clouds because clouds can mean anything you want
 but now i wanted to work in a very low tech way so something that would mean at the same time
 a lump of cotton a cloud and durer 's praying hands although this looks a lot more like mickey mouse 's praying hands  
 but i was still you know this is a kitty cloud
 they 're called equivalents after alfred stieglitz 's work 
 the snail but i was still working with sculpture and i was really trying to go flatter and flatter 
 the teapot i had a chance to go to florence in i think  it was ' ninety four and i saw
 ghiberti 's door of paradise and he did something that was very tricky he
 put together two different media from different periods of time
  first he got
 an age old way of making it which was relief  and he worked this with
 three point perspective which was brand new technology at the time  
 and it 's totally overkill  and your eye doesn 't know which level to read and you become trapped into this kind of representation so i decided to make these very
 simple renderings that at first they are taken as a line drawing you know something that 's very and then i did it with
 wire the idea was to because everybody overlooks white
 like pencil drawings  you know  and they would look at it ah it 's a pencil drawing then you have this
 double take and see that it 's actually something that existed in time it had a physicality  and you start going deeper and deeper into
  the same way the history of representation evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings  
 and i wanted to deal with other subjects i started taking that into the realm of landscape  which is something that 's almost a picture of nothing
 i made these pictures called pictures of thread and i named them after the amount of yards that i used to represent each picture these always end up being a photograph at the end or more like an etching in this case  
 so this is a lighthouse
  i don 't know how many yards after john constable
 departing from the lines i decided to tackle the idea of points like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves 
 i had met a group of children in the caribbean island of saint kitts  and i did
  work and play with them i got some photographs from them
 upon my arrival in new york i decided they were children of sugar plantation workers
 and by manipulating sugar over a black paper  i made portraits of them 
 these are thank you this is 
 valentina  the fastest it was just the name of the child with the
  another layer of representation was still introduced  because i was doing this while i was making these pictures  i realized that i could add still another thing i was trying to make a subject
 something that would interfere
 with the
  it brings to mind ideas that go from
 scatology to romance and so i decided to make these pictures and they were very large so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them so they 're called pictures of chocolate 
 freud probably
 could explain chocolate better than i he was the first subject and jackson pollock
  pictures of crowds are particularly interesting because you know you go to that you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily 
 like a face goes into becoming
 just a texture paparazzi 
 i used the dust at the whitney museum to render some pieces of their collection  
 and i picked minimalist pieces because they 're about
 specificity  and you render this with the most
  material which is
 dust itself like you know 
 you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor  they do a dna scan of this they will come up with a great mailing list this
 is richard serra 
  told me it had millions of colors in it you know an artist 's first response to this is who counted it you know and i
 realized that i never worked with color because i had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors 
 but once they 're applied to numeric structure then you you can feel more comfortable so the first time i worked with colors was by making these mosaics of pantone swatches 
 they end up being very large pictures and i photographed with a very large camera
  camera so you can see the surface of every single swatch like in this picture of chuck close  and you have to walk
 very far to be able to see it also the reference to gerhard richter 's use of color
 charts and the idea also also entering another realm of representation that 's very common to us today which is the bit map i ended up narrowing the subject to
  monet 's haystacks this is something i used to do as a joke you know  make
 the same like
 robert smithson 's spiral jetty and then leaving traces as if
 it was done on a tabletop i tried to prove that he didn 't do that thing in the salt lake  
 but then just doing the models  i was trying to explore the relationship between the model
 and the original
  felt that i would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself 
 i opt for very simple line drawings kind of stupid looking  and at the same time i was doing these very large constructions being one hundred and fifty meters
 away now i would do very small ones  which would be like but
  and i would show them together so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking  
 i wasn 't interested in the very large things  or in the small things i was more interested in the things in between you know because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there 
 this is like you see the size of a person over there
  not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in in a lot of people at the same time to evidence a single drawing  and
 i love this work  because i did these cartoonish clouds over manhattan
  for a period of two months  
 and it was quite wonderful because i had an interest an early interest in theater that 's justified on this thing in theater  you have the character and the actor in the same place trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience  
 and in this you 'd have like a
 something that looks like a cloud and it is a cloud at the same time so they 're like perfect actors 
  i once paid like sixty dollars to see a very great actor to do a version of king lear 
 and i felt really robbed because by the time the actor started being king lear  he stopped being the great actor that i had paid money to see 
 on the other hand you know i paid like three
  i think and i went to a warehouse in queens
 to see a version of othello
 by an amateur group and it was quite fascinating because you know the guy his name was joey grimaldi
 he impersonated the moorish 
  general and then he went back into plumber he worked as a plumber so plumber  general plumber  general
