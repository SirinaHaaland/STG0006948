  things happening in the design world and at ideo this past year and i 'm pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you 
 i didn 't attend the first ted
  but i 've been to a lot of them since that time i thought it [ would ] kind of be interesting to think back to that time
 when richard got the whole thing started thank you very much richard it 's been a big enjoyable part of my life coming here  
 and
 so thinking back i was thinking those of us in silicon valley were really focused on products or objects certainly technological objects  
 and so
 it was great fun in those days and some of those of those of you who are in the
  audience were my clients we 'd come in with some
 prototype underneath a black cloth and we 'd put it on the conference table and we 'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would ooh and 
 ah that was a really good time and so we 'll continue to to focus on products as we always have 
 and if you were here
  i probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new eyemodule two which was a camera that plugged into the handspring  
 and i took i took a lot of pictures last year very few people knew what i was up to but
 i took a lot of pictures this year maybe you could
 show the slides this year we 're carrying this treo which we had a lot to do with and helped handspring design
  though we designed it a few years ago it 's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so this heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives maybe you 've seen them in the airports they seem to be everywhere now lots of lives are being saved by those 
 and we 're just about to announce the
 the zinio
 reader product that that i believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read so we really will continue to focus on products but
 something 's happened in the last eighteen years since richard started ted and that 's that
 people like us i know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time 
 but for us
  we 've really just started we 've kind of climbed maslow 's hierarchy a little bit and so we 're now focused
 more and more on
  and personality into products and i think you 're starting to see that and it 's making our job even more enjoyable
 interestingly enough we used to primarily build 3 d models you know you 've seen some today and
 and 3 d renderings then we 'd go and we 'd show those as communicating our
  but firms like ours are having to move to to a point where we get those objects that we 're designing and get them in motion
  showing how they 'll be used  and so
 in order to do that we 've been forming internal
  groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the 
 relationship and it 's it 's a much better way to see it 's kind of like architects who show people in their houses
  as opposed to them being empty so i thought that
 i would show you a few a few videos to show off this new 
 broader definition of design in products and services and environments 
 i have a few of them they 're no more than a minute or a minute and a half apiece
 but i thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last
  year and how it
 responds in video so prada new york  we were asked by rem koolhaas and oma to help us conceive
 the technology that 's in their retail store in new york  he wanted
 a new kind of store a new one a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail
  that meant
 actually designing custom technology as opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use so
 there 're lots of things everything has rf tags there 's rf tags on the user on the cards  there 's the staff devices that are all around the store  
 you pick them up and once you see something that you 're interested in 
 the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store  you can look at color and sizes and how it appeared on the runway or whatever
  and so
 then the object the
 merchandise that you 're interested in can be scanned it 's taken into the dressing room  and in the dressing room there are scanners so that we know exactly what
 clothing you have in the dressing room  we can put that up on a on a touch screen and you can
 play with that and get more information about the clothing that you 're interested
 in as you 're trying it on it 's been used a lot of places but i particularly like the the use here of liquid crystal
 displays in the changing room the last time i went to to see this store there was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering am i going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here
 if you push the button of course the whole
  you can try to get approval or not for whatever you 're wearing 
 and then one of my favorite features of the technology is the magic mirror where
 you put on the clothes there 's a big display in the
 in the mirror  and you can turn around but there 's a three second delay so you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around
  about a year and a half ago we
 were asked to design
 an installation in the museum this is a new wing of the science museum in london  and it 's primarily about digital and biomedical issues 
 and
 a group at itch which is now part of ideo 
 designed this interactive wall that 's about four stories tall i don 't know if anybody 's seen this it 's pretty spectacular in the room  
 anyway it 's based on the london subway system and so you can see that
  the goal is to bring some of the feedback that the people who had gone to the museum
 were giving and get it up on the wall so everybody could see just for everybody to see so you enter your information then like the london tube system  the little trains go around with
 what you  're thinking about  and then when you get to a station it 's
 expanded so that you can actually read it then when you exit the imax theatre on the fourth floor mostly teenagers coming out of there there 's this big open
  space that has these tables in it that have interactive games which are quite fun also designed by durrell [ bishop ] and andrew [ hirniak ] of itch  and the topics
 the topics include
 things that the museum is about  male fertility  choosing the sex of your baby or what a driverless car might be like 
  there 's lots of room so people can come up and understand what it is before they get involved  and also it 's not shown in the video but these are very beautiful they go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top after they 've bounced around they
 disperse into bits and go off into the atmosphere
  the next video is not done by us this is cbs sunday morning that aired about
  scott adams ran into us and asked us if we wouldn 't help to design the ultimate cubicle for dilbert which sounded like a fun thing and so
 we couldn 't pass it up he 's always been interested in technology in the future video scott adams i realized that at some point i might be the world 's expert on what 's wrong with cubicles 
 so we thought well wouldn 't it be fun to get together with some of the smartest design guys in the world
 and try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better narrator though they work in a
  space spectacularly set under san francisco 's oakland bay bridge  
 the team built their own little cubicles to fully experience the problems
  the first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens
 for the computer and for family photos in the second group 's scenario  the walls are alive
 and actually give dilbert a group hug 
 behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human 
  so here 's the final thing complete with orange lighting that follows the sun across that follows the tracks of the sun across the the sky so you feel that in your
 in your cubicle and my favorite feature which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment  and then when you come back it comes up
 something to be aggressive with to release tension dk and of course a hammock for your afternoon nap 
  life would be sweet in a cubicle like this dk 
 this next project we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate the recycling of the water on the millennium dome
 in london  the dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it as well as wastewater  
 so this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time
  the pavilion 's design goal was to be kind of quiet and
  in contrast to if you went inside the dome where it 's kind of wild and crazy and everybody 's
 learning all kinds of things or fooling around or whatever they 're doing but it was intended to be quite quiet 
 and then you would wander around and gather information in a straightforward fashion 
 about the recycling process and what 's being done and how they 're going to reuse the water once it comes
  the panels actually rotate so you can get the information on the front side but as as they rotate you can see the actual recycling plant behind with all the machines as they actually process
 these are all very 
 like quick prototypes and we 're announcing a new product here tonight which is the first time this has ever been shown in public 
 it 's called spyfish and it 's
 a company called h2eye started by nigel jagger in london
  and it 's a company that 's trying to
 bring the experience many people have boats or enjoy being on boats but a very small percentage of people actually
 have the capability or the interest in going under the water
 and actually seeing what 's there and enjoying what scuba divers do this product it has two cameras  you throw it over the side of your boat
  and you basically scuba dive without getting wet 
 for us there 's the object for us it was two projects one to design the interface
 so that the interface doesn 't get in your way you could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater of feeling like you 're underwater seeing what 's going on 
 and the other one was to design the object and make sure that it was
 it was a consumer product and not a research tool and so we spent a lot of time this has been going on for about seven or eight years this project and [ we 're ]
 just ready to start building them narrator 
 the spyfish is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera it can dive to five hundred feet to where sunlight does
  and is equipped with powerful lights  it becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep 
 the battery powered spyfish sends the live video feed through a slender cable dk 
 this slender cable was a huge technological advancement and it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is narrator and this central box connects the whole system together
 maneuvering the spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control  you watch the video with superimposed graphics that indicate your depth and compass heading
  fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine to help you completely lose yourself underwater
  and the last thing i 'll talk about is approtec which is a project that i 'm very excited about 
 approtec is a company started by dr martin fisher who 's a good friend of mine he 's a ph d from stanford he found himself in kenya on a fulbright
 and he had a very interesting insight which is that he said
  there must be
 entrepreneurs in kenya there must be entrepreneurs everywhere 
 and he noticed that for for weddings and funerals there they could find enough money to put something together so he decided to start manufacturing
 products in kenya with kenyan manufacturers designed by people like us but
 taken there
  to this date he 's been gone for only a few years he 's started nineteen thousand companies
 he 's made thirty thousand new jobs and just
 the sales of the products this 
  the sales of these products is now 
 of the gdp of kenya this is one guy doing this this is a pretty spectacular thing so we 're in the process of helping them design
  in order for these people who have a quarter acre
 of land to be able to grow crops in the off season what they do now is they can grow crops in the rainy season but they can 't grow them in the in the off season and so by doing that 
 the woman that you saw in the first thing she 's a school teacher always wanted to send her kids to college and she 's going to be able to do it
  very straightforward things that we 're designing my students are doing this as class projects and ideo has
 donated their time to do this kind of work it 's really amazing to see
 to see his success martin  's we also were thinking about the experience of richard  and so
 i just have one more thing to say can you read it 
 well it 's always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers you know you don 't want to be rude to him and you don 't want to feel guilty and so i thought this would do it where i just sit here
