  suicide bomber would actually teach me a valuable lesson  but he
  he taught me to never presume anything about anyone you don 't know 
 on a thursday morning in july two thousand and five 
 the bomber and i unknowingly  boarded the same train carriage at the same time standing  apparently
  i didn 't see him actually i didn 't see anyone you know not to look at anyone on the tube but i guess he saw me 
 i guess he looked at all of us 
 as his hand hovered over the detonation switch  
 i 've often wondered  what was he thinking
 in those final seconds  
 i know it wasn 't personal 
 he didn 't set out to kill or maim me gill hicks i mean he didn 't know me 
 instead he gave me an unwarranted
  allowed him to dehumanize us it allowed him to push
  precious lives were taken in my carriage alone  and i was almost one of them 
 in the time it takes to draw a breath 
 we were plunged into a darkness so immense that it was almost tangible  
 what i imagine wading through tar might be like
  we didn 't know we were the enemy
  we were just a bunch of commuters who minutes earlier had followed the tube etiquette  
 no direct eye contact no talking
 and absolutely no conversation  
 but in the lifting of the darkness we were reaching out
  we were helping each other 
 we were calling out our names a little bit like a roll call  waiting for responses
  i didn 't know alison  but i listened for her
 every few minutes  i didn 't know richard  but it mattered to me that he survived
  all i shared with them
 was my first name they didn 't know that i was a head of a department at the design council  
 and here is my
 beloved briefcase  also rescued from that morning 
 they didn 't know that i published architecture and design journals that i was a fellow of the royal society
  of arts that i wore black
 still do
 that i smoked cigarillos 
 i don 't smoke cigarillos anymore  i drank gin and i watched ted talks of course never dreaming
 that one day i
  on prosthetic legs  giving a talk  
 i was a young australian woman doing extraordinary things in london 
 and i wasn 't ready for that all to end 
 i was so determined to survive that i used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my
  and i just shut
 everything
 and everyone out 
 to focus to listen to myself to be guided by instinct alone  
 i lowered my breathing rate 
 i elevated my thighs  i held myself upright and i fought the urge to close my eyes
  to contemplate the whole of my life up until this point  
 perhaps
 i should have done more  perhaps i could have lived more seen more  maybe i should have gone running  dancing taken up
  but my priority
 and my focus was always my work  i lived to work
  who i was on my business card mattered to me 
 but it didn 't matter
 down in that tunnel 
 by the time i felt that first touch from one of my rescuers i was unable
  speak unable to say even a small word like gill 
 i surrendered my body to them  
 i had done all i possibly could and now i was in their hands  
 i understood just who and what
  humanity really is when i first saw
 the id tag that was given to me when i was admitted to hospital  and it read
  words were my gift  
 what they told me very clearly was that my life was saved  
 purely because i was a human being  
 difference of any kind made no difference to the extraordinary lengths that the rescuers were prepared to go
 to save my life to save
  as many unknowns as they could and putting their own lives at risk to them it didn 't matter
 if i was rich or poor the color of my skin  whether i was male or female my sexual orientation 
 who i voted for whether i was educated if i had a faith
 or no faith at all nothing
 mattered other than i was a precious human life  
 i see myself
 as a living fact  i am proof that unconditional love and respect
 can not only save but it can transform lives
  here is a wonderful image of one of my rescuers  andy  and i taken just last year  
 ten years after the event  and here we are arm in arm  
 throughout all the chaos my hand was held tightly 
 my face was stroked gently 
 what did i feel
 i felt loved  
 what 's shielded me from hatred and wanting retribution what 's given me the courage to say 
 this ends with me
 is love i was loved
  potential
 for widespread positive change
 is absolutely enormous because i know
 what we 're capable of i know the brilliance of humanity 
 so this leaves me with some pretty big things to ponder and some questions for us all to consider 
 is what unites us not far greater
  than what can ever divide  
 does it have to take a tragedy or a disaster for us to feel deeply connected as one species 
 as human beings  
 and when will we embrace the wisdom of our era
 to rise above mere tolerance
 and move to an acceptance for all
 who are only a label until we know them  thank you
