  i 'm here today to talk to you about a very powerful little word one that people will do almost anything to avoid becoming
 billion dollar industries thrive because of the fear of it  and those of us who undeniably are it
  to navigate a relentless storm surrounding it i 'm not sure if any of you have noticed  but i 'm fat 
 not the lowercase 
 kind or the seemingly harmless chubby or cuddly  i 'm not even the more sophisticated voluptuous or curvaceous
  let 's not sugarcoat it  i am the capital
 kind of fat  i am the elephant in the room 
 when i walked out on stage some of you may have been thinking aww 
 this is going to be hilarious because everybody knows that fat people are funny 
 or you may have been thinking where does she get
  because a confident fat woman is almost unthinkable 
 the fashion conscious members of the audience may have been thinking how fabulous i look in this beth ditto dress thank you very much 
 whereas some of you might have thought hmm black would have been so much more slimming 
 you may have wondered consciously or not if i have diabetes or a partner  or if i eat carbs after
  you may have worried that you ate carbs after 7pm last night  and that you really should renew your gym membership 
 these judgments are insidious they can be directed at individuals and groups and they can also be directed at ourselves 
 and this way of thinking is known as fatphobia 
 like any form of systematic oppression
  rooted in complex structures
 like capitalism  patriarchy and racism  and that can make it really difficult to see  let alone challenge  
 we live in a culture where being fat is seen as being a bad person
 lazy  greedy  unhealthy irresponsible and morally suspect  and we tend to see thinness
 as being universally good
 responsible successful and in control of our appetites bodies and lives  
 we see these ideas again and again in the media in public health policy doctors ' offices 
 in everyday conversations and in our own attitudes
  we may even blame fat people themselves
 for the discrimination they face because after all if we don 't like it we should just lose weight  easy
 this antifat bias has become so integral so ingrained to how we value ourselves and each other
 that we rarely question why we have such contempt for people of size
 and where that disdain comes from but we must question it
  because the enormous value we place on how we look affects every one of us  
 and do we really want to live in a society where people are denied their basic humanity
 if they don 't subscribe to some arbitrary form of acceptable 
 so when i was six years old my sister used to teach ballet to a bunch of little girls in our garage  i was about a foot taller and
  wider than most of the group  
 when it came to doing our first performance  i was so excited about wearing a pretty pink tutu  
 i was going to sparkle 
 as the other girls slipped easily into their lycra and tulle creations not one of the tutus was big enough to fit me  
 i was determined not to be excluded from the performance
  so i turned to my mother and loud enough for everyone to hear
 said mom 
 i don 't need a tutu  
 i need a fourfour thanks mom 
 and although i didn 't recognize it at the time  claiming space for myself in that glorious
 was the first step towards becoming a radical fat activist  
 now i 'm not saying that this whole body love thing has been an easy skip along a glittering path of  self acceptance since that day in class far from it  
 i soon learned that living outside what the mainstream considers normal can be a frustrating and isolating place
  last twenty years unpacking and deprogramming these messages  and it 's been quite the roller coaster  
 i 've been openly laughed at  abused from passing cars and been told that i 'm delusional 
 i also receive smiles from strangers who recognize what it takes to walk down the street with a spring in your step and your head held high
  and through it all that fierce little six year old has stayed with me and she has helped me stand before you today
 as an unapologetic fat person 
 a person that simply refuses to subscribe to the dominant narrative about how i should move through the world in this body of mine
  i 'm not alone  i am part of an international community of people who choose to rather than passively accepting that our bodies are
 and probably always will be big we actively choose to flourish in these bodies as they are today 
 people who honor our strength and work with not against our perceived limitations people who
  value health as something much more holistic
 than a number on an outdated bmi chart  instead  we value mental health self worth and how we feel in our bodies
 as vital aspects to our overall well being people who refuse to believe that living in these fat bodies
 is a barrier to anything really
  there are doctors  academics and bloggers who have written countless volumes on the many facets of this complex subject  there are 
 who reclaim their bodies and their beauty by wearing fatkinis and crop tops  exposing the flesh that we 're all taught to
  there are fat athletes who run marathons teach yoga or do kickboxing 
 all done with a middle finger firmly held up to the status quo  
 and these people have taught me that radical body politics is the antidote to our  body shaming culture  
 but to be clear i 'm not saying that people shouldn 't change their bodies if that 's what they want to do reclaiming yourself can be one of the most
 acts of self love and can look like a million different things 
 from hairstyles to tattoos to body contouring to hormones to surgery and yes even weight loss 
 it 's simple it 's your body  and you decide what 's best to do with it  
 my way of engaging in activism
 is by doing all the things that we fatties aren 't supposed to do  and there 's a lot of them
 inviting other people to join me and then making art about it 
 the common thread through most of this work has been reclaiming spaces that are often prohibitive to bigger bodies 
 from the catwalk to club shows 
 from public swimming pools to prominent dance stages
  and reclaiming spaces en masse is not only a powerful artistic statement but a radical community building approach this was so true of 
  fat  fem synchronized swim team
 i started with a group of friends in sydney 
 the impact of seeing a bunch of defiant fat women in flowery swimming caps and bathers throwing their legs in the air without a care
 should not be underestimated
 throughout my career  i have learned that fat bodies are inherently political  
 and unapologetic fat bodies can blow people 's minds  
 when director kate
  of acclaimed dance theater company force majeure  asked me to be the artistic associate on a work featuring all fat dancers  
 i literally jumped at the opportunity  
 and i mean literally 
 nothing to lose is a work made in collaboration with performers of size
 who drew from their lived experiences to create a work as varied and authentic as we all are and it was as far from ballet as
  you could imagine 
 the very idea of a fat dance work by such a prestigious company was to put it mildly  controversial  
 because nothing like it had ever been done on mainstream dance stages before
 anywhere in the world people were
  size twelve
 kind of fat where did they do their dance training are they going to have the stamina for a  full length production 
 but despite the skepticism nothing to lose became a sellout hit of sydney festival we
  won awards and were written about in over twenty seven languages these incredible images of our cast were seen worldwide  
 i 've lost count of how many times people of all sizes have told me that the show has changed their lives 
 how it helped them shift their relationship to their own and other people 's bodies 
 and how it made them confront their own bias 
 but of course work
  that pushes people 's buttons is not without its detractors  
 i have been told that i 'm glorifying obesity  
 i have received violent death threats and abuse for daring to make work that centers fat people 's bodies and lives
 and treats us as worthwhile human beings with valuable stories to tell  i 've even been called
  isis of the obesity epidemic 
 a comment so absurd that it is funny  
 but it also speaks to the panic the literal terror that the fear of fat can evoke 
 it is this fear that 's feeding the diet industry  which is keeping so
  many of us from making peace with our own bodies for waiting to be the 
 before we truly start to live our lives  because the real elephant in the room here is fatphobia 
 fat activism refuses to indulge this fear by advocating for 
  and respect for all of us we can shift society 's reluctance to embrace diversity
 and start to celebrate the myriad ways there are to have a body  thank you
