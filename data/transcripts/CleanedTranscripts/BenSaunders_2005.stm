  ben saunders i specialize in dragging heavy things around cold places on may  11th last year i stood alone at the north
 geographic pole i was the only human being in an area
  times the size of america five and a half thousand square miles more than two thousand people have climbed everest  
 twelve people have stood on the moon  including me only four people have skied solo to the north pole  and i think the reason for that 
  it 's as chris said bonkers it 's a journey that is right at the limit of human capability  i skied the equivalent of
  marathons back to back eight hundred miles in ten weeks  and i was dragging
 all the food i needed the supplies the equipment  sleeping bag one change of underwear everything i needed for nearly three months what
 we 're going to try and do today in the sixteen and a bit minutes i 've got left is to try and answer three questions the first one is why  the second
  the loo at minus forty ben i 've read somewhere that at minus forty exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute so how do you answer the call of nature i don 't want to answer these now i 'll come on to them at the end 
 third one how do you top that what 's next
 it all started back in two thousand and one my first expedition was with a guy called pen hadow enormously experienced chap this was like my polar apprenticeship  
 we were trying to ski from this group of islands up here severnaya zemlya to the north pole 
  that fascinates me about the north pole geographic north pole is that it 's slap bang in the middle of the sea this is about as good as maps get 
 and to reach it you 've got to ski literally over the frozen crust  the floating skin of ice on the artic ocean i 'd
 spoken to all the experts i 'd read lots of books i studied maps and charts but i realized on the morning of day one that i had no idea exactly what i 'd let myself in for i was twenty three years old 
  age had attempted anything like this and
 pretty quickly almost everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong  we were attacked by a polar bear on day two i had frostbite in my left big toe  
 we started running very low on food we were both pretty hungry losing lots of weight some very unusual weather conditions very difficult ice conditions 
 we had
  we couldn 't afford a satellite phone so we had hf radio you can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent there 's a a wire dangling down either side that was our hf radio antenna we had less than two hours
 two way communication with the outside world in two months
  ultimately we ran out of time we 'd skied four hundred miles we were
 just just over two two hundred miles left to go to the pole and we 'd run out of time we were too late into the summer the ice was starting to melt we spoke to the russian helicopter pilots on the radio and they said
  look boys  you 've run out of time we 've got to pick you up and i felt that i had
 failed wholeheartedly i was a failure  the one goal the one dream i 'd had for as long as i could remember i hadn hadn 't even come close 
 and skiing along that first trip i had two
 imaginary video clips that i 'd replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough just to keep my keep my motivation going the first one was
 reaching the pole itself
  see vividly i suppose being filmed out of the door of a helicopter  there was kind of rock music playing in the background and i had a
 a ski pole with a union jack you know flying in the wind i could see myself sticking the flag in a pole you know ah glorious moment the music kind of reaching a crescendo  the second
 video clip that i imagined was was getting back to heathrow airport and i could see again vividly the
  autograph hunters the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal 
 and of course neither of these things happened we didn 't get to the pole and we didn 't have any money to pay anyone to do the pr so no one had heard
 of this expedition  and i got back to heathrow my mum was there  my brother was there  my granddad was there had a little union jack
  a failure in a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition and
 lying on my mum 's sofa day in day out watching daytime tv 
 my brother sent me a text message an sms it was a quote from the simpsons it said you tried your hardest and failed miserably  
 the lesson is don 't even try 
  fast forward three years i did eventually get off the sofa and start planning another expedition this time i wanted to go right across on my own this time from
 russia at the top of the map to the north pole where the sort of kink in the middle is and then on to canada 
 no one has made a complete crossing of the arctic ocean on their own two norwegians did it as a team in two thousand no one 's done it solo 
 very famous very accomplished italian mountaineer reinhold messner tried it in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five 
  and he was rescued after a week he described this expedition as ten times
 as dangerous as everest  so for some
 reason this was what i wanted to have a crack at 
 but i knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece let alone make it across to canada i had to take a radical approach 
 this meant everything from perfecting the
 strategy from scratch six thousand calories a day 
 and the expedition started in february last year big support team we had a film crew a couple of logistics people with us my girlfriend a
 photographer at first it was pretty sensible we flew british airways to to moscow  the next bit in siberia to krasnoyarsk on a russian internal airline called
 chartered a pretty elderly russian plane to fly us up to a town called khatanga which was the the sort of last bit of civilization 
 our cameraman who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times
 actually asked the pilot before we got on the plane how long this flight would take and the pilot russian pilot completely deadpan replied six hours if we live
  we got to khatanga i think the joke is that khatanga isn 't the end of the world but you can see it from there it
 was supposed to be an overnight stay we were stuck there for ten days there was a kind of vodka fueled pay dispute between the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter so we were stuck we couldn 't move 
 finally morning of day eleven we got the all clear 
 loaded up
 the helicopters two helicopters flying in tandem dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice  we had a frantic sort of
  minutes of filming photography while the helicopter was still there
 i did an interview on the satellite phone  and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter wham the door closed  and i was
 alone and i don 't
 know if words will ever quite do that moment justice all i could think about was running back up to the door
  to make things worse you can just see the white dot up at the top right hand side of the screen that 's a full moon because we 'd been held up in russia of course the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides when you 're standing on the on the frozen surface of the sea  
 high and low tides generally mean that interesting things are going to happen the ice is going to start moving around a bit 
 i was you can see there pulling two sledges  grand total in all  ninety five days of food and fuel
  and eighty kilos that 's almost exactly four hundred pounds when the ice was flat or flattish i could just about pull both when the ice wasn 't flat i didn 't have a hope in hell i had to pull one  leave 
  it and go back and get the other one literally scrambling scrambling through what 's called pressure ice the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean the wind and the tides 
  's always drifting the pack ice  is always drifting  i was skiing into headwinds for nine out of the ten weeks i was alone last year  and i was drifting backwards most of the time 
 my record was minus two point five miles i got up in the morning took the tent down skied north for seven and a half hours put the tent up  and i was two and a half miles further back
  getting ready to go  the weather is just appalling oh  drifted back about five miles
 in the last last night  later in the expedition the problem was no longer the ice  it was
 a lack of ice open water  i knew this was happening i knew the  artic was warming i knew there was more open water
  weapon up my sleeve this was my little bit of bio mimicry 
 polar bears on the artic ocean move in in dead straight lines if they come to water they 'll climb in swim across it so we had a dry suit developed i worked with a team in norway
 based on a sort of survival suit i suppose that helicopter pilots would wear
 that i could climb into it would go on over my boots over my mittens it would pull up around my face and seal pretty tightly around my face  and this meant i could ski over very thin ice
  if i fell through it wasn 't the end of the world it also meant if the worst came to the worst i could actually jump in and swim across
 and
 drag the sledge over after me  some pretty radical technology a radical approach but it worked perfectly 
 another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology 
 in one thousand nine hundred and twelve shackleton 's endurance expedition there was
 one of his crew a guy called thomas
  explorers of two thousand and twelve  if there is anything left to explore 
 will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones fitted with wireless telescopes well orde lees guessed wrong by about eight years this is my pocket wireless telephone iridium satellite phone 
 the wireless telescope was a digital camera i had tucked in my pocket and every single day of the seventy two days i was alone on the ice i was
  blogging live from my tent  sending back a little diary piece sending back information on the distance i 'd covered the ice conditions the temperature and
 a daily photo remember two thousand and one we had
 less than two hours radio contact with the outside world last year  blogging live from an expedition that 's been described as ten times
 as dangerous as everest it wasn 't all high tech this is navigating in what 's called a whiteout  when you get
  there isn 't even a pole at the pole there 's nothing there  purely because it 's sea ice it 's drifting  stick a flag there leave it there  pretty soon it will drift off usually towards canada
  this but i was expecting something
 strange mixture of feelings it was extremely warm by this stage a lot of open water around and
 of course  elated that i 'd got there under my own steam but
 starting to to really realize that my chances of making it all the way across to canada which was still four hundred miles away were slim at best 
 the only proof i 've got that i was there is a blurry photo
  of my gps the little satellite satellite navigation gadget  you can just see there 's a
 nine and a string of zeros here ninety degrees north that is slap bang in the north pole i
 took a photo of that sat down on my sledge did a sort of video diary piece took a few photos i got my satellite phone out i warmed the battery up in my armpit i dialed three numbers  i
  i dialed my girlfriend i dialed the ceo of my sponsor and i got three voicemails
  i skied on for a week past the pole i wanted to get as close to canada as i could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue
  this was the the last day i had on the ice  when i spoke to the my project management team they said look ben conditions are getting too dangerous 
  areas of open water just south of your position  we 'd like to pick you up ben could you please look for an airstrip this was the view
 outside my tent when i when i had this this fateful phone call i
 'd never tried to build an airstrip before tony the expedition manager he said look ben you 've got to find five hundred meters of of flat  thick safe ice the only bit of ice i
  hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip
 was exactly four hundred and seventy three meters i could measure it with my with my skis
 i didn 't tell tony that i didn 't tell the pilots that i thought  it 'll have to do oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 it just about worked a pretty dramatic landing the plane actually passed over four times and i was a bit worried it wasn 't going to land at all the pilot i knew was called troy i was expecting someone called troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy  
  bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed a pretty emotional moment so i thought i 've got to
 compose myself for troy i 'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type the plane taxied up to where i was standing the door opened this guy jumped out he 's about that tall
  troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice we took a few photos  he
 climbed up the ladder he said just just get in the back he threw his cigarette out as he got on the front and i climbed in the back 
 laughter taxied up and down the runway a few times just to flatten it out a bit and he said right i 'm going to i 'm going to give it a go and he
 i 've now learned that this is
  me worried at the time he put his hand on the throttle you can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit it 's that little bar there  he put his hand on the throttle monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his i thought god here we go we 're we 're this is all or nothing 
 rammed it forwards bounced down the runway just took off one of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway 
 banking i could see into the cockpit  troy battling the controls and he just took one hand off reached back  flipped a switch on the on the roof of the cockpit  
 and it was the fasten seat belt sign you can see on the
 only from the air did did i see the big picture of course when you 're on the ice you only ever see one obstacle at a time whether it 's
 a pressure ridge or there 's a bit of water this is probably why i didn 't get into trouble about the the length of my airstrip i mean it really was starting to break up 
 why i 'm not an explorer in the traditional sense  i 'm not skiing along drawing maps everyone knows where the north pole is at the south pole there 's a big scientific base there 's an
  airstrip there 's a cafe and there 's a tourist shop 
 for me this is about exploring human limits about exploring the limits of physiology of psychology and of technology they 're the things that excite me
  and it 's also about potential  on a personal level this for me is a chance to to explore
 the limits really push the limits of my own potential see how far they
  and on a wider scale  it amazes me how people go through life just scratching the surface of their potential just doing three or four or five percent of what they 're truly capable of so 
 on a wider scale  i hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people to to think about
 what they want to do with their potential  and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet 
 that 's as close as i can come to summing that up the next question is how do you answer the call of nature at minus
  forty the answer of course to which is is a trade secret
 and
 the last question what 's next 
 as quickly as possible if i  have a minute left at the end i 'll go into more detail what 's next
  antarctica  it 's the coldest highest windiest and driest continent on earth 
  a race to be the first to the south pole the heart of the antarctic continent 
 if you include the coastal ice shelves you can see that the ross ice shelf it 's the big one down here the ross ice shelf is the size of france antarctica
 if you include the ice shelves is twice the size of australia it 's a big place and there 's a race to get to the pole between amundsen the norwegian amundsen had dog sleds and huskies
 and scott the british guy captain scott scott had sort of ponies and
  and some tractors and a few dogs all of which went wrong and scott and his team of four people ended up on foot 
 they got to the pole late january one thousand nine hundred and twelve to find a norwegian flag already there there was a tent a letter to the norwegian king
 and they turned around headed back to the coast and all five of them died on the return journey since
  no one has ever skied this was ninety three years ago since then no one has ever skied
 from the coast of antarctica to the pole and back 
 every south pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing
 no one has ever made a return journey so that 's the plan two of us are doing it that 's pretty much it
