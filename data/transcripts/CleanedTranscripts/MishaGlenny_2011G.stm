  thing to do but let 's kick off the afternoon with a message from a mystery sponsor
  ladies and gentlemen a sophisticated group of politically motivated hackers who have emerged in two
  thousand and eleven  and they 're pretty scary you never know when they 're going to attack next who or what the consequences will be  
 but interestingly  they have a sense of humor 
 these guys hacked into fox news ' twitter account to announce president
  you can imagine the panic that would have generated in the newsroom
 at fox what do we do now put on a black armband or crack open the champagne and of course 
 who could escape the irony of a member of rupert murdoch 's news corp being a victim of hacking for a change
  you turn on the news and you say is there anyone left to hack sony playstation network
  the government of turkey tick britain 's serious organized crime agency a breeze  the cia falling off a log in fact a friend of mine from the security industry told me 
  the other day that there are two types of companies in the world those that know they 've been hacked and those that
 i mean
 three companies providing cybersecurity services to the fbi have been hacked is nothing sacred anymore for heaven 's sake  
 anyway this mysterious group anonymous and they would say this themselves they are providing a service by demonstrating how useless companies are at protecting our data
  but there is also a very serious aspect to anonymous they are ideologically driven  
 they claim that they are battling a dastardly conspiracy  
 they say that governments are trying to take over the internet and control it and that they anonymous are the authentic voice of resistance be it against middle eastern dictatorships against global media
  corporations or against intelligence agencies or whoever it is 
 and their politics are not entirely unattractive  okay they 're a little
  internet 
 the web links everything  and very soon it will mediate most human activity 
 because the internet has fashioned a new and complicated environment for an  old age dilemma that pits the demands of security
 with the desire for freedom now this is a very complicated struggle and unfortunately
  for mortals like
 you and me we probably can 't
 understand it very well nonetheless in an unexpected attack of hubris a couple of years ago i decided i would try and do that and
 i sort i sort of get it these were the various things that i was looking at as i was trying to understand it but in order to try and explain the whole thing
 i would need another eighteen minutes or so to do it so you 're just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion  and let me assure you that all of these 
  issues are involved in cybersecurity and control of the internet one way or the other but in a configuration that
  trying to get his head around so there you are and as you see in the middle there is our old friend the hacker  
 the hacker is absolutely central to many of the political social and economic issues affecting the net  and so i thought to myself well 
 these are the guys who i want to talk to and what do you know 
 anonymous  as it were so despite the fact that we are beginning to pour billions hundreds of billions of dollars into cybersecurity for the most extraordinary technical
 solutions no one wants to talk to these guys the hackers who are
  we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions 
 which cost a huge amount of money and so nothing is going into into the hackers  
 well i say nothing  but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit in turin italy called the hackers profiling project 
 doing some fantastic research into the characteristics into the abilities and the socialization of hackers but because they 're a u n operation 
 maybe that 's why governments and corporations are not that interested in them  because it 's a u n operation of course  it lacks funding  but i think they 're doing very 
  important work because where we have a surplus of technology in the cybersecurity industry we have
 a definite lack of call me  old fashioned human intelligence now  so far i 've mentioned the hackers
 anonymous who are a politically motivated hacking group of course the criminal justice system treats them as common old garden criminals but interestingly anonymous does not make use of its hacked information for financial gain  
 but what about the
 real cybercriminals  well real organized crime on the internet goes back about ten years when a group of gifted ukrainian hackers
 developed a website  
 which led to the industrialization of cybercrime welcome to the now forgotten realm of carderplanet
  this is how they were advertising themselves a decade ago
 on the net now carderplanet was very interesting cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details to exchange information about new malware that was was out there 
 and remember this is a time when
  which you can deploy even if you 're not a terribly sophisticated hacker and so carderplanet became a sort of supermarket for cybercriminals 
 and its creators were incredibly smart and entrepreneurial because they were faced with one enormous challenge as cybercriminals and that challenge is 
 how do you do business
 how do you trust somebody on the web who you want to do business with when you know that they 're a criminal it
 's axiomatic that they 're dodgy and they 're going to want to try and rip you off
 so the family as the inner core of carderplanet was known came up with this brilliant idea called the escrow system 
 they appointed an officer
 who would
  mediate between the vendor and the purchaser the vendor say had stolen credit card details
 the purchaser wanted to get a hold of them the purchaser would send the administrative officer
 some dollars digitally and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details and the officer would then verify if
 the stolen credit card worked  and if they did he then passed on the money
  money to the vendor and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser 
 and it was this which completely revolutionized cybercrime on the web and after that it just went wild we had
  a champagne decade for people who we know as carders now i spoke to one of these carders
  his proper nickname but i promised i wouldn 't reveal who he was  and he explained to me how in two thousand and three and two thousand and four he would go on sprees in new york taking out $ ten thousand from an atm here $ thirty thousand from an
 he said that
 he had so much money stashed in his upper east side apartment at one point that he just didn 't know what to do with it and actually fell into a depression  but that 's a slightly different story  
 which i won 't go into now now the interesting thing about redbrigade is is that he wasn 't an advanced hacker  he sort of understood the technology and he realized that security was very important if you
  going to be
 a carder  but he didn 't spend his days and nights bent over a computer eating pizza
  drinking coke and that sort of thing he was out there on the town having a fab time enjoying the high life  and this is because hackers are only one element in a cybercriminal enterprise
  they 're the most vulnerable element of all and
 i want to explain this to you by introducing you to six characters who i met while i was
 doing this research dimitry golubov aka script born in odessa ukraine in 
 now he developed his social and moral compass on
  environment where involvement in criminal or corrupt activities was entirely necessary if you wanted to survive as an accomplished computer 
  user what dimitry did was to transfer the gangster capitalism of his hometown onto the worldwide web  and he did a great job in
  you have to understand though that from his ninth birthday  
 the only environment he knew was gangsterism he knew no other way of making a living
 and making money 
 then we have renukanth subramaniam  aka jilsi founder of darkmarket  born in colombo sri lanka as an eight year old he and his parents fled 
 the sri lankan capital because singhalese mobs were roaming the city looking for tamils like renu to murder
 at eleven he was interrogated by the sri lankan military accused of being a terrorist and his parents sent him
 on his own to britain as a refugee seeking political asylum at thirteen with only little english and being bullied at school 
  he escaped into a world of computers where he showed great technical ability  but he was soon being seduced by people
 on the internet he was convicted of mortgage and credit card fraud  and he will be released from wormwood scrubs jail in london in two thousand and twelve
 who was an administrator at darkmarket  born in southern germany to a stable and well respected middle class family his obsession with gaming as a teenager led him to hacking
  and  he was soon controlling huge servers around the world where he stored his games that he had cracked and pirated his slide into criminality 
 was incremental  and when he finally woke up to his situation and understood the implications he was already in too deep  max vision aka iceman mastermind of cardersmarket born
  in meridian  idaho  max vision was one of the best penetration testers working out of santa clara california
 in the late 90s for private companies and voluntarily
 for the fbi now in the late 1990s he discovered a vulnerability on all u s government
  and he went in and patched it up because this included nuclear research facilities
 sparing the american government a huge security embarrassment but also because he was an inveterate hacker  he left a tiny digital
 wormhole through which he alone could crawl  but this was spotted by an eagle eye investigator  and he was convicted at his open prison he came under the influence
  and those financial fraudsters persuaded him to work for them on his release  and this man with a 
 brain is now serving a
  arriving in britain in two thousand and five to take a masters in chemical engineering at manchester university  he impressed in the private sector developing 
 chemical applications for the oil industry while simultaneously running a worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions until
  one of the most remarkable hackers ever from ankara in turkey  he combined the tremendous skills of a geek with the suave social 
  engineering skills of the master criminal one of the smartest people
  encountered amongst global cybercriminals now the important thing about all of these people is they share certain characteristics despite the fact that they come 
  from very different environments they are all people who learned their hacking skills in their early to mid teens 
  remember that when they developed those hacking skills their moral compass had not yet developed and most of them with the exception of script and 
 they did not demonstrate any real social skills in the outside world only on the web and the other thing is is the high incidence of hackers like these who have characteristics which are
  consistent with asperger 's syndrome  now i discussed this with professor simon baron cohen who 's the professor of developmental psychopathology at
 cambridge and he has done path breaking work on autism and confirmed also for the authorities here that gary mckinnon
  who is wanted by the united states for hacking into the pentagon suffers from asperger asperger 's and a secondary condition of depression and baron cohen
 explained that certain disabilities can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world as tremendous skills and that we should not be throwing in jail people who have such disabilities
 a trick here  because i don 't think people like max vision should be in jail and let me be blunt about this in china in russia and in loads of other countries that are developing
  capabilities this is exactly what they are doing 
 they are recruiting hackers both before and after they become involved in criminal and industrial espionage activities are mobilizing them on behalf
 of the state 
 we need to engage and find ways of offering guidance to these young people because they are a remarkable breed  and if we rely as we do at the moment 
 solely on the criminal justice system and the threat of punitive sentences  we will be nurturing a monster we cannot
  so your idea worth spreading is hire hackers
 how would someone get over that kind of fear that the hacker they hire might preserve that little teensy wormhole mg i think to an extent
  have to understand that it 's axiomatic among
 hackers that they do that 
 they 're just relentless and obsessive about what they do but all of the people who i 've spoken to who have fallen foul of the law  they have all said please please 
  give us a chance to work in the legitimate industry  we just never knew how to get there what we were doing we want to work with you
