  a curious little invention is being talked about it 's called a microscope  
 what it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye  soon comes the medical discovery
 that many of these lifeforms are actually causes of terrible human diseases  imagine what happened to the society when they realized
 that an english mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup not very far from here this is from london fast
 forward two hundred years  we still have this monster soup around and it 's taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt 
 just for malaria itself 
 there are a million deaths a year 
 and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections  
 now it 's actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters you take a stain like acridine orange or a
  stain or giemsa and a microscope  and you look at them they all have faces 
 why is that so that alex in kenya  fatima in bangladesh navjoot in mumbai  and julie and mary in uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose
 why they are sick and that 's primarily because scalability of the diagnostics is completely out
  of reach  and remember that number one billion 
 the problem lies with the microscope itself 
 even though the pinnacle of modern science research microscopes are not designed for field testing neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all 
 they are heavy  bulky
  really hard to maintain  and cost a lot of money 
 this picture is mahatma gandhi in the ' 40s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing t b 
 in his ashram in sevagram in india 
 two of my students jim and james  
 traveled around india and thailand starting to think about this problem a lot we saw all kinds of donated equipment we saw fungus growing on microscope lenses and we saw people
  who had a functional microscope but just didn 't know how to even turn it on 
 what grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call foldscopes 
 so what is a foldscope a foldscope is a completely functional microscope a platform for fluorescence bright field polarization
  all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper 
 so now you think how is that possible i
 'm going to show you some examples here and we will run through some of them it starts with a single sheet of paper 
 what you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright field and fluorescence microscope  
  there are three stages there is the optical stage the illumination stage and the mask holding stage and there are micro optics at the bottom that 's actually embedded in the paper itself 
 what you do is you take it on and just like you are playing like a toy  which
 it is i tab it off  
 and i break it off this paper
 has no instructions and no languages there is a code a color code embedded that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope 
 when it 's done it looks something like this has all the functionalities of a standard microscope just like an xy stage 
 a place where a sample slide could go 
 for example right here we didn 't want to change this
  this is the standard that 's been optimized for over the years  and many health workers are actually used to this so this is what changes but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases 
 you pop this in 
 there is an xy stage 
 and then there is a focusing stage
  which is a flexure mechanism that 's built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps  
 so what 's really interesting about this object and my students hate when i do this but i 'm going to do this anyway is these are rugged devices i can turn it on
 and throw it on the floor
 and really try to stomp on it 
 and they last even though they 're designed from a very flexible material like paper  another fun fact is
  this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool 
 but here in this envelope i have thirty different foldscopes of different configurations all in a single folder  
 and i 'm going to pick one randomly this one it turns out is actually designed specifically for malaria because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria
  so the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this 
 so up till now you didn 't actually see what i would see from one of these setups  so what i would like to do is if we could dim the lights please it turns 
  out foldscopes are also projection microscopes i have these two microscopes that i 'm going to turn go to the back of the wall and just project and this way you will see
  what i would see what you 're looking at 
 this is a cross section of a compound eye  and when i 'm going to zoom in closer  right there i am going through the z axis you actually see how the lenses are cut together
 in the cross section pattern another example one of my favorite insects i love to hate this one is a mosquito and
  you 're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens right there 
 all from the simple setup that i actually described 
 so my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes
 by washing my clothes whenever i forget them in the dryer  so it turns out they
  right here is just fluorescent water  and i don 't know if you can actually see this this also shows you how the projection scope works you get to see the beam the way it 's projected and bent 
 can we get the lights back on again  
 so i 'm quickly going to show you since i 'm running out of time  in terms of how much it costs for us to
  allows us to do is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy which we call use and throw microscopy i 'm going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in here is 
  a sheet of paper this is when we were thinking about the idea this is an a4 sheet of paper these are the three stages that you actually see and the optical components if you look at the inset up on the
 we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs so it uses a process of self assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in 
  the paper itself  so that 's where the lenses go there are some light sources and essentially in the end all the parts line up because of origami because of the fact
  so even though this looks like a simple toy  the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated  
 so here is another obvious thing that we would do typically if i was going to show that these microscopes are robust is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself  
 there it is and it survives
  so for us the next step actually is really finishing our field trials we are starting at the end of the summer 
 we are at a stage where we 'll be making thousands of microscopes that would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place we
 've started collecting data for malaria  chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves 
 and i want to leave you with this picture i had not anticipated this before but a really interesting link between
  education and global health what are the tools that we 're actually providing
 the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow i would love for them to be able to just print out a foldscope and carry them around in their pockets  thank you
