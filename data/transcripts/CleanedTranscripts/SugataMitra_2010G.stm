  kind of an obvious statement up there i started with that sentence about twelve years ago  
 and i started in the context of developing countries  but you 're sitting here
  every corner of the world so if you think of a map of your country  i think you 'll realize
 that for every country on earth  you could draw little circles to say these are places where good teachers won 't go 
 on top of that  those are the places from where trouble comes  so we have an ironic problem
 good teachers don 't want to go to just those places where they 're
  to try and address this problem with an experiment  which was a very simple experiment in new delhi  i
 basically embedded a computer
 into a wall of a slum
 in new delhi
  the children barely went to school they didn 't know any english they 'd never seen a computer before  and they didn 't know what the internet was 
 i connected high speed internet to it it 's about three
  feet off the ground turned it on and left it there after this we noticed a couple of interesting things which you 'll see  but i repeated this
 all over india and then through a large part of the world
 and noticed that children will learn to do what they want to learn to do this is the first experiment that we did eight
 on your right
 teaching his student a six  year old girl  and he was teaching her how to browse  
 this boy here in the middle of central india
 this is in a rajasthan village  where the children recorded their own music
 and then played it back to each other and in the process they 've enjoyed themselves thoroughly  they did all of this
  in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time  in another south indian village these
 boys here had assembled a video camera and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee  they downloaded it from disney com or one of these websites  fourteen days after putting the computer in their
  so at the end of it we concluded
 that groups of children can learn to use computers and the internet on their own  irrespective of who or where
 they were at that point i became a little more ambitious
 and decided to see what else could children do with a computer we started off with an
  i gave a group of children they spoke english with a very strong telugu accent i gave them a computer with 
 interface which you now get free with windows 
 and asked them to speak into it so when they spoke into it  the computer typed out gibberish  
 so they said well it doesn 't understand anything of what we are saying so i said yeah i 'll leave it here for two
  two months later and this is now documented in the information technology for international development journal
  that accents had changed and were remarkably close to the neutral british accent in which i had trained the speech to text synthesizer in other words they were all speaking like james tooley 
 so they could do that on their own after that i started to experiment with various other things that they might learn to do on their own
  i got an interesting phone call once from columbo from the late arthur
  i want to see what 's going on 
 and he couldn 't travel so i went over there he said two interesting things a teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be 
 the second thing he said was that if children
 have interest then education happens and i was doing that in the field so every time i would watch it
  i took the experiment to south africa  this is a fifteen
  and they hop across the ocean this is in cambodia  rural cambodia
 a fairly silly arithmetic game
  which no child would play inside the classroom or at home they would you know throw it back at you they 'd say this is very boring if you leave it on the pavement
 and if all the adults go away then they will show off with each other about what
  do  this is what
 these children are doing they are trying to multiply i think 
 and all over india  at the end of about two years children were beginning to google their homework 
 as a result the teachers reported
 tremendous improvements in their english rapid improvement and all sorts of things
  so on and so forth 
 and indeed they had i mean if there 's stuff on google  why would you need to stuff it into your head  
 so at the end of the next four years  i decided that groups of children can navigate the internet to achieve educational objectives on their own
  a large amount of money had come into newcastle university
 to improve schooling in india  so newcastle gave me a call i said i 'll do it from delhi they said there 's no way you 're going to handle a million  pounds worth of
 university money
 sitting in delhi so in two thousand and six i bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to newcastle
  i wanted to test the limits of the system the first experiment i did out of newcastle
  was actually done in india and i set myself and impossible target can tamil speaking
 children in a south indian village
 teach themselves biotechnology in english on their own  and i thought i 'll test them they 'll get a zero
  come back and test them they get another zero i 'll go back and say yes  we need teachers for certain things 
 i called in twenty six children they all came in there and i told them that there 's some really difficult stuff on this computer i wouldn 't be surprised if you didn 't understand anything 
 it 's all in english  and
 i 'm going so
 i left them with it i came back after two
  how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing they said we look at it every day 
 so i said for two months you were looking at stuff you didn 't understand so a twelve  year old girl raises her hand and says  
  from the fact that improper replication of the dna molecule causes genetic disease we 've understood nothing else it
 took me three years to publish that it 's just been published in the british journal of educational technology one of the referees who refereed the paper said it 's too good to be
  true which was not very nice  well  one of the girls had taught herself to become the teacher  and then that 's her over there
 scores had gone up from zero to thirty percent which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances but thirty percent is not a pass  
 so i found that they had a friend a local accountant a young girl  and they played football with her 
 i asked that girl would you teach them enough biotechnology to pass and she said how would i do that i don 't know the subject i said no use the method of the grandmother 
 she said what 's that i said well what you 've got to do
 is stand behind them
 and admire them all the time
 just say to them ' that 's cool that 's fantastic what is that can you do that again can you show me some more ' she did that for two months  the scores went up to fifty  
 which is what the posh schools of new delhi with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting  
 so i came back to newcastle with these results
 and decided that
 there was something happening here that definitely was getting
  very serious 
 so having experimented in all sorts of remote places i came to the most remote place that i could think of
 five thousand miles from delhi is the little town of gateshead in gateshead i
  i said you make your own groups of four each group of four can use one computer and not four computers remember from the hole in the wall 
 you can exchange groups you can walk across to another group if you don 't like your group  etc  
 you can go to another group peer over their shoulders see what they 're doing come back to you own group and claim it as your own work
  what do you want us to do i gave them six gcse questions the first group the best one solved everything in twenty minutes
  let 's try it i 'll come back after two months we 'll give them a paper test no computers no talking to each other etc 
 the average score when i 'd done it with the computers and the groups was seventy six percent when i did the experiment when i did the test after two months  the score was
 seventy six percent there was photographic recall
 inside the children i suspect because they 're discussing with each other a single child in front of a single computer will not do that 
 i have further results which are almost unbelievable of scores which go up with time  
 because their teachers say that after the session is over the children continue to google further
 here in britain i
 put out a call for british grandmothers  after my kuppam experiment 
 well  you know they 're very vigorous people british grandmothers two hundred of them
 volunteered immediately 
 laughter the deal was that they would give me one hour of broadband time sitting in
  one day in a week  
 so they did that and over the last two years 
 over six hundred hours of instruction has happened over skype using what my students call the granny cloud the
 granny cloud sits over there i can beam them to whichever school i want to
  girl gets into the heart of
  hinduism in fifteen minutes  you know stuff which i don 't know anything about 
 two children watch a tedtalk they wanted to be footballers before after watching eight tedtalks 
 he wants to become leonardo da vinci
 this is what i 'm building now they 're called soles  self organized learning environments  
 the furniture is designed so that children can sit in front of big  powerful screens  big broadband connections 
 but in groups if they want they can call the granny cloud  this is a sole in newcastle the mediator is from pune india
  so how far can we go one last little bit and i 'll stop i went to turin in may  
 i sent all the teachers away from my group of ten  year old students 
 i speak only english they speak only italian  so we had no way to communicate  i started writing english questions on the blackboard 
 the children looked at it and said what i said  well do it they typed it into google translated it into italian went back into italian google
  later
 next question where is calcutta 
 this one they took only ten minutes 
 i tried a really hard one then who was
  pythagoras and what did he do 
 there was silence for a while then they said you 've spelled it wrong it 's pitagora 
 and then in twenty minutes the right angled triangles began to appear
  the screens this sent shivers up my spine  these are ten
  system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside 
 self organizing systems also always show emergence  which is that the system starts to do things which it was never designed for which is why you
  react the way you do because it looks impossible  i think
 i can make a guess now education is self organizing system where learning is an emergent phenomenon it
 'll take a few years to prove it experimentally  but i 'm going to try  but in the meanwhile  there is a method available 
 one billion children  we need one hundred million
  mediators there are many more than that on the planet
 ten million soles one hundred and eighty billion dollars and ten years  we could change everything thanks
