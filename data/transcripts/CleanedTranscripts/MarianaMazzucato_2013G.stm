  have you ever asked yourselves why it is that companies the really cool companies the innovative ones the creative new economy type companies
 apple  google facebook are coming out
 of one particular country  the united states of america  usually when i say this someone says
  that 's europe but yeah  it has not had the impact that these other companies have had 
 now what i do is i 'm an economist and i actually study the relationship between innovation and economic growth at the level of the company  the industry and the nation  and i work with policymakers 
  worldwide  especially in the european commission but recently also in interesting places like china
  and i can tell you that that question is on the tip
 of all of their tongues where are the european googles 
 what is the secret behind the silicon valley growth model  which they understand is different from this old economy growth model  
 and what is interesting is that often
  even if we 're in the 21st century we kind of come down in the end to these ideas of market versus state it 's talked about in these modern ways  but the idea is that somehow behind places like silicon
  valley the secret have been different types of market making mechanisms the private initiative 
 whether this be about a dynamic venture capital sector that 's actually able to provide that high risk finance to these innovative companies the gazelles as we often call them which 
  traditional banks are scared of  or different types of really successful commercialization policies which actually allow these companies to bring these great inventions
  products to the market and actually get over this really scary death valley period in which many companies instead fail  
 but what really interests me  especially nowadays and
 because of what 's happening politically around the world is the language that 's used  the narrative  the discourse the images the actual words so we often
  are presented
 with the kind of words like that the private sector is also much more innovative because it 's able to think out of the box  
 they are more dynamic think of steve jobs ' really inspirational speech to the two thousand and five graduating class at stanford where he said to be innovative you 've got
 to stay hungry stay foolish right so these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys right  
  it might be more equitable we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the u s but the problem is
 this damn public sector  it 's a bit too big and it hasn 't actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could 
 and even really respectable newspapers some
  actually subscribed to the words they use are you know the state as this leviathan  right this monster with big tentacles  
 they 're very explicit in these editorials they say 
 you know the state it 's necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution but you know what 
 what is the next big revolution going to be after the internet we all hope it might be something green or all of this nanotech stuff and in order for that stuff to happen
 this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution they say the state just stick to the basics right fund the infrastructure fund the schools 
 even fund the basic research because this is popularly recognized in fact as a big public good which private companies don 't want to invest in do that but you know what  leave the rest to the revolutionaries those
  kind of thinkers  they 're often called garage tinkerers because some of them actually did some things in garages even though that 's
 partly a myth
  and so what i want to do with you in oh god only ten minutes is to really think again this juxtaposition 
 because it actually has massive massive implications beyond innovation policy which just happens to be the
 the area that i often
 talk with with policymakers it has huge implications even with this whole notion that we have on where
 when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending
 and different types of public services which of course as we know are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition right i mean the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in 
  order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum
  so these kind of words are constantly these juxtapositions come up everywhere not just with innovation policy
  and so to think again there 's no reason that you should believe me so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on but you might want to take it out your iphone  
 who actually funded the really cool revolutionary
  things in the iphone  
 what actually makes your phone a smartphone basically instead of a stupid phone so the internet which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world  
 gps where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world  the touchscreen display which makes it also a really easy to use phone for anybody these are the very smart revolutionary bits about the iphone  
 and they 're all
 and the point is
  the internet was funded by darpa u s department of defense gps was funded by the military 's
 navstar program  even siri was actually funded by darpa  the touchscreen display was funded by two public
 grants by the cia and the nsf to two
 public university researchers at the university of delaware  now you might be thinking well she 's just said the word ' defense ' and ' military
  really interesting is that this is actually true in sector after sector and department after department so the pharmaceutical industry which i am personally very interested in because i 've actually had the fortune to study it  in quite some depth 
 is wonderful to be asking this question about the revolutionary versus non revolutionary bits 
 because each and every medicine can actually be divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental  so the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs
  variations of existing drugs viagra different color different dosage are the less revolutionary ones  and it turns out that a full seventy five percent
 of the new molecular entities with priority rating are actually funded in boring
  kafka ian public sector labs 
 this doesn 't mean that big pharma is not spending on innovation they do  they spend on the marketing part they spend on the d part of r & d they spend an awful lot
  on buying back their stock which is
 quite problematic in fact companies like pfizer and amgen recently have spent more money in buying back their shares to boost their stock price than on r  & d but that 's a whole different ted talk which one day i 'd be fascinated to tell you about
 now what 's interesting in all of this is the state in all these examples was doing so much more than just fixing market failures  it was actually shaping
 and creating markets  it was funding not only the basic research  which again is a typical public good 
 but even the applied research  it was even god forbid being a venture capitalist so
  increasingly important why because as many of us know  v c is actually quite short term they want their returns in three to five years innovation takes a much longer time than that fifteen to twenty years  
 and so this whole notion i mean this is the point right  who 's actually funding the hard stuff of course it 's not just the state the private sector does a lot but the narrative that we 've always been told is the state is important for the basics
  not really providing that sort of high risk revolutionary thinking out of the box in all these sectors from funding the internet to doing
 the spending but also the envisioning the strategic vision for these investments it was actually coming within the state  the nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating to study this  because the word itself nanotechnology came from within
  and so there 's huge implications of this first of all of course i 'm not someone this old fashioned person market versus state what we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public private partnerships
 but the point is by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually pffff
 a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of leviathan i think we 've actually really
  really stunted the possibility to build these public private partnerships in a really dynamic way  even the words that we often use to justify the p part the public part well they 're both p 's
 with public private partnerships is in terms of de risking what the public sector did in all these examples i just gave you  and there 's many more which
 myself and other colleagues have been looking at is doing much more than de risking it 's kind of been taking on that risk bring it
  actually been the one thinking out of the box
 but also i 'm sure you all have had experience with local regional national governments and you 're kind of like you know what that kafka ian bureaucrat i 've met him 
 that whole juxtaposition thing it 's kind of there well there 's a self fulfilling prophecy by talking about the state as kind of irrelevant boring
  it 's sometimes that we actually create those organizations in that way so what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations darpa that funded the internet and siri
  actually thought really hard about this how to welcome failure  because you will fail  you will fail when you innovative one out of ten experiments has any
 success  and the v c guys know this  and they 're able to actually fund the other losses from that one success and this brings me actually probably to the biggest
 implication  and this has huge
  if the state is more than just a market fixer  if it actually is a market shaper  and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk 
 what happened to the reward  we all know if you 've ever taken a finance course the first thing you 're taught is sort of the risk reward relationship and so some people are foolish enough or probably smart 
  enough if they have time to wait to actually invest in stocks because they 're higher risk which over time will make a greater reward than bonds that whole risk reward thing well where 's the reward
  for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the internet the internet was crazy 
 it really was i mean the probability of failure was massive you had to be completely nuts to do it and luckily they were  
 now we don 't even get to this question about rewards unless you actually depict the state as this
  and the problem is that economists often think well there is a reward back to the state it 's tax you know
 the companies will pay tax the jobs they create will create growth so people who
 get those jobs and their incomes rise will
 will come back to the state through the tax mechanism well unfortunately that 's not true okay
 it 's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad  globalization and that 's fine we shouldn 't be nationalistic let the jobs go where they have to go perhaps i mean one can take a position on that
 but also these companies
 that have actually had this massive benefit from the state apple 's a great example they even got the first well not the first but five hundred thousand
 dollars actually went to apple the company  through this sbic program  which predated the sbir program  as well as as i said before all the technologies
  and yet we know they legally as many other companies pay very little tax back so what we really need to actually rethink
 is should there perhaps be
  mechanism that 's much more direct than tax why not it could happen perhaps through equity 
 this  by the way in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically countries like finland in scandinavia but also in china and brazil they 're retaining equity in these
 sitra funded nokia  kept equity made a lot of money it 's a public funding agency in  in finland which then funded the next round of nokias 
 the brazilian development bank which is
 providing huge amounts of funds today to clean technology they just announced  a $ fifty six billion
 program for the
 future on this is retaining equity
 in these investments  so to put it provocatively had the u s government
 thought about this  and maybe just brought back just something called an innovation fund 
 you can bet that you know if even just 05 percent of the profits from what the internet produced had come back to that innovation fund there would be so much more money to spend today on green technology 
  instead many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained
  perhaps even more important we heard before about the one percent the ninety nine percent 
 if the state is thought about in this more strategic way as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism because that 's what we 're talking about right  who are the different players in creating value in the economy 
 and is the state 's role has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat
  if we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back it might just be that in the next round  and i hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green 
 that that period of growth will not only be smart innovation led not only green  but also more inclusive  
 so that the public schools in places like silicon valley can actually also benefit from that growth  because they have not thank you
