  fifteen years ago i went to visit a friend in hong kong and
 at the time i was very superstitious so upon landing this was still at the old hong kong airport that 's kai tak
  in the middle of the city
 i thought if i see something good  i 'm going to have a great time here in my two weeks 
 and if i see something negative i 'm going to be miserable indeed 
 so the plane landed in between the buildings
 and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard
 i actually went to see some of the design companies in hong kong in my stay there  and it turned out that
 i just went to see you know what they are doing in hong kong but
 i actually walked away with a great job offer  and i flew back to austria  packed my
  week later i was again on my way to hong kong
 still superstitions
 and thinking well if that ' winner ' billboard is still up i 'm going to have a good time working here laughter
 but if it 's gone it 's going to be really miserable and stressful 
 so it turned out that not only was the billboard still up
 but they had put this one right next to it
  on the other hand it also taught me where superstition gets me because i really had a terrible time in hong kong 
 laughter however i did have
 a number of real moments of happiness in my life
  i think what the conference brochure
 refers to as moments that
 take your breath away and since i 'm a big list maker i actually
 listed them all 
 now you don 't have to go through the trouble of reading them and i won 't read them for you 
 i know that it 's incredibly boring to hear about other people 's happinesses
 is i actually looked at them
 from a design standpoint and
 just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design 
 and very surprisingly over half of them had actually something to do with design
  two different possibilities there 's one from a consumer 's point of view where i was happy while experiencing design and i 'll just give you one example 
 i had gotten my first walkman this is one thousand nine hundred and eighty three 
 my brother had this great yamaha
 motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely  and the police 's synchronicity cassette had just been
  and there was no helmet law in my hometown of bregenz so you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting the police on the new sony walkman 
 and
 i remember it as a true
 moment of happiness you know of course they are related to this combination
 of at least two of them being  you know design objects 
  there 's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be you know  situated somewhere here right
 in there between delight and bliss now there is the
 other
 part from a designer 's standpoint if you 're happy while actually doing it and
 one way to see how happy designers are when they 're designing could be to look at
  the authors ' photos on the back of their monographs so according to this the australians and the japanese
 as well as the mexicans are very happy
  a museum opened in tokyo called the mori museum in a skyscraper up on the 56th floor and their inaugural exhibit
  with an eye on this conference and they interestingly
 sectioned the exhibit off into four different
 areas  under arcadia they showed things like this from the edo period a hundred ways to write happiness in
  or they had this apple by yoko ono that of course later on was  you know  made into the label for the beatles  
 under nirvana they showed this constable painting 
 and there was a little an interesting theory about abstraction this is a
 blue field it 's actually an yves klein painting  and the theory was that
  they showed these shunsho paintings also from the edo period ink on silk
  now what i took away from the exhibit was that
 maybe with the exception of the mandala
 most of the
 pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness 
 and i felt a little bit cheated because the visualization that 's a really
  my studio
 we 've done it all the time this is you know  
 a book a happy dog and you take it out it 's an aggressive dog it 's a happy david byrne and an angry david byrne 
 or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face you know that 's not a big deal
 to accomplish
  gotten to the point where  you know  within advertising or within the movie industry happy has gotten such a bad
 reputation that if you actually
 want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic you almost would have to  you know  
 do it from a cynical point of view this is you
 know the movie poster 
  a couple of weeks ago  designed a box set for the talking heads where the happiness
 visualized on the cover definitely has very much a dark side to it much 
 much more difficult is this where the designs actually can
 evoke happiness and i 'm going to just show you three that actually did this for
  me this is a campaign
 done by a a young artist in new york who calls himself true everybody who has ridden the new york subway system will be familiar
 with these signs  true
 printed his own version of these signs  met every wednesday
  at a subway stop with twenty of his friends they divided up the different subway lines and added their own version so
 this is one 
 now the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs so you 're 
  you 're really bored in the subway and you kind of stare at something and it takes you a while until it actually you realize that this says something different than what it normally says laughter
 i
 mean that 's at least how it made me happy
  real humanitarian he didn 't want any of his friends to be arrested so he
 supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card 
 and also gave this fake letter from the mta to everybody sort of like pretending that it 's an art project financed by the
  another new york project  this is at p s one a sculpture that 's basically a square room by james turrell that has a retractable
 ceiling opens up
 at dusk and dawn every day  you don 't see the horizon you 're just in there  
 watching the incredible  subtle changes of color in the sky  
 and
 the room is truly
 something to be seen
  people 's demeanor changes when they go in there and for sure i haven 't looked
 at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there 
 there are of course more than those three projects that i 'm showing here  i would definitely say that observing
  a couple of years ago in manhattan
 for sure made me happy as well  but my last project is again from a young designer in new york he 's from korea originally  
 and he took it upon himself to print
 fifty five thousand
 speech bubbles empty speech bubbles stickers large ones and small ones and he goes around new york and just puts them empty as they are on posters
 go and fill them in 
 this one says please let me die in peace 
 i think that was was
 the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good  this is on a musician poster that says
  am concerned that my cd will not sell more than two hundred thousand units and that as a result my recoupable advance from my label will be taken from me 
 after which my contract will be cancelled and i 'll be back doing journey covers on bleecker street
  i think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins  jee gets to have his project the public gets a
 sweeter environment and different public gets a place to express
  the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads 
 well there was a question of course  that was on my mind for a while
  you know  can i do more of the things that i like doing in design and less of the ones
 that i don 't like to
  which brought me back to my list making you know  just to see what i actually like about my job
 you know one is 
 just working without pressure then working concentrated without being frazzled or as nancy said before like really immerse
 oneself into it
  try not to get stuck
 doing the same thing or try not get stuck behind the computer all day  this is you know related to it  getting out of the studio 
 then of course  trying to  you know work on things where the content is actually important for me and
 being able to enjoy the end results  and
 then i found another list in one of my diaries
  that actually contained all the things that i thought i learned in my life so far and 
 just about at that time an austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine  
 and
 the whole thing just fell together  so i just picked one of the
  things
 that i thought i learned in this case everything i do always comes back to me and we made these spreads right out of this so
 company asked us to design five billboards for them again we could supply the content for it 
 so i just picked another one and this was two weeks ago we flew to arizona
 the designer who works with me and myself and photographed this one so
  we did one more of these  this is again for a magazine dividing pages 
 this is having this is the same thing it 's just you know photographed from the side  this is from the front then it 's guts again
  it 's the same thing guts is just the same room reworked  then it 's
