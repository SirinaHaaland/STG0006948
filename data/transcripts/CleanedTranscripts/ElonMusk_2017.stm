  in the next half hour or so we 're going to spend some time exploring your vision
 for what an exciting future might look like  which i guess makes the first question a little ironic  why are you boring em yeah i
 ask myself that frequently
 we 're trying to dig a hole
 under la and this is to create the beginning of what will hopefully be a 3d network of
  things is traffic 
 it affects people in every part of the world
  it takes away so much of your life it 's horrible it 's particularly horrible in 
 i think you 've brought with you the first
  visualization that 's been shown of this can i show this em yeah absolutely so this is the first time
 just to show what we 're talking about so a couple of key things that are important in
 having
 a 3d tunnel network first of all you have to be able to integrate the entrance and exit of the tunnel seamlessly into the fabric of the city so
 by having an elevator sort of a car
  you can integrate the entrance and exits
 to the tunnel network just by using two parking spaces  and then the car gets on a skate there 's no speed limit here so
 we 're designing this to be able to operate at two hundred kilometers an hour 
 two hundred kilometers an hour or about one hundred and thirty miles per hour  so you should be able to get from say
 lax in six minutes five six minutes 
 ca so possibly initially done it 's like on a sort of toll 
 which i guess alleviates some traffic from the surface streets as well 
 em so i don 't know if people noticed it in the video but there 's no real limit to how many levels of of tunnel you can have 
  much further deep than you can go up the deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings are tall  so you can alleviate any
 arbitrary level of urban congestion
 with with a 3d tunnel network this is a very important point so a key rebuttal to the tunnels is that if you add
 one layer
  that will simply alleviate congestion it will get used up 
 and then you 'll be back where you started back with congestion but you can go to any arbitrary number of tunnels any number of levels ca but people
 seen traditionally it 's incredibly expensive to dig and that would block this idea em 
 yeah well  they 're right to give you an example the la subway extension which is
 i think it 's a
  mile extension that was just completed for two billion dollars so it 's roughly a billion dollars a mile to do the the subway extension in la
 and this is not the highest utility subway in the world
  so
 yeah it 's quite difficult to dig tunnels normally  i think we need to have at least
 a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling ca and how could you
  if you just do two things  you can get to approximately an order of magnitude improvement
 and i think you can go beyond that  so the the first thing to do is to cut the tunnel diameter
 by a factor of two or more so a single road lane tunnel according to
 regulations has to be twenty six feet maybe twenty eight feet in diameter to allow for crashes and emergency vehicles
 and sufficient ventilation for combustion
  engine cars  but  if you shrink that diameter to what we 're attempting which is twelve feet which is plenty to get an electric skate through you drop the
 the diameter by a factor of two and the cross sectional area by by a factor of four 
 and the tunneling cost scales with the cross sectional area  so that 's roughly a half order of magnitude
  then tunneling machines
 currently
 tunnel for half the time  then they stop  and then
 the rest of the time is putting in reinforcements for the tunnel wall 
 so if you design the machine instead to do continuous tunneling and reinforcing that will give you a factor of two improvement  combine that and that 's a factor of eight
 also these machines are far from
 being at their their power or thermal limits  so you can jack up the power to the machine substantially  i think you can get at least a factor of two
  maybe a factor of
 four or five improvement on on top of that so i think
 there 's a fairly straightforward series of steps to get somewhere in excess of an order of magnitude improvement in the cost per mile 
 and
 our target actually is we 've got a pet snail called gary this is from gary
  is capable of currently he 's capable of going fourteen times faster than
  beating the snail ca 
 but a lot of people imagining dreaming about future cities they imagine that actually the solution is flying cars drones etc you go aboveground
  why isn 't that a better solution you save all that tunneling cost em 
 right  i 'm in favor of flying things obviously i do rockets  so i like
  things that fly this is not some inherent bias against flying things  but
 there is a challenge with flying cars in that they 'll be quite noisy  the wind force generated will be very high
  just say that if something 's flying over your head  a whole bunch of flying cars going all over the place that is not an
  you don 't think to yourself well i feel better about
 today you 're thinking did they service their hubcap or is it going to come off and guillotine me
  these tunnels to use for this hyperloop idea you released a few years ago em yeah  so
 we 've been sort of puttering around with the hyperloop stuff for
 a while  we built a  hyperloop test track adjacent to spacex just for a student competition to encourage innovative ideas in transport and
  quite fun to do that but it was kind of a hobby thing  and then
 we we think we might so we 've built a little pusher car to push  the student pods
  going to try seeing how fast we can make the the pusher go if it 's not pushing something 
 so  we 're cautiously optimistic we 'll be able to be faster than
  the world 's fastest bullet train even
  and looking at tunneling technology it turns out that in order to make a tunnel you have to
 in order to seal against the water table  you 've got to typically design a tunnel wall to be good to about five or six
  to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere or near vacuum so
 actually it sort of turns out that automatically if you build a tunnel that is good enough to resist the water table it is automatically capable of holding vacuum
  you could dig as much as you want  i think if you were to do something like
 a dc to new york
  hyperloop i think you 'd probably want to go underground the entire way because it 's a high density area you 're going
 under a lot of buildings and houses
  's going to be pretty annoying to have a tunnel dug under my house like if that tunnel is dug more than about three or four tunnel diameters beneath your house you will not be able to detect it being dug at all 
 in fact if you 're able to detect the tunnel
 being being dug whatever device you are using you can get a lot of money for that device from the israeli military who is trying to
  detect tunnels from hamas  and from the us
 customs and border patrol that try and detect drug tunnels so the reality is that
 earth is incredibly good at absorbing vibrations  and once the tunnel depth is below a certain level it is undetectable maybe if you have a very sensitive seismic instrument you might be able to detect it
  've started a new company to do this called the boring company very nice very funny
  it 's kind of puttering along but it 's making good progress so ca so an even bigger part of your time is being spent on
  cars and transport through tesla is one of the motivations for the tunneling project the realization that
 actually in a world where cars are electric and where they 
 there may end up being more cars on the roads on any given hour than there are now
  will alleviate congestion  and to some degree that will be true  but
 once you have shared autonomy where it 's much cheaper to go by car and you can go point to point  the affordability of
 of going in a car will be better than that of a bus like it will cost less than a bus ticket
 so
 the amount of driving that will occur will be much greater with shared autonomy and actually
  traffic will get far worse ca you started tesla with the goal of of persuading the world
  was the future of cars and a few years ago people were laughing at you now not so much
  i think almost every automaker has some electric vehicle program 
 they vary in seriousness some are very serious about transitioning entirely to electric and some are just
  the world electrify and you go on and focus on other stuff em 
 yeah
 i intend to stay with tesla as as far into the future as i can imagine
  it 's looking quite good for starting production in july ca wow  one of the things that people are so excited about is is the fact that it it
 's got autopilot
 and you put out this video a while back showing what that
 what that technology would look like em yeah there 's obviously
 autopilot in model s right now what are we seeing here em yeah so this is
 using only cameras and gps so there 's no lidar or radar being used here  this is just using passive optical which is
  what a person uses  the whole road system is meant to be navigated with
 passive optical or cameras and so
 once you solve cameras
 or vision
  then autonomy is solved  if you don 't solve vision it 's not solved  so that that 's why our focus is so heavily on
 having
 a vision neural
  net that 's very effective for road conditions ca right many other people are going the lidar route  you want cameras plus radar is is most of it em 
 you can absolutely be superhuman with just cameras 
 like you can probably do it ten times better than humans would just cameras ca so the new cars being sold right now have
 eight cameras
  by the end of the year you 're saying someone 's going to sit in a tesla without
  won 't ever have to touch the wheel by the end of two thousand and seventeen em yeah essentially november
 or december of this year  we should be able to go all the way from a parking lot in california to a parking lot in new york  
 no controls touched at any point during the entire journey
 teslas driving all these roads you 're accumulating a huge amount of data of that national road system em 
 yes but the thing that will be interesting is that
 i 'm actually fairly confident it will be able to do that route
 even if you change
  it 's fairly easy
 if you say i 'm going to be really good at one specific route  that 's one thing but
 it should be able to go really be very good certainly once you enter a highway to go anywhere on the highway system
 in a given country  so it 's not sort of limited to  la to new york we could change it and make it
 la to new york now go from la to toronto 
 ca so leaving aside regulation for a second in terms of the technology alone
 the time when someone will be able to buy one of your cars and literally just
 take the hands off the wheel and go to sleep and wake up and find that they 've arrived how far away is that to do that
 so the real trick of it is not
 how do you make it work say ninety nine point nine percent of the time  because 
 like if a car crashes one in a thousand times  then you 're probably still not going to be comfortable falling asleep
  no system is going to be perfect  but if you say it 's perhaps
 the car is unlikely to crash in a hundred lifetimes or a thousand lifetimes  
 then people are like ok wow  
 if i were to live a thousand lives  i would
 still most likely never experience a crash then that 's probably ok ca to sleep
  i guess the big concern of yours is that people may actually get seduced too early to think that this is safe  and that you 'll have some horrible incident happen that
 puts things back em well i think that the autonomy system is likely to at least mitigate the crash  
 except in rare circumstances 
 the thing to appreciate about
 vehicle safety is this is this is probabilistic
  there 's some chance that any time a human driver gets in a car that they will have an accident that is their fault
  it 's never zero  so really the key threshold for autonomy is
 how much better does autonomy need to be
 than a person before you can rely on it ca but once you get literally safe hands off driving
 the power to disrupt the whole industry seems massive because at that point you 've spoken of people being able to buy a car
 drops you off at work and then you let it go and and
 provide a sort of  uber like service to other people earn you money maybe even cover the cost of your lease of that car so you can kind of get a car for free is that really likely em 
 yeah absolutely this is what will happen so there will be a shared autonomy fleet where you buy your car and you can choose to use that car exclusively
  you could choose to
  have it be used only by friends and family  only by other drivers who are rated five star  you can choose to
 share it sometimes but not other times
   that 's one hundred percent what will occur  it 's just a question of when ca
 wow so
 you mentioned the semi and i think
 i 'm curious whether there 's anything you could show us today em i will show you a teaser shot of the
  neighborhood truck it looks kind of badass what sort of
  do not today think is possible they think the truck doesn 't have enough power or it doesn 't have enough range  and then with the tesla semi
 we want to show that no an electric
 truck actually can
  these are going to be trucks that truck drivers want to drive em yes so what will be really fun about this is
  a flat torque rpm curve with an electric motor whereas with a diesel motor or any kind of internal combustion engine car you 've got
 a torque rpm curve that looks like a hill   so this will be a very spry truck  you can drive this around like a sports car 
 there 's no gears it 's like single speed  ca there 's a great movie to be made here somewhere i don 't know what it is and i don 't know that it ends well but it 's a great
  when i was driving the
 the test prototype for the first truck it 's really weird because you 're driving around and you 're just so nimble  
 and you 're in this giant truck ca wait you 've already driven a
 prototype
  kind of less badass picture 
 this is just a cute house from desperate housewives or something 
 what on earth is going on here em well  this illustrates the picture of the future that i think
 is how how things will evolve you 've got an electric car in the driveway  if you look in between the electric car and the house
  stacked up against the side of the house  and then that that house roof is is a solar roof so that 's an actual solar glass roof
 you can adjust the texture and the color to a very fine grained level  and then there 's sort of 
 in the glass such that when you 're looking at the roof from street level or close to street level all the tiles look the
 so you have an even
 even color from from
 the ground level  if you were to look at it from a helicopter you would be actually able to look through and see that some of the the glass tiles
 have a solar cell behind them and some do not you can 't tell from street level ca you put them in the ones that are likely to see a lot of sun
  we 're very confident that the cost of the roof
 plus the cost of electricity
 a solar glass roof will be less than the cost of a normal roof plus the the cost of electricity so in other words this will be
 economically a
 we thought about having the warranty be infinity  but then people thought well that might sound like were just talking rubbish but actually
  're starting off with two  two initially and the second two will be introduced early next year ca and what 's the scale of ambition here 
 how many houses do you believe could end up having this this type of roofing em
  i think eventually almost all houses will have a solar roof the thing is to consider the time scale here to be
 probably on the order of
 forty or fifty years
 so on average a roof is replaced every twenty to twenty five years   but
 you don 't start replacing all roofs immediately but eventually  if you say were to
  to
 say fifteen years from now it will be unusual to have a roof that does not have solar ca 
 is there a mental model thing that people don 't get here that  that because of the shift in the cost the economics of solar power
 most houses actually have enough sunlight on their roof pretty much to power
 all of their needs if you could capture the power it could pretty much power all their needs
 on where you are and what the house size is relative to the roof area  but it 's a fair statement to say that most houses
 in the us have enough roof area to power all the needs of the house
 falling price of lithium ion batteries  which you 've made a huge bet on as as tesla in many ways that 's almost the core competency and
 you 've decided that to really like  own that
 competency  you just have to build the world 's largest manufacturing plant to double the world 's supply
  you can sort of roughly see that there 's sort of a diamond shape
 overall and when it 's fully done it 'll look like a giant diamond or that 's the idea behind it and it 's aligned on true north it 's a small detail ca 
  one of your core ideas elon about what makes an exciting future is a future where we no longer feel guilty about energy
  you can picture what it would take to move the world off this vast fossil fuel thing it 's like you 're building one it costs five billion dollars 
 or whatever five to ten billion dollars  like it 's kind of cool that you can picture that that project
  announce locations for somewhere between two and four gigafactories later this year
  to ask you one question about politics only one i 'm kind of sick of politics but i do want to ask you this
 on
 a body now giving advice to a guy em who ca who has said he doesn 't really believe in climate change 
 and there 's a lot of people out there who think you shouldn 't be doing that they 'd like you to walk away from that  what would you say to them
  format consists of going around the room and asking people 's opinion on things  and
 so there 's like a meeting every month or two that 's the sum total of
  the degree that there are people in the room who are arguing in favor of doing something about climate change
  the meetings i 've had thus far to argue in favor of immigration and in favor of climate change and if i hadn 't done
 that that wasn 't on the agenda before so maybe nothing will happen but at least the words
  let 's talk spacex and mars last time you were here  you spoke about  what seemed like a kind of incredibly ambitious dream to
 develop rockets that were actually reusable  and you 've only gone and done it
 very high very high and fast in space so just delivered the the upper stage
 at at high velocity i think this might have been at sort of mach seven or so delivery of the of the upper stage
  that 's amazing  and several of these failed before you finally figured out how to
  to appreciate that reusability is only relevant if it is rapid
 rapid and complete  so like an aircraft or a car
  the reusability is rapid and complete you do not send your aircraft
  and you 've designed this outrageous rocket to do it  help us understand the scale of this thing em well visually you can see that 's a
  the thrust level of this is really
 this configuration is about four times the thrust of the saturn v moon rocket
  for every ten million pounds of thrust there 's forty 747s 
  with a machine designed to escape earth 's gravity  i think you told me last time this thing could actually take a fully loaded seven
  recently this interplanetary transport system which is visualized this way this is a scene you picture
  vehicle seems quite large and is large by comparison with other rockets  i think the future spacecraft will make this look
  do we need to build a city on mars with a million people on it
 in your lifetime which i think is kind of what you 've said you 'd love to do  em i think it 's important to have
  be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live 
 like why do you want to live what 's the point what inspires you what do you love about the future 
 and if we 're not out there if the future does not include being out there among the stars
 and being a multiplanet species i find that it 's incredibly depressing if that 's
  want to position this as an either or that there are so many desperate things happening on the planet now from climate to poverty to you know you pick your issue
  and this this feels like a distraction you shouldn 't be thinking about this you should be solving what 's what 's here and now and to be fair you 've done a fair old bit to actually do that with with your
 work work on sustainable energy
 why not just do that 
 em i think there 's
 i look at the future from the standpoint of of
 probabilities it 's like a branching stream of probabilities  and there are actions that we can take that affect
 those probabilities
  or that accelerate one thing or slow down another thing i may introduce something new to the probability stream 
 sustainable energy will happen no matter what if there was no tesla if tesla never never existed it would have to happen
 out of necessity it 's tautological
  if you don 't have sustainable energy it means you have unsustainable energy eventually you will run out and the the laws of economics will drive
 will drive civilization towards sustainable energy  inevitably 
 the fundamental value of a company like tesla is the degree to which it it accelerates the advent of sustainable energy  faster than it would otherwise occur
  if it accelerated that by a decade potentially more than a decade  that would be quite a good thing to occur  that 's what i consider to be the
