  i was informed by this kind of unoriginal and trite idea that new technologies were an opportunity for social transformation which is what drove me then 
 and still it 's a delusion that drives me now
  i wanted to update what i 've been doing since then but it 's still the same theme song
 and introduce you to my lab and current work which is the
 environmental health clinic that i run at nyu 
 and what it is it 's a twist on health because really what i 'm trying to do now is redefine what counts as health it 's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university  
 except people come to the clinic with environmental health concerns and they walk out with prescriptions for things they can do to improve
  environmental health as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals 
 it 's a handy dandy quote from hippocrates of the hippocratic oath that says the greater part of the soul lays outside the body treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer but that suggests the the issue that i 'm trying to get at here that we have an
  opportunity to redefine what is health because this idea that health is internal and atomized and individual and
 pharmaceutical is
 largely an error and i would use this study a recent study by philip landrigan 
 to motivate a different view of health where he went to most of the pediatricians in manhattan and the new york area
 and logged what they spent their patient hours on eighty to ninety percent of their time was spent on five things
  one was asthma  number two was developmental delays  number three was
 400 fold increases in rare childhood cancers in the last eight to ten fifteen years
 number four and five were childhood obesity and  diabetes related issues  so all of those what 's common about all of those  
  the environment is implicated radically implicated right this is not the germs
 that medicos were trained to deal with this is a different definition of health health that has a great advantage
 because it 's external  it 's shared  we can do something about it as opposed to internal genetically predetermined
 or individualized people who come to the clinic are called
  because they 're too impatient to wait for legislative change to address
 local and environmental health issues  
 and i meet them at the university i also have a few field offices that i set up in various places that provide an immersion in some of the environmental challenges we face i like this one from the belgian field office  
 where we met in a roundabout precisely because the roundabout iconified the headless social movement
 that informs much social transformation as opposed to the
  top down control of red light traffic
 intersections in this case of course the roundabout with that micro decisions being made in situ by people not being told what to do 
 but of course affords greater throughput fewer accidents  
 and an an interesting model of social movement 
 some of the things that
  the monitoring protocols have developed this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol or keeping tabs 
 if you will what they are is an addition of tadpoles that are named after a local bureaucrat whose decisions affect your water quality so
 an impatient concerned for water quality would raise a tadpole bureaucrat in a sample of water  in which they 're interested
 and we give them a couple of things to do that to help them do companion animal devices while they 're blogging and doing their email  this is a
  tadpole walker to take your tadpole walking in the evening 
 and the interesting thing that happens because we 're using tadpoles of course  because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have several orders of magnitude more sensitive
 than
 some of our senses for
 for sensing  responding in a biologically meaningful way to that whole class of industrial contaminants we call endocrine disruptors or hormone
  emulators  but by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening there 's a few action shots
 your neighbors are likely to say what are you doing and then you have to introduce your tadpole and
 who it 's named after you have to explain what you 're doing and how the developmental events of a tadpole are of course very
  next time your neighbor sees you they 'll say how is that tadpole doing and you can let them social network with your tadpole because
 the environmental health clinic has a social networking site for not only impatients
  humans but non humans social networking for humans and non humans and of course
  these endocrine disruptors are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic the obesity epidemic  
 the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls and other related things the culmination of this is if you 've successfully raised your tadpole observing the behavioral and developmental
 events you will then go and introduce your tadpole to its namesake and discuss the evidence that you 've
 seen another quick protocol and i 'm going to go through these quickly but just to give you the material sense of
  what we 're doing here instead of asking you for urine samples i
 'll ask you for a mouse sample anyone here lucky enough to share to cohabit with a mouse a domestic partnership with mice 
 very lucky
 mice of course are the
 quintessential model organism  they 're even better models of environmental health because not only the same mammalian biology but
 they share your diet largely they share
  share your environmental stressors the
 asbestos levels and lead levels whatever you 're exposed to and they 're geographically more limited than you are because we don 't know if you 've been exposed to
 persistent organic pollutants in your home or
 occupationally or as a child mice are a very good representation so it starts by building
 a better mousetrap of course this is one of them  coping with environmental stressors is tricky
  is anybody here on antidepressants 
 there 's a lot of people in manhattan are and we were testing if the mice would also 
 so this was prozac this was zoloft this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant all of which were the medications that the
  how did you know that  they did this was vodka and solution gin and solution  this guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant
  water which was interesting then of course it goes into the entrapment device there 's an old cellphone in there a good use for old cellphones which dials the clinic we go and pick up the mouse 
 we take the
 blood sample and do the blood work and hair work on the mice  and i want to sort of point out the big advantage of framing health in this external way  but we do have a few prescription
  different from the medical model anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality or to understand it or to change it
  the benefits are enjoyed by anyone you share that water quality or air quality with and that aggregating effect
 that collective action effect is actually something we can use to our advantage so i want to show you one prescription product in the clinic
 called the no park  this is a prescription to
  improve water quality  many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality what we do is we take a fire hydrant a no parking space associated with a fire hydrant  and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt to create an engineered micro landscape 
 to create an infiltration opportunity  because many of you will know that the biggest pollution burden that we have on the new york new jersey harbor right now is no longer the point sources
 polluters no longer the ges but that massive network of roads [ those ] impervious surfaces that collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners or the oily 
  hydrocarbon waste in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure washes it straight into the estuary system that
  produced by impatients on various city blocks
 in some very interesting ways i just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though there 's about two or three fire hydrants
 on every city block by
 creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them we don 't prevent them from being used as emergency vehicle parking spaces because of course a firetruck can come and park there they flatten a few plants no big deal
 but if we did this in every single every fire hydrant
 we could redefine the emergency that 
  percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there it 's infiltrating pollutants  it 's also increasing
  these smaller interceptions could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution that now runs into the estuary system up to a seven inch rain event up to a hundred year storm  
 so these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect
 to improve local environmental health this is one of the more ambitious ones
  what the climate crisis has revealed to us
 is a secondary more insidious and more pervasive crisis which is the crisis of agency  which is
 what to do somehow buying a local lettuce changing a light bulb  
 driving the speed limit  changing your tires regularly doesn 't seem sufficient in the face of
 climate crisis and this is an interesting icon that happened you remember these fallout shelters
  fallout shelter for the climate crisis  
 this was civic mobilization churches school groups hospitals  private residents everyone built one of these in a matter of months  
 and they still remain as icons of civic response in the face of shared uncertain collective threat  fallout shelter for the climate crisis i would say looks something like this 
 or this which is an intensive urban agriculture facility
 that 's due to go on my lab building at nyu what it does is a very simple idea of taking eighty to ninety percent of the co2 produced in manhattan is building related
 we take just like a commercial greenhouse we take the co2 from the building
 co2 enriched air we force it through the urban agriculture facility and then we resupply
 you can 't actually build much on a roof they 're not designed for that so it 's on legs  
 so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns 
 it 's built as a barn raising using open source hardware  this is the  quarter scale prototype that was functioning in spain this is what it will look like fingers crossed
 nyu willing  and what i want to show you is actually this is one of the components of it that we 've just recently been testing
  which is a solar chimney we have got seventeen of them now put around new york at the moment that passively draws air up you understand a solar chimney  hot air rises you put a bit of black 
  plastic on the side of a building it 'll heat up and you 'll get passive airflow what we do is actually put
  ozone is responsible for about half of global warming 's effects because it changes it settles on the snow it changes the reflectors it changes the
 the
 transmission qualities of the atmosphere 
 carbon black is that grime that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs and it 's associated with  it 's not good stuff and it 's from
  when we put it through our solar chimney we remove actually about ninety five percent of that and then i swap it out with the students
 and actually re release that carbon black and we make pencils the length of which measures the grime that we 've pulled out of the air here
 's one of them that we have up now here 's who put them up
 and who are avid pencil users  okay so i want to show you just two more interfaces
  because
 i think one of our big challenges is re imagining our relationship to natural systems not only through this model of of
 twisted personalized health  but through the animals with whom we cohabit 
 we are not alone the animals are moving in in fact urban migration now describes the movement of animals formerly known as wild
 into urban centers
  park a whale in the gowanus canal  elk in westchester county  it 's happening all over the developed world probably for loss of habitat but also because our cities
 are a little bit more livable than they have been and every green space we create is an invitation for non humans to cohabit with us but we 've kind of lacked imagination in how we could do that well or interestingly 
  and i want to show you a few of the technological interfaces that have been developed under the moniker of ooz
 which is zoo backwards and without cages to try and
 that relationship this is communication technology for birds it
 looks like this when a bird lands on it they trigger a sound file  this is actually in the whitney museum where there were six of them  each of which had a different argument on it 
 different sound file
  health food bars the ones you call bird food and bring it here and scatter it around there 's a good person natalie jeremijenko okay 
 so there was several of these the birds were able to jump from one to the other these are just your average urban pigeon
 elicited cooperative behavior from the people below about a hundred to one decided that
 this was the argument
 that worked best on us recorded voice tick tick tick that 's the sound of genetic mutations
 of the avian flu becoming a deadly human flu do you know what slows it down
  biodiversity generally 
 it is in your interests that i 'm healthy  happy 
 well fed hence you could share some of your nutritional resources instead of monopolizing them 
 that is share your lunch
  it 's actually officially launched next week with a wonderful commission from the architectural league you may not have known that you need to communicate with fish but there is now a device for you to do so it looks like this 
 buoys that float on the water project three foot up three foot down when a fish swims underneath a light goes on  this is what it looks like
  there 's another function on here this top light is i 'm sorry if i 'm making you seasick
 this top light is actually a water quality display that shifts from red when the dissolved oxygen is low to a blue  green when its dissolved oxygen is high  
 and then you can also text
 the fish  so there 's business cards down there that 'll give you contact details and they text back  when the buoys get your text they wink at you twice
  to say we 've got your message  but perhaps the most popular has been that we 've got another array of these boys in the bronx river  where the first beaver crazy as he is
 to have moved in and built a lodge in new york in two hundred and fifty years
 hangs out so updates from a beaver you can subscribe to updates from him you can
 talk to him and what i like to think of is this is an
 interface
 how we interact with natural systems specifically by changing who has information  where they have it who can make sense of that information  
 and what you can do about it 
 in this case  instead of throwing
 chewing gum or doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish there 's a body of water in
  been dealing with that 's in the middle of the city and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution it 's actually white bread
 from people feeding the fish and the birds  instead of doing that actually we 've developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish
  they 're delicious
  delicious that is delicious for humans and non humans but they also have a chelating agent in them 
  they 're nutritionally appropriate not like doritos and so every time that desire to interact with the animals which is is 
 at least as ubiquitous as that sign do not feed the animals and there 's about three of them on every new york city park and yellowstone national park there 's more do not feed the animals signs than there are animals you might
 wish to feed
  changing it into an opportunity to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate that could augment the nutritional resources that we ourselves have depleted
 for augmenting the fish population and also adding chelating agent which like any chelating agent that we use medicinally 
 binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and pcbs that
 are in the fish living in this particular
 habitat
 and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt where it 's complexed
 by a reactive effectively removing it from bioavailability 
 but i wanted to say that that interaction re scripting that interaction into collective action collective remediative action  
 very different from the approach
 that 's being used on the other side on the
  where we 're dredging
 the pcbs after thirty years of
 legislative and legal struggle  ge 's paying for the dredging of the
 the largest superfund site in the world we 're dredging it and it 'll probably get shipped off to
 pennsylvania or the nearest third world country  where it will continue to be toxic sludge  displacement is not the way to deal with environmental
  and that 's typically the paradigm under which we
 we 've operated by actually taking the opportunity that new technologies new interactive technologies present to re script our interactions 
 to
 script them not just as isolated individuated interactions but as collective aggregating
 actions that can amount to something we can really begin to address some of our important environmental challenges thank you
