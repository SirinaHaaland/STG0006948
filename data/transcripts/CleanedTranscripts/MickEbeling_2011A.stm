  i have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects but the coolest i ever worked on
 was around this guy this guy 's name is tempt tempt was one of the foremost graffiti
  and he came up home from a run one day and said dad my legs are tingling and that was the onset of als 
 so tempt is now completely paralyzed he only has use of his eyes 
 i was exposed to him i have a company that does design and animation so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of of what we admire and respect in the art world 
 and so we decided that we were going to sponsor tony tempt  and his cause so i went and met with his brother and father and said
  this money what are you going to do with it and his brother said i just want to be able to talk to tony again  i just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me 
 and i said wait a second isn 't that i 've seen stephen hawking don 't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices 
 and he said no unless you 're in the upper echelon and
  everyone seen the movie the diving bell and the butterfly that 's how they communicate so run their finger along i said that 's archaic how can that be 
 so i showed up with the desire to just write a check 
 and instead i wrote a check that i had no freaking idea how i was going to cash
  here 's the deal  tony 's going to speak we 're going to get him a machine 
 and we 're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again because it 's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn 't able to communicate it 
 so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that i met these guys called grl graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then with a laser pointer 
 draw on it and it just registers the negative space so they go around and
 art installations like this all the things that go up there they said there 's a life cycle first it starts with the sexual organs then it starts with
 cuss words then it was bush
 slanders and then people actually got to art but there was always a life cycle to their presentations so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and and was telling her about
 if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things why don 't we figure out a way for tempt to control a laser and he could do graf again well that would be awesome 
 so that started the journey  and about
 two years later about a year later after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around we 'd accomplished a couple things one we battered down the doors of the insurance companies  and we actually got tempt a machine that let him communicate
 a stephen hawking machine
 applause which was awesome and he 's seriously one of the funniest i call him yoda because you talk to the guy you get an email from him and you 're like i 'm not worthy this guy 's so amazing 
 the other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world literally every corner of the world
 into our house  my wife and kids and i moved to our
  and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house a lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to
 come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls  but
 for over two weeks  we programmed  we went to the venice boardwalk  my kids got involved  
 my dog got involved
  and we created this this is called the eyewriter and you can see the description this is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought at the venice beach boardwalk
  some copper wire and some stuff from home depot and radio shack  
 we took a ps3 camera hacked it open mounted it to  an led light  and now there 's a device that is free you build this yourself we publish the code for free you download the software for free  
 and now we 've created a device that has absolutely no
  limitations there 's no insurance company that can say no 
 there 's no hospital that can say no anybody who 's paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their
  thank you guys very much that was awesome  so
 at the end of the two weeks  we went back to tempt 's room
 i love this picture because this is someone else 's room and that 's his room so there 's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling  
 and after over a year of planning two weeks of programming
  tony drew again for the first time in seven years  and this is an amazing picture because this is his life support system  and he 's looking over his life support system we kicked his bed so that he 
  could see out  and we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital  and he drew again for the first time in front of his family and friends and you can only imagine what the
  in the parking lot was the funny thing was we had to break into the parking lot too so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too 
 so at the end of this he sent us an email and this is what the email said 
 that was the first time i 've drawn anything for seven years  
 i feel like i had been held underwater  and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so i could breathe
  our battle cry that 's what keeps us going and keeps us developing and we 've got such a long way to go with this this 
 this is an amazing device but it 's the equivalent of an etch a sketch and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more so we 're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better faster stronger  
 since that time  we 've had all kinds of acknowledgment we 've won a bunch of awards remember it 's free none of us are making any money on this thing it 's all coming out
  of our own pockets so the awards were like oh this is fantastic 
 armstrong twittered about us and then in december time magazine honored us as one of the top fifty inventions of two thousand and ten which was really cool 
 the coolest thing about this and this is what 's completing the whole circle is that in april of this year 
 at the geffen moca in downtown los angeles there 's going to be an exhibition called art of the streets and art of the streets is going to have
 pretty much the bad asses of the street art scene
 banksy  shepard fairey  kaws all of these guys will be there tempt 's going to be in the show which is pretty awesome 
 so basically this is my point  
 if you see something that 's not possible make it possible everything in this room wasn 't possible this stage this computer
  mic the eyewriter wasn 't possible at one point  make it possible everyone in this room  i 'm not a programmer  
 never done anything with ocular recognition technology but i just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen  and this is the question i want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done 
 if not now then when and if not me then who  thank you guys
