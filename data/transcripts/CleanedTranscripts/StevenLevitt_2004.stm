  happy to know that
 i 'll be talking not about my own tragedy but other people 's tragedy it 's a lot easier to be lighthearted about other people 's tragedy
 than your own and i want to keep it in the spirit of the conference  so
  if you believe the media accounts being a drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic
 was a very glamorous life in the words of virginia postrel
 there was money there was drugs guns women you know you name it jewelry bling bling it had it all 
 what i 'm going to tell you today is that in fact  based on ten years of research a unique opportunity to go inside a gang
 to see the actual books
  the financial records of the gang
 that the answer turns out not to be
 that
 being in the gang
 was a glamorous life but i think more realistically that being in a gang selling drugs for a gang is perhaps the worst job in all of america  
 and that 's what i 'd like to convince you of today so there
 are three things i want to do first i want to explain how and why
 crack cocaine had such a
 on inner city gangs  secondly i want to tell you how
 somebody like me came to
 be able to see the inner workings of a gang an interesting story i think  and then third  
 i want to tell you in a very superficial way about some of the things we found when we actually got to look at the the
  the books of the gang  so before i do that just one warning  which is that this
 presentation has been rated ' r ' by the motion picture association of america  it contains adult themes adult language  
 given who is up on the stage you 'll be delighted to know that in fact there 'll be no nudity 
 unexpected wardrobe malfunctions
  let me start by talking about crack cocaine and how it transformed the gang to do that you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine  in the early ' 80s and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader
 being a gang leader in the inner city wasn 't such a bad deal
 in the mid ' 80s the early ' 80s let
  a lot of power and you got to beat people up you got a lot of prestige a
 lot of respect  but the thing is there was no money in it 
 the gang had no way to make money  you couldn 't charge dues to the people in the gang because the people in the gang didn 't have any money you
 couldn 't really make any money selling marijuana marijuana 's too cheap it turns out
  you can 't get rich selling marijuana  you couldn 't sell cocaine cocaine 's a great product powdered cocaine but you 've got to know rich white people and most of the
  members didn 't know any rich white people so couldn 't sell to that market  
 you couldn 't really do petty crime either turns out petty crime 's a terrible way to make a living as a result as a gang leader  you had you know 
 power it 's a pretty good life but the thing was in the end you were living at home with your mother  
 and so it wasn 't really a career there were limits to how powerful and important you could be if you had to live at home with your mother
  then along comes crack cocaine
  and
 in the words of malcolm gladwell crack cocaine was the  extra chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city 
 because crack cocaine was an unbelievable innovation i don 't have time to talk about it today  but if you think about it 
 i would say that in the last twenty five years of every invention or innovation that 's occurred in this country  the biggest one in terms of impact on the
 people who live in the inner city was crack cocaine 
 and for the worse not not for the better but for the worse it had a huge impact on life  so what was it about crack cocaine  it was a brilliant way of getting the brain high 
 you could smoke crack cocaine you can 't smoke powdered cocaine and smoking is a much more efficient mechanism of delivering a high than snorting it
  and it turned out there was this audience that didn 't know it wanted crack cocaine but when it came it really did and it was a perfect drug you could 
  the cocaine that went into it for a dollar 
 sell it for five dollars highly addictive the high was very short so for fifteen minutes you get this great high and then when you come down all you
  to do
 is get high again
 it created a wonderful market  and for the people who were there running the gang  it was a great way  
 seemingly to make a lot of money at least for the people on the top
 so this is where we enter the picture not really me i 'm really a bit player in all this my co author sudhir venkatesh is the main character
  he was a
 a math major in college who had a good heart and decided he wanted to get a sociology phd came  to the university of chicago
 the three months before he came to chicago  he
 had spent following the grateful dead and in his own words he looked like a freak he 's a
 south asian very  dark skinned south asian big man and he had hair in his words down to his ass 
 defied all kinds of boundaries was he black or white was he man or woman he was really a curious
 sight to be seen
  he showed up at the university of chicago  and the famous sociologist william julius wilson was doing a book that involved surveying
 people all across
 chicago 
 he took one look at sudhir who was going to go do some surveys for him  and decided he knew exactly the place to send him which was to one of the toughest 
 most notorious housing projects not just in chicago but in the entire united states  so sudhir 
 the suburban boy who had never really been
  the inner city  dutifully took his clipboard and walked down to this housing project  gets to the first building the
 first building  well there 's nobody there but he hears some voices
 up in the stairwell  so he climbs up the stairwell comes around the corner and finds a group of
  very dangerous job being in a gang  you don 't like to be surprised you don 't like to be surprised by people who come around the corner  and the mantra was shoot first ask questions later 
 now sudhir was lucky he was such a freak  and that clipboard probably saved his life  because they figured no other rival gang member would be coming up to shoot at them with a clipboard 
 so his greeting was not particularly warm
 but they did say
  ok let 's hear your questions on your survey  so i kid you not the first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was
  the survey was not in the end going to be what got sudhir off the hook he was held hostage overnight
 in the stairwell  there was a lot of gunfire there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the with the gang members 
 by morning the gang leader arrived  checked out sudhir decided he was no threat and they let him go home
  so sudhir went home took a shower  took a nap  and you and i probably faced with the situation would
 think  i guess i 'm going to write my dissertation on the grateful dead i 've been following them for the last three months 
 sudhir on the other hand got right back walked down to the housing project went up to the second floor
  had so much fun hanging out with you last night i wonder if i could do it again tonight and that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship
 that involved sudhir living in the housing project on and off for ten years hanging out in crack houses going to jail
 with the gang members  having the windows shot out of his car  having the police break into his apartment and steal his computer disks you name it
  story has a happy ending for sudhir who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country  
 and especially for me as i sat in my office with my excel spreadsheet open  waiting for sudhir to come and deliver to me the latest load of data that he would get from the gang it
 was one of the
 the most unequal co authoring relationships ever but i was glad to be the beneficiary of it so what did we find
  what did we find in the gang  well let me say one thing we really got access to everybody in the gang
  we got an inside look at the gang from the very bottom up to the very top  they trusted sudhir
 in ways that really no academic has ever or
 really anybody any outsider has ever earned the trust of these gangs to the point where they actually opened up what was most
  interesting for me their books  the financial records they kept  they made them available to us and we not only could study them but we could ask them questions about what was in them 
 so if i have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time i have
 what the bottom line of what i take away from the gang is it 's that  if i had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization 
 it would be that the gang is just like mcdonald 's
  in a lot of different respects the restaurant mcdonald 's
 so first in one way which isn 't maybe the most interesting way but it 's a good way to start is in the way it 's organized the hierarchy of the gang the way it looks so here 's what the org chart of the 
  gang looks like i don 't know if you know much about org charts but if you were to assign a  stripped down and simplified mcdonald 's org chart this is exactly what
  it 's amazing but the top level of the gang  they actually call themselves the board of directors
  and sudhir says it 's not like these guys had a very sophisticated
 view of
 of what happened in american corporate life but they had seen movies like wall street and they had learned a little bit about
 about what it was like to to be in the real world  now below that board of directors you 've got essentially what are regional vps people who control
  south side of chicago or the west side of chicago  
 sudhir got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment of trying to take the iowa franchise  which it turned out for this black gang was not one of the more brilliant
 financial endeavors they undertook but the thing that really makes the gang seem like mcdonald 's is its franchisees
  they 're just like the guys  in some sense who are running the mcdonald 's  
 they are the entrepreneurs  they get the exclusive property rights to control the drug selling they get the name of the gang
 behind them for merchandising and marketing 
 and they 're the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit depending on how good they are at running the business
  i really want you to think about though are the ones at the bottom the foot soldiers 
 these are the the teenagers typically who 'd be standing out on the street corner selling the drugs extremely dangerous work
  and
 important to note is that almost all of the weight all of the people in this organization are at the bottom just like mcdonald
  in some sense the foot soldiers are a lot like the people who are taking your order at mcdonald 's and it 's not just by chance that they 're like them  in fact in these neighborhoods they 'd be the same people so the same kids who are working in the gang were actually 
 at the very same time 
 typically working part time at a place like mcdonald 's   which already
 foreshadows the main result that i 've talked about about what a crappy job it was being in the gang  because
  if being in the gang were such a wonderful lucrative job why in the world would these guys moonlight at mcdonald 's  
 so what do the wages look like you might be surprised but based on being able to talk to them and to see their records this is what it looks like in terms of the wages  
 the hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was $ three 
 it was below the minimum wage
 and this is well documented it 's easy to see by the patterns of consumption they have it really is not fiction it 's fact  there was very
  little money
 in the gang  especially at the bottom  now if you managed to rise up say and be that local leader the guy who 's the equivalent of the mcdonald 's franchisee you 'd be making one hundred thousand dollars a year  and that 
 in some ways was the best job you could hope to get if you were growing up in one of these neighborhoods
 one of the sad parts of this is that indeed among the many other ramifications of crack cocaine is that the most talented individuals
 in these communities
 this is what they were striving for they weren 't trying to make it in legitimate ways  because there were no legitimate channels out this was the best way out and it actually was the right choice
  to try to make it out
 this way 
 you look at this the relationship to mcdonald 's breaks down here the money looks about the same 
 why is it such a bad job  well the reason it 's such a bad job is that there 's somebody shooting at you
 a lot of the time so with shooting at you what are the death rates we found in our gang and admittedly this was not really a standard situation
  time of intense violence of a lot of gang wars as this gang actually became quite successful  but there were costs and so the death rate
 not to mention the rate of being arrested sent to prison being wounded the death rate in our sample was seven percent per person per year you
 're in the gang for four years  you expect
 to die with about a
  that is about as high as you can get so for comparison 's purposes let 's think about some other
 walk of life you may expect might be extremely risky let 's say that you were a murderer
 and you were convicted of murder and you 're sent to death row it
 turns out the death rates on death row from all causes including execution  two percent a year so
 it 's a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugs out on the street
  you some pause for those of you who believe that a death penalty 's going to have an enormous deterrent effect effect on crime 
 to give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack and i 'm not really focusing on the negatives but really there 's another story to tell you there
 if you look at the death rates just of random young black males growing up in the inner city in the united states the death rates during crack were about one
  percent that 's extremely high and this is violent death it 's unbelievable  in some sense to put it into perspective if you compare this
 to the soldiers in iraq for instance right now fighting the war zero point five percent so in some very literal way
  the young black men who were growing up in this country were living in a war
  very much in the sense that
 the soldiers over in iraq are are fighting in a war  so
 why in the world you might ask would anybody be willing to stand out on a street corner
 selling drugs for $ three point five an hour with a twenty five percent chance of dying over the next four years  why would they do that
  and i think there are a couple answers  i think
 the first one is that they got fooled by history
  it used to be the gang was a rite of passage that the young people controlled the gang that as you got older  you dropped out of the gang
  so what happened was the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time the people who happened to be leading the gang
 in the
  out of the gang like everybody else has and the next generation is going to take over and get the wealth
  there are striking similarities i think to the internet boom the first set of people in silicon valley got very very rich 
 and then all of my friends said maybe i should go do that too and they were willing to work very cheap
 for stock options that never came in some sense that 's what happened exactly to the
  we were looking at they were willing to start at the bottom just like say 
 a first year lawyer at a law firm is willing to start at the bottom work 80 hour weeks for not that much money  because they think they 're going to make partner  but the rules changed  and they never got to make 
  partner  indeed the same people who were running all of the major gangs in the late 1980s are still running the major gangs in chicago today  they never passed on any of the wealth  so everybody got stuck at that
  job and it turned out to be a disaster  the other thing the gang was very very good at was marketing and trickery  and so
 for instance one thing the gang would do is the gang leaders would have big entourages  and they 'd drive fancy cars
 and have fancy jewelry  so what sudhir eventually realized as he hung out with them more is that really they didn 't own those cars they just leased them  because they couldn 't afford to own
  fancy cars and they didn 't really have gold jewelry they had gold plated jewelry it goes back to you know the real real versus 
 and really they did all sorts of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be  so for instance  they would give a
  money i got in the gang it wasn 't his money until he spent it and then he was in debt to the gang and was sort of an indentured servant for a while  so
 i have a couple minutes  let me do one last thing i hadn 't thought i 'd have time to do  which is to talk about
 what we learned more generally about economics from the study of the gang
  tend to talk in technical words  often our theories fail quite miserably
 when we over the data but what 's kind of interesting is that in this setting 
 it turned out that some of the economic theories that worked worked not so well in the real economy worked very well in the drug economy in some sense because  it 's unfettered capitalism 
 here 's an economic principle this is one of the basic ideas in labor economics  called a compensating differential 
  because they 're not willing to to be
 at risk  and the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely he says would you stand around here when all this shit the shooting if all this shit 's going on no right so if i gonna be asked to put my life on the line 
 then front me the cash man i think the gang member says it much more articulately than
  game has a nash equilibrium  here 's the translation you get from the gang member they 're talking about the decision of why they don 't go shoot one thing that turns out to be a great
 business tactic in the gang  if you go and just shoot guns in the air in the other gang 's territory people are afraid to go buy drugs there they 're going to come into your neighborhood
  here 's what he says about why they don 't do that if we start shooting around there the other gang 's territory
  i mean you dig it nobody gonna step on their turf  but we gotta be careful ' cause they can shoot around here too and then we all fucked so that 's the same concept 
 then again sometimes economists get it wrong one thing we observed in the data is that it looked like
 the gang leader always got paid  no matter how bad it was economically he always got himself paid we had some
  related to cash flow and lack of access to capital markets and things like that then we asked the gang member why is it you always get paid and your workers don 't always get paid his response is you
 got all these niggers below you who want your job you dig if you start taking losses they see you as weak and shit and i thought about it and said 
 ceos
 often pay
  even when companies are losing a lot of money  and it never would really occur to an economist that this this idea of ' weak and shit ' could really be important
