  the words of my grandmother who died in her exile son resist gaddafi fight him
  but don 't you ever turn into a gaddafi like revolutionary
 almost two years have passed since the libyan revolution broke out
 inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both
  the tunisian and the egyptian revolutions
 i joined forces with many other libyans inside and outside libya to call for a day of rage
 and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of gaddafi
 and there it was a great revolution
 young libyan women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime raising slogans of
  freedom dignity social justice
 they have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of gaddafi
 they have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south
 eventually after a period of six months of brutal war
 and a toll rate
 of almost fifty thousand dead
 we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant applause
 however gaddafi left behind a heavy burden
 a legacy of tyranny corruption and seeds
 of diversions for four decades gaddafi 's tyrannical regime destroyed
 the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of libyan society
 aware of the devastation and the challenges i was keen among many other women to rebuild the libyan civil society
 calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation
 almost two hundred organizations were established in benghazi
 during and immediately after the fall of gaddafi almost three hundred in tripoli
 after a period of thirty three years in exile i went back to libya and with unique enthusiasm
  i started organizing workshops on capacity building on human development of leadership skills
 with an amazing group of women i co founded the libyan women 's platform for peace a movement of women leaders from different walks of life
 to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right
  for equal participation in building democracy and peace
 i met a very difficult
 environment in the pre elections an environment which was increasingly polarized
 an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion
 i
  led an initiative by the libyan women 's platform for peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law
 a law that would give every citizen no matter what your background
 the right to vote and run and most importantly to stipulate on political parties
 the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and
  horizontally in their lists creating the zipper list
 eventually
 our initiative was adopted and successful
 women won seventeen point five percent of the national congress in the first elections ever in fifty two years
  however
 bit by bit the euphoria of the elections
 and of the revolution as a whole was fading out
 for every day we were waking up to the news of violence one day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and sufi tombs
 on another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the american ambassador and the attack on the consulate on another day we wake up to the news
 of the assassination of army officers and every day every day we wake up with the rule of the militias and their continuous 
 violations of human rights of prisoners and their disrespect of the rule
  of law
 our society shaped by a revolutionary mindset
 became more polarized and has driven away
 from the ideals and the principles freedom dignity social justice that we first held
 intolerance exclusion and revenge became the icons of the aftermath of the revolution
  i am here today
 not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zipper list and the elections
 i 'm rather here today to confess that we as a nation
 took the wrong choice made the wrong decision
 we did not prioritize right for elections did not bring peace and
  stability and security in libya
 did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates
 bring peace and national reconciliation no it didn 't what is it then
 why does our society continue to be polarized
 and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and
 exclusion by both men and women
 maybe what was missing was not the women
 only but the feminine values of compassion mercy and inclusion
 our society needs national dialogue and consensus building more than it it needed the elections which only reinforced polarization and
 division our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical
 quantitative representation of the feminine we need to stop
 acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage we need to start acting
 as agents of compassion and mercy
  mercy we need to develop a feminine discourse that not only honors but also implements
 mercy instead of revenge collaboration instead of competition
 inclusion instead of exclusion these are the ideals that a war torn libya needs desperately in
  order to achieve peace for peace has an alchemy and this alchemy is about the intertwining
 the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives that 's the real zipper
 and we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically
 according to a quranic verse
  salam peace is the word of the all merciful god raheem
 in turn
 the word raheem which is known in all abrahamic traditions has the same root in arabic as the word rahem womb
 symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female from which
  all tribes all peoples have emanated from
 and so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo
 which grows within it
 the divine matrix of compassion
 nourishes the entire existence thus we are told that my mercy
  encompasses all things thus we are told that my mercy takes precedence over my anger
 may we all be granted a grace of mercy
