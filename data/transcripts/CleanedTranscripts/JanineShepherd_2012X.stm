  is about opportunities creating them and embracing them and for me  that was the olympic dream  
 that 's what defined me  that was my bliss 
 as a cross country skier and member of the australian ski team headed towards the winter olympics i
  on a training bike ride with my fellow teammates 
 as we made our way up towards the spectacular blue mountains west of sydney  it was the perfect autumn day  sunshine the smell of eucalypt
 and a dream life was good we
 'd been on our bikes for around five and a half hours when we got to the part of the ride that i loved and that was the hills because i loved the hills
 i got up off the seat of my bike and i started pumping my legs and as i sucked in the cold mountain air i could feel it burning my lungs  and i looked up to see the sun shining in my face  
 and then everything went black where was i what was happening my body was consumed by pain
  been hit by a speeding utility truck with only ten minutes to go on the bike ride 
 i was airlifted from the scene of the accident by a rescue helicopter to a large spinal unit in sydney  i had extensive and life threatening injuries 
 i 'd broken my neck and my back in six places  i broke five ribs on my left side  i broke my right arm  i broke my
  i broke some bones in my feet 
 my whole right side was ripped open filled with gravel my head was cut open across the front lifted back exposing the skull underneath i had head injures i had internal injuries 
 i had massive blood loss in fact i lost about five liters of blood which is all someone my size would actually hold 
 for over ten days  i drifted between two dimensions  
 i had an awareness of being in my body but also being out of my body somewhere else watching from above as if it was happening to someone else  why would i want to go back to a body that was so
  that body is broken it can no longer serve me come on  stay with me we can do it we can do it together 
 i was at a crossroads  i knew if i didn 't return to my body i 'd have to leave this world forever it was the fight of my life
 after ten days  i made the decision to return to my body  and the internal bleeding stopped 
 the next concern was whether i would walk again  because i was paralyzed from the waist down  
 they said to my parents that the neck break was a stable fracture but the back was completely crushed the vertebra at l1 was like you 'd dropped a peanut
  stepped on it smashed it into thousands of pieces they 'd have to operate  
 they went in  they put me on a beanbag they cut me literally cut me in half i have a scar that wraps around my entire body  
 they picked as much broken bone
 as they could that had lodged in my spinal cord they took out two of my broken
  then they stitched me up they took an entire hour to stitch me up  i woke up in intensive care and the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success  because at that stage  i had a little 
  bit of movement in one of my big toes  and i thought great because i 'm going to the olympics 
  the sort of thing that happens to someone else not me  surely  but then the doctor came over to me and she said janine 
 the operation was a success and we 've picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could 
 but the damage is permanent the central nervous system nerves
 there is no cure you 're what we call a partial paraplegic and you 'll have all of the injuries that go along with that
  have no feeling from the waist down and at most you might get ten or twenty percent return you
 'll have internal injuries for the rest of your life you 'll have to use a catheter for the rest of your life  
 and if you walk again  it will be with calipers and a walking frame and then she said janine you 'll have to rethink everything you do in your life because you 're never going to be able to do the things you did before
  i tried to grasp what she was saying  
 i was an athlete that 's all i knew that 's all i 'd done if i couldn 't do that then what could i do and the question i asked myself is if i couldn 't do that 
 then who was i 
 they moved me from intensive care to acute spinal i was lying on a thin hard spinal bed
  had no movement in my legs i had tight stockings on to protect from blood clots  i had one arm in plaster one arm tied down by drips  i had a neck brace and sandbags on either side of my head
 and i saw my world through a mirror that was suspended above my head 
 i shared the ward with five other people  and the amazing thing is because we were all lying paralyzed in a spinal ward  
 we didn 't know what each other looked like 
 how amazing is that how often in life
 do you get to make friendships 
 purely based on spirit  
 and there were no superficial conversations as we shared our innermost thoughts our fears  and our hopes for life after the spinal ward
 i remember one night one of the nurses came in jonathan with a whole lot of plastic straws
  he put a pile on top of each of us  and he said start threading them together well there wasn 't much else to do in the spinal ward so we did 
 and when we 'd finished  he went around silently and he joined all of the straws up till it looped around the whole ward  and then he said  ok everybody hold on to your straws 
 and we did  and he said
 now we 're all connected and as we held on
 and we breathed as one we knew we weren 't on this journey alone  and even lying paralyzed
 in the spinal ward  there were moments of incredible depth and richness of authenticity and connection
  that i had never experienced before
  and each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward
  we would never be the same  
 after six months it was time to go home  i remember dad pushing me outside in my
  wrapped in a plaster body cast  
 and feeling the sun on my face for the first time i soaked it up and i thought how could i ever have taken this for granted 
 i felt so incredibly grateful for my life  but before i left hospital the head nurse had said to me janine i want you to be ready because
 when you get home something 's going to happen and i said
  janine the machine which was my nickname  she said you are because see it happens to everyone in the spinal ward  
 that 's normal  you 're in a wheelchair that 's normal but you 're going to get home and realize
 how different life is and i got home and something happened
  i realized sister sam was right  i did get depressed  
 i was in my wheelchair  i had no feeling from the waist down attached to a catheter bottle i couldn 't walk  
 i 'd lost so much weight in hospital  i now weighed about eighty pounds  
 and i wanted to give up all i wanted to do was put my running shoes on and run out the
  friends that were still in the spinal ward
 particularly maria 
 maria was in a car accident and she woke up on her 16th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic had no movement from the neck down 
 had damage to her vocal chords  and she couldn 't talk  
 they told me we 're going to move you next to her because we think it will be good for her 
 i was worried i didn 't know how
  i 'd react to being next to her  i knew it would be challenging  but it was actually a blessing  because
 maria always smiled 
 she was always happy and even when she began to talk again  albeit difficult to understand she never complained not
  and i wondered how had she ever found that level of acceptance  and i realized
 that this wasn 't just my life  it was life itself  i realized that this wasn 't just my pain it was everybody 's pain  
 and then i knew just like before that i had a choice 
 i could keep
  i could let go and accept not only my body  but the circumstances of my life  
 and then i stopped asking why me and i started to ask why not me 
 and then i thought to myself  maybe being at rock bottom is actually the perfect place to start
 i had never before thought of
  myself as a creative person i was an athlete my body was a machine  but now i was
 about to embark on the most creative project that any of us could ever do that of rebuilding a life  
 and even though i had absolutely no idea what i was going to do in that uncertainty
 came a sense of freedom  i was no longer tied to a set path
 i was free to explore life 's infinite possibilities  and that realization
 was about to change my life  
 sitting at home in my wheelchair and my plaster body cast an airplane flew overhead 
  she passed me the phone book i rang up the flying school i said i 'd like to make a booking to come out for a flight  they said 
 when do you want to come out i said  well i have to get a friend to drive me because i can 't drive
 that a problem i made a booking and weeks later my friend chris and my mom drove me out to the airport all eighty pounds of me covered in a plaster body cast in a baggy pair of overalls 
 i can tell you i did not look like the ideal candidate to get a pilot 's license 
 i 'm holding on to the counter because i can 't stand i said hi i 'm here for a flying
  get me out on the tarmac and there was this red white and blue airplane it was beautiful 
  they had to slide me up on the wing to put me in the cockpit they sat me down there are buttons and dials everywhere i 'm going wow how do you ever know what all these buttons and dials do 
 andrew got in the front started the
 and said would you like to have a go at taxiing that 's when you use your feet to control the rudder pedals to control the airplane on the ground i said 
 no i can 't use my legs he went oh i said but i can use my hands and he said ok 
 so he got over to the runway and he applied the power  and as we took off down the runway  and the wheels lifted up off the
  i had the most incredible sense of freedom  
 and andrew said to me 
 as we got over the training area 
 you see that mountain over there and i said yeah and he said well you take the controls and you fly towards that mountain 
 and as i looked up  i realized
 that he was pointing towards the blue mountains where the journey had begun
  and i took the controls  and i was flying  
 and i was a long long way from that spinal ward  i knew right then that i was going to be a pilot 
 didn 't know how on earth i 'd ever pass a medical 
 but i 'd worry about that later because right now i had a dream  so i went home  i got a training diary out and i had a plan  
 and i practiced my walking as much as
  could and i went from the point of two people holding me up to one person holding me up to
 the point where i could walk around the furniture as long as it wasn 't too far apart  
 and then i made great progression to the point where i could walk around the house holding onto the walls like this  
 and mom said she was forever following me  wiping
  but at least she always knew where i was 
 so while the doctors continued to operate and put my body back together again  i went on with my theory study  
 and then eventually amazingly  i passed my pilot 's medical  and that was my green light to fly  
 and i spent every moment i could out at that flying school way out of my comfort zone all these young guys that wanted to be qantas pilots
 hop along me in first my plaster cast and then my steel brace my baggy overalls my bag of medication and catheters and my limp
 they use to look at me and think oh who is she kidding she 's never going to be able to do this and sometimes i thought that too but that didn 't matter  
 because now there was something inside that burned that far
  and little goals kept me going along the way and eventually i got my private pilot 's license 
 then i learned to navigate  and i flew my friends around australia  
 and then i learned to fly an airplane with two engines and i got my twin engine rating  
 and then i learned to fly in bad weather as well as fine weather and got my instrument rating  
 and then i got my commercial pilot 's license and then i got my instructor rating
  and then i found myself back at that same school where i 'd gone for that very first flight  teaching other people how to fly  
 just under eighteen months after i 'd left the spinal ward
  and i learned to fly upside down and became an aerobatics flying instructor 
 laughter and mom and dad never been up 
 but then i knew for certain that although my body might be limited
  spirit that was unstoppable 
 the philosopher lao tzu once said 
 when you let go of what you are  you become what you might be 
 i now know that it wasn 't until i let go of who i thought i was
 that i was able to create a completely new life  it wasn 't until i let go of
  of the life i thought i should have that i was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me  
 i now know that my real strength never came from my body  
 and although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically  who i am
 is unchanged the pilot light inside of me
 was still alight  just as it is in each and every one of us 
 i know that i 'm not my body  
 and i also know that you 're not yours  and then it no longer matters
 what you look like where you come from or what you do for a living all that matters is that we continue
 to fan the flame of humanity
 by living our lives as the ultimate creative expression of who we really are  
 because we are all connected
 by millions and millions of straws  and it 's time to join those up
 and to hang on and if we are to move towards our
  collective bliss it
 's time we shed our focus on the physical and instead embrace the virtues of the heart so raise your straws if you 'll join me
