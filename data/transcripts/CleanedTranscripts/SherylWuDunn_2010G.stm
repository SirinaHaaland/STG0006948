  about today
 rarely makes the front pages  it  however is enormous in both scale and importance look  you
  all are very well traveled this is tedglobal after all  but i do hope to take you to some places you 've never been to before 
 so let 's start off in china  this photo was taken two weeks ago  
 actually one indication is that little boy on my husband 's shoulders has just graduated from high school 
 laughter but this is tiananmen square many of you have been there it 's not the real china let me take you to the real china 
 this is in the dabian mountains in the remote part
 of hubei province in central china  
 dai manju is thirteen years old at the time the story starts  she lives with her parents 
 her two brothers and her great aunt they have a hut that has no electricity no running water 
 no wristwatch no bicycle  and they share this great splendor with a very large pig 
 dai manju
 was in sixth grade when her parents said
 we 're going to pull you out of school because the 13 dollar school fees are too much for us  you 're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies  why would we waste this money on you 
 this is what happens to girls in remote areas  
 turns out that dai manju was the
 best pupil in her grade  she still made the two hour trek to the schoolhouse and
  tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors  we wrote about her in the new york times  we got a flood of donations
 mostly
 13 dollar checks because new york times readers are very generous in tiny amounts 
 but then  we got a money transfer for $ ten thousand
 really nice guy  we turned the money over to that man there the principal of the school he was delighted he thought
  i can renovate the school i can give scholarships to all the girls you know if they work hard and stay in school  so dai manju basically finished out
 middle school she went to high school  she went to vocational school for accounting  she scouted for jobs down in guangdong province in the south she found a job she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends 
 she sent money back to her family they built
  a new house this time with running water electricity a bicycle no pig  
 what we saw was a natural experiment 
 it is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls ' education 
 and over the years as we followed dai manju we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle she not only changed her own dynamic she changed her
 she changed her family her village the village became
 a real standout of course most of china was flourishing at the time  but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of china  
 and that brings me to my first major of two tenets of half the sky 
 and that is that the
  was totalitarianism the cause of our time is
 the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender 
 so some of you may be thinking gosh that 's hyperbole  she 's exaggerating well let me ask you this question
  how many of you think there are more males or more females in the world  let me take a poll how many of you think there are more males in the world hands up please 
 how many of you think a few how many of you there are more females in the world  okay most of you well you know this latter group you 're wrong  
 there are true enough in europe and the west when women and and men have equal access to food and health care there are more women we live
  in most of the rest of the world that 's not the case  in fact demographers have shown that there are anywhere between sixty million and one hundred million missing females in the current population
  and you know  it happens for several reasons for instance  in the last half century 
 more girls were discriminated to death than all the people killed on all the battlefields in the  20th century  
 sometimes it 's also because of the sonogram girls get aborted before they 're even born
 when there are scarce resources this girl here for instance is in a feeding center in ethiopia  the entire center was filled with girls like her 
 what 's remarkable is that her brothers in the same family were totally fine 
 in india
  in the first year of life from zero to one boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast and the breast shows
  no son preference from one to five girls die at a fifty percent higher mortality rate than boys in all of india  
 the second tenet of half the sky 
 is that let 's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all and just on a purely practical level
  we think that one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism is to educate
  girls and to bring women into the formal labor force 
 poverty for instance  there are three reasons why this is the case 
 for one overpopulation is one of the persistent causes of poverty and you know when you educate a boy 
 his family tends to have fewer kids but only slightly when you educate a
  she tends to have significantly fewer kids  the second reason
 is
 it has to do with spending it 's kind of like the dirty little secret of poverty which is that not only do
 poor people take in very little income  but also the income that they take in they don 't spend it very wisely
  and unfortunately most of that spending is done by men so
 research has shown if you look at people who live under two dollars a day one
  metric of of poverty
 two percent of that take home pay goes to this basket here in education 
 twenty percent goes to a basket that is a combination of alcohol  tobacco  sugary drinks and prostitution and
 festivals if you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket you would have a
  the last
 reason has to do with women being part of the solution not the problem
  you need to use scarce resources  it 's a waste of resources if you don 't use someone like dai manju 
 bill gates put it very well when he was traveling through saudi arabia he was speaking to an audience much like yourselves however two thirds of the way there was a barrier on this side was men 
 and then the barrier and this side was women 
 and someone from this side of the room got up and said
 we have here as our goal in saudi arabia to be one of the top ten countries when it comes to technology do you think we 'll make it 
 so bill gates as he was staring out at the audience he said 
 if you 're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country there is no way you will get anywhere near the top ten 
 so here is bill of arabia
  so what would some of the specific challenges look like 
 i would say on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking and i 'll just say two things about this 
 the slavery at the peak of the slave trade in
 there were about eighty thousand slaves transported from africa to the new world 
  modern slavery according to state department rough statistics there are about eight hundred thousand ten times the number
 that are trafficked across international borders  and that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders  which is a substantial portion 
 and  if you look at another factor another contrast a slave back then
 is worth about $ forty thousand in today 's money
  today you can buy a girl trafficked for a few hundred dollars which means she 's actually more disposable  
 but you know  there is progress being made in places like cambodia and thailand we don 't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed 
 the second item on the agenda is
  this part of the world is a wonderful event 
 in niger one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth around the world 
 one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth
 you know  it 's not as though we don 't have the technological solution  but these women have three strikes against them they are poor they are rural
 and they are female  you know  for every woman who does die there are twenty who survive
 but end up with an injury  and the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula it 's
 a tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman incontinent  
 let me tell you about mahabuba  she lives in ethiopia she was married against her will at age thirteen she
  got pregnant ran to the bush to have the baby but you know her body was very immature  and she ended up having obstructed labor 
 the baby died  and she ended up with a fistula so
 that meant she was incontinent she couldn 't control her wastes in a word she stank 
 the villagers thought she was
  they didn 't know what to do with her so finally they put her at the edge of the village in a hut  they ripped off the door so that the hyenas would get her at night 
 that night  there was a stick in the hut  she fought off the hyenas with that stick 
 and the next morning she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary she would be saved 
 because she had some damage to her nerves she crawled
 all the way thirty miles to that
 doorstep
  dead the foreign missionary opened the door knew exactly what had happened took her to a nearby fistula hospital in addis ababa  and
 she was repaired with a 350 dollar operation  
 the doctors and nurses there noticed that she was not only a survivor  she was really clever  and they made her a nurse
  she is saving the lives of hundreds  thousands of women she has become part of the solution not the problem she 's moved out of a vicious cycle and
 into a virtuous cycle 
 i 've talked about some of the challenges  let me talk about some of the
 solutions and there are predictable solutions
  i 've hinted at them education and also economic economic opportunity  so of course when you educate a girl  she tends to
 get married later
  life  she tends to have kids later on in life  she tends to have fewer kids  and those kids that she does have she educates them in a more enlightened fashion 
 with economic opportunity  it can be transformative 
 let me tell you about saima  she lives in a small village outside lahore pakistan 
 and at the time she was miserable she was beaten every single day by her husband who was unemployed he was kind of a gambler
  type and unemployable therefore and took his frustrations out on her well when she had her second daughter her mother  in law told her son 
 i think you 'd better get a second wife saima 's not going to produce you a son this
 is when she had her second daughter  at the time there was a microlending group
 in the village that gave her a
  took that money  and she started an embroidery business  
 the merchants liked her embroidery it sold very well  and they kept asking for more 
 and when she couldn 't produce enough she hired other women in the village pretty soon she had thirty women in the village working for her embroidery business  
 and then when she
  all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace  she needed someone to help her do the transport so she hired her husband  
 so now they 're in it together he does the transportation and distribution  and she does the production and sourcing and now they have a third daughter  
 and the daughters all of them are being tutored in education because saima knows what 's really important  
 which brings me to the final element which is education
  larry summers when he was chief
  economist at the world bank once said that it may well be
 that the highest return on investment in the developing world
 is in girls ' education let me tell you about beatrice biira beatrice
 was living in uganda near the congo border and like dai manju she didn 't go to
  she had never been to school not to a lick one day 
 her parents again said why should we spend the money on her she 's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth 
 well it just so happens at that time there was a
 group
 in connecticut called the niantic community church group in connecticut they made a donation to an organization based in
 arkansas called heifer international heifer sent two goats to africa
  of them ended up with beatrice 's parents  
 and that goat had twins the twins started producing milk they sold the milk for cash the cash started accumulating 
 and pretty soon the parents said you know  we 've got enough money let 's send beatrice to school 
 so at nine years of age beatrice started in first grade after all she 'd never been to a lick of school with a six year old 
 no matter she was just
  delighted to be in school  she rocketed to the top of her class she stayed at the top of her class
 through elementary school  middle school and then in high school  she scored brilliantly on the national examinations
 so that she became the first person in her village ever to come to the united states on scholarship
  she graduated from connecticut college 
 on the day of her graduation  she said i am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat 
 and that goat was $ one hundred and twenty so you see how transformative
 little bits of help can be but i want to give you a reality check look u s 
  helping people is not easy and there have been books that have criticized u s aid there 's bill easterly 's book there 's a book called dead aid 
 you know  the criticism is fair it isn 't easy  you know  people say how half of all water well projects a year later are failed when i was in zimbabwe
  we were touring a place with the village chief he wanted to raise money for a secondary school and there was some construction a few yards away and i said what 's that 
 he sort of mumbled
  out that it 's a failed irrigation project a few yards away was a failed chicken coop one year all the chickens died and no one wanted to put the chickens in there it
 's true  but we think that you don 't through the baby out with the bathwater you actually
 improve you learn from your mistakes and you continuously improve  
 we also think that individuals can make a difference  and they should because individuals together  we can all help create a
  movement and a movement of men and women is what 's needed to bring about social change change that will
 address this great moral challenge 
 so then i ask what 's in it for you you 're probably asking that why should you care 
 i will just leave you with two things one
 is that research shows
 that once you
  have all of your material needs taken care of which most of us all of us here in this room do
 research shows that there are very few things in life that can actually elevate your level of happiness 
 one of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself 
 and the second thing  it 's an anecdote that i 'll leave you with and that is the
  story of
 an aid worker in darfur 
 here was a woman who had worked in darfur  seeing things that no human being should see 
 throughout her time there  she was strong she was steadfast  she never broke down  and
  she came back to the united states and was on break christmas break  she was in her grandmother 's backyard  
 and she saw something that made her break down in tears 
 what that was
 was a bird feeder  and she realized
 that she had the great fortune
 to be born in a country where we take security for granted where we not only
  provide for wild birds so they don 't go hungry in the winter  and she realized that with that great fortune
 comes great responsibility  and so 
 like her you me we have all won the lottery of life  
 and so the question becomes how do we discharge that responsibility
  so here 's the cause join the movement  feel happier and help save the world thank you very much
