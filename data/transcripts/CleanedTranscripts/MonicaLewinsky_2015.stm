  you 're looking at a woman
 who was publicly silent for a decade  
 obviously that 's changed 
 but only recently  it was several months ago that i gave my very first major public talk at the forbes thirty under thirty summit
 five hundred brilliant people all under the age of thirty 
 that meant that in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight the oldest among the group were only fourteen  
 and the youngest just four 
 i joked with them
 that some might only have heard of me from rap songs
  night of my speech a surprising thing happened at the age of forty one i was hit on by a 
  guy  i know right  
 he was charming and i was flattered  and i declined you know what his unsuccessful pickup line was
 he could make me feel twenty two again 
 i realized later that night  i 'm probably the only person over forty who does not want to be
  at the age of twenty two i fell in love with my boss  
 and at the age of twenty four i learned the devastating consequences
 can i see a show of hands of anyone here who didn 't make a mistake or do something they regretted at
  's what i thought  
 so like me at twenty two 
 a few of you may have also taken wrong turns and fallen in love with the wrong person 
 maybe even your boss  
 unlike me though your boss probably wasn 't the president of the united states of america
  life is full of surprises 
 not a day goes by that i 'm not reminded of my mistake  and i regret that mistake deeply in
 one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight after having been swept up into an improbable romance  
 i was then swept up into the eye of a political legal and media maelstrom like we had never seen before
 remember just a few years earlier news was consumed from just three places  
 reading a newspaper or magazine listening to the radio 
 or watching television that was it  
 but that wasn 't my fate 
 instead this scandal was brought to you by the digital revolution that meant we
  could access all the information we wanted when we wanted it anytime  anywhere 
 and when the story broke in january one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight it broke online  
 it was the first time the traditional news was usurped by the internet for a major
  a click that reverberated around the world what that meant for me personally
 was that overnight i went from being a completely private figure
 to a publicly humiliated one worldwide  i was patient zero
 of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously
  this rush to judgment enabled by technology led to mobs of virtual 
 granted it was before social media but people could still
 comment online  email stories and of course  email cruel jokes 
 news sources plastered photos of me all over to sell newspapers
  ads online and to keep people tuned to the tv 
 do you recall a particular image of me  say wearing a beret  
 now i admit i made mistakes especially wearing that beret 
 but the attention and judgment that i received not the story  but that i
  personally received was unprecedented  i was branded
 as a tramp  tart  slut  whore  bimbo 
 and of course that woman 
 i was seen by many but actually known by few and i get it
  it was easy to forget that that woman was dimensional had a soul and was once unbroken 
 when this happened to me seventeen years ago  there was no name for it 
 now we call it cyberbullying and online harassment
  i want to share some of my experience with you talk about how that experience has helped shape my cultural observations  
 and how i hope my past experience can lead to a change that results in less suffering for others
  lost my life 
 let me paint a picture for you 
 it is september of one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight i 'm sitting in a windowless office room
 inside the office of the independent counsel
 underneath
  i 'm listening
 to the sound of my voice my voice on surreptitiously taped phone calls that a supposed friend had made the year before  
 i 'm here
 because i 've been legally required to personally authenticate all twenty hours of taped conversation 
 for the past eight months  the mysterious content of these tapes has hung like the sword
  of damocles over my head  i mean who can remember what they said a year ago  
 scared and mortified  i listen 
 listen as i prattle on about the flotsam and jetsam of the day 
 listen as i confess my love for the president and of course my heartbreak
  to my sometimes catty sometimes churlish sometimes silly self
 being cruel unforgiving  uncouth  
 listen deeply  deeply ashamed to the worst version of myself  
 a self i don 't even recognize 
 a few days later  the starr report is released to congress
 and all of those tapes and transcripts those stolen words form a part of it 
 that people can read the transcripts is horrific enough  but a few weeks later  
 the audio tapes are aired on tv  and significant portions made available online  
 the public humiliation was
  excruciating life was almost unbearable 
 this was not something that happened with regularity back then in 
 and by this i mean the stealing of people 's private words  actions  conversations or
  and then making them public
 public without consent public without context and public without compassion  
 fast forward twelve years to two thousand and ten  and now social media has been born
  the landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine  whether or not someone actually make a mistake  
 and now it 's for both
  public and private people the consequences for some have become dire very dire  
 i was on the phone with my mom in september of two thousand and ten  
 and we were talking about the news of a young college freshman from rutgers
  by his roommate while being intimate with another man  
 when the online world learned of this incident the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited a
 few days later  tyler jumped from the george washington bridge to his death
 my mom was beside herself about what happened to tyler and his family  and she was
 gutted with pain
 in a way that i just couldn 't quite understand  and then eventually i realized she was reliving one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight 
 reliving a time when she sat by my bed every night
  reliving a time when she made me shower with the bathroom door open  
 and reliving a time when both of my parents feared that i would be humiliated to death  
 literally
 today  too many parents haven 't had the chance to step in and rescue their loved ones
  too many have learned of their child 's suffering and humiliation after it was too late 
 tyler 's tragic senseless death was a turning point for me  it served to 
  my experiences  and i then began to look at the world of humiliation and bullying around me and see something different
  had no way of knowing where this brave new technology called the internet would take us 
 since then it has connected people in unimaginable ways  joining lost siblings  
 saving lives launching revolutions  
 but the darkness cyberbullying and slut shaming that
  especially young people who are not developmentally equipped to handle this are so abused and humiliated that they can 't imagine living to the next day 
 and some tragically don 't 
 and there 's nothing virtual about that 
  nonprofit that 's focused on helping young people on various issues  released a staggering statistic late last year 
 from two thousand and twelve to two thousand and thirteen 
 there was an eighty seven percent increase in calls and emails related to cyberbullying
 a meta analysis done out of the netherlands showed that for the
  leading to suicidal ideations more significantly than offline bullying 
 and you know what shocked me  although it shouldn 't have 
 was other research last year that determined humiliation was a more intensely felt emotion
 than either happiness or even anger cruelty to others is nothing new
  but online  technologically enhanced shaming
 is amplified  uncontained  and permanently accessible 
 the echo of embarrassment used to extend only as far as your family  village school or community 
 but now it 's the online community too 
 millions of people often
  anonymously can stab you with their words  and that 's a lot of pain  
 and there are no perimeters around how many people can publicly observe you
 and put you in a public stockade 
 there is a very personal price
 to public humiliation and the growth of the internet has jacked up that price
 for nearly two decades now we have slowly been sowing the seeds of shame and public humiliation in our cultural soil both on and offline 
 gossip websites paparazzi reality programming politics news outlets and sometimes hackers all traffic in shame 
  's led to desensitization and a permissive environment online
 which lends itself to trolling  invasion of privacy and cyberbullying 
 this shift has created what professor nicolaus mills calls a culture of humiliation 
 consider a few prominent examples just from the past six months alone
  which is used mainly by younger generations and claims that its messages only have the lifespan of a few seconds 
 you can imagine the range of content that that gets
 a third party app which  snapchatters use to preserve the lifespan of the messages was hacked  and one hundred thousand
  and videos were leaked online to now have a lifespan of forever 
 jennifer lawrence and several other actors had their icloud accounts hacked and private intimate nude photos were plastered across the internet without their permission 
 one gossip website
 had over five million hits for this one story  and what about the sony pictures
  the documents which received the most attention were private emails that had maximum public embarrassment value
  but in this culture of humiliation there is another kind of price tag attached to public shaming 
 the price does not measure the cost to the victim which tyler and too many others notably women minorities
 and members of the lgbtq community have paid  but the price measures the profit of those who prey on them 
 this invasion of others is a raw material  efficiently and ruthlessly mined  packaged and sold at a profit 
 a marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity
 and shame is an industry 
 how is the money made 
 clicks  
 the more shame  the more clicks  the more clicks  the more advertising dollars we
 're in a dangerous cycle  the more we click on this kind of gossip the more numb we get to the human lives behind
  it and the more numb we get  the more we click 
 all the while someone is making money off of the back of someone else 's suffering 
 with every click we make a choice  
 the more we saturate our culture with public shaming  the more accepted it is the more we will see behavior like cyberbullying
 trolling some forms of hacking and online harassment  
 why because they all have humiliation at their cores 
 this behavior is a symptom of the culture we 've created just think about it 
  changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs 
 we 've seen that to be true with racism homophobia  and plenty of other biases  today and in the past 
 as we 've changed beliefs about same sex marriage more people have been offered
 equal freedoms 
 when we began valuing sustainability more people began to recycle 
 so as far as our culture of humiliation goes what we need is a
  cultural revolution 
 public shaming as a blood sport has to stop  and it 's time for an intervention on the internet and in our culture 
 the shift begins with something simple but it 's not easy 
 we need to return to a long held value of compassion
  we 've got a compassion deficit an empathy crisis  
 researcher bren brown said  and i quote shame can 't survive empathy 
 shame
 cannot survive empathy 
 i 've seen some very dark days in my life
  was the compassion and empathy
 from my family friends  professionals and sometimes even strangers that saved me 
 even empathy from one person can make a difference 
 the theory of minority influence proposed by social psychologist serge moscovici  
 says that even in small numbers when there 's consistency over time change can happen
 in the online world we can foster minority influence by becoming
 to become an upstander means instead of bystander apathy  we can post a positive comment for someone or report a bullying situation 
 trust me compassionate comments help abate the negativity  
 we can also counteract the culture by supporting organizations that deal with these
  kinds of issues like the tyler clementi foundation in the u s 
 in the u k there 's anti bullying pro and in australia  there 's project rockit 
 we talk a lot about
 our right to freedom of expression  but we need to talk more about our responsibility to freedom of expression  
 we all want to be
  heard but let 's acknowledge the difference between speaking up with intention and speaking up for attention 
 the internet is the superhighway for the id  but online showing empathy to others benefits us all
 and helps create a safer and better world  we need to communicate online with
  compassion  consume news with compassion and click with compassion 
 just imagine walking a mile in someone else 's headline i
 'd like to end
 on a personal note 
 in the past nine months the question i 've been asked the most is why  why now  why was i sticking my
  above the parapet 
 you can read between the lines in those questions  and the answer has nothing to do with politics  
 the top note answer was and is because it 's time 
 time to stop tip toeing around my past time to stop living a life of opprobrium and time to take back my narrative it
 's also not just
  about saving myself  anyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation needs to know one thing 
 you can survive it  i know it 's hard  
 it may not be painless quick or easy but you can insist on a different ending to your story 
 have compassion for yourself
 we all deserve compassion 
 and to live both online and off in a more compassionate world
 thank you for listening
