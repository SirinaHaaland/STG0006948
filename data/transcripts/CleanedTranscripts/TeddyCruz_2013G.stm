  urban explosion of the last years of economic boom
 also produced dramatic marginalization  
 resulting in the explosion of slums in many parts of the world  
 this polarization of
  enclaves of mega wealth surrounded by sectors of poverty and the socioeconomic inequalities they have engendered
 is really at the center of today 's urban crisis  but i want to begin tonight
 by suggesting that this urban crisis is not only economic
 or environmental it 's particularly a cultural crisis a crisis of the institutions
 unable to reimagine
 the stupid ways which we have been growing unable to challenge the oil hungry selfish urbanization
 that have perpetuated cities based on consumption from southern california
 to new york
  so i just really want to share with you a reflection
 that the future of cities today depends less on buildings
 and in fact  depends more
 on the fundamental reorganization of socioeconomic relations that the best ideas in the shaping of the city in the future
 will not come from enclaves of economic power and abundance  but in fact from sectors
 of conflict and scarcity
 from which an urgent imagination
 can really inspire us to rethink urban growth today  and let me illustrate what i mean
 by understanding or engaging sites of conflict
 as harboring creativity as i briefly introduce you to the tijuana san diego border region  which has been the
  laboratory to rethink my practice as an architect  
 this is the wall the border wall that separates san diego and tijuana  latin america and the united states 
 a physical emblem
 of exclusionary planning policies that have perpetuated the division of communities 
 jurisdictions and resources across the world  
 in this border region
  region we find some of the wealthiest real estate as i once found in the edges of san diego  barely twenty minutes away from some of the poorest settlements in latin america 
 and while these two cities have the same population 
 san diego has grown six times larger than tijuana in the last decades  immediately thrusting us to confront
 the tensions and conflicts between sprawl and density which are at the center of today 's discussion about environmental sustainability  
 so i 've been arguing in the last years
 that in fact  the slums of tijuana can teach a lot to the sprawls of san diego when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability
  that we should pay attention and learn from the many migrant communities on both sides of this border wall
 so that we can translate
 their informal processes of urbanization 
 what do i mean by the informal in this case i 'm really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation
 that enable many of these migrant communities to transgress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization
 i 'm talking simply about the creative intelligence of the bottom up 
 whether manifested in the slums of tijuana that build themselves in fact  with the waste of san diego 
 or the many migrant neighborhoods in southern california that have begun to be retrofitted with difference in the last decades
  so i 've been interested as an artist
 in the measuring  the observation of many of the trans border informal flows across this border 
 in one direction from south to north the flow of immigrants into the united states 
 and from north to south the flow of waste from southern california into tijuana 
 i 'm referring to the recycling of these old post war bungalows
 that mexican contractors bring to the border as
  american developers are disposing of them in the process of building a more inflated version of suburbia in the last decades  so these are houses
 waiting to cross the border not only people cross the border here  but entire chunks of one city move to the next 
 and when these houses are placed on top of these steel frames 
 they leave the first floor to become the second to be in filled with more house with a small
  business  this layering of spaces and economies
 is very interesting to notice  
 but not only houses also small debris from one city from san diego to tijuana  probably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires that are used in the slums to build retaining walls 
 but look at what people have done here in conditions of socioeconomic emergency
  have figured out how to peel off the tire how to thread it and interlock it to construct a more efficient retaining wall  
 or the garage doors that are brought
 from san diego in trucks to become
 the new skin
 of emergency housing
 in many of these slums surrounding the edges of tijuana  so while as an architect this is a very compelling thing to witness this creative intelligence
  i also want to keep myself in check i don 't want to romanticize poverty i just want to suggest
 that this informal urbanization
 is not just the image of precariousness 
 that informality here  the informal is really a set of socioeconomic and political procedures
 that we could translate as artists that this is about a bottom up urbanization that performs
  performs  see here  buildings are not important just for their looks but in fact they are important for what they can do 
 they truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate
 the spaces and boundaries and resources  so while waste flows southbound
  people go north in search of dollars  and most of my research has had to do with the impact of immigration
 in the alteration of the homogeneity of many neighborhoods in the united states  particularly in san diego  
 and i 'm talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of southern california
 depends on the retrofitting of the large
  social and economic 
 i 'm referring to how immigrants when they come to these neighborhoods they begin to alter the one dimensionality of parcels and properties
 into more
 socially and economically complex systems as they begin to plug an informal economy into a garage or as they build an illegal granny flat
 to support an extended family
  socioeconomic
 entrepreneurship on the ground
 within these neighborhoods
 really begins to suggest ways of translating that
 into new inclusive and more equitable land use policies so many stories emerge from these dynamics of
  which tells the story of a small house that saved itself it did not travel to mexico 
 but it was retrofitted in the end into a buddhist temple and in so doing this small house transforms or mutates
 from a singular dwelling into a small or a micro socioeconomic and cultural infrastructure
 inside a neighborhood  so these action neighborhoods as i call them really
  become the inspiration to imagine other interpretations of citizenship that have less to do  in fact  with belonging to the 
  more with upholding the notion of citizenship as a creative act
 that reorganizes institutional protocols in the spaces of the city 
  in fact in the visualization of citizenship  
 the gathering of many anecdotes urban stories in order to narrativize
 the relationship between social processes and spaces this
 is a story of a group of teenagers
 that one night a few months ago  decided to invade this space under the freeway
 to begin
 constructing their own skateboard park with shovels in hand they started to dig  two weeks later  the police stopped them  
 they barricaded the place and the teenagers were evicted and the teenagers decided to fight back not with bank cards or slogans
 but with constructing a critical process the first thing they did was to recognize the specificity of political
  in that empty space they found out that they had been lucky
 because they had not begun to dig under caltrans territoy 
 caltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway  
 so it would have been very difficult to negotiate with them they were lucky they said because they began to dig under an arm of the freeway
 that belongs to the local municipality  
 they were also lucky they said  because they began to dig in a sort of bermuda triangle of jurisdiction between port authority
  airport authority  two city districts and a review board  
 all these red lines are the invisible political institutions that were inscribed in that leftover empty space 
 with this knowledge these teenagers as skaters confronted the city  they came to the city attorney 's
  the city attorney told them that in order to continue the negotiation they had to become an ngo and of course they didn 't know what an ngo was they had to
 talk to their friends in seattle who had gone through the same experience  and they began to realize the necessity to organize themselves even deeper
 and began to fundraise to organize budgets to really be aware of all the knowledge embedded in the urban code
 in san diego so that they could begin to redefine
  the very meaning of public space
 in the city  expanding it to other categories at the end the teenagers won the case with that evidence  
 and they were able to construct their skateboard park under that freeway  
 now for many of you this story might seem trivial or naive for me as an architect it has become a fundamental narrative because
 it begins to teach me that 
 not only designed another category of public space but they also designed the socioeconomic protocols that were necessary to be inscribed in that space for its long term sustainability  
 they also taught me
 that similar to the migrant communities on both sides of the border  they engaged conflict itself as a creative tool
 because they had to produce a process
 that enabled them to reorganize resources and the politics of the city 
 in that that act that informal bottom up act of transgression 
 really began to trickle up
 to transform top down policy  now this
 journey
  to the transformation of the top down is where i find hope today and i 'm thinking of how these modest
 alterations
 with space and with policy in many cities in the world  in primarily the urgency
 of a collective imagination as these communities reimagine their own forms of governance social organization and infrastructure 
 really is at the center
  of the new formation
 of democratic politics of the urban it is in fact this that could become the framework
 for producing new social and economic justice in the city i want to say this and emphasize it because
 this is the only way i see
 that can enable us to move from urbanizations of consumption
 to neighborhoods of production today  thank you
