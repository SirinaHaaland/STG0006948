  the nairobi national park those are my dad 's cows at the back  and behind the cows that 's the nairobi national park 
 nairobi national park is not fenced in the south widely which
  means wild animals like zebras
 migrate out of the park freely so predators like lions
 follow them  and this is what they do they kill our livestock this
 is one of the cows which was killed at night  and i just woke up in the morning and i found it dead  and
 i felt so bad
  because it was the only bull we had 
 my community the maasai we believe that we came from heaven
 with all our animals and all the land
 for herding them  and that 's why we value them so much  so i grew up hating lions so much  the morans
 are the warriors who protect our community
 and the livestock  and they 're also upset about this problem  so
 they kill the lions it 's one of the six lions which were killed in nairobi  
 and i think this is why the nairobi national park lions are few  so a boy from six to nine
  is responsible for his dad 's cows and that 's the same same thing which happened to me  so i had to find a way of solving this problem  
 and the first idea i got
 was to use fire  because i thought lions
 were scared of fire  but i came to realize that that didn 't really help because
 it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed
  so i didn 't give up i continued  and a second idea i got
 was to use a scarecrow  i was trying to trick the lions [ into thinking ] that i was standing near the cowshed  
 but lions are very clever 
 they will come the first day and they see the
  i was walking around the cowshed with a torch  and that day the lions didn 't come and i discovered that lions
 are afraid of a moving light  so i had an idea
  since i was a small boy  i used to work in my room for the whole day 
 and i even took apart my mom 's new radio  and that day she almost killed me 
 but i learned a lot about electronics 
 so
 i got an old car battery 
 an indicator box it 's a small device found in a motorcycle  and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left it blinks
  and i got a switch where i can switch on the lights on and off  and that 's a small torch from a broken flashlight  
 so i set up everything  
 as you can see the solar panel charges the battery  and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box i call it a transformer
  indicator box
 makes the lights flash  as you can see the bulbs face outside because that 's where the lions come from  
 and that 's how it looks to lions when they come at night the lights
 flash and trick the lions into thinking i was walking around the cowshed  but i was sleeping in my bed
  it up in my home two years ago  and since then we have never experienced any problem with lions  and
 my neighboring homes heard about this idea one of them was this grandmother 
 she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions and she asked me if i could put the lights for
  the lights you can see at the back those are the lion lights  
 since now i 've set up seven homes around my community and they 're really working 
 and my idea is also being used now all over kenya
 for scaring other predators like hyenas  leopards and it 's also being used
 to scare elephants away from people 's farms
 because of this invention  i was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools
 in kenya  brookhouse international school  and i 'm really excited about this my new school now is coming in
 and helping
 by fundraising and creating an awareness i even took my friends back to my community
  and we 're installing the lights
 to the homes which don 't have [ any ] and i 'm teaching them how to put them so one year ago  i was just a boy in the savanna grassland
 herding my father 's cows and i used to see planes flying over  and
 i told myself that one day i 'll be there
  a chance to come by plane for my first time for ted so my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when i grow up 
 i used to hate lions  but now because my invention
 is saving my father 's cows and the lions we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict
  you have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours so you got
  invention is i want to make an electric fence ca electric fence rt but i know electric fences are already invented but i want to make mine ca 
 you already tried it once right and you rt i tried it before but i stopped because it gave me a shock
