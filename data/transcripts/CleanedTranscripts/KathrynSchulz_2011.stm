  i 'm in college  and a friend and i go on a road trip from providence rhode island to portland oregon and you know we 're
  so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests
 basically the longest route we can possibly take  
 and somewhere in the middle of south dakota  i turn to my friend
 and i ask her a question that 's been bothering me for two thousand miles
  what 's up with the chinese character i keep seeing by the side of the road 
 my friend looks at me totally blankly 
 there 's actually a gentleman in the front row who 's doing a perfect imitation of her look 
 laughter and i 'm like you know all the signs we keep seeing with the chinese character on them
  at me for a few moments  
 and then she cracks up because she figures out what i 'm talking about 
 and what i 'm talking about is this 
 laughter right the famous chinese character for picnic area
  i 've spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this
 why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us and how we behave when that happens  
 and what all of this can tell us about human nature 
 in other words as you heard chris say  i 've spent the last
 five years thinking about being wrong 
 this might strike you as a strange career move  
 but it actually has one great advantage  no job competition 
 in fact  most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong  
 or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong
 we get it in the abstract we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes the human species in general
  is fallible okay fine  
 but when it comes down to me right now to all the beliefs i hold here in the present tense  
 suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility
 goes out the window
 and i can 't actually think of anything i 'm wrong about 
 and the thing is the present tense is where we live
 we go to meetings in the present tense  we go on family vacations in the present tense  we go to the polls and vote in the present tense  
 so effectively we all kind of wind up
 traveling through life trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything 
 i think this is a problem i think it 's a problem for each of us as individuals in our personal and professional lives
 and i think it 's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture  
 so what i want to do today is first of all talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right  
 and second why it 's such a problem  
 and finally i want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling
 and that if you can do so it is the single greatest moral
  intellectual and creative leap you can make 
 so why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right 
 one reason actually has to do with a feeling of being wrong  so let me ask you guys something
 or actually let me ask you guys something because you 're right here how does it feel emotionally
 how does it feel to be wrong
  down  embarrassing okay wonderful great  dreadful thumbs down embarrassing
 thank you these are great answers  but they 're answers to a different question 
 you guys are answering the question how does it feel to realize you 're wrong 
  realizing you 're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things right i mean it can be devastating it can be revelatory it can actually be quite funny like my stupid chinese character mistake  
 but just being wrong
 doesn 't feel like anything 
 i 'll give you an analogy do
 you remember that loony tunes cartoon where there 's this pathetic coyote who 's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner 
 in pretty much every episode of this cartoon 
 there 's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner
 and the roadrunner runs off a cliff  which is fine he 's a bird he can fly  
 but the thing is the coyote runs off the cliff right after him  and what 's funny
 at least if you 're six years old is that the coyote 's totally fine too he just keeps running
 right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he 's in mid air that 's when he falls
  when we 're wrong about something
 not when we realize it but before that we 're like that coyote
 after he 's gone off the cliff and before he looks down 
 you know  we 're already wrong we 're already in trouble  but we feel like we 're on solid ground  
 so i should actually correct something i said a moment ago
  it does feel like something to be wrong  it feels like being right 
 so this is one reason a structural reason why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness i call this error blindness 
 most of the time we don 't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we 're wrong about something until it 's too late
  but there 's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well and this one is cultural 
 think back for a moment to elementary school you 're sitting there in class and your teacher is handing back quiz papers  
 and one of them looks like this this is not mine by the way 
 so there you are in grade school  and you know exactly
  to think about the kid who got this paper it 's the dumb kid the troublemaker the one who never does his homework  
 so by the time you are nine years old 
 you 've already learned first of all that people who get stuff wrong are lazy irresponsible dimwits
 and
  the way to succeed in life
 is to never make any mistakes  
 we learn these really bad lessons really well and a lot of us
 and i suspect especially a lot of us in this room
 deal with them by just becoming perfect little a students perfectionists
  except that
 then we freak out at the possibility that we 've gotten something wrong  
 because according to this getting something wrong
  something wrong with us  
 so we just insist that we 're right  because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe  
 so let me tell you a story a couple of years ago a woman comes into beth israel deaconess medical center for a surgery  beth israel 's in boston
  it 's the teaching hospital for harvard one of the best hospitals in the country  
 so this woman comes in and she 's taken into the operating room she 's anesthetized the surgeon does his thing stitches her back up sends her out to the recovery room 
 everything seems to have gone fine  
 and she wakes up and she looks down at herself  and she says 
 why is the wrong side of my body in bandages 
 well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one
 when the vice president for health care quality at beth israel spoke about this incident 
 he said something very interesting 
 he said for whatever reason  
 the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient 
  the point of this story
 is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything
 can be very dangerous this internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often
 is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world 
 and when we act like it is  and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong  
 well that 's when we
  up doing things like dumping two hundred million gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico or torpedoing the global economy  
 so this is a huge practical problem  
 but it 's also a huge social problem think for a moment about what it means to feel right 
 it means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality  
  feel that way  you 've got a problem to solve  which is how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you 
 it turns out most of us explain those people the same way  by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions  
 the first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us
 is we just assume they 're ignorant
  they don 't have access to the same information that we do and when we generously share that information with them they 're going to see the light and come on over to our team 
 when that doesn 't work when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us then we move on to a second assumption  
 which is that they 're idiots they
 have all the right pieces of the puzzle and they are too moronic to put them together correctly  
 and when that doesn 't work
  it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do
 and are actually pretty smart then we move on to a third assumption  
 they know the truth  and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes  
 so this is a
  attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to
 and causes us to treat each other terribly  but to me what 's most
 baffling and most tragic about this
 is that it misses the whole point of being human it 's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just
 gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds
  and we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing 
 that is not true and if it were life would be incredibly boring  the miracle of your mind
 isn 't that you can see the world as it is  it 's that you can see the world as it isn 't 
 we can remember the past and we can think about the future
  and we can imagine what it 's like to be some other person in some other place  
 and we all do this a little differently  which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this
 and also this
 and also this 
 and yeah it is also why we get things wrong one thousand two hundred years before descartes said his famous thing about i think
  i am this guy st augustine sat down and wrote fallor ergo sum i err therefore i am 
 augustine understood that our capacity to screw up it 's not some kind of
 embarrassing defect in the human system something we can eradicate or overcome it 's totally fundamental to who we are 
 because unlike god
 really know what 's going on out there 
 and unlike all of the other animals we are obsessed with trying to figure it out 
 to me this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity
 last year for various reasons i found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the public radio show this american life
 and so i 'm listening and i 'm listening and at some point i start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong  
 and my first thought was 
 i 've lost it i 've become the crazy wrongness lady i just imagined it everywhere which has happened
  but a couple of months later i actually had a chance to interview ira glass who 's the host of the show and i mentioned this to him
  and he was like no actually that 's true in fact he says as a staff we joke that every single episode of our show has the same 
 and the crypto theme is ' i thought this one thing was going to happen
 and something else happened instead ' and the thing is says ira glass we need this we need these moments of
  surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work and for the rest of us audience members as listeners as readers  
 we eat this stuff up  we love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings 
 when it comes to our stories  we love being wrong  
 but you know our stories
  are like this because our lives are like this we think this one thing is going to happen
 and something else happens instead  
 george bush thought he was going to invade iraq find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction liberate the people and bring democracy to the middle east  
 and something else happened instead  and hosni mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of egypt for the rest of his life until he got too
  old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son  
 and something else happened instead  and maybe you thought you were going to
 grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together and something else happened instead  
 and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody
  hates for an audience that would never materialize  and something else happened instead 
 i mean this is life
 for good and for ill  we generate these incredible stories about the world around us 
 and then the world turns around and astonishes us
 is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong  
 we just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements  but
 you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements  because half the stuff that 's the most
  so here we are again
  another idea  we tell another story  we hold another conference 
 the theme of this one as you guys have now heard seven million times is the rediscovery of wonder  
 and to me if you really want to rediscover wonder you need to step outside
  of rightness
 and look around at each other
 and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe
 and be able to say wow  i don 't know maybe i 'm wrong
