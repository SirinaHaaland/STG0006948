  you should be nice to nerds  in fact  i 'd go so far as to say if you don 't already have a nerd in your life you should get one
  i 'm just saying  scientists and engineers change the world
 i 'd like to tell you about a magical place called darpa where scientists and engineers defy the impossible and refuse to fear failure  
 now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize  because when you remove the fear of
  impossible things suddenly become possible 
 if you want to know how ask yourself this question 
 what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail  
 if you really ask yourself this question  you can 't help but feel uncomfortable 
 i feel a little uncomfortable 
 because when you ask it you begin to
  understand how the fear of failure constrains you  how it keeps us from attempting great things 
 and life
 gets dull 
 amazing things stop happening  sure  good things happen but amazing things stop happening  
 now i should be clear
  'm not encouraging failure  i 'm discouraging fear of failure  
 because it 's not failure itself that constrains us the path to truly new
  things always has failure along the way we 're tested  and in part that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving
  something great 
 clemenceau said life gets interesting when we fail  because it 's a sign that we 've surpassed ourselves
  expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in ten million years we could build an aircraft that would fly  and two months later on december 
 orville wright powered the first airplane across a beach in north carolina the flight lasted twelve seconds and covered
  one year later the next declarations of impossibilities began ferdinand foch a french army general credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds in the french army 
 said airplanes are interesting toys  but of no military value 
 forty years later  aero experts coined the term
  transonic  they debated should it have one s or two 
 you see  they were having trouble in this flight regime  and it wasn 't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound in one thousand nine 
 there was no wind tunnel data beyond mach
  chuck yeager climbed into the cockpit of his bell x 1 and he flew towards an unknown possibility  
 and in so doing he became the first pilot to fly faster
 than the speed of sound
 six of eight atlas rockets blew up on the pad  
 after eleven complete mission failures we got our first images from space  and on that first flight we got more data than in all u 2 missions combined  
 it took a lot of failures to get there
 since we took to the sky we have wanted to fly faster
 and farther 
 and to do so we 've had to believe in impossible things and we 've had to refuse to fear failure  
 that 's still true today
  we don 't talk about flying transonically  or even supersonically  we talk about flying hypersonically
 not mach two or mach three mach twenty 
 at mach twenty we can fly from new york to long beach in eleven minutes and twenty seconds 
 at that speed  the surface of the airfoil is the temperature of molten steel three thousand five hundred degrees
  fahrenheit like a blast furnace we are essentially burning the airfoil as we fly it 
 and we are flying it or trying to 
 darpa 's hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built  it 's boosted
  the minotaur iv has too much impulse  so we have to bleed it off by flying the rocket at an eighty nine degree angle of attack for portions of the trajectory 
 that 's an unnatural act for a rocket 
 the third stage has a camera  we call it rocketcam  and it 's pointed at the hypersonic glider 
 this is the actual
  rocketcam footage from flight one  
 now to conceal the shape we changed the aspect ratio a little bit  but this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider 
 as it heads into the atmosphere back towards earth  
 but we collected more hypersonic flight data than in thirty years of ground based testing combined
  and in the second flight 
 three minutes of 
 aerodynamic flight at mach twenty  we must fly
  require that you fly  you can 't learn to fly at mach twenty unless you fly  
 and while there 's no substitute for speed  maneuverability is a very close second 
 if a mach twenty glider takes eleven minutes and twenty seconds to get from new york to long
  a hummingbird would take well days
 you see hummingbirds are not hypersonic but they are maneuverable in fact  
 the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards  it can fly up down  forwards  backwards  even
 and so if we wanted to fly in this room or places where humans can 't go we 'd need an aircraft small
  enough and maneuverable enough to do so 
 this is a hummingbird drone  
 it can fly in all directions  even backwards  it can hover and rotate this prototype aircraft
 is equipped with a video camera  it weighs
  it does not eat nectar
 in two thousand and eight it flew for a whopping twenty seconds a year later two minutes then six eventually eleven 
 many prototypes crashed
 many  but there 's no way to learn to fly like a
  matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot 
 failure is part of creating 
 new and amazing things  we cannot both fear failure
  or maybe even ice a robot that can run like a cheetah or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human 
 or perhaps spider man will one day be gecko man 
 a gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe one square millimeter
 of a gecko 's footpad has fourteen thousand hair like structures called setae
  they are used to help it grip to surfaces using intermolecular forces  
 today we can manufacture structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko 's foot the result
  can support a static load of six hundred and sixty pounds  
 that 's enough to stick six 42 inch plasma tv 's to your wall no nails 
 so much for velcro  right  and it 's not just passive structures it 's entire
  is a spider mite  it 's one millimeter long but it looks like godzilla next to these micromachines 
 in the world of godzilla spider mites we can make millions of mirrors  each one fifth the diameter of a human hair 
 moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second to make large screen displays  so that we can watch movies like
 and if we can build machines at that scale  what about eiffel tower like trusses at the microscale  
 today we are making metals that are lighter than styrofoam 
 so light they can sit atop a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air
 so light
 that you can make a car that two people can lift but so strong that it has the crash worthiness of an suv 
 from the smallest wisp of air to the powerful forces of nature 's storms 
 there are forty four lightning strikes per second around the globe  each
  lightning bolt heats the air to forty four thousand degrees fahrenheit hotter than the surface of the sun what if we could use these electromagnetic pulses as beacons  
 beacons in a moving network of powerful transmitters  
 experiments suggest that lightning could be the next gps  
 electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains
  using a grid the size of your thumb with thirty two electrodes on the surface of his brain tim uses his thoughts
 to control
 an advanced prosthetic arm
  and his thoughts made him reach for katie this is the first time
 a human has controlled a robot with
  thought alone
  and it is the first time that tim has held katie 's hand in seven years 
 that moment mattered to tim and katie 
 and this green goo may someday matter to you  this green goo
 is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life it was made in tobacco plants
 tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months  
 and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever
  and if it seems far fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy what about gamers that could solve problems that experts can 't solve 
  september  the gamers of foldit
 solved the  three dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to aids in rhesus monkeys now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments 
 for fifteen years it was unsolved
  in the scientific community  the gamers of foldit solved it in fifteen days  
 now they were able to do so by working together they were able to work together because they 're connected by the internet  and others 
 also connected to the internet used it as an instrument of democracy  
  people or thirty percent of the world 's population  it allows us to contribute
 and to be heard as individuals  it allows us to amplify
 our voices and our power as a group  but it too
  the internet was but a dream a few sketches on a piece of paper 
 and then on october 29th the first  packet switched message was sent from  ucla to sri the first two letters of the word login 
 that 's all that made it through
 an l and an o and then a buffer overflow crashed the system
  o now a worldwide force 
 so who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called darpa 
 they are nerds  
 and they are heroes among us 
 they challenge existing perspectives at the edges of science and under the most demanding of conditions
 they remind us that we can change the world
 if we defy the impossible
 and we refuse to fear failure  they remind us that we all have
 nerd power  sometimes we just forget  
  there was a time when you weren 't afraid of failure when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing you were good at math you could build things you were an astronaut 
 an adventurer jacques cousteau you could jump higher run faster kick harder than anyone  you believed in impossible things and you were fearless 
  you were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero
 scientists and engineers
 can indeed change the world so can you  you were born to 
 so go ahead ask yourself what would you attempt to do
 if you knew you could not fail  now i want to say  this is not easy  it 's hard
  to hold onto this feeling really hard i guess in some way i sort of believe it 's supposed to be hard 
 doubt and fear always creep in we think someone else someone smarter than us someone more capable  someone with more resources will solve that problem  but there isn 't anyone else  
 there 's just you  
 and if we 're lucky
  in that moment someone steps into that doubt and fear takes a hand and says 
 let me help you believe 
 jason harley did that for me  jason started at darpa on march 18th two thousand and ten he
 with our transportation team 
 i saw jason nearly every day sometimes twice a day and more so than most he saw the highs and the lows  the celebrations and the disappointments  
 and on one
 particularly dark day for me  jason sat down and he wrote an email 
  and when he hit send  he probably didn 't realize what a difference it would make it mattered to me  in that moment
 and still today when i doubt when i feel afraid 
 when i need to reconnect
  i remember his words  they were so powerful
  there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you 
 and remember be nice to nerds
  what happened on that second flight yeah it also went into the pacific 
 we didn 't fly it into the pacific 
 no there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed  and so in the second flight
  we were able to get three minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it ca i
 imagine you 're not planning to open up to passenger service from new york to long beach anytime soon rd it might be a little warm ca 
 what do you picture that glider being used for rd 
 well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this how it 's ultimately used will be determined by the
  the purpose of the vehicle though the purpose of the technology is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than sixty minutes ca 
 and to carry a payload of more than a few pounds like what 's the payload it could carry rd 
 well i don 't think we ultimately know what it will be right we 've got to fly it first ca but not necessarily just a camera  
  you started your beautiful sequence on flight with with a
 plane kind of trying to flap its wings and failing horribly  and there haven 't been that many planes built since that flap
 why did we think that this was the time to go biomimicry and copy a hummingbird isn 't that a very expensive
  solution for a small
 maneuverable flying object rd so i mean  in part  we wondered if it was possible to do it and you have to revisit these questions over time 
 the folks at aerovironment tried three hundred or more different wing designs twelve different forms of the avionics
  took them ten full prototypes to get something that would actually fly  but there 's something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something 
 you 'd recognize  so we often talk about stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing  but when things looks just natural you also don 't see them
  my headquarters 
 because i think as well as the awe of looking at that i 'm sure some people here are thinking  technology catches up so quick how long is it before some crazed
 geek with a little remote control flies one through a window of the white house i mean do you worry about the pandora 's box issue here
  singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise  that 's what we do 
 it would be inconceivable for us to do that work
 if we didn 't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time 
 it 's just the nature of what we do  now our responsibility is to push that edge and
 we have to be of
  course mindful and responsible of how the technology is developed and ultimately used but we can 't simply close our eyes and pretend that it isn 't advancing  it 's advancing ca i
 mean you 're clearly a really inspiring leader
 and you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention but at a personal
  can 't imagine doing your job do you wake up in the night sometimes just
 asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of of your team 's brilliance rd 
 sure  i think you couldn 't be human if you didn 't ask those questions ca how do you answer them rd 
 well i don 't always have answers for them  right  i think that
  my job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have i work with some of the most amazing people and
 with that exhilaration comes a really deep sense of responsibility  
 and so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of
  thank you so much for coming to
