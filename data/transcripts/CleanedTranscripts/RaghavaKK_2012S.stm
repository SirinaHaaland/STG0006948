  years ago my grandfather a young man walked into a tent that was converted into a movie theater like that 
 and he fell hopelessly in love with the woman he saw on the silver screen  none other than mae west
  heartthrob of the ' 30s 
 and he could never forget her in fact when he had his daughter many years later 
 he wanted to name her after mae west but can you imagine an indian child name mae west 
 the indian family said  no way so when my twin brother kaesava was born 
 he decided to tinker with the spelling of keshava
  so he changed kaesava 's spelling  
 now kaesava had a baby boy called rehan a couple of weeks ago  he decided to spell or rather misspell raehan with an a e 
 you know my grandfather died many years ago when i was little  but his love for mae west lives on as a misspelling in the dna of his progeny 
 that for me is
  legacy you know
 as for me my wife and i have our own crazy legacy project  
 we actually sit every few years  argue  disagree  fight  and actually come up with our very own  200 year plan 
 our friends think we 're mad our parents think we 're cuckoo  because you know we both come from families that
  really look up to humility and wisdom  but we both like to live larger than life i believe in the concept of a raja yogi be a dude 
 before you can become an ascetic this is me being a rock star even if it 's in my own house  
  what do we mean by beyond ourselves  
 well two hundred years we calculated is at the end of our direct contact with the world there 's nobody i 'll meet in my life
 will ever live beyond two hundred years 
 so we thought that 's a perfect place where we should situate our plan and let our imagination take flight  you know i never really believed in legacy what am i going to leave behind i 'm an artist
  i made a cartoon about nine eleven it caused so much trouble for me i was so upset  
 you know  a cartoon that was meant to be a cartoon of the week
 ended up staying so much longer  now i 'm in the business of creating art
 that will definitely even outlive me  and i think about what i want to leave behind
 through those paintings 
  the nine eleven cartoon upset me so much
 that i decided i 'll never cartoon again  i said i 'm never going to make any honest public commentary again  
 but of course i continued creating artwork that was honest and raw  
 because i forgot about how people reacted to my work you know sometimes forgetting is so important to remain idealistic  
 perhaps loss of memory is so crucial for our survival as human beings
  most important things in my 200 year plan that netra and i write
 is what to forget about ourselves you know we carry so much baggage from our parents from our society from so many people fears  insecurities
 and our 200 year plan really lists all our childhood problems that we have to expire
  we actually put an expiry date on all our childhood problems 
 the latest date i put was i said  i am going to expire my fear of my leftist feminist mother in law 
 and this today is the date 
 laughs she 's watching 
 you know  i really make decisions all the time about how i want to remember myself and that 's the most important
  kind of decisions i make 
 and this directly translates into my paintings  
 but like my friends  i can do that really well on facebook pinterest twitter flickr  youtube name it i 'm on it 
 i 've started outsourcing my memory to the digital world  you know  but that comes with a problem  it 's so easy to think of technology
  as a metaphor for memory  but our brains are not perfect storage devices like technology we only remember what we want to at least i do  
 and i rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory  
 you know  and if technology is not a metaphor for memory what is it 
 netra and i use our technology as a tool in our
  that is a picture of my mother  and she recently got a facebook account  you know where this is going  
 and i 've been very supportive until this picture shows up on my facebook page 
 and
 i actually untagged myself first then i picked up the phone i said mom you will never put a picture of me in a bikini
  you just don 't understand maybe we are among the first generation that really understands this digital curating of ourselves  
 maybe we are the first to even actively record our lives  
 you know  whether you agree with 
 you know legacy or not we are actually leaving behind digital traces all the time so netra and i really wanted to use our
  digital legacy  and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future 
 how you may ask 
 when i think of the future  i never see myself moving forward in time i actually see time moving backward towards me 
 i can actually visualize my future approaching  i can dodge what i don 't want and pull in what i want
 like a video game obstacle course  and i 've gotten better and better at doing this even when i make a painting  i actually imagine
 i 'm behind the painting it already exists and someone 's looking at it  
 and i see whether they 're feeling it from their gut are they feeling it from their heart or is it just a cerebral thing and it really informs my
  even when i do an art show i really think about what should people walk away with
 i remember when i was nineteen i did  
 i wanted to do my first art exhibition  and i wanted the whole world to know about it i didn 't know ted then  
 but what i did was i closed my eyes tight and i started dreaming  
 i could imagine people coming in dressed up looking beautiful my paintings with all the light 
 and in my visualization i actually saw a very famous
 launching my show giving credibility to me  
 and i woke up from my visualization and i said  who was that i couldn 't tell if it was shabana azmi or rekha two very famous indian actresses like the meryl streeps of india 
 as it turned out  next morning i wrote a letter to both of them  and
  and shabana azmi replied  and came and launched my very first show twelve years ago  and what a bang it started my career with  
 you know  when we think of time in this way  we can curate not only the future
 but also the past this is a picture of my family and that is netra my wife she 's the co creator of my
  netra 's a high school history teacher  i love netra  but i hate history  
 i keep saying nets  you live in the past while i 'll create the future and when i 'm done you can study about it 
 she gave me an indulgent smile  and as punishment she said tomorrow i 'm teaching a class on indian history  and you are sitting in it and i 'm grading you
 she started by giving students
 primary source documents from india  pakistan from britain and i said wow 
 then she asked them to separate fact from bias
  as an imaging tool 
 i was so inspired  i went and created my own version of indian history  i actually included stories from my grandmother she used to work for the telephone exchange  and she used to actually overhear conversations between nehru and edwina mountbatten  
 and she used to hear all kinds of things she shouldn 't have
  i include things like that this is my version of indian history  you know  
 if this is so it occurred to me that maybe just maybe the primary objective of our brains
 is to serve our dignity  go tell facebook to figure that out  netra and i don 't write
  for someone else to come and execute it
 in one hundred and fifty years imagine receiving a parcel saying 
 from the past okay now you 're supposed to spend the rest of your life doing all of this no we actually write it only to set our attitudes right  
 you know
 i used to believe that education is the most important tool to leave a meaningful legacy 
 education is great it really teaches us who we are and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world
  but it 's really my creativity that 's taught me that i can be much more than what my education told me i am 
 i 'd like to make the argument that creativity is the most important tool we have it lets us create who we are 
 and curate what is to come 
 i like to think thank you i like to think of myself as a storyteller where my past
  my future
 are only stories my stories  waiting to be told and retold 
 i hope all of you one day get a chance to share and write your own 200 year story thank you so much
