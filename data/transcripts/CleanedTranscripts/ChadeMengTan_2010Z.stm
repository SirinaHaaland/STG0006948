  does the happiest man in the world look like he certainly doesn 't look like me he looks like this 
 his name is matthieu ricard so
  how do you get to be the happiest man in the world 
 well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain 
 and you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fmri versus the right prefrontal cortex  
 and matthieu 's happiness measure is off the charts he 's by far the happiest man ever measured by science
  which leads us to a question
  what was he thinking when he was being measured  perhaps something very naughty 
 actually  he was
 meditating on compassion matthieu 's own experience
 is that compassion is the happiest state ever reading about matthieu was one of the pivotal moments of my life
  dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime
 and to do that by creating
 the conditions for inner peace
 and compassion
 on a global scale  and learning about matthieu
 gave me a new angle to look at my work matthieu 's brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore
  is something that creates happiness compassion is fun and
 insight changes the entire game  
 because if compassion was a chore  nobody 's going to do it except maybe the dalai lama or something  but if compassion was fun
  everybody 's going to do it therefore to create the conditions for global compassion
 all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun  
 but fun is not enough what if compassion is also
 profitable  what if compassion is also good for business then
  boss every manager in the world will want to have compassion
 like this that would create the conditions for world peace  
 so i started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting  
 fortunately i didn 't have to look very far because what i was looking for was right in front of my eyes in google my company
  i know there
 are other compassionate companies in the world but google is the place i 'm familiar with because i 've been there for ten years  so i 'll use google as as the case study 
 google is a company born of idealism it 's a company that thrives on idealism 
 and maybe because of that 
  in google expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern it 's sort of a funny pattern it starts with a small group of googlers
 taking the initiative to do something  
 and they don 't usually ask for permission they just go ahead and do it 
 and then other googlers join in and it just gets bigger and bigger and sometimes it gets big enough to become official
 in other words  it almost always starts from the bottom up 
 and let me give you some examples  the first example is the largest annual community event where googlers from around the world
 donate their labor to their local communities
 was initiated and organized by three employees
 before it became official  because it just became too big another example
 three googlers a chef an engineer
 and most funny a massage therapist
 three of them  they learned about a region in india
 where two hundred thousand people live without a single medical facility so what do they do they just go ahead and start a fundraiser  
 and they raise enough money
 to build this hospital
 the first hospital of its kind for two hundred
  thousand people  during the haiti earthquake a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and 
  stayed overnight to build a tool
 to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones and expressions of compassion are also found in our international
  the largest social action competition in china  
 involving more than one thousand schools in china working on issues such as education  poverty health care
 and the environment there is so much organic social action all around google
 that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts
 and this idea again  came from the grassroots from two googlers
 who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job 
 and i found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy it was
 two persons saying
 that google is a compassionate company because googlers found compassion to be fun  
 but again fun is not enough there
 are also real business benefits  so what are they the first benefit of compassion
 is that it creates highly effective business leaders
  what does that mean  there are three components of compassion there is
 the affective component  which is i feel for you there is the cognitive component  which is i understand you 
 and there is a motivational component  which is i want to help you 
 so what has this got to do
  according to a very comprehensive study led by jim collins and documented in the book good to great it takes a very special kind of leader
 to bring a company from goodness
 to greatness  and he calls them level five leaders these are leaders who in addition to being highly
  and they are
 humility
 and ambition 
 these are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good  
 and because they 're ambitious for a greater good they feel no need to inflate their own egos  
 and they according to the research  make the best business leaders 
  if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion
 understanding people and empathizing with people inhibits  tones down  what i call the excessive
  in us  therefore creating the conditions for humility the motivational component of compassion creates ambition
 for greater good 
 in other words compassion is the way to grow level five leaders  
 and this is the first compelling business benefit
  the second compelling benefit of compassion
 is that it creates an inspiring workforce  employees
  towards greater good it creates a vibrant  energetic community where people admire and respect each other i mean you come to work in the morning
 and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in india it 's like how can you not be inspired by those people
 your own coworkers  so this mutual inspiration
  and creativity it makes us a highly effective company 
 so having said all that what is the secret formula for brewing compassion
 in the corporate setting in our experience there are three ingredients the first ingredient
 is to create a culture of passionate concern for the greater good
  so always think how is your company and your job
 serving the greater good or how can you further serve the greater good 
 this awareness of serving the greater good is very self inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in
  autonomy  
 so in google there 's a lot of autonomy  and one of our most popular managers jokes that this is what he says google is a place
 where the inmates run the asylum 
 and he considers himself one of the inmates if you already have a culture of compassion
 and idealism
 and you let your people roam free
  they will do the right thing
 in the most compassionate way  the third ingredient
 is to focus on inner development
 and personal growth leadership training in google for example  places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities such as
 that leadership begins with
 character we even created a seven week curriculum
 on emotion intelligence  which we jokingly call searching inside yourself it
 's less naughty than it sounds  
 so i 'm an engineer by training  but i 'm one of the creators and instructors of this course which i find kind of funny
 this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence
  any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training the idea here is to train attention
 to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time  and this
  so using the supercharged attention from step one we create a 
 perception into the cognitive and emotive processes  what does that mean  it means being able to observe our thought stream
 and the process of emotion
 with high clarity  objectivity and from a third person perspective
  and once you can do that you create the kind of self knowledge that enables
 the third step following the second step is to create new mental habits
  imagine whenever you meet
 any other person  any time you meet a person  your habitual  instinctive first thought is i want you to be happy  
 i want you to be happy imagine you can do that having this habit this mental habit  changes everything at work  
 because this good will
 is unconsciously
 picked up by other people and it
 creates trust and trust creates a lot of
 good working relationships  and this also creates the conditions for compassion
 in the workplace 
 someday we hope to open source search inside yourself so that everybody in the corporate world
 will at least be able to use it as a
  and in closing  i want to end the same place i started with happiness  i want to quote this guy the guy in robes not the other guy
 the dalai lama who said if you want others to be happy  practice compassion if you want to be happy  
 practice compassion 
 i found this to be true both on the individual level
 and at a corporate level and i hope that compassion will be both
  fun and profitable for you too thank you
