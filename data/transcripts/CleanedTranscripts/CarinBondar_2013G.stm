  anyone in the room thought about sex today 
 yeah you did thank you for putting your hand up over there 
 well i 'm here to provide you with some biological validation for your sordid daydreams  i 'm here to tell you a few things that you might not have known about wild sex
 now when humans think about sex male and female forms are generally what come to mind 
 but for many millions of years  such specific categories didn 't even exist sex was a mere fusion of bodies or a trickle of dna shared between two or more beings it
 wasn 't until about five hundred million years ago that we start to see structures akin to a penis or a thing that gives dna out
 and a vagina  something that receives it
  now invariably you 're probably thinking about what belongs to our own species these very familiar structures but the diversity that we see in sexual structures in the animal 
  kingdom that has evolved in response to the multitude of factors surrounding reproduction
  so this is a paper nautilus it 's a close relative of squid and octopus  and males have a 
 just what is a hectocotylus a detachable  swimming
 penis it leaves the [ body of the male ] 
 finds the female through pheromonal cues in the water  attaches itself to her body and deposits the sperm for many decades biologists actually
  felt that the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether now
 the tapir is a mammal from south america  
 and the tapir has a prehensile penis it actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands  
 and it uses this dexterity to bypass the vagina altogether
  and deposit sperm directly into the female 's uterus not to mention
 it 's a pretty good size the biggest penis in the animal kingdom however is not that of the tapir the biggest
  ratio in the animal kingdom actually belongs to the meager beach barnacle  and this video is actually showing you what the human penis would look like if it were the same size as that
  all of this diversity in structure one might think then that penises are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place for the purposes of successful reproduction simply insert part a into slot b and we should all be good to go  
 but of course that doesn 't exactly happen and that 's because we can 't just take form into account we have to think about function as well  and when it comes to sex
  relates to the contributions made by the gametes or the sperm and the eggs  and these contributions are far from equal 
 eggs are very expensive to make so it makes sense for females to be very choosy about who she shares them with 
 sperm on the other hand is abundant
 and cheap  so it makes more sense for males to have a 
  strategy when it comes to
  generations  
 so how do animals cope with these very incongruent needs between the sexes i mean  if a female doesn 't choose a particular male or if she has the ability to store sperm and she simply has enough  
 then it makes more sense for her to spend her time doing other biologically relevant things  avoiding predators taking care of offspring  gathering and ingesting food 
 this is of course bad news
  for any male who has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank  and this sets the scene for some pretty drastic strategies for successful fertilization 
 this is bedbug sex  and it 's aptly termed traumatic insemination 
 males have a spiked barbed penis that they literally stab into the female and they don 't stab it anywhere near her vagina they stab
  it anywhere in her body and the sperm simply migrates through her hemolymph to her ovaries  
 if a female gets too many stab wounds or if a stab wound happens to become infected she can actually die from it  
 now if you 've ever been out for a nice peaceful walk by the lake and happened to see some ducks having sex 
 you 've undoubtedly been alarmed  because it looks like gang rape  and quite frankly that
  's exactly what it is a group of males will grab a female hold her down and
  their  spiral shaped penis into her  corkscrew shaped vagina
 over and over and over again  from flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second 
 now the female actually gets the last laugh though because she can actually manipulate her posture so as to
  allow the sperm of certain suitors better access to her ovaries now 
 i like to share stories like this with my audiences because yeah we humans we tend to think sex sex is fun sex is good there 's romance and there 's orgasm 
 but orgasm didn 't actually evolve until about sixty five million years ago with the advent of mammals but
  pleasing one 's partner
 earwig males have either really large penile appendages or really small ones it
 's a very simple genetically inherited trait and the males are not otherwise any different those that have long penile appendages are not bigger or stronger or otherwise any different at all 
 so going back to our biological minds then we might think that females should choose to have sex with the guys that have the shorter appendages
  because she can use her time for other things avoiding predators taking care of young  finding and ingesting food  
 but biologists have repeatedly observed that females choose to have sex with the males that have the long appendages  
 why do they do this well according to the biological literature during
  the genitalia of certain males may elicit more favorable female responses through superior mechanical or stimulatory interaction with the female reproductive tract mm hm 
 these are mexican guppies and what you see on their upper maxilla is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments and these filaments basically form
  a fish mustache if you will  now males have been observed to prod the female 's genital opening prior to copulating
  with her  and in what i have lovingly termed the magnum p i hypothesis 
 females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found with males that have these fish mustaches a
 little guppy porn for you right there so we 've seen very different strategies that males are using when it comes to
 winning a female partner we 've seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures
 are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex we 've also seen a titillation strategy where males are actually pleasing their female partners into choosing them as a sex partner  
 now unfortunately in the animal kingdom it 's the coercion strategy that we see
 time and time again  it 's very common in many
  from invertebrates to avian species mammals and of course  even in primates  
 now interestingly there are a few mammalian species in which females have evolved specialized genitalia that doesn 't allow for sexual coercion to take place 
 female elephants and female hyenas have a penile clitoris or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs
  much like a penis  and in fact it 's very difficult to sex these animals by merely looking at their external morphology  
 so before a male can insert his penis into a female 's vagina she has to take this penile clitoris and basically inside out it in her own body  
 i mean imagine putting a penis into another penis it 's simply not going to happen unless the female is on board with the action  
 now even more interesting is the fact that elephant and hyena societies are entirely matriarchal
  they 're run by females groups of females sisters  aunts and offspring  and when young males
 attain sexual maturity  they 're turfed out of the group 
 in hyena societies adult males are actually the lowest on the social scale they can take part in a kill only after everybody else 
  so it seems that when you take the penis power away from a male you take away all the social power he has 
 so what are my  take home messages from my talk today well sex is just so much more than insert part a into slot b and hope that the offspring run around everywhere  
 the sexual strategies and reproductive structures that we see in the animal kingdom basically
 dictate how males and females will react to each other
  which then dictates how populations and societies form and evolve  
 so it may not be surprising to any of you that animals including ourselves spend a good amount of time thinking about sex  
 but what might surprise you is the extent to which so many other aspects of their lives and our lives are influenced by it  
 so thank you and happy daydreaming
