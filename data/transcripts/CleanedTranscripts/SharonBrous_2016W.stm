  a new mother
 and a young rabbi in the spring of two thousand and four and the world was in shambles maybe you remember every day we heard devastating reports from the
 war in iraq there were waves of terror rolling across the globe it seemed like humanity was spinning out of control 
 i remember the night that i read about the series of coordinated bombings in the subway system in madrid  
 and i got up and i walked over to the crib where my six month old baby girl lay sleeping sweetly  and i heard the rhythm of her breath  
 and i felt this sense of urgency coursing through my body we were living through a time of tectonic shifts in
  ideologies in politics in religion in populations everything felt so precarious  
 and i remember thinking my god  what kind of world did we bring this child
 into  and what was i as a mother
 and a religious leader willing to do about it 
  i knew it was clear that religion would be a principle battlefield in this rapidly changing landscape  and it was already clear that religion was a significant part of the problem  
 the question for me was could religion also be part of the solution  
 now throughout history people have committed horrible crimes and atrocities in the name of religion 
 and as we entered the 21st century it was very clear that religious extremism
 was once again on the rise 
 our studies now show that over the course of the past fifteen twenty years  hostilities and religion related violence have been on the increase all over the world 
 but we don 't even need the studies to prove it because i ask you how many of us are surprised today when we hear the stories of a bombing or a shooting when we later find out that the last word that was uttered before the
  trigger is pulled or the bomb is detonated is the name of god 
 it barely raises an eyebrow today when we learn that yet another person has decided to show his love of god by taking the lives of god 's children 
 in america religious extremism looks like a white  antiabortion christian extremist walking into planned parenthood in colorado springs
  and murdering three people 
 it also looks like a couple inspired by the islamic state walking into an office party in san bernardino and killing fourteen  and even when
 extremism does not lead to violence it is still used as a political wedge issue  cynically leading people to justify the subordination of women  the stigmatization of lgbt people
  racism islamophobia and and anti semitism this ought to concern deeply those of us who care about the future of religion
 and the future of faith  we need to call this what it is a great failure of religion 
 but the thing is this isn 't even the only challenge that religion faces today 
 at the very same
  time that we need religion to be a strong force against extremism it is suffering from a second pernicious trend  
 what i call religious routine ism 
 this is when our institutions and our leaders are stuck in a paradigm that is rote and perfunctory devoid of life devoid of vision and devoid
  let me explain what i mean like this one of the great blessings of being a rabbi is standing under the chuppah under the wedding canopy with a couple 
 and helping them proclaim publicly and make holy the love that they found for one another 
 i want to ask you now though to think maybe from your own experience or maybe just imagine it about the difference between the intensity of the experience under the wedding canopy  
 and maybe the experience of the sixth or seventh anniversary
 and if you 're lucky enough to make it sixteen or seventeen years if you 're like most people you probably wake up in the morning realizing that you forgot 
  to make a reservation at your favorite restaurant and you forgot so much as a card and then you just hope and pray that your partner also forgot 
 to be a container in which we would hold on to the remnants of that sacred revelatory encounter that birthed the religion in the first place the problem is that after a few centuries  the date remains on the calendar  
 but the love affair is long dead that 's when we find ourselves in endless
  mindless repetitions of words that don 't mean anything to us rising and being seated because someone has asked us to holding onto jealously guarded doctrine 
 that 's completely and wildly out of step with our contemporary reality  engaging in perfunctory practice simply because that 's the way things have always been done 
  across the board churches and synagogues and mosques are all complaining
 about how hard it is to maintain relevance
 for a generation of young people who seem completely uninterested not only in the institutions that stand at the heart of our traditions but even in religion itself  
 and what they need to understand
 is that there is today a generation of people who are as disgusted by the violence of religious
  extremism
 as they are turned off by the lifelessness
 of religious routine ism 
 of course there is a bright spot to this story  
 given the crisis of these two concurrent trends in religious life about twelve or thirteen years ago i set out to try to determine if there was any way that i could reclaim the heart of my own jewish
  tradition to help make it meaningful and purposeful again in a world on fire  
 i started to wonder 
 what if we could harness some of the great minds of our generation and think in a bold and robust and imaginative way again about what the next iteration of religious life would look like 
 now we had no money no
  no space no game plan but we did have email 
 so my friend melissa and i sat down and we wrote an email which we sent out to a few friends and colleagues it basically said this 
 before you bail on religion 
 why don 't we come together this friday night and see what we might make of our own jewish inheritance 
 we hoped maybe twenty people would show up  it turned out one hundred
  people came 
 they were cynics and seekers atheists and rabbis  many people said that night that it was the first time that they had a meaningful religious experience
 in their entire lives  and so i set out to do the only rational thing that someone would do in such a circumstance i quit my job
 and tried to build this audacious dream a reinvented rethought religious
  is not alone out there in the religious landscape today there are jewish and christian and muslim and catholic religious leaders many of them women  by the way 
 who have set out to reclaim the heart of our traditions who firmly believe that now is the time for religion to be part of the solution 
 we are going back into our sacred traditions
  and recognizing that all of our traditions contain the raw material to justify violence and extremism and also contain the raw material to justify
 compassion coexistence and kindness that when others choose to read our texts as directives for hate and vengeance we can choose to read those same texts as directives for love and for
  forgiveness  i have found now in communities as varied as jewish indie start ups on the coasts
 to a woman 's mosque 
 to black churches in new york and in north carolina 
 to a holy bus loaded with nuns that traverses this country with a message of justice and peace 
 that there is a shared religious ethos that is now emerging in the form
  of revitalized religion in this country 
 and while the theologies
 and the practices vary very much between these independent communities what we can see are some common consistent threads between them i 'm going to share with you four of those commitments now 
 the first is wakefulness we live in a time today in which we have unprecedented access to
  information about every global tragedy that happens on every corner of this earth  within twelve hours twenty million people saw that image of aylan kurdi 's little body washed up on the turkish shore 
 we all saw this picture  
 we saw this picture of a  five year old child pulled out of the rubble of his building in aleppo and once we see these images  we are
  called to a certain kind of action 
 my tradition tells a story of a traveler who is walking down a road when he sees a beautiful house on fire  
 and he says how can it be that something so beautiful would burn  and nobody seems to even care so too we learn that our world is on fire  and
  our job to keep our hearts and our eyes open 
 and to recognize that it 's our responsibility to help put out the flames this is extremely difficult to do psychologists tell us that the more we learn about what 's 
  broken in our world the less likely we are to do anything it 's called psychic numbing we just shut down at a certain point  
  our job to make people uncomfortable it 's our job to wake people up to pull them out of their apathy and into the anguish  and to insist that 
  we do what we don 't want to do and see what we do not want to see because we know that social change only happens 
 and hope is not an opiate hope may be the single greatest act of defiance against a politics of pessimism and against a culture
  of despair  because what hope does for us is it lifts us out of the container that holds us and constrains us from the outside and
  you can dream and think expansively again that they cannot control in you 
 i saw hope made manifest in an african american church in the south side of chicago this summer  
 where i brought my little girl who is now thirteen and a few inches taller than me to hear my friend rev otis moss preach 
 that summer  there had already been
 three thousand people shot between january and july in chicago
  we went into that church and heard rev moss preach and after he did 
 this choir of gorgeous women one hundred women strong  stood up and began to sing 
 i need you you need me  i love you  i need you to survive 
 and i realized in that moment that this is what religion is supposed to be about it 's supposed to be
  about giving people back a sense of purpose 
 a sense of hope a sense that they and their dreams fundamentally matter in this world that tells them that they don 't matter at all 
 the third principle is the principle of mightiness there 's a rabbinic tradition that we are to walk around with two slips of paper in our pockets one says i am but dust and ashes
  it 's not all about me  i can 't control everything and i cannot do this on my own 
 the other slip of paper says for my sake the world was created which is to say it 's true that i can 't do everything  
 but i can surely do something  
 i can forgive  i can love i can show up  i can protest i can be a part
 of this conversation 
 we even now have a religious ritual a posture that holds the paradox between powerlessness and power in the jewish community the only time of year 
 that we prostrate fully to the ground is during the high holy days it 's a sign of total submission 
 when we get up off the ground we stand with our hands raised to the heavens and we say 
 i am strong  i am mighty  and i am worthy  i can 't do everything  
 but i can do something 
 in a world that conspires
 to make us believe that we are invisible and that we are impotent religious communities and religious ritual can remind us that for whatever amount of time we have here on this earth whatever gifts and blessings
 we were given whatever resources we have we can and we must use them to try to make the world a little bit more just and a little bit more loving  
 the fourth and final is interconnectedness a few years ago there was a man walking on the beach in alaska when he came across a soccer ball that had some japanese letters written on it he took a picture of it and posted it up on social media 
 and a japanese
  teenager contacted him he had lost everything in the tsunami that devastated his country 
 but he was able to retrieve that soccer ball after it had floated all the way across the pacific  how small our world has become  
 it 's so hard for us to remember how interconnected we all are as human beings
  and yet we know that it is systems of oppression that benefit the most from the lie of radical individualism  let me tell you how this works 
  i 'm not supposed to care when black youth are harassed by police because my white looking jewish kids probably won 't ever get pulled over for the crime of driving while black well
  and islamophobia and racism of all forms those are also all of our problems  and so too is anti semitism all of our problems  because emma lazarus was right 
 emma lazarus was right when she said until all of us are free  we are none of us free  
 we are all in this together 
 and now somewhere at the intersection of these four trends of wakefulness and hope and  mightiness and interconnectedness there is a burgeoning 
 multifaith justice movement in this country that is staking a claim on a countertrend saying that religion can and must be a force for good in the world 
  and we deserve more than the failed religion of routine ism 
 it is time for religious leaders and religious communities to take the lead in the spiritual and cultural shift that this country and the world so desperately needs a shift toward love 
 toward justice toward equality and toward dignity for all i believe that our children deserve no less than that
