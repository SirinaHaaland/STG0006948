  robotic surgery geek  and i really want to build green  but i 'm very suspicious of all of these
  moral authority and short on data telling me how to do these kinds of things  and so i have to figure this out for myself 
 for example is this evil  i have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self actualized local cows on my counter top 
 and i grab a paper towel and i want to wipe it up  
 but can i use a paper
  the answer to this can be found in embodied energy  this is the amount of energy that goes into any paper towel or embodied water  
 and every time i use a paper towel i am using this much virtual energy and water  wipe it up  throw it away  
 now if i compare that to a cotton towel that i can use a thousand times 
 i don 't have a whole lot of embodied energy
 until i wash that yogurty towel this is now operating energy
  if i throw my towel in the washing machine  i 've now put energy and water back into that towel  unless i use a 
  washing machine and then it looks a little bit better  
 but what about a recycled paper towel that comes in those little half sheets well now a paper towel looks better  
 screw the paper towels let 's go to a sponge i wipe it up with a sponge and i put it under the running water  and i have a lot less energy and a lot more water  unless you 're like
  me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on and then you start to use more energy or worse you let it run until it 's warm to rinse out your towel 
 and now all bets are off so
 what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect the position in which you put the handle
  have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house 
  what my husband and i are doing right now  and so  we wanted to know how green could we be and there 's a thousand and one articles out there telling us how to make all these green trade offs and they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and
  missing the elephant in the living room now the average house
 has about three hundred megawatt hours of embodied energy in it this is the energy it takes to make it
 millions and millions of paper towels  we wanted to know how much better we could do  
 and so like many people we start with a house on a lot and i 'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we 're doing on the bottom  so first we
  takes some energy but if you deconstruct it you take it all apart you use the bits you can get some of that energy back  
 we then dug a big hole to put in a rainwater catchment tank to take our yard water independent  and then we poured a big foundation for passive solar  
 now you can reduce the embodied energy by about twenty five percent by using high fly ash concrete  
 we then put in framing  and so this is framing lumber
  materials
 and it 's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that but it can be a sustainable resource if you use fsc certified lumber  
 we then go on to the first thing that was very surprising if we put aluminum windows in this house 
 we would double the energy use right there now
  pvc is a little bit better  but still not as good as the wood that we chose  we then put in plumbing electrical and hvac  
 and insulate now  spray foam is an excellent insulator it fills in all the cracks but it is pretty high embodied energy 
 and sprayed in cellulose or blue jeans is a much lower energy alternative to that we also used straw bale
 infill for our library 
 which has zero embodied energy when it comes time to sheetrock  if you use ecorock it 's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock  
 and then you get to the finishes the subject of all of those go green articles 
 and on the scale of a house they almost make no difference at all and yet all the press is focused on that 
 except for flooring  if you put carpeting in your house it 's about a tenth of
  embodied energy of the entire house unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy 
 so now we add in the final construction energy we add it all up  and we 've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this 
 but before we pat ourselves too much on the back  
 we have poured one hundred and fifty one megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before
  and so the question is how could we make that back  and so if i run my new energy efficient house forward compared with the old
  house we make it back in about six years 
 now  i probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy efficient and in that case 
 it would take me more about twenty years to break even 
 now if i hadn 't paid attention to embodied
  it would have taken us over fifty years to break even
 compared to the upgraded house 
 so what does this mean on the scale of my portion of the house this is equivalent to about as much as i drive in a year 
 it 's about five times as much as if i went entirely vegetarian  but my elephant in the living room flies  
 clearly i need to walk home from ted  
 but
 all the calculations for embodied energy are on the blog and remember it 's sometimes the things that you are not expecting to be the biggest changes that are
