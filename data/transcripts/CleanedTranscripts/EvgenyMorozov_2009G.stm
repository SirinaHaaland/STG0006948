  i think as a grumpy eastern european  i was brought in to play the pessimist this morning  so bear with me 
 well i come from the former soviet republic of belarus  
  as some of you may know is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy
  so that 's why i 've always been fascinated with how technology could actually reshape and open up authoritarian societies like ours  
 so i 'm graduating college and feeling very idealistic  i decided to join the ngo which actually was using new media to promote democracy and media reform in much of the former soviet union however
 to my surprise
 i discovered that dictatorships do not crumble so easily 
 in fact some of them actually survived the internet challenge and some got even more repressive
  so this is when i ran out of my idealism and decided to quit my ngo job and actually study how the internet could impede
  i must tell you that this was never a very popular argument and
 it 's probably not very popular yet with some of you sitting in this audience it was never popular with many political leaders especially those in the united states
  who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn 't 
  by two thousand and nine this news has finally reached britain  so i should probably add gordon brown to this list as well
  however there is an underlying argument
 about logistics which has driven so much of this debate right so if you look at it close enough you 'll actually see that much of this is
  the cybertopians say much like fax machines and xerox machines did in the ' 80s 
 blogs and social networks have radically transformed the economics of protest  so people would inevitably rebel
  to put it very simply the assumption so far has been that if you give people enough connectivity  if you give them enough devices
  i never really bought into this argument in part because i never saw three american presidents agree on anything else in the past 
 but you know even beyond that if you think about the logic underlying it is something i call ipod liberalism
 where we assume that every single iranian or chinese who happens to have and love his ipod
 will also love liberal democracy 
 and again  i think this is kind of false  
 but i think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic that we should be dropping ipods not bombs i mean it would make a fascinating title for thomas friedman 's new book 
 but this is rarely a good sign
  so the bigger problem with this logic is that it confuses the intended
 versus the actual uses of technology 
 for those of you who think that new media of the internet could somehow help us avert genocide 
 should look no further than rwanda where in the ' 90s it was actually two radio stations which were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the
  first place  but even beyond that coming back to the internet what you can actually see is that certain governments
 have mastered the use of cyberspace for propaganda purposes  right  and they are building what i call the spinternet 
 the combination of spin on the one hand and the internet on the other
 so governments from russia to china to iran are actually hiring training
  and paying bloggers in order to leave ideological comments and create a lot of ideological blog posts to comment on sensitive political issues  right  
 so you may wonder why on earth are they doing it why are they engaging with cyberspace  
 well my theory is that it 's happening because censorship actually
  is less effective than you think it is in many of those places the moment you put something critical 
 even if you manage to ban it immediately it will still spread around thousands and thousands of other blogs   so the more you block it the more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship and thus
 win in this cat and mouse game   so the only way to
 control this message is actually to try to spin it and accuse anyone who has written something critical of being for example a cia agent  
 and again this is happening quite often just to give you an example of how it works in china for example there
 was a big case in february two thousand and nine
 called elude the cat and for those of you who didn 't know i 'll just give a little summary  so what happened is that
  prison custody  and police said that it happened
 because he was playing hide and seek which is elude the cat in chinese slang with other inmates
 and hit his head against the wall
  which was not an explanation which sat well with many chinese bloggers
  so they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments in fact
 qq com which is a popular chinese website  had  thirty five thousand comments on this issue within hours  
 but then authorities did something very smart 
 instead of trying to purge these comments they instead went and reached out to the bloggers  and they basically said look guys we 'd like you to become netizen
  so five hundred people applied  and four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question
  and thus inspect it and then blog about it  within days the entire incident was forgotten 
 which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content people would keep talking about it for weeks
  and this actually fits with another interesting theory about what 's happening in authoritarian states and in their cyberspace
 this is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation
 and it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics and letting them engage with each other online
  we tend to think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships but in many cases it only strengthens them
  and you may wonder why i 'll just give you a very short list of reasons
 why authoritarian deliberation may
  actually help the dictators  and first it 's quite simple most of them operate in a complete information vacuum
  they don 't really have the data they need in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime  
 so encouraging people to actually go online and share information and data on blogs and wikis is great because
  low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats will continue
 concealing what 's actually happening in the country  right  so from this perspective  having blogs and wikis produce knowledge has been great  
 secondly involving public in any decision making
 is also great because it helps you to share the blame for the policies which eventually fail 
 because they say well look we asked you we consulted you you voted on it you put it on the front
  and finally 
 the purpose of any authoritarian deliberation efforts is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes  both at home and abroad  
 so inviting people to all sorts of public forums having them participate in decision making  
 it 's actually great because what happens is that then you can actually point to this initiative and say well we are
  just to give you an example one of the russian regions for example  now involves its citizens
 in
 planning its strategy up until year two thousand and twenty  
 right  so they can go online and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year two thousand and twenty i
 mean anyone who has been to russia would know that there was no planning in russia for the next month  so having people involved in
  is not necessarily going to change anything because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda
 just to give you an example from iran we all heard about the twitter revolution that happened there
  but if you look close enough you 'll actually see that many of the networks and blogs and twitter and facebook were actually operational   they may have become slower  but the activists could still access it
 and actually argue that having access to them is actually great for many authoritarian states and
 simply because
 they can gather open source intelligence 
  in the past it would take you weeks  if not months to identify how iranian activists connect to each other 
 now you actually know how they connect to each other by looking at their facebook page i mean kgb and not just kgb used to torture in order to actually get this data now it 's all available online
  i think the biggest conceptual pitfall that
 cybertopians made is when it comes to digital natives people who have grown up online  
 we often hear about cyber activism how people are getting more active because of the internet rarely hear about cyber hedonism for example  how people are becoming passive why because they somehow assume that the internet is going to be
 catalyst of change that will push young people into the streets while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography that 's not an option being considered too strongly  
 so for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of tehran there may as well be two digital captives who are actually rebelling only in the world of warcraft  
 and this is realistic  and there is nothing wrong about it because the internet has greatly empowered many of these young people and it plays a completely different social role for them if you
  look at some of the surveys on how the young people actually benefit from the internet you 'll see that the number of teenagers in china for example for whom the internet actually broadens their sex life is three times more than in the united states  so it does play a social role
  however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement
 so the way i tend to think of it is like a hierarchy of cyber needs in space a total rip off from abraham maslow  but the point
  is that when we get the remote russian village online what will get people to the internet is not going to be the reports from human rights watch it 's going to be pornography sex and the city or maybe watching funny videos of cats
  so this is something you have to recognize
