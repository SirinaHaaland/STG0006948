  been making pictures for quite a long time and normally speaking a picture like this for me should be straightforward  i 'm in southern ethiopia i
 'm with the  daasanach there 's a big family there 's a very beautiful
  and i make these pictures with this very large extremely cumbersome very awkward technical plate film camera does anybody know 
  sheets of film and
 you 're setting it up putting it on the tripod i 've got the family spent the better part of a day talking with them  they sort of understand what i 'm on about they think i 'm a bit crazy but that 's another story 
 and
 what 's most important for me is the beauty and the aesthetic and that 's based on the light  so the light 's setting on my
 and there 's a balance in the communication with the daasanach the family of thirty all ages there 's babies and there 's grandparents i
 'm getting them in the tree and waiting for the light to set  and it 's going going and i 've got one sheet of film left 
 and i think i 'm okay i 'm in control i 'm in control i 'm setting it up and i 'm setting up and the light 's just about to go and i want it to be golden i
  to be beautiful i want it to be hanging on the horizon so it lights these people in all the potential glory that they could be presented  and it 's about to go and it 's about to go and i put my sheet in the camera it 's all focused  
 and all of a sudden there 's a massive whack and
 i 'm looking around and in the top corner of the tree one of the girls slaps the girl next to her and the girl next to her pulls her hair  and all hell breaks loose  and i 'm
  around and starts screaming shouting  
 and the whole tree collapses not the tree but the people in the tree they 're
 all running around screaming and they run back off into the village in this sort of cloud of smoke and i 'm left there standing behind my tripod 
 i 've got my sheet and the light 's gone and i can 't make the picture where have they all gone  i had no idea  it took me a week it took
  's your story who are you and it all turned out to be about a boyfriend for crying out loud i mean i have teenage kids  i should know  
 it was about a boyfriend the girl on the top she 'd kissed the wrong boy  and they 'd started having a fight
  a very very beautiful lesson for me in that if i was going to photograph these people in the dignified respectful way that i had intended  and put them on a pedestal i had to understand them it wasn 't just 
  about turning up it wasn 't just about shaking a hand it wasn 't about just saying i 'm jimmy i 'm a photographer i had to get to know every single one of them  right down to whose boyfriend is who and who is allowed to kiss who 
  they all came back i put them all back up in the tree  i made sure the girls were in the right position and the ones that slapped one was over there they did look at each other if you look at it later they 're staring at each other very angrily  
 and i 've got the tree and everything and then at the last minute i go the goat the goat i need something for the eye to look at i need a white goat in the middle so i swapped all the goats around i put
  but even then i got it wrong because if you can see on the left hand side another little boy storms off because i didn 't choose his goat so
 the moral being i have to learn to speak goat as well as daasanach but anyway the effort that goes into that picture
 and the story that i 've just related to you as you can imagine there are hundreds of other bizarre eccentric stories of hundreds of other people around the world  
 and this was about four years ago and i set off on a journey to be honest a very indulgent journey  i 'm a real romantic
 'm an idealist 
 perhaps in some ways naive  
 but i truly believe that there are people on the planet that are beautiful it 's very very simple it 's not rocket science
 i wanted to put these people on a pedestal i wanted to put them on a pedestal like they 'd never been seen before  so i chose about thirty five different groups 
 tribes
  indigenous cultures 
 they were chosen purely because of their aesthetic and i 'll talk more about that later i 'm not an anthropologist i have no technical study with the subject  
 but i do have a very very very deep passion  
 and i believe that i had to choose the most beautiful people on the planet in the most beautiful environment that they lived in and put the two together and present them to you  
 about a year ago i published the first pictures
  and something
 extraordinarily exciting happened the whole world came running 
 and it was a bizarre experience because everybody from everywhere who are they what are they how many are they where did you find them are they real  you faked it 
 tell me tell me tell me tell me millions of questions for which to be honest  i don 't have the answers  i really didn 't have the answers and i could sort of understand okay they 're beautiful that was my intention
  but who 's ted do i have to talk to him or do we sit with each other on the stage 
 and no no the ted group you must know about it and i said i 've been in a teepee and in a yurt for the last
  we have to do a ted talk 
 researched oh exciting that 's great  and then eventually you 're going to go to tedglobal even more exciting  
 but what you need to do you need to teach the people lessons lessons that you 've learned on your travels around the world with these tribes i thought lessons okay well what did i learn good question three you need three lessons and they need to be terribly
  so i thought long and hard and i stood here two days ago and
 i had my test run and i had my cards and my clicker in my hands and my pictures were on the screen  and i had my three lessons  and i started presenting them  
 and i had this very odd out of body experience i sort of
  had more of these talks they 've heard more lessons in their life who are you to tell them what you 've learned who are you to guide them and who are you to show them what is right what is wrong what these people have to say 
 and i had a little bit of a it was very private a little bit of a meltdown i went back and a
 little bit like the boy walking away from the tree with his goats very
  it wasn 't what i wanted to communicate  and i thought long and hard about it and i thought well the only thing i can communicate is very very basic  you have to turn it all the way around  there 's only one person i know here and that 's me
  i 'm still getting to know myself  and it 's a lifelong journey and i probably won 't have all the answers but i did learn some extraordinary things
 on this journey  so what i 'm going to do is share with you my lessons  it 's a very
  as i explained at the beginning very indulgent very personal how and why i made these pictures and i leave it to you as the audience to interpret what these lessons have meant to me what they could perhaps mean to you  
 i traveled enormously as a child i was very nomadic it was actually very exciting all around the world  and i
  feeling that i was pushed off at
 great speed to become somebody become that individual jimmy go off into the planet and so i ran and
 i ran and my wife sometimes kids me jimmy you look a bit like forrest gump but i 'm no it 's all about something trust me so i kept running and i kept running 
 and i sort of got somewhere and i sort of stood there and looked around me and i thought well
  where do i belong where do i fit what am i where am i from i had no idea
  't too many psychologists in this audience perhaps part of this journey is about me trying to find out where i belonged  so
 whilst going and don 't worry i didn 't when i arrived with these tribes i didn 't paint myself yellow and run around with these spears and loincloths
  but what i did find were people that belonged themselves and they inspired me some extraordinary people and i 'd like to introduce you to some heroes of mine
  people on the planet  they 're proud  they live in the papua new guinean highlands  there 's not many of them left and they 're called the huli wigmen 
 and images like this i mean this is what it 's all about for me and you 've spent weeks and months there talking with them getting there  and i want to put them on a pedestal and i said you have something that many people have not seen you sit in this
  it really does look like this and they really do look like this this is the real thing  and you know why they 're proud you know why they look like this 
 and why i broke my back literally to photograph them and present them to you it 's because they have these extraordinary rituals  and the huli have this ritual 
 when they 're teenagers
  becoming a man they have to shave their heads  and they spend the rest of their life shaving their heads every single
  and what they do with that hair  they make it into a creation a creation that 's a very personal creation it 's their creation  it 's their huli creation so they 're called the huli wigmen 
 that 's a wig on his head  it 's all made out of his human hair  and then they decorate that wig with the feathers of the birds of paradise and don 't worry there are many birds there there 's very few people living so
 nothing to get too upset about  and they spend the rest of their life recreating these hats
  further and further and it 's extraordinary and there 's another group they 're called the kalam and they live in the next valley  but they speak a completely different language they look completely different and they wear a hat  and it 's built out of scarabs these fantastic emerald green little scarabs 
 and sometimes there are five thousand or six thousand scarabs in this hat  and they spend the whole of their life collecting these scarabs to build these hats 
 so
  inspired me in that they belong  perhaps i have to work harder at finding a ritual which matters for me and going back into my past to see where i actually fit
 an extremely important part of this project was about how
 i photograph these extraordinary people  and it 's basically beauty 
 i think beauty matters we spend the whole of our existence revolving around beauty beautiful places beautiful things and ultimately 
 beautiful people
  very very very significant i 've spent all of my life analyzing what do i look like 
 am i perceived as beautiful does it matter if i 'm a beautiful person or not or is it purely based on my aesthetic  
 and then when i went off i came to a very narrow conclusion do i have to go around the world photographing  
 excuse me  women between the age of twenty five and thirty is that what beauty is going to be is everything before and after that utterly irrelevant
  was only until i went on a journey  a journey that was so extreme  i still
 get shivers when i think about it i went to a part of the world and i don 't know whether any of you have ever heard of chukotka has anybody ever heard of chukotka chukotka
 probably is technically as far as one can go and still be on on the living planet
  it 's thirteen hours ' flight from moscow  first you 've got to get to moscow and then thirteen hours ' flight nonstop from moscow  and that 's if you get there as you can see some people sort of miss the runway 
 and then when you land there in chukotka are the chukchis now the chukchis are the last indigenous inuits of siberia  
 and they 're people i 'd heard about i 'd hardly seen any images of but i knew they were there and i 'd been in touch with this guide and this guide said there 's this fantastic tribe there 's only about forty of them you 'll be okay
 off we went on this journey when we arrived there after a month of traveling across the ice  and we 'd got to them  but then i was not allowed to photograph them they said you cannot photograph us
  you have to wait  you have to wait until you get to know us you have to wait until you understand us you have to wait until you see how we interact with one another 
 and only then it was many many weeks later i saw a respect  they had zero judgment  they observed one another
 from the youth from the middle aged to the old they need each other the children need to chew the meat all day because the adults don 't have any teeth  but at the same time the children take the old aged 
  people out to the toilet because they 're infirm so there 's this fantastic community of respect  and they adore and admire one another and they truly taught me what beauty
  a little bit of audience interaction
 this is extremely important for the end of my talk  
 if you could look at somebody left to the right of you and i want you to observe them  and i want you to give them a compliment  this is very important now it may be their nose or their hair 
  or even their aura  i don 't mind  but please look at each other give them a compliment you have to be
  because i 'm running out of time and you have to remember it 
 okay thank you thank you thank you you 've given each other compliments
 hold that compliment very very tightly  hold it for later
  and the last thing it was extraordinarily profound and it happened only two weeks ago two weeks ago i went back
 to the himba now the himba live in northern namibia on the border of angola and i 'd been there a few times before and i 'd gone back to present this book
  them the pictures to get into a discussion with them to say this is how i saw you  this is how i love you this is how i respect you  what do you think am i right am i wrong so i wanted this debate  it was very 
  very very emotional and one night we were sitting around the campfire and i have to be honest i think i 'd had a little bit too much to drink and i was sort of sitting under the stars going this is great you 've seen my pictures  we love each
  look up at the stars again look at the campfire  chief die what on earth does chief die have to do with the fence chief die  first we destroy
 then we reflect 
 then we rebuild then we respect 
 and i burst out in tears because my father had only just died prior to this journey  
 and i didn 't ever acknowledge him  i didn 't ever appreciate him for the fact that i 'm probably standing here today because of him 
 these people taught me that we are only who we are
  because of our parents and our grandparents and our forefathers going on and on and on before that and i 
 no matter how romantic or how idealistic i am on this journey  i did not know that until two weeks ago i did not know that until two weeks ago  
 so
 what 's this all about well there 's an image i 'd like to show you  quite a special image and it wasn 't essentially the image i wanted to choose i was sitting
  finish on a strong image  
 and somebody said you have to show them the picture of the nenets  the nenets i was like yeah but that 's not my favorite picture she went no no no no no no no  it 's an amazing picture you 're in his eyes 
 i said what do you mean i 'm in his eyes it 's a picture of the nenets she said no look look closely you 're in his eyes and
 when you look closely at this picture there is a reflection of me in
  so i think perhaps
 he has my soul and i 'm in his soul  and whilst these pictures look at you i ask you to look at them you may not be reflected in his eyes
  but there is something extraordinarily important about these people i don 't ultimately have the answers as i 've just shared with you  
 but you must do there must be something there  
 so if you can
 briefly reflect on what i was
  beauty and about belonging and about our ancestors and our roots  and i need you all to stand for me please 
 now you have no excuse it 's almost lunchtime  and this is not a standing ovation so don 't worry i 'm not fishing for compliments
 but you were given a compliment a few minutes ago now i want you to stand tall   i want you to breathe in this is what i say i 'm not going to get on my knees for two weeks i 'm not going to ask you to carry a goat  and i know you don 't have any camels
  photography 's extraordinarily powerful it 's this language which we now all understand we truly do all understand it and we have this global digital fireplace don 't we  but i want to share you with the world because you are also a tribe  
 you are the ted tribe yeah  but you have to remember that compliment  you have to stand tall
  breathe in through your nose
  and i 'm going to photograph you okay i need to do a panoramic shot so it 's going to take a minute so you have to concentrate  okay breathe in stand tall  no laughing shh breathe through your nose i 'm going to photograph
