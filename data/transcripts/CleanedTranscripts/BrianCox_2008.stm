  is the large hadron collider it
 's twenty seven kilometers in circumference it 's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted over ten thousand physicists and engineers from
  countries around the world have come together
 over several decades to build this machine what we do is we accelerate protons so  hydrogen nuclei around ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine percent the speed of light right at
 that speed they go around that twenty seven kilometers
 eleven thousand times a second  and we collide them with another beam of protons going in the opposite
  we collide them inside giant detectors they 're essentially digital cameras  and this is the one that i work on atlas  you get some sense of the size you can just see these
  people underneath 
 you get some sense of the size forty four meters wide twenty two meters in diameter seven thousand tons  
 and we re create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to six hundred million times a second
  inside that detector immense numbers and if you see those
 metal bits there those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles  so it can measure how fast they 're traveling this is a picture about a year ago
  those magnets are in there and again 
  real person so you get some sense of the scale  and it 's in
  bangs will be created sometime in the summer this year and actually this morning i got an email saying that we 've just finished today  building the last piece of atlas  so as of today it 's finished i 'd like to say that i planned that
 for ted  but i didn 't so it 's been completed as of today yeah it 's
 a wonderful achievement
  so you might be asking why why create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began
  particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious and the aim of particle physics is to understand what everything 's made of and how everything sticks together 
 and by everything i mean of course me and you the earth the sun the
 one hundred billion suns in our galaxy
 and the one hundred billion galaxies in the observable
  but why not just look at it you know if you want to know what i 'm made of let 's look at me 
 well  
 we found that as you look back in time the universe gets hotter and hotter denser and denser 
 and simpler and simpler 
 now there 's no real reason i 'm aware of for that but that seems to be the case  so  way back in the early times of the universe  we believe
  it was very simple and understandable all this complexity all the way to these wonderful things human brains are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe  
  back at the start in the first billionth of a second we believe or we 've observed it was very simple  
  into a pool of water  and you would be able to see that actually  it was just made of
 's in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of and as of today  
 it 's made of these things just twelve particles of matter  stuck together by four forces of nature 
 the quarks these pink things are the things that make up protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nuclei in your body  the electron the thing that goes
  around the atomic nucleus
 held around in orbit by the way by the electromagnetic force that 's carried by this thing the photon the quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons 
 and these guys here they 're the weak nuclear force probably the least familiar but without it the sun wouldn 't shine 
 and when the sun shines you get copious quantities of these things called
  if you just look at your thumbnail
 about a square centimeter there are something like sixty billion neutrinos per second from the sun passing through every square centimeter of your body  
 but you don 't feel them  because the weak force is correctly named
 very short range and very weak so they just fly through you and these particles have been discovered over the last
  and the last one this thing called the tau neutrino in the year two thousand actually just
 i was going to say just up the road in chicago i know it 's a big country america isn 't it 
 just up the road  relative to the universe it 's just up the road 
 laughter so this thing was discovered in the year two thousand so it 's a relatively recent picture one of the wonderful things actually i find is that we 've
  any of them when you realize how tiny they are you know they 're a
 step in size from the entire observable universe  so  one hundred billion galaxies thirteen point seven billion light years away
 a step in size from that to monterey actually is about the same as from monterey to these things  absolutely exquisitely minute and yet we 've discovered
 pretty much the full set
  one of my most illustrious forebears at manchester university ernest rutherford
 discoverer of the atomic nucleus once said all science is either physics or stamp collecting now i don 't think he meant to insult
 the rest of science although he was from new zealand  so it 's possible laughter
 but what he meant was that what we 've done really is stamp collect there  ok we 've discovered the
  particles  but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern you know why it 's built the way it is really you 've done stamp collecting you haven 't done science 
 fortunately we have
 probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century that underpins that pattern it 's the newton 's laws if you want of
 particle physics it 's called the standard model beautifully simple mathematical equation you could stick it on the front
  is always the sign of elegance this is it 
 i 've been a little disingenuous because i 've expanded it out in all its gory detail 
 this equation though allows you to calculate everything other than gravity that happens in the universe  so you want to know why the sky is blue why atomic nuclei stick together in principle you 've got
 big enough computer why dna is the shape it is in principle you should be able to calculate it from that equation  but
 there 's a problem can anyone see what it is 
 a bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me i 'll
 make it easier actually by blowing one of the lines up  
 basically 
 each of these terms refers to some of the particles so those ws there refer to the ws and how they stick together these carriers of the weak force the zs the same  but there 's an extra
 h stands for higgs particle 
 higgs particles have not been discovered 
 but they 're necessary  they 're necessary to make that mathematics work so all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn 't be possible 
  without an extra bit so it 's a prediction a prediction of a new particle 
  time to come up with good analogies and back in the 1980s when we wanted the money for the lhc from the u k government
  margaret thatcher at the time said if you guys can explain in language a politician can understand what the hell it is that you 're doing  you can have the money  i want to know what this higgs particle does 
 and we came up with this analogy and it seemed to work well what the higgs does is it gives mass to the fundamental particles and the picture is that the whole universe and that doesn 't mean
  just space it means me as well and inside you the whole universe is full of something called a higgs field higgs particles if you will the analogy is that these people in a room are
 the higgs particles  
 now when a particle moves through the universe  it can interact with these higgs particles  
 but imagine someone who 's not very popular moves through the room then everyone ignores them they can just pass through the room very quickly essentially at the speed of light  they 're massless
 and imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent
 walks into the room
  they 're surrounded by people and their passage through the room is impeded it 's almost like they get heavy they get massive  
 and that 's exactly the way the higgs mechanism works the picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us
 are heavy in a sense and massive  because they 're surrounded by higgs
  particles they 're interacting with the higgs field if that picture 's true then we have to discover those higgs particles at the lhc  
 if it 's not true because it 's quite a convoluted mechanism  although it 's the simplest we 've been able to think of then whatever does the job of the higgs particles we know have to turn up at the lhc  
 so that 's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine  i 'm glad you recognize margaret thatcher
  actually i thought about making it more culturally relevant 
 so that 's one thing that 's essentially a guarantee of what the lhc will find 
 there are many other things you 've heard many of the big problems in particle physics one of them you heard about dark matter  dark energy
  there 's another issue which is that the forces in nature it 's quite beautiful actually seem as you go back in time  they seem to change in strength well they do change in strength so the electromagnetic force the force that holds us together gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures  
 the strong force  the strong nuclear force which sticks nuclei together  gets weaker  
 and what you see is the standard model you can calculate how these change is the forces  the three
  other than gravity almost seem to come together at one point it 's almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super force back at the beginning of time  but they just miss now
 there 's a theory called super symmetry which doubles the number of particles in the standard model which at first sight doesn 't sound like a simplification 
 but actually with this theory we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together back at the big bang
  the model wasn 't built to do that but it seems to do it also those super symmetric particles are very strong candidates for the dark matter  so a very compelling theory that 's really
 mainstream physics and if i was to put money on it i would put money on in a very unscientific way that that these things would also crop up at the lhc 
 many other things that the lhc could discover but in the last few minutes i just want to
 give you a
  of what i think what particle physics really means to me particle physics and cosmology  and that 's that i think it 's given us a wonderful
 narrative almost a creation story  if you 'd like about the universe  from modern science over the last few decades
 and i 'd say that it deserves in the spirit of wade davis ' talk to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation
  of the high andes and the frozen north this is a creation story i think equally as wonderful 
 the story goes like this we know that the universe began thirteen point seven billion years ago in an immensely hot dense state 
 much smaller than a single atom  it began to expand about a million billion billion billion billionth of a second i think i got that right
 after the big bang gravity separated away from the other forces the
  universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation 
 in about the first billionth of a second or so the higgs field kicked in and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass 
 the universe continued to expand and cool 
 after about
 a few minutes there was hydrogen and helium in the universe that 's all the universe was about
  it still is today  it continued to expand
 about three hundred million years then light began to travel through the universe it was big enough to be transparent to light  and that 's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that george smoot described as looking at the face of god 
 after about four hundred million years the first stars formed  and that hydrogen that
  then began to cook into the heavier elements so the elements of life carbon and oxygen and iron all the elements that we need to make us up were cooked in 
  those first generations of stars  which then ran out of fuel exploded threw those elements back into the universe  they then re collapsed into another generation of stars
  on the surface on at least one 
 and maybe only one of those planets  primitive life evolved which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of tanzania  and eventually
 left a footprint on another world and built this civilization this wonderful picture that turned the darkness into light  and you
  can see the civilization from space as one of my great heroes carl sagan said these are the things and actually not only these but i was looking around these are the things like
 saturn v rockets and sputnik and dna and literature and science these are the things that hydrogen atoms do when given thirteen point seven billion years  
 absolutely remarkable  and the laws of physics
  the right laws of physics they 're beautifully balanced if the weak force had been a little bit different then carbon and oxygen wouldn 't be stable inside the hearts of stars and there would be none of that in the universe  
 and i think that 's a
 wonderful and significant story  fifty years ago i couldn 't have told that story because we didn 't know it  it makes me really feel that
 that civilization which as i say
 if you believe the scientific creation story
 has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics and a few hydrogen atoms then i think to me anyway  it makes me feel
 incredibly valuable 
 so that 's the lhc the lhc is certainly 
 when it turns on in summer going to write the next chapter of that book  and i 'm certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on thanks
