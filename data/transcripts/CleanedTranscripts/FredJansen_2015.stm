  like to take you on the epic quest of the rosetta spacecraft 
 to escort and land the probe on a comet  this has been my passion for the past two years 
 in order to do that i need to explain to you something about the origin of the solar system
  go back four and a half billion years there was a cloud of gas and dust in the center of this cloud our sun formed and ignited  
 along with that what we now know as planets comets and asteroids formed  
 what then happened  according to theory is that when the earth had cooled down a bit after its formation 
 comets massively impacted the earth and
  delivered water to earth  
 they probably also delivered complex organic material to earth 
 and that may have bootstrapped the emergence of life  you can compare this to having to solve a  250 piece puzzle and not a 2 000 piece puzzle  
 afterwards  the big planets like jupiter and saturn they were not in their place where they are now and they interacted gravitationally and
  they swept the whole interior of the solar system clean and what we now know as comets ended up in something called the kuiper belt 
 which is a belt of objects beyond the orbit of neptune  
 and sometimes these objects run into each other  
 and they gravitationally deflect  and then the gravity of jupiter pulls
  them back into the solar system  
 and they then become the comets as we see them in the sky  the important thing here to note is that in the meantime  the four and a half billion years  these comets 
  have been sitting on the outside of the solar system  and haven 't changed deep frozen versions of our solar system 
  ion tail which is charged particles  and they follow the magnetic field in the solar system  
 there 's the coma and then there is the nucleus which here is too small to see and you have to remember that in the case of rosetta the spacecraft is in that center pixel we are only twenty thirty forty kilometers away from the comet  
 so what 's important to remember comets contain the original material from which our solar system was formed
  so they 're ideal to study the components that were present at the time when earth and life  started  
 comets are also suspected of having brought the elements which may have  bootstrapped life 
 esa set up its long term horizon two thousand program which contained one cornerstone which would be a
  mission to a comet in parallel a small mission to a comet what you see here giotto was launched and 
 flew by the comet of halley
 with an armada of other spacecraft from the results of that mission it became immediately clear that comets were ideal bodies to study
 to understand our solar system and thus the rosetta mission was approved in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three
  and originally it was supposed to be launched in two thousand and three but a problem arose with an ariane rocket  however 
 our p r department in its enthusiasm had already made one thousand delft blue plates
 with the name of the wrong comets so i 've never had to buy any china since that 's the positive part 
 once the whole problem was solved  we left earth in two thousand and four to the
  this comet had to be specially selected because a you have to be able to get to it and b it shouldn 't have been in the solar system too long  this particular comet has been in the solar system 
  since one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine that 's the first time when it was deflected by jupiter and it got close enough to the sun to start changing  so it 's a very fresh comet  
  throughout its whole tour through the solar system closest approach to the sun
 as we will see in august  and then away again to the exterior  it 's the first ever landing on a comet 
 we actually orbit the comet using something which is not normally done with spacecraft normally you look at the sky and you know where you point and where you are 
 in this case that 's not enough we navigated by looking at landmarks on the
  recognized features boulders craters and that 's how we know where we are respective to the comet 
 and of course  it 's the first satellite to go beyond the orbit of jupiter on solar cells  now this sounds more heroic than it actually is because the technology to use
 radio isotope thermal generators wasn 't
  in europe at that time so there was no choice  but these solar arrays are big  this is one wing  and these are not specially selected small people they 're just like you and me 
 laughter we have two of these wings
  square meters now later on of course  when we got to the comet  you find out
 that sixty five square meters of sail close to a body which is outgassing
  is not always a very handy choice  
 now how did we get to the comet  because we had to go there for the rosetta scientific objectives very far away four times the distance of the earth to the sun and also at a much higher velocity than we could achieve with fuel 
 because we 'd have to take six times as much fuel as the whole spacecraft weighed  
 so what do you do you use gravitational flybys  
  where you pass by a planet at very low altitude a few thousand kilometers  and then you get the velocity of that planet around the sun for free  
 we did that a few times  we did earth  we did mars  we did twice earth again  and we also flew by two asteroids lutetia and steins 
 then in two thousand and eleven we got so far from the sun that if the spacecraft got into trouble
  we couldn 't actually
 save the spacecraft anymore  so we went into hibernation  everything was switched off except for one clock 
 here you see in white the trajectory and the way this works  you see that from the circle where we started  the white line  actually you get more and more and more elliptical 
  and then finally we approached the comet in may two thousand and fourteen  and we had to start doing the rendezvous
  on the way there we flew by earth and we took a few pictures to test our cameras  this is the moon rising over earth 
 and this is what we now call a selfie which at that time by the way that word didn 't exist 
 laughter it 's at mars  it was taken by the civa camera  that 's one of the cameras on the lander  
 and it just looks under the solar arrays and you see the planet mars and the solar array in the distance
  when we got out of hibernation in january two thousand and fourteen  
 we started arriving at a distance of two million kilometers from the comet in may however 
 the velocity the spacecraft had was much too fast we were going two thousand eight hundred kilometers an hour faster than the comet  so we had to brake we had to do eight maneuvers  and you see here some of them were really big 
 we had to brake
 the first one by a few hundred kilometers
  per hour and actually the duration of that was seven hours  and it used two hundred and eighteen kilos of fuel 
 and those were seven nerve wracking hours  because in two thousand and seven there was a leak in the system of the propulsion of rosetta  and we had to close off a branch so the system was actually operating at a pressure which it was never designed or qualified for
 in the vicinity of the comet  and these were the first pictures we saw the true comet rotation period is twelve and a half hours so this is accelerated  
 but you will understand that our flight dynamics engineers thought  this is not going to be an easy thing to land on we had hoped for some kind of 
 thing where you could easily land but we had one hope
  it was smooth  no 
 that didn 't work either 
 so at that point in time it was clearly unavoidable we had to map this body in all the detail you could get because we had to find an area which is five hundred meters in 
  diameter and flat  why five hundred meters  that 's the error we have on landing the
  so we went through this process and we mapped the comet we used a technique called photoclinometry you use shadows thrown by the sun 
 what you see here is a rock sitting on the surface of the
 comet and the sun shines from above from the shadow we with our brain can immediately determine roughly what the shape of that rock is 
 you can program that in a computer you then cover the whole comet
  and you can map the comet  for that we flew special trajectories starting in august 
 first a triangle of one hundred kilometers on a side at one hundred kilometers ' distance  and we repeated the whole thing at fifty kilometers 
 at that time we had seen the comet at all kinds of angles  and we could use this technique to map
 the whole thing  now  this led to a selection of landing sites this
  whole process we had to do to go from the mapping of the comet to actually finding the final landing site 
 was sixty days  we didn 't have more to give you an idea the average mars mission
 takes hundreds of scientists for years to meet about where shall we go we had sixty days and that was it 
 we finally selected the final landing site and the commands were prepared for
  the way this works is that rosetta has to be at the right point in space and aiming towards the comet because the lander is passive the lander is then pushed out and moves towards the comet rosetta had to turn around to get its cameras to actually look
 at philae while it was departing and to be able to communicate with it  now  the landing duration of the whole trajectory was seven hours  
 now do a simple calculation  if the
  velocity of rosetta is off by one centimeter per second  seven
 hours is twenty five thousand seconds  that means two hundred and fifty two meters wrong on the comet  
 so we had to know the velocity of rosetta much better than one centimeter per second  
 and its location in space better than one hundred meters at five hundred million kilometers from earth
 that 's no mean feat  
 let me quickly take you through some of the science and the instruments  i won 't bore you with all the details of of all the instruments  but it 's got everything we can sniff gas we can measure
 dust particles  the shape of them the composition  there are magnetometers  everything 
 this is one of the results from an instrument which measures gas density at the position of rosetta
 so it 's gas which has left the comet the bottom graph is september of last year  there is a long term variation which in itself is not surprising  but you see the sharp peaks  this is a comet day  
 you can see the effect of the sun on the evaporation of gas and the fact that the comet is rotating  so there is one
  there is a lot of stuff coming from it gets heated in the sun and then cools down on the back side  and we can see the density variations of this 
 these are the gases and the organic compounds that we already have measured you will see it 's an impressive list and there is much much much more 
  to come  because there are more measurements actually there is a conference going on  in houston at the moment where many of these results are presented 
  particles now for you this will not look very impressive but the scientists were thrilled when they saw this two dust particles  the right one they call boris  and they shot it with tantalum
 in order to be able to analyze it  now we found sodium and magnesium  what this tells you is this is the concentration of these two materials at the time the solar system was formed  so we learned things about which materials
  were there when the planet was made 
 of course one of the important elements is the imaging 
 this is one of the cameras of rosetta the osiris camera and this actually was the cover of science magazine on january twenty three of this year 
 nobody had expected this body to look like this boulders rocks if anything it looks more like the half dome in yosemite than anything else
  we also saw things like this dunes  and what look to be on the righthand side wind blown shadows now we know these from mars  but this comet doesn 't have an atmosphere  so it 's a bit difficult to create a wind blown shadow  
 it may be local outgassing 
 stuff which goes up and comes back we don 't know  so there is a lot
  you see the same image twice on the left hand side you see in the middle a pit  on the right hand side if you carefully look there are three jets coming out of the bottom of that pit  
 so this is the activity of the comet  apparently at the bottom of these pits is where the active regions are and where the material evaporates into space 
 there is a very intriguing crack in the neck of the comet  you see it
  it 's a kilometer long  and it 's two and a half meters wide some people suggest
 that actually when we get close to the sun the comet may split in two and then we 'll have to choose which comet do we go for the lander
 again  lots of instruments  mostly comparable except for the things which hammer in the ground and drill etc 
 but much the same as rosetta and that is because you want to compare
 what you find in space with what
  find on the comet  these are called ground truth measurements 
 these are the landing descent images that were taken by the osiris camera  you see the lander getting further and further away from rosetta 
 on the top right you see an image taken at sixty meters by the lander sixty meters above the surface of the comet the boulder there is some ten meters  
 so this is one of the last images we took
  before we landed on the comet  
 here you see the whole sequence again  but from a different perspective  and you see three blown ups from the bottom left to the middle
 of the lander traveling over the surface of the comet  then at the top 
 there is a before and an after image of the landing the only problem with the after image is there is no lander 
 but if you carefully look at the right hand side of this
  image we saw the lander still there  but it had bounced it had departed again  now on
 a bit of a comical note here is that originally rosetta was designed to have a lander which would bounce  that was discarded because it was way too expensive now we forgot but the lander knew 
  during the first bounce in the magnetometers you see here the data from them from the three axes x y and z 
 halfway through you see a red line at that red line  there is a change what happened  apparently is during the first bounce  somewhere we hit the edge 
 of a crater with one of the legs of the lander and the rotation velocity of the lander changed  
 it 's a 
 a leg of the lander  standing on a comet 
 this for me is one of the very best images of space science i have ever seen 
 one of the things we still have to do is to actually find the lander
  the blue area here is where we know it must be we haven 't been able to find it yet  but the search is continuing as are our efforts to start getting the lander to work 
  again  we listen every day  and we hope that between now and somewhere in april the lander will wake up again  
  so it looks like a very big rock but it 's not 
 the activity increase we saw in june july august last year was a four fold activity increase by the time we will be at the sun there will be one hundred kilos a second
 leaving this comet gas dust whatever  that 's one hundred million kilos a day  
 then finally the landing day  i will never forget absolute madness two hundred and fifty tv crews in germany the
  was interviewing me and another tv crew who was following me all day were filming me being interviewed and it went on like that for the whole day  
 the discovery channel crew
 actually caught me when leaving the control room  and they asked the right question  and man i got into tears  and i still feel this for a month and a half
  i couldn 't think about landing day without crying  and i still have the emotion in me with this image of the comet  i would like to leave you thank you
