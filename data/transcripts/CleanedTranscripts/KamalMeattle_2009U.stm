  some seventeen years ago  i became allergic to delhi 's air my doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to seventy percent 
 and it was killing me 
 with the help of
  are three basic green plants common green plants with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors
 to keep us healthy  we 've also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building while maintaining industry indoor air quality standards 
 the three plants are areca palm
  names are in front of you 
 areca palm is a plant which removes co2 and converts it into oxygen 
 we need four shoulder high plants per person  
 and in terms of plant care we need to wipe the leaves every day in delhi  and perhaps once a week in cleaner air cities 
 we had to grow them in vermi manure  which is sterile  or hydroponics
  and take them outdoors every three to four months 
 the second plant is mother in law 's tongue 
 which is again a very common plant  and we call it a bedroom plant  because it converts  co2 into oxygen at night  
 and we need six to eight  waist high plants per person 
 the third plant is money plant  and this is again a very common plant
  preferably grows in hydroponics  
 and this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals  with these three plants you can grow all the fresh air you need 
 in fact you could be in a bottle with a cap on top  and you would not die
 at all  and you would not need any fresh air 
  and it has
 close to one thousand two hundred such plants for three hundred occupants our studies have found that there is a forty two percent probability of one 's blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for ten hours 
 the government of india has discovered or published a study to show that this is the healthiest building in new delhi
 and the study showed that  compared to other buildings there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by fifty two percent
 respiratory systems by thirty four percent  
 headaches by twenty four percent lung impairment by twelve percent and asthma by nine percent and this study has been published on september
  and it 's available on the government of india website 
 our experience points to
 an amazing increase in human productivity by over twenty percent by using these plants  and also
 a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding fifteen percent because you need less fresh air we are now replicating this
  which will have sixty thousand indoor plants
