  the word that comes to mind  
 we 're the new technologists we have a lot of data  so we have a lot of power how much power do we have  scene from a movie apocalypse
  we 've got to get our hero captain willard to the mouth of the nung river so he can go pursue colonel kurtz the way we 're going to do this is fly him in and drop him off so the scene the sky is filled with this fleet of helicopters carrying him in and there 's this loud  thrilling music in the background this wild music
  because of all of the data that we have  
 let 's take an example  what can we do with just one person 's data  what can we do with
 that guy 's data  
 i can look at your financial records  i can tell if you pay your bills on time  i know if you 're good to give a loan to i
 can look at your medical records i can see if your pump is still pumping see if you 're good to offer insurance to
  i can look at your clicking patterns when you come to my website  
 i actually know what you 're going to do already because i 've seen you visit millions of websites before and i 'm sorry to tell you you 're like a poker player  you have a tell  i can tell with data analysis what you 're going to do before you even do it  
 i know what you like  i know who you are  and that 's even before i look at your mail
  those are the kinds of things we can do with the data that we have  but i 'm not actually here to talk about what we can do 
 i 'm here to talk about what we should do  
 what 's the right thing to do  
 now i see some puzzled looks like why are you asking us what 's the right thing
  just building this stuff somebody else is using it 
 fair enough  but it brings me back i
 think about world war ii
 some of our great technologists then some of our great physicists studying nuclear fission and fusion just nuclear stuff  we gather together these physicists in los alamos to
 see what they 'll build 
 we want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be
  doing with the technology  
 so what should we be doing with that guy 's data should
 we be collecting it  gathering it  so we can make his online experience better  so we can make money  
 so we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good 
 or
 should we respect his
  protect his dignity and leave him alone  which one is it  
 how should we figure it out  i know crowdsource let 's crowdsource this
  so to get people warmed up let 's start with
 an easy question something i 'm sure everybody here has an opinion about iphone versus android  let 's do a show of hands iphone
  think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn 't be such suckers just for the pretty phones 
 next question a little bit harder should we be collecting all of that guy 's data
 to make his experiences better and to protect ourselves in case he 's up to no good or should we leave him alone  
  last question harder question
 when trying to evaluate what we should do in this case should we use a kantian deontological
  that 's a terrifying result
  terrifying because we have stronger
  than about the moral framework we should use to guide our decisions  how do we know what to do with all the power we have if we don 't have a moral framework 
 we know more about mobile operating systems  but what we really need is a moral operating system
 what 's a moral operating system we all know right and wrong right you feel good when you do something right you feel bad when you do something wrong our parents teach us that  praise with the good
  good scold with the bad 
 but how do we figure out what 's right and wrong  and from day to day we have the techniques that we use maybe we just follow our gut  
 maybe we take a vote we crowdsource or
 maybe we punt
 ask the legal department see what they say  in other words it 's kind of random kind of ad hoc how we figure out what we should do
  and maybe if we want to be on surer footing what we really want is a moral framework that will help guide us there that will tell us what kinds of things are right and wrong in the first place  and how would we know in a given situation what to do  
 so let 's get a moral framework we 're numbers people living by numbers how can we use numbers as the basis for a moral framework  
 i know a guy who did
  exactly that a brilliant guy he
 's been dead two thousand five hundred years  
 plato that 's right  remember him old philosopher you were sleeping during that class
 plato  he had a lot of the same concerns that we did he was worried about right and wrong  he wanted to know what is just but he was worried that all we seem to be doing is trading opinions about this
  says something 's just she says something else is just it 's kind of convincing when he talks and when she talks too i 'm just going back and forth i 'm not getting anywhere i don 't want opinions i want knowledge  i want to know the truth about justice
 like we have truths in math  in math  we know the objective facts take a number any number
  i love that number  
 there are truths about two 
 if you 've got two of something you add two more you get four  that 's true no matter what thing you 're talking about it 's an objective truth about the form of two the abstract form when you have two 
  of anything two eyes two ears two noses just two protrusions those all partake of the form of two 
  and therefore it 's not a matter of opinion  
 what if plato thought ethics was like math  
 what if there were a pure form of justice  what if there are truths about justice and you could just look around in this world and see which things participated partook of 
  that form of justice then you would know what was really just and what wasn 't it wouldn 't be a matter of just opinion or just appearances  
  vision i mean think about that how grand how ambitious that 's as ambitious as we are  he wants to solve ethics
 he wants objective truths if you think that way  you have a platonist moral framework  
 if you don 't think that way  well  you have a lot of company in the history of western philosophy because the tidy idea
  was not amused  he thought it was impractical  aristotle said we should seek only so much precision in each subject as that subject allows 
 aristotle thought ethics wasn 't a lot like math  he thought ethics was a matter of making decisions in the here and now using our best judgment to find
 the right path 
  you think that plato 's not your guy but don 't give up maybe there 's another way
 that we can use numbers as the basis of our moral framework  
 how about this  
 what if in any situation you could just calculate 
 look at the choices  measure out which one 's better and know what to do  that sound familiar
  that 's a utilitarian moral framework  john stuart mill was a great advocate of this nice guy besides
 and only been dead
  two hundred years  so basis of utilitarianism i 'm sure you 're familiar at least the three people who voted for mill before are familiar with this but
 here 's the way it works  what if morals  what if what makes something moral is just a matter of if it maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain 
 it does something intrinsic to the act it 's not like its relation to some abstract form  it 's just a matter of the consequences you just look at the consequences and
  see if overall it 's for the good or for the worse that would be simple then we know what to do  
 let 's take an example  suppose i go up and i say i 'm going to take your phone not just because it rang earlier  but i 'm going to take it because
 i made a little calculation  i thought that guy looks suspicious 
 and what if he 's been sending little messages to bin laden 's hideout or whoever took over after bin laden
 and he 's actually like
  terrorist a sleeper cell i 'm going to find that out and when i find that out  i 'm going to prevent a huge amount of damage that he could cause  
 that has a very high utility to prevent that damage and compared to the little pain that it 's going to cause because it 's going to be embarrassing when i 'm looking on his phone and seeing that he has a farmville problem and that whole bit
 that 's overwhelmed overwhelmed
  by the value of looking at the phone if you feel that way  that 's a utilitarian
 choice  but maybe you don 't feel that way either maybe you think  it 's his phone  it 's wrong to take his phone
 because he 's a person and he has rights and he has dignity and we can 't just interfere with that he has autonomy it doesn
 't matter what the calculations are there are things that are intrinsically wrong like lying is wrong 
 like torturing
  innocent children is wrong  kant was very good on this point 
 and he said it a little better than i 'll say it he said we should use our reason to figure out the rules by which we should guide our conduct and then it is our duty
 to follow those rules  it 's not a matter of calculation so let 's stop we
  in the thick of it this philosophical thicket  
 and this goes on for thousands of years  because these are hard questions and i 've only got fifteen minutes  so let 's cut to the chase  
 how should we be making our decisions 
 is it plato is it aristotle is it kant is it mill what should we be doing  
 what 's the answer  what 's the formula that we can use in any situation to determine what we should do  whether we should use that guy 's data or not what 's the formula
 there 's not a formula 
 there 's not a simple answer ethics is hard ethics requires thinking 
 and that 's uncomfortable  
 i know  i spent a lot of my career in artificial intelligence trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us that
  give us answers but they can 't you can 't just take human thinking and put it into a machine we 're the ones who have to do it  
 happily  we 're not machines  and we can do it not only can we think we must 
 hannah arendt said 
 the sad truth
 is that most evil done in this world is not done by people who
  choose to be evil  it arises from not thinking that 's what she called the banality of evil 
 and the response to that is that we demand the exercise of thinking from every sane person  
 so let 's do that let 's think in fact let 's start
  right now 
 every person in this room do this 
 think of the last time you had a decision to make where you were worried to do the right thing where you wondered what should i be doing 
 bring that to mind  and now
 reflect on that and say how did i come up that decision  what did i do  did i follow my gut  
 did i have somebody vote on it or did i punt to legal or now we have a few more
  did i evaluate what would be the highest pleasure like mill would 
 or like kant did i use reason to figure out what was intrinsically right think about it  really bring it to mind  this is important it is so important we are going to spend thirty seconds of valuable tedtalk time doing nothing but thinking about this are you ready go
  good work what you just did  that 's the first step towards taking responsibility for what we should do with all of our power 
 now the next step try this go find a friend and explain to them how you made that decision
 not right now wait till i finish talking do it over lunch  and don 't just find another technologist friend find somebody different
 than you find an artist or a writer
 or heaven forbid find a philosopher and talk to them  in fact  find somebody from the humanities why because they think about problems differently than we do as
  a few days ago right across the street from here there was hundreds of people gathered together it was technologists and humanists at that big bibliotech conference and they gathered together because 
 the technologists wanted to learn what it would be like to think from a humanities perspective you have someone from google talking to someone who does comparative literature you
  well that 's interesting  that 's a different way of thinking and when you think in that way  you become more sensitive to the human considerations which are crucial to making ethical decisions  
 so imagine that right now you went and you found your musician friend and you 're telling him what we 're talking about 
 about our whole data revolution and all this maybe even hum a few bars of our theme music
  data revolution  that 's an opera  
 that 's wagner it 's based on norse legend it 's gods and mythical creatures fighting over magical jewelry 
 that 's interesting now
 it 's also a beautiful opera  and we 're moved by that opera  we 're moved because
 it 's about the battle between good and evil about right
  and wrong  and we care about right and wrong  we care what happens in that opera  
 we care what happens in apocalypse now and we certainly care what happens with our technologies 
 we have so much power today it is up to us to figure out what to do  and that 's the good news we
 're the ones writing this opera this is our movie
  we figure out what will happen with this technology  we determine how this will all end thank you
