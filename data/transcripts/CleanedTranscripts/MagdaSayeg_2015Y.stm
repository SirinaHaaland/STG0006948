  i 'm a textile artist most widely known for starting the yarn bombing movement yarn bombing is when you take knitted or crocheted material out into the urban environment
  more specifically  without permission and unsanctioned  but when i started this over ten years ago
  didn 't have a word for it  i didn 't have any ambitious notions about it  i had no visions of grandeur all i wanted to see was something warm and fuzzy and human like on the cold steel gray facade that i looked at everyday  
 so i wrapped the door handle 
 i call this the alpha piece 
 little did i know that this tiny piece would change the course of my life  so clearly the reaction was interesting it intrigued me and i thought
  thought what else could i do could i do something in the public domain that would get the same reaction  so i wrapped the stop sign pole near my house 
 the reaction was wild
  people would park their cars and and get out of their cars and stare at it and scratch their heads and stare at it and take pictures of it and take pictures next to it and all of that was
  really exciting to me and i wanted to do every stop sign pole
 in the neighborhood and the more that i did the stronger the reaction 
 so at this point i 'm smitten i 'm hooked this was all seductive i found my new passion and the urban environment was my playground  
 so this is some of my early work 
 i was very curious about this idea of enhancing the ordinary the mundane even the ugly  and not taking away its identity or its functionality but just giving it a
  well tailored suit out of knitting and this was fun for me  it was really fun to take inanimate objects and have them come to life  so 
 i think we all see the humor in this but 
 i was at a point where i wanted to take it seriously i wanted to analyze it  i wanted to know why i was letting this take over my life why i was passionate about it why were other people reacting so strongly to it
  and i realized something 
 we all live in this fast paced digital world but we still crave and desire something that 's relatable  
 i think we 've all become desensitized by our overdeveloped cities that we live in and billboards and advertisements and giant parking lots and we don 't even complain about that stuff anymore  
 so when you stumble upon a stop sign pole that 's wrapped in knitting
  and it seems so out of place and then gradually weirdly you find a connection to it 
 that is the moment that is the moment i love and that is the moment i love to share with others  
 so at this point my curiosity grew it went from the fire hydrants and the stop sign poles to what else can i do with this material can i do something
  so that 's when the bus happened 
 this was a real game changer for me i 'll always have a soft spot in my heart for this one 
 at this point people were recognizing my work but there wasn 't much out there that was wrapped in knitting that was large scale and this definitely was the first city bus to be wrapped in knitting  
 so at this point i 'm experiencing or i 'm witnessing
  i may have started yarn bombing but i certainly don 't own it anymore it had reached global status people from all over the world were doing this and i know this because i would travel
 to certain parts of the world that i 'd never been to and i 'd stumble upon a stop sign pole and i knew i didn 't wrap it  
 so as i pursued my own goals with my art this is
 a lot of my recent work
 so was yarn bombing yarn bombing was also
  and that experience
 showed me the hidden power of this craft and and showed me that
 there was this common language i had with the rest of the world 
 it was through this granny hobby this unassuming hobby that i found commonality with people that i never thought i 'd have a connection with 
 so as i tell my story
  also like to convey to you that hidden power can be found in the most unassuming places  and we all possess skills that are just waiting to be discovered 
 if you think about our hands these tools that are connected to us and what they 're capable of doing
 building houses and furniture and painting giant murals and
 most of the time we hold a controller or a cell phone and i 'm totally guilty of this as well 
 but if you think about it what would happen if you put those things down what would you make what would you create with your own
  hands 
 a lot of people think that i am a master knitter but i actually couldn 't knit a sweater to save my life  
 but i did something interesting with knitting that had never been done before  
 i also wasn 't supposed to be an artist in the sense that i wasn 't formally trained to do this i 'm a math major actually  so
 i didn 't think this was in the cards for me but i also know that i didn 't stumble upon this and
  when this happened to me  i held on tight  i fought for it  and i 'm proud to say that i am a working artist today  
 so as we ponder the future 
 know that your future might not be so seamless  and one day you might be as bored as i was and knit a door handle to change your world forever  thank you
