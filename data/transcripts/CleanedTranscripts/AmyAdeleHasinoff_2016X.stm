  people have been using media to talk about sex for a long time  
 love letters  phone sex racy polaroids  there 's even a story of a girl who eloped with a
  i am a sexting expert not an expert sexter 
 though 
 i do know what this means i think you do too [ it 's a penis ] 
 i have been studying sexting since the media attention to it began in two thousand and eight i
  a book on the moral panic about sexting  and here 's what i found 
 most people are worrying about the wrong thing they 're trying to just prevent sexting from happening entirely  
 but let me ask you this as long as it 's completely consensual what 's the problem with sexting  
 people are into all sorts of things that you may not be into like blue cheese or cilantro
 sexting is certainly risky like anything that 's fun  but
 as long as you 're not sending an image to someone who doesn 't want to receive it there 's no harm 
 what i do think is a serious problem is when people share private images of others without their permission  
 and instead of worrying about
  sexting what i think we need to do is think a lot more about digital privacy the key is consent  
 right now most people are thinking about sexting without really thinking about consent at all 
 did you know that we currently criminalize teen sexting  
  it can be a crime because it counts as child pornography if there 's an image of someone under eighteen and it doesn 't even matter if they took that image of themselves and shared it willingly  
 so we end up with this bizarre legal situation where two  17 year olds can legally have sex in most us states
 but they can 't photograph it some states have also tried passing sexting misdemeanor laws but these laws repeat the same
 problem because they still make consensual sexting illegal 
 it doesn 't make sense to try to ban all sexting to try to address privacy violations 
 this is kind of like saying let 's solve the problem of date rape by just making dating completely illegal 
 most teens don 't get arrested for sexting  but can you guess who does
  does it 's often teens who are disliked by their partner 's parents 
 and this can be because of class bias  racism or homophobia  
 most prosecutors are of course  smart enough not to use child pornography charges against teenagers  but some do 
 according to researchers at the university of new hampshire seven percent of
  all child pornography possession arrests are teens sexting consensually with other teens 
 child pornography is a serious crime but it 's just not the same thing as teen sexting  
 parents and educators are also responding to sexting without really thinking too much about consent their message to teens is often
  just don 't do it  and i totally get it there are serious legal risks and of course that potential for privacy violations  
 and when you were a teen i 'm sure you did exactly as you were told  right you
 're probably thinking my kid would never sext and that 's true your little angel may not be sexting because only thirty three percent
 of 16 and 17 year olds are sexting  
 but sorry by the time they 're older  odds are they will be sexting  every study i 've seen puts the rate above fifty percent for 18 to 24 year olds 
 and most of the time nothing goes wrong people ask me all the time things like isn 't sexting just so dangerous though it 's like
  like you wouldn 't leave your wallet on a park bench and you expect it 's going to get stolen if you do that right  
 here 's how i think about it sexting is like leaving your wallet at your boyfriend 's house  if you come back the next day and all the money is just gone 
 you really need to dump that guy 
 so instead of criminalizing
  sexting to try to prevent these privacy violations instead we need to make consent central to how we think about the circulation of our private information  
 every new media technology raises privacy concerns in fact in the us the very first major debates about privacy were in response to technologies that were relatively new at the time
  the late 1800s people were worried about cameras  which were just suddenly more portable than ever before 
 and newspaper gossip columns  
 they were worried that the camera would capture information about them take it out of context and widely disseminate it 
 does this sound familiar it 's exactly
  worrying about now with social media and drone cameras and of course sexting  
 and these fears about technology they make sense because technologies can amplify and bring out our worst qualities and behaviors  
 but there are solutions and we 've been here before with a dangerous new technology 
 in one thousand nine hundred and eight  ford introduced the model t car  traffic fatality rates were rising
  problem it looks so safe right  
 our first response was to try to change drivers ' behavior  so we developed speed limits and enforced them through fines  
 but over the following decades  we started to realize the technology of the car itself is not just neutral  we could
  all three of these areas laws  individuals and industry came together over time to help solve the problem that a new technology causes  
 and we can do the same thing with digital privacy 
 of course  it comes back to consent
 here 's the idea before anyone can distribute your private information they should have to get your permission  
 this idea of affirmative consent comes from anti rape activists
 who tell us that we need consent for every sexual act 
 and we have really high standards for consent in a lot of other areas think about having surgery your doctor has to make sure
  that you are meaningfully and knowingly consenting to that medical procedure 
 this is not the type of consent like with an itunes terms of service where you just scroll to the bottom and you 're like agree agree whatever 
 if we think more about consent we can have better privacy laws 
 right now we just don 't have that many protections if your
  a terrible person they can take your nude photos and upload them to a porn site 
 it can be really hard to get those images taken down  
 and in a lot of states you 're actually better off if you took the images of yourself because then you can file a copyright claim 
 laughter right now
  if someone violates your privacy  whether that 's an individual or a company or the nsa 
 you can try filing a lawsuit  
 though you may not be successful because many courts assume that digital privacy is just impossible so they 're not willing to punish anyone for violating it 
 i still hear people asking me all the time isn 't a digital image somehow blurring the line between public and private because
  it 's digital right
 no no everything digital is not just automatically public that doesn 't make any sense 
 as nyu legal scholar helen nissenbaum tells us we have laws and policies and norms that protect all kinds of information that 's private  and it doesn 't make a difference if it 's digital or
  all of your health records are digitized but your doctor can 't just share them with anyone 
 all of your financial information is held in digital databases  but your credit card company can 't just post your purchase history online  
 better laws could help address privacy violations after they happen  
 but one of the easiest things we can all do is make personal changes to help protect each other 's privacy
 're always told that privacy is our own sole  individual responsibility we 're told  constantly monitor and update your privacy settings we 're
  told never share anything you wouldn 't want the entire world to see this doesn
  princeton researcher janet vertesi argues our data and our privacy they 're not just personal they 're actually interpersonal 
 and so one thing you can do that 's really easy is just start asking for permission before you share anyone else 's information  
 if you want to post a photo of someone online  
 ask for permission  if you want to forward an email thread
  ask for permission and if you want to share someone 's nude selfie obviously ask for permission 
 these individual changes can really help us protect each other 's privacy  but we need technology companies on board as well  
 these companies have very little incentive to help protect our privacy because their business models depend on us sharing everything with as many
  people as possible  
 right now if i send you an image you can forward that to anyone that you want  
 but what if i got to decide if that image was forwardable or not this would tell you you don 't have my permission to send this image out 
 we do this kind of thing all the time to protect copyright 
  you can 't just send it out to as many people as you want  so why not try this with mobile phones 
 what you can do is we can demand that tech companies add these protections to our devices and our platforms as the default  
 after all you can choose the color of your car but the airbags are always standard  
 if we don 't think more about digital privacy and consent there can be
 consequences  
 there was a teenager from ohio let 's call her jennifer for the sake of her privacy  
 she shared nude photos of herself with her high school boyfriend thinking she could trust him  
 unfortunately  he betrayed her and sent her photos around the entire school 
  instead of being compassionate her classmates harassed her they called her a slut and a whore and they made her life miserable 
 jennifer started missing school and her grades dropped  ultimately  jennifer decided to end her own life  
 jennifer did nothing wrong all she did was share a nude photo with someone she thought that she could trust and yet
  yet our laws tell her that she committed a horrible crime equivalent to child pornography 
 our gender norms tell her that by producing this nude image of herself she somehow did the most horrible shameful thing  
 and when we assume that privacy is impossible in digital media we completely write off and excuse her boyfriend 's bad bad behavior
 people are still saying all the time to victims of privacy violations 
 what were you thinking you should have never sent that image 
 if you 're trying to figure out what to say instead try this imagine you 've run into your friend who broke their leg skiing  
 they took a risk to do something fun  and it didn 't end well
 you 're probably not going to be the jerk who says well  i guess you shouldn 't have gone skiing then 
 if we think more about consent we can see that victims of privacy violations deserve our compassion not criminalization shaming harassment or punishment 
 support victims and we can prevent some privacy violations by making these legal individual and technological changes 
 because the problem is not sexting the issue is digital privacy and one solution is consent 
 so the next time a victim of a privacy violation comes up to you 
 instead of blaming them let 's do this instead let 's shift our ideas about digital privacy and let 's respond with compassion  
 thank you
