  discovered what it is we put our speakers through  sweaty palms sleepless nights  a wholly unnatural fear of clocks  
 i mean it 's quite brutal
  and i 'm also a little nervous about this there are nine billion humans coming our way now
 the most optimistic dreams can get dented by the prospect of people plundering the planet  
 but recently i 've become intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowds  because there are circumstances where they can do something really
  it 's a phenomenon that i think any organization or individual can tap into it certainly impacted the way we think about ted 's future and perhaps
 the world 's future overall  so let 's explore the story starts with just a single person  a child behaving a little strangely 
 this kid is known online as lil demon he 's doing tricks here dance tricks that probably
  that was sent to me by this man a filmmaker jonathan chu who told me that was the moment he realized the
  was causing dance to evolve this is what he said at ted in february
 in essence 
 dancers were challenging each other online to get better incredible new dance skills were being invented even the six year olds were joining in it felt like a revolution  
 and so jon had a brilliant idea 
 he went out to recruit the best of the best dancers off of youtube
 to create
 this dance troupe the league of extraordinary dancers the
  lxd i mean these kids were web taught but they were so good that they got to play at the oscars this year
  and at ted here in february their passion and brilliance just took our breath away
  so  this story of the evolution of dance
 seems strangely familiar you know a while after tedtalks started taking off we noticed that speakers were starting to
  spend a lot more time in preparation
  it was resulting in incredible new talks like these two 
 months of preparation crammed into eighteen minutes 
 raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers with the effects that we 've seen this week it 's not as if j j and jill
 actually ended their talks saying step your game up but they might as well have so in both of these cases you 've got
  these cycles of improvement apparently driven by people watching web video what is going on here well
 i think it 's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call 
 and there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear you can think of them as three dials on a giant
  you turn up the dials the wheel starts to turn  and the first thing you need is a crowd a group of people who share a common interest 
 the bigger the crowd 
 the more potential innovators there are that 's important but actually most people in the crowd occupy these other roles 
 they 're creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges 
 the second thing you need is light you
  open visibility of what the best people in that crowd are capable of because that is how you will learn how you will be empowered to participate  and third 
 you need desire you
 know innovation 's hard work it 's based on hundreds of hours of research of practice absent desire not going to happen now  
 here 's an example pre internet of this machine in action  dancers at a street corner
 it 's a crowd a small one  but they can all obviously see what each other
  do  and the desire part comes i guess from social status right 
 best dancer walks tall gets the best date  there 's probably going to be some innovation happening here  
 but
 on the web all three dials are ratcheted right up the dance community is now global there 's millions connected  and amazingly
  you can still see what the best can do because the crowd itself shines a light on them  either directly through
 comments ratings email facebook twitter
  or indirectly  through numbers of views  
 through links that point google there so it 's easy to find the good stuff and when you 've found it you can watch it in close up repeatedly and read what hundreds of people have written about it 
  the desire element is really
 dialed way up  
 i mean  you might just be a kid with a webcam  but if you can do something that goes viral  
 you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people 
 you get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you and even if it 's not that eloquent and it 's not
 it can still really make your day
 possibility of a new type of
 global recognition 
 i think is driving huge amounts of effort 
 and it 's important to note that it 's not just the stars who are benefiting because you can see the best everyone can learn 
 also the system is self fueling it 's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the
  but the light and desire are a lethal one two combination that attract new people to the crowd  so  this is a model
 that pretty much any organization could use to try and nurture its own
 cycle of crowd accelerated innovation invite the crowd  let in the light  dial up the desire  
 and the hardest part about that is probably the light  because it means you have to open up
  you have to show your stuff to the world  
 it 's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret
 that maybe millions of people are empowered to help improve it 
 and very happily there 's one class of people who really can 't make use of this tool
  the dark side of the web is allergic to the light  i don 't think we 're going to see terrorists for example publishing their plans online and saying to the world please could you help us to actually make them work this time
 publish your stuff online and if you can get that wheel to turn  look out 
 so at ted we 've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness in fact
 my colleague  june cohen has taken to calling it radical openness because it works for us each time  we opened up our
 talks to the world and suddenly there are millions of people out there helping spread our speakers ' ideas  and thereby making it easier for us to
  recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers 
 by opening up our translation program thousands of heroic volunteers some of them watching online right now and thank you 
 have translated our talks into more than seventy languages  thereby tripling our viewership in non english speaking countries by giving away our tedx brand
  live experiments in the art of spreading ideas  and these organizers 
 they 're seeing each other they 're learning from each other  we are learning from them  we 're getting great talks back from them  the wheel is turning 
 okay  step back a minute i mean it 's really not news for me to
 tell you that innovation emerges out of groups you know we 've heard that this week this romantic notion of the lone genius with the
 is misleading even he said that and he would know we
 're a social species we spark off each other it
 's also not news to say that the internet has accelerated innovation for the past fifteen years  powerful communities have been connecting online
  movement is a fantastic instance of crowd accelerated innovation  but what 's key here is the reason these groups have been able to connect
 is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared digitally
 a picture a music file software  
 and that 's why what i 'm excited about and what i think is
 is the significance of the rise of online video this is the technology
 that 's going to allow the rest of the world 's talents to be shared digitally  thereby launching a whole new cycle of crowd accelerated innovation 
 the first few years of the web were pretty much video free for this reason video files are huge the web couldn 't handle them  but in the last ten years  bandwidth has
  exploded a hundredfold suddenly here we are humanity watches eighty million hours of youtube every day  
 cisco actually estimates that within four years more than ninety percent of the web 's data will be video 
 if it 's all puppies porn and piracy we 're
 doomed i don 't think it will be 
  for a reason it packs a huge amount of data and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it 
 here let me introduce you to sam haber he 's a unicyclist before youtube 
 there was no way for him to discover his sport 's true potential because you can 't communicate this stuff in words right  but looking at video clips
 posted by strangers  a world of possibility opens up for him  
 suddenly he starts to emulate and then to innovate and a global community of unicyclists discover each other online inspire each other to greatness  
 and there are thousands of other examples of this happening of video driven evolution of skills ranging from the
 physical to the artful  and i have to tell you as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines i find this
  there 's a lot of passion right here on this screen  
 but if rube goldberg machines and video poetry aren 't quite your cup of tea how about this 
 jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer reviewed research
 on video  there 's a problem with a traditional scientific paper it can take months for a scientist in another lab
 to figure out how to replicate the experiments that are described in
 here 's one such frustrated scientist moshe pritsker the founder of jove he told me that the world is wasting billions of dollars on this 
 but look at this video  
 i mean look if you can show
 instead of just describing that problem goes away so it 's not far fetched to say that at some point 
 online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance
  here 's another example that 's close to our hearts at ted where video is sometimes more powerful than print the sharing of an idea  
 why do people like watching tedtalks all those ideas are already out there in print it 's actually faster to read than to view why would someone
  there 's some showing as well as telling  but even leaving the screen out of it  
 there 's still a lot more being transferred than just words and in that non verbal portion  there 's some serious magic somewhere hidden in
 the physical gestures the vocal cadence the facial expressions the eye contact the passion the kind of awkward  british body
  the sense of how the audience are reacting there are hundreds of subconscious clues that go to how well you will understand and whether you 're inspired
 light if you like and desire  incredibly all of this can be communicated on just a few square inches of a screen 
 reading and writing are actually relatively recent inventions face to face communication
  millions of years of evolution that 's what 's made it into this mysterious powerful thing it is 
 someone speaks  there 's resonance in all these receiving brains  the whole group acts together  
 i mean this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action it 's probably driven our culture for millennia 
 five hundred years ago it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage it 's right here 
 print
  the world 's ambitious innovators and influencers now could get their ideas to spread far and wide and so the art of the spoken word pretty much withered on the vine 
 but now  in the blink of an eye  the game has changed again  
 it 's not too much to say that what gutenberg did for writing 
 online video can now do for face to face communication so that primal medium which your brain is exquisitely wired for that
 just went global 
 now this is big we may have to reinvent an ancient art form  i mean  today one person speaking
 can be seen by millions 
 shedding bright light on potent ideas  creating intense desire for learning and to respond and in his case intense desire to laugh 
  time in
 human history  talented students don 't have to have their
 potential and their dreams written out of history by lousy teachers they can sit two feet in front of the world 's finest now  ted is
 just a small part of this i mean  the world 's universities are opening up their curricula
  thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn and crucially to respond completing the cycle 
 and so as we 've thought about this you know it 's become clear to us
 what the next stage of ted 's evolution has to be tedtalks can 't be a
  for you the global ted community to respond to speakers to contribute your own ideas  maybe even your own tedtalks 
 and to help shine a light on the very best of what 's out there because if we can bubble up the very best from a vastly larger pool 
 this wheel turns 
 now  is it possible to imagine
 a similar process to this happening to global education overall
 does it have to be this
 painful top down process why not a self fueling cycle in which we all can participate  
 it 's the participation age right
  schools can 't be silos we can 't stop learning at age twenty one 
 what if in the coming crowd of nine billion what if that crowd
 could learn enough to be net contributors instead of net
 plunderers 
 that changes everything right i mean
 that would take more teachers than we 've ever had  but the good news is they are out there they
 're in the crowd  and the crowd is switching on lights  and we can see them for the first time not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers 
 but as individuals we can learn from
 who 's the teacher you 're the teacher  
 you 're part of the crowd that may be about to launch
 the biggest learning cycle in human history  a cycle capable of carrying all of us to a smarter wiser more
  here 's a group of kids in a village in pakistan near where i grew up  within five years each of these kids is going to have access to a cellphone capable of full on web video
 and capable of uploading video to the web i mean 
 is it crazy to think that this girl in the back at the right in fifteen years might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful for your grandchildren 
 it 's not crazy  it 's actually happening right now
  good friend of ted who just happens to live in africa 's biggest shantytown christopher makau 
 hi my name is christopher makau  i 'm one of the organizers of tedxkibera  there are so many good things which are
 green manure  
 the same trash site is feeding more than thirty families  we have our own film school  they are using flip
 cameras to record  edit and reporting to their own channel  kibera tv because of a scarcity of land  we are using the sacks
  able to save on the cost of living change happens when we see things in a different way  today  i see kibera in a different way
  bet chris has always been an inspiring guy what 's new and it 's huge
 is that for the first time  we get to see him  and he can see us right now  chris and kevin and dennis and dickson and their friends
 are watching us in nairobi right now  guys
