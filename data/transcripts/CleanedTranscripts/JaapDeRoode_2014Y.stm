  so infectious diseases right infectious diseases are still the main cause of human suffering and death around the world every year millions of people die of diseases such as t b malaria  hiv 
 around the world and even in the united states every year  thousands of americans die of seasonal flu  
  humans we are creative right we have come up with ways to protect ourselves against these diseases we have drugs and vaccines 
 and we 're conscious we learn from our experiences and come up with creative solutions 
 we used to think we 're alone in this but now we know we 're not we 're not the only medical doctors  now we know that there 's a lot of animals out there that can do it too most famous perhaps
  not so much different from us they can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites but the last few decades have shown us that other animals can do it too  elephants porcupines sheep goats 
 you name it and even more interesting than that is that recent discoveries are telling us that insects and other little animals with smaller brains
  therefore there is this great need to find new ways to discover drugs that we can use against our diseases  now i think that we should look at these animals and we can learn from them how to treat our own diseases  
 as a biologist i have been studying monarch butterflies for the last ten years  now monarchs are extremely famous for their spectacular migrations from the u s and canada down to mexico every year  where millions of them come together
 but it 's not why i started studying them 
 i study monarchs because they get sick  they get sick like you they get sick like me and i think what they do can tell us a lot about drugs that we can develop for humans  
 now the parasites that monarchs get infected with are called
 a mouthful what they do is they produce spores
  millions of spores on the outside of the butterfly that are shown as little specks in between the scales of the butterfly  and this is really detrimental to the monarch it shortens their lifespan 
  it reduces their ability to fly it can even kill them before they 're even adults very detrimental parasite 
  these milkweeds have cardenolides in them these are chemicals that are toxic they 're toxic to most animals but not to monarchs in fact 
 monarchs can take up the chemicals put it in their own bodies and it makes them toxic against their predators such as birds  and what they do then is advertise this toxicity through their beautiful warning colorations with this orange black and white 
 so what i did during my job is grow plants in the greenhouse different ones
  some were toxic  including the tropical milkweed with very high concentrations of these cardenolides 
 and some were not toxic  and then i fed them to monarchs some of the monarchs were healthy they had no disease  but some of the monarchs were sick and what i found is that some of these milkweeds are medicinal meaning they reduce the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies
  meaning these monarchs can live longer when they are infected when feeding on these medicinal plants  
 and when i found this i had this idea  and a lot of people said it was a crazy idea  but i thought what if monarchs can use this  what if they can use these plants as their own form of medicine what if they can act as medical doctors 
 so my team and i started doing experiments in the first types of experiments we had caterpillars and gave them a choice 
  and then we measured how much they ate of each species over their lifetime  and the result as so often in science was boring
  fifty percent of their food was medicinal fifty percent was not these caterpillars didn 't do anything for their own welfare 
 so then we moved on to adult butterflies  and we started asking the question whether it 's the mothers that can medicate their offspring can the mothers lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future offspring less sick
 we have done these experiments now over several years and always get the same results what we do is we put a monarch in a big cage a medicinal plant on one side 
 and then we measure the number of eggs that the monarchs lay on each plant  
 and what we find when we do that is always the same what we find is that the monarchs strongly prefer the medicinal milkweed in other words what these females are doing is they 're laying
  sixty eight percent of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed 
 intriguingly  what they do is they actually transmit the parasites when they 're laying the eggs they cannot prevent this they can also not medicate themselves but what these experiments 
  tell us is that these monarchs these mothers can lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future
  a really important discovery i think not just because it tells us something cool about nature  
 but also because it may tell us something more about how we should find drugs 
 now these are animals that are very small and we tend to think of them as very simple they have tiny little brains yet they can do this very sophisticated medication 
 now we know that even today most of our drugs derive from natural products
  including plants and in indigenous cultures traditional healers often look at animals to find new drugs 
 in this way elephants have told us how to treat stomach upset  and porcupines have told people how to treat bloody diarrhea  
 what i think is important though is to move beyond these large brained mammals and give these guys more credit these simple animals these insects that we tend to think of as very very simple with tiny little brains 
 the discovery that these animals can also use medication opens up completely
  new avenues and i think that maybe one day we will be treating human diseases with drugs that were first discovered by butterflies  
 and i think that is an amazing opportunity worth pursuing thank you so much
