  you remember the story of odysseus and the sirens from high school or junior high school there was
 this hero odysseus who 's heading back home after the trojan war and he 's standing on the deck of his
  we will sail past those rocks 
 and on those rocks sit some beautiful women called sirens  and these women sing an enchanting song 
 a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks
 and die now you would expect given that that they would choose an alternate route around the sirens but instead odysseus says 
 i want to hear that song
  and so what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to pour wax in the ears of you and all the men stay with me
 so that you can 't hear the song  and then i 'm going to have you tie me to the mast so that i can listen
 and we can all sail by unaffected so this is a captain putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk so that he can hear a song and
  i 'd like to think if this was the case they probably would have rehearsed it
 a few times odysseus would have said okay  let 's do a dry run
  you tie me to the mast  and i 'm going to beg and plead and no matter what i say you cannot untie me from the mast all right so tie me to the mast and the first mate takes a rope and
 ties odysseus to the mast in a nice knot  and odysseus does his best job playacting and says untie me untie me i want to hear that song untie me
 and the first mate wisely resists and doesn 't untie odysseus and then odysseus says 
 i see that you can get it  all right untie me now and we 'll get some dinner 
 and the first mate hesitates he 's like is this still the rehearsal or should i untie him and
 the first mate thinks well i guess at some point the rehearsal has to end so he unties odysseus and odysseus
  flips out he 's like you idiot  you moron if you do that tomorrow i 'll be dead you 'll be dead every single one of the men will be dead now just don 't untie me no matter what he throws the first mate to the ground 
 this repeats itself through the night
 rehearsal  tying to the mast  conning his way out of it  beating the poor first mate up
  tying yourself to a mast is perhaps the oldest written example of what
 psychologists call a commitment device a commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head
 to bind yourself so that you don 't do something regrettable when you have a hot head because there 's two heads inside one person when you think about
  scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions
 of temptation 
 there is first the present self this is like odysseus when he 's hearing the song  
 he just wants to get to the front row he just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification  
 but then there 's this other self the future self  this is odysseus as an old man
 who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa with his wife penelope outside of ithaca
 the other one
  so
 why do we need commitment devices  well
 resisting temptation is hard as the 19th century english economist
 nassau william senior said to abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power 
 or to seek distant rather than immediate results are among the most painful exertions of the human will
  set goals for yourself and you 're like a lot of other people you probably realize it 's not that your goals are physically impossible that 's keeping you from achieving them it 's that you lack the self discipline to stick to them
  it 's physically possible to lose weight it 's physically possible to exercise more but
 resisting temptation is hard
  the other reason
 that it 's
 difficult to resist temptation is because
 it 's an unequal battle between the present self and the future self  i mean let 's face it the present self is present  it 's in control  it 's in power right now it has these strong heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth
  and the future self is not even around  it 's off in the future  
  it 's weak it doesn 't even have a lawyer present there 's nobody to stick up for the future self and so the present self can trounce all over its dreams  so 
 there 's this battle between the two selves that 's being fought and we need commitment devices to level the playing field between the two 
  food into the house so you won 't eat it or unplugging your internet connection so you can use your computer 
 i was creating commitment devices of my own long before i knew what they were so when i was a starving post doc at columbia university i was deep in a
 phase of my career i had to write five pages a day towards papers or i would have to give up five dollars and when you try to
  these commitment devices you realize the devil is really in the details because it 's not that easy to get rid of five dollars  i mean you can 't burn it that 's illegal and i thought well i could give it to a charity or give it to my wife or something like that but then
 i thought oh i 'm sending myself mixed messages because not writing is bad but giving to charity is good so then i would kind of justify not writing by giving a gift  
 and then i kind of flipped that around and thought well i could give it to the
 but then i was like that 's more bad than writing is good and so that wouldn 't work 
 so ultimately  i just decided i would leave it in an envelope on the subway
  sometimes a good person would find it sometimes a bad person would find it on average it was just a completely pointless exchange of money that i would regret
 with commitment devices but despite
 my my like for them  there 's two nagging concerns that i 've always had about commitment devices and you might feel this if you use them them yourself 
 so the first is when you 've got one of these devices going 
 such as this contract to write everyday or pay  it 's just a constant reminder that you have no
  am nothing i have no self discipline and then when you 're ever in a situation
 where you don 't have a commitment device in place like oh my god that person 's offering me a doughnut and i have no defense mechanism you just eat it
  so i don 't like the way that they take the power away from you i think self discipline is something it 's like a muscle the more
  you exercise it  the stronger it gets the other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them
 you say well of course i can 't write today because i 'm giving a tedtalk and i have five media interviews and then i 'm going to a cocktail party and then i 'll be drunk after that and so there 's no way that this is going to work
 so in effect you are like odysseus and the first mate in one person you 're putting yourself
  you 're binding yourself  and you 're weaseling your way out of it and then you 're beating yourself up afterwards
  so i 've been working for about a decade now on finding other ways to change people 's relationship to the future self without using commitment devices 
  in particular i 'm interested in the relationship to the future financial self 
  save at all it wants to consume  whereas the future self wants
 the present self to save 
 so this is a timely problem 
 we look at the savings rate and it has been declining since the 1950s at the same time  the retirement risk index  the chance of not being able to meet your needs in 
  retirement has been increasing and we 're at a situation now where for every three baby boomers
  boomers  the mckinsey global institute predicts that two
 will not be able to meet their pre retirement needs while they 're in retirement  so what can we do about this 
 there 's a philosopher derek parfit  
 who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and i he said that we might neglect our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination
 that is to say  we somehow might not believe
 that we 're going to get old or we might not be able to imagine that we 're going to get old some day 
 on the one hand it sounds ridiculous of course we know that we 're going to get old but aren 't there things that we believe and don 't believe at the same time  
 so my coauthors and i have used computers the greatest tool of our
  to assist people 's imagination
 and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future  and i 'll show you some of these tools right here 
 the first is called the distribution builder 
 it shows people what the future might be like by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes that might be obtained in the future  
 each outcome is shown by one of these markers and each sits on a
  that represents a level of wealth and retirement  
 being up at the top means that you 're enjoying a high income in retirement  being down at the bottom means that you 're struggling to make ends meet 
 when you make an investment what you 're really saying is i accept that any one of these one hundred things could happen to me and determine my wealth 
 now you can try to move your outcomes around you can try to manipulate your fate like this person is doing but
 it costs you something to do it it means that you have to save more today
  once you find an investment that you 're happy with what people do is they click done and the markers begin to disappear slowly one by one 
 it simulates what it is like to invest in something and to watch that investment pan out 
 at the end  there will only be one marker left standing and it will determine our wealth in retirement  
  this person retired at one hundred and fifty percent
 of their working income in retirement they 're making more money while retired than they were making while they were working if you 're like most people just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy just to think about making
 fifty percent more money in retirement than before 
 however had you ended up on the very bottom it might have given you a slight sense of dread and or nausea
 thinking about
 struggling to get by in
  retirement by using this tool over and over and simulating outcome after outcome 
 people can understand that the investments and savings that they undertake today determine their well being in the future  now people are motivated
 through emotions  but different people find different things motivating this
 is a simulation that uses graphics but other people find motivating
 what money can buy not just numbers  so here i made a distribution builder where instead of showing numerical outcomes i show people what those outcomes will get 
 you in particular apartments that you can afford if you 're retiring on three thousand two thousand five hundred two thousand dollars per month and so on 
  of apartments you see that they get worse and worse some of them look like places i lived in as a graduate student and
 as you get to the very bottom  you 're faced with the unfortunate reality
 that if you don 't save anything for retirement you won 't be able to afford any housing at all those are actual pictures of actual apartments renting for that amount
 as advertised on the internet the last thing i 'll show you the last behavioral time machine is something
 that i created with
  hal hershfield  who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project bill sharpe  and what it is is
 an exploration into virtual reality  
 so what we do is we take pictures of people in this case college age people and we use software to age them and show these people what they 'll look like when they 're sixty seventy eighty years old 
 and we try to test whether
  actually
 assisting your imagination by looking at the face of your future self can change you investment behavior  
 so this is one of our experiments here we see the face of the young subject on the left he 's given a control that allows him to adjust his savings rate 
 as he moves his savings rate down it means that he 's
 saving zero when it 's all the way here at the left you can see his current annual income this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today
 is quite high ninety one percent but his retirement income is quite low he 's going to retire on forty four percent of what he earned while he was working 
 if he saves the maximum legal amount his retirement income goes up but he 's unhappy because now he has less money on the left hand side to spend today 
 other conditions show people the
  future self and from the future self 's point of view everything is in reverse if you save very little the future self is unhappy
 living on forty four percent of the income 
 whereas if the present self saves a lot the future self is delighted where the income is close up near one hundred percent 
 to bring this to a wider audience i 've been working with hal and allianz to create
  something we call the behavioral time machine in which you not only get to see yourself in the future but you get to see anticipated emotional reactions
 to different levels of retirement wealth so for instance here is somebody using the tool 
 and just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider  
 the younger face gets happier and happier saving nothing the older face is miserable and slowly slowly we 're bringing it up
  to a moderate savings rate and then it 's a high savings rate the younger face is getting unhappy the older face is quite pleased with the decision
 we 're going to see if this has an effect on what people do and what 's nice about it is it 's not something that biasing people actually because as one face smiles the other face frowns
  it 's not telling you which way to put the slider it 's just reminding you that you are connected to and legally tied to this future self your decisions today are going to determine its well being and that 's something that 's easy to forget 
 this use of virtual reality
 is not just good for making people look older there are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke if they get too much exposure to the sun if they gain weight and so on and
  's good is unlike in the experiments that hal and myself ran
 with russ smith you don 't have to program these by yourself in order to see the virtual reality there are
 applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing 
 this is actually a picture of hal my coauthor you might recognize him from the previous demos  and just for kicks we ran his
 picture through the balding  aging and weight
  gain software to see how he would look hal is here so i think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image  and
 i 'll close it there on behalf of hal and myself i wish all the best to your present and future selves thank you
