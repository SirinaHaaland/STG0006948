  we know about the future difficult question simple answer nothing we cannot predict the future
 we only can create a vision of the future how it might be
 a vision which reveals disruptive ideas which is inspiring and this is the most important reason
 which breaks the chains of common thinking
 there are a lot of people who created their own vision about the future for instance
 this vision here from the early twenty th century it says here that this is the ocean plane of the future it takes only one and a half days to cross the atlantic ocean
 today we know that this future vision didn 't come true so this is our largest airplane which we have the
 hundred and eighty and it 's quite huge so a lot of people fit in there and it 's technically completely different than the vision i 've shown to you
 i 'm working in a team with airbus and we have created our vision about a more sustainable future of aviation
 so sustainability is quite important for us which should incorporate social but as well as environmental and economic values
 so we have created a very disruptive structure
  which mimics the design of bone or a skeleton which occurs in nature
 so that 's why it looks maybe a little bit weird especially to the people who deal with structures in general
 but at least it 's just a kind of artwork to explore our ideas about a different future
 what are the main customers of the future so we have the old we have the young we have the uprising power of
  women and there 's one mega trend which affects all of us these are the future anthropometrics
 so our children are getting larger but at the same time we are growing into different directions so
 what we need is space
 inside the aircraft inside a very dense area these people have different needs so we see a clear need of active
 health promotion especially in the case of the old people we want to be treated as individuals we
 like to be productive throughout the entire travel
 chain and what we are doing in the future is we want to use the latest man machine interface and
 we want to integrate this and show this in one product
 so we combined these needs with technology 's themes so
 for instance we are asking ourselves how can we create more light how can we bring more natural light into the airplane
 so this airplane has no windows anymore for example
 what about the data and communication software which we need in the future my belief is that the airplane of the future will get its own consciousness
 it will be more like a living organism than just a collection of very
  complex technology this will be very different in the future it will communicate directly with the passenger in its environment
 and then we are talking also about materials synthetic biology for example and my belief is that we will get more and more new materials which we can put into structure later on
 because structure is one of the key issues in aircraft design
 so let 's
  compare the old world with the new world i just want to show you here what we are doing today so this is a bracket of an a three hundred and eighty crew rest compartment
 it takes a lot of weight and it follows the classical design rules this here is an equal bracket for the same purpose
 it follows the design of bone the design process is completely different at the one hand we have one point two kilos and at the other
  hand zero point six kilos so this technology three d printing and new design rules really help us to reduce the weight which is the biggest issue in aircraft design because it 's directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions
 push this idea a little bit forward so how does nature build its components and structures so nature is very clever it puts
  all the information into these small building blocks which we call dna and nature builds large skeletons out of it
 so we see a bottom up approach here because all the information as i said are inside the dna and this is combined with a top down approach because what we are doing in our daily life is we train our muscles we train our skeleton and it 's getting stronger
 and the same approach can be applied to technology as well so
  our building block is carbon nanotubes for example to create a large rivet less skeleton at the end of the day
 how this looks in particular you can show it here so imagine you have carbon nanotubes growing inside a three d printer and they are embedded inside a matrix of plastic and follow 
  the forces which occur in your component and you 've got trillions of them so you really align them to wood
  you to transmit electrical energy or data and now we take this material combine this with a top down approach and build bigger and bigger components
 so how might the airplane of the future look
 so we have very different seats which adapt to the shape of the future passenger with the different anthropometrics we have social areas inside the aircraft which might turn
  play virtual golf
 and finally this bionic structure which is covered by a transparent biopolymer membrane will really change radically how we look at aircrafts in the future
 so as jason silva said if we can imagine it why not make it so see you in the future thank you
