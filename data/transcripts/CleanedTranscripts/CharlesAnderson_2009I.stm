  i come from britain but i 've been living in maldives for
 twenty six years now so that 's home really the maldives as i 'm sure you 're aware are a chain of islands off the southwest coast of of india here  capital
  where i live actually sitting here today in mysore we 're closer to to mal than we are to
 delhi for example 
 if you 're in it india obviously is the place to be at the moment  but if you 're a marine biologist  maldives is not such a bad place to be and it has been my home these years 
 for those of you who 've been there fantastic coral reefs fantastic diving fantastic snorkeling  i spend as much of my time as possible investigating the marine life i study fish
  also the bigger things  whales and dolphins  this is a blue whale we have blue whales in the waters around here off maldives
 around the waters of india you can see them off kerala
 and in fact we 're very lucky in this region  one of the best places in the world to see blue whales is here in this region
 in sri lanka  if you go down to the south coast of sri lanka  during the northeast monsoon season  you can see blue whales very very easily it 's probably the best place in the world to see them 
 now  when i talk about the northeast monsoon season i 'm sure
  many of you here know exactly what i mean but perhaps
 some of you are not quite so sure i need to explain a little bit about monsoons now monsoon the root of the word monsoon comes from the word season so it 's just a season and
 there are two seasons in most of
 south asia  
 and in the summer india heats up gets very hot hot air rises  and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it  and
 the way it works is it comes from the southwest
  comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards india  so it comes from the southwest it 's a southwest monsoon  picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean  that 's what brings the the monsoon rain  and then in the winter 
 things cool down high pressure builds over india  and the whole system goes into reverse so the wind is now coming from the northeast out of india  across the indian
  this way towards africa  
 keep that in mind 
 now  i 'm a marine biologist  but i 'm actually a bit of an old fashioned naturalist i suppose i 'm interested in all sorts of things almost everything that moves  including dragonflies  and i 'm actually going to talk this afternoon about dragonflies this is a very beautiful species it 's called the oriental scarlet 
 and one thing you need to know about dragonflies one important thing 
 is that they lay their eggs in fresh water they need fresh
 water to breed  they lay the eggs into fresh water little larvae hatch out in fresh water  they feed on other little things  they feed on
 mosquito larvae so they 're very important  they control mosquito larvae  among other things  and they grow and grow by stages  and they climb out
 of the water  burst out as the adult which we see and typically 
 there is a lot of variation but if you have a dragonfly with say a one year life cycle which is quite typical the larva living in the fresh water  
 lives for ten or eleven months  
 and then the adult which comes
  or two months so it 's essentially a freshwater animal it really does need
 fresh water  
 now the particular species of dragonfly i want to talk about is this one because most dragonflies like the one we 've just seen 
 when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life it doesn 't go very far it can 't travel very far a few kilometers maybe is quite
  they don 't go too far but this guy is an exception and this is called the globe skimmer 
 or wandering glider and as the name might suggest it is found pretty much around the world it lives throughout the tropics the americas africa asia  australia into the pacific 
 and it it wanders far and wide we know that much about it  but it really hasn 't been studied very much  it 's a rather
 mediocre
  looking dragonfly if you 're going to study dragonflies you want to study those really bright beautiful ones like that red one or the really rare ones the endemic endangered ones this is is 
 it seems a bit dull you know it 's sort of
 dull colored and it 's fairly common and it occurs everywhere you know why bother  
 but if you take that attitude you 're actually missing something rather special because this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell  and i feel very privileged to have stumbled across
  living in the maldives  
 when i first went to the maldives  
 dead keen on diving spent as much of my time as i could in and under the water  didn 't notice any dragonflies maybe they were there maybe they weren 't didn 't notice them 
 but after some time after some months one day as i was going out and about 
 suddenly i noticed hundreds of dragonflies  hundreds of dragonflies  something like this these are all
 this species globe skimmer  i didn 't know at the time but i know now they 're globe skimmers hundreds of them and they were there for some time and then they were gone
  and i didn 't think anything more of it until the following year when it happened again  
 and then the year after that  and then the year after that and
 i was a bit slow i didn 't really take too much notice  but i asked some maldivian friends and colleagues and yes they come every year  
 and i asked people about them and yes they knew but they didn 't know anything  where they came from or anything 
 and again i didn 't think too much of it 
 but slowly it began to dawn on me that something rather special was happening
  because dragonflies need fresh water to breed and the maldives and i 'm sure some of you have been there
 so here is home so maldives  beautiful place 
 it 's built entirely of coral reefs and on top of the coral reefs are sand banks average height about that much above sea level  so global warming
  sea level rise it 's a real serious issue  but i 'm not going to talk about that another important point of these sand banks is that when it rains the rainwater soaks down into the soil so 
 it 's gone so it stays under the soil  the trees can put their roots into it humans can dig holes and make a well  but dragonflies a
 bit tricky there is no surface fresh water  there are no ponds streams rivers lakes  nothing like that  
 so  why is it that every year millions of dragonflies  millions millions of dragonflies
 turn up i got a little bit curious in fact i 'll stop here because i want to ask and there is a lot of
 people who from india of course people who grew up spending your childhood here  
 those of you who are indian or spent your childhood here let me have a show of hands who of you
 not yet not yet  you 're too keen you 're too keen no hang on hang on wait for the go i 'll say go 
 those of you who grew up in india
 do you remember in your childhood dragonflies  swarms of dragonflies maybe at school maybe tying little bits of string onto them maybe pulling bits off i 'm not asking about that 
 you 've only got to say  do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies any hands any hands   yes thank you thank you  
 it 's a widespread phenomenon throughout south asia
  including the maldives  
 and i got a bit curious about it 
 in the maldives now in india there is plenty of water so dragonflies yeah of course  why not but in maldives  no fresh water so what on earth is going on  
 and the first thing i did was started recording when they turned up in the maldives  
 and there is the answer 21st of october  not every year that 's the average date so i 've been writing it down for fifteen years now  you 'd think they 're coming from india it 's the closest place  
 but in october  remember we 're still in southwest monsoon  maldives is still in the southwest monsoon
  invariably every time is from the west it 's going towards india not from india  so are these things  how are these things getting here are they coming from india against the wind seemed a bit unlikely  so  
 next thing i did is i got on the phone maldives is is a long archipelago it stretches about five hundred miles  of course it 's india here  i got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues when do you see the dragonflies
  pretty soon a picture started emerging in bangalore a colleague there sent me information for three years  average 24th of september so late september 
 down in trivandrum a bit later far north of maldives a bit later then mal 
 then further south  and then the southernmost maldives it 's pretty obvious  
 they 're coming from india  but they are coming four hundred miles across the ocean  against the wind how on earth are they doing that
  i didn 't know 
 the next thing i did was i started counting dragonflies i wanted to know about their seasonality what time of year this is when they first arrive but how long are they around for does that give any clues 
 so i started a very rigorous scientific process i had a rigorous scientific transect  
 i got on my bicycle  and i cycled around the the island of mal it 's about five kilometers around counting the dragonflies as i go trying not to bump into people as i 'm looking in the trees
  here for a very short time october november december that 's it  and then they tail off there 's a few but that 's it october november december that is not the northeast monsoon  season that 's not the southwest season that 's the inter monsoon 
 the time when the monsoon changes now  what i said was you get the southwest monsoon going one way  and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way  
 and that sort of gives the impression you 've got one air mass going up and down up and down it doesn 't work like that what happens actually
  masses and there is a front between them 
 and the front moves so if you 've got india here  when the front is up above india you 're into the southwest monsoon then the front moves into the northeast monsoon  
 and that front in the middle is not vertical  it 's at an angle 
 so as it comes over towards mal i i 'm standing in mal underneath the front i can be in the southwest monsoon  but the wind above is from the northeast monsoon 
  dragonflies are actually coming from india on the northeast monsoon but at an altitude at one thousand to two thousand meters
 up in the air incredible these little insects it 's the same ones we see out here [ in india ] two inches long five centimeters long 
 flying in their millions  four hundred miles across the ocean at two thousand meters up quite incredible  
 so i was quite pleased with myself i thought wow  i 've tracked this one i know how they come here
 then i scratched my head a bit and that 's okay  i know how they come here  but why do they come here  
 what are millions of dragonflies doing  flying out over the ocean every year
 to their apparent doom it doesn 't make sense there is nothing for them in maldives  what on earth are they doing well to
 cut a long story short they 're actually flying right across the ocean  they 're making it all the way across
  to east africa  i know that because i have friends who work on on fisheries ' research vessels who have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean  i know because we have reports from seychelles which fit in as well down here  
 and i know because
 when you look at the rainfall these particular insects these globe skimmers breed in temporary rain water pools
  they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are the monsoon rains 
 the larvae have to develop very quickly they only take six weeks instead of eleven months they 're six weeks they 're up and they 're off 
 now here we have in case
 you can 't read at the back the top is rainfall for india  
 and we 're starting in june so this is the monsoon rain  by september october it 's drying out nothing for these dragonflies there is no more seasonal rain  they 've got to go hunting for seasonal
  they fly south as the monsoon withdraws to the south they come down through karnataka into kerala  and then they run out of land  
 but they are incredibly good fliers this particular species it can fly for thousands of kilometers and it just keeps going and the wind the northeast wind swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to africa  where
 it 's raining  and they are breeding in the rains of africa  now this is southeast africa
  it makes it look like there are sort of two breeding periods here  it 's slightly more complicated than that 
 what 's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here  
 and the the dragonflies you can see today outside here  on the campus are the the young of of this generation they hatched out in india  
 they 're looking for somewhere to breed  if it rains here they 'll breed but most of them are going to carry on and next stop perhaps only four or five days away
  is going to be east africa the wind will swoosh them out across here if they pass the maldives they might go and have a look nothing there they 'll carry on here  
 here  kenya  east africa  
 they 've actually just come out of a long drought just last week the rains broke the short rains broke and it 's raining there now  and the dragonflies are there i have reports from my various contacts the dragonflies are here now they 're breeding
  when those guys  they 'll lay their eggs now they 'll hatch out in six weeks by that time the seasonal rains have moved on it 's not there it 's down here they 'll fly down here  and the clever thing is the wind
 is always converging to where the rain is the rain occurs these are summer rains this is a summer monsoon  the sun is overhead there summer rains in southern africa  
 the sun is overhead  maximum heating  maximum evaporation maximum clouds maximum rainfall  maximum opportunities for reproduction 
 not only that because you have this
  convection you have this rising of the air
 where it 's hot air is drawn in there 's a convergence so wherever the rain is falling the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that 's rising 
 so the little fellow that hatches out here  he gets up into the air he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling  
 lay their eggs next generation they come up automatically carried to where the rain is falling it 's now back there they come out it 's time
  to come back so in four generations one two three four and then back a complete circuit of the indian ocean  this is a circuit of
 about
 sixteen thousand kilometers  
 sixteen thousand kilometers  four generations mind you for a two inch long insect it 's quite incredible those of you from
 north america will be familiar with the monarch butterfly
  now has had the the longest known insect migration  it 's only half the length of this one and this this crossing here of the ocean is the the only
 truly regular transoceanic transoceanic crossing of any insect a quite incredible feat  
 and i only stumbled on this because i was living in mal in maldives for long enough for it to percolate into my brain that something rather special was going on
  dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing there is more to the story  
 i 'm also interested in birds  and i 'm familiar with this fellow this is a rather special bird it 's a falcon it 's called the eastern red footed falcon obviously but it 's also called the amur falcon  
 and it 's called the amur falcon because it breeds in amurland which is an area along the amur river which
  the border much of it is the border between
 china and russia up here in the far east so siberia manchuria  
 and that 's where it breeds and if you 're a falcon it 's quite a nice place to be in the summer  but it 's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter it 's 
 well you can imagine 
 so 
 as any sensible bird would do  he moves south they move south the whole population moves south  but then the being sensible stopped so now they don
  stop here or even down here no they turn across here they have a little
 refueling stop in
 northeastern india  they come to the latitude of about mumbai or goa  and then they strike out across the ocean  down to kenya and down here  and they winter down here [ in southern africa ] incredible this is the most extraordinary migration of any
 bird of prey a quite incredible migration  
 and they are not the only one that makes the crossing  they have the most incredible journey but several make the crossing from india to africa includes this one  the hobby this fellow is a very nice bird
  pied cuckoo those of you from northern india will be familiar with this it comes with the the monsoons  this time of year they cross back to africa  
 and this guy the roller a rather beautiful bird it 's known as the eurasian roller in india it occurs in the northwest so it 's known as the kashmir roller  
 and these birds what i 've done is i 've complied all the records all the available records of these birds  put them together and found out they migrate at exactly the same time as the dragonflies  
 they make use of exactly the same
  they travel at exactly the same time with the same winds to make the crossing  i know they travel at the same altitude
  the crossing from india to africa
