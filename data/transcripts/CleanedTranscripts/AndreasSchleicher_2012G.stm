  radical openness is still a distant future in the field of school education  
 we have such a hard time figuring out that learning is not a place but an activity  
 but i want to tell you the story of pisa oecd 's test to measure the knowledge and
  skills of   15 year olds around the world and it 's really a story of how international comparisons
 have globalized the field of education that we usually treat as an affair of domestic policy  
 look at how the world looked in the 1960s in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school 
 you can see the united states ahead of everyone else  
 and much of the economic success of
  the united states draws on its long standing advantage as the first mover in education  
 but in the  1970s some countries caught up
 in the 1980s the global expansion of the talent pool continued  and the world didn 't stop in the 1990s 
 so in the ' 60s the
  and not because standards had fallen but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere  
 korea shows you what 's possible in education two generations ago  korea had the standard of living of afghanistan today  
 and was one of the lowest education performers 
 today  every young korean finishes high school  
 so this tells us that
 in a global economy it is no longer
 national improvement that 's the benchmark for success but the best performing education systems internationally  
 the trouble is that
 measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have got is not always a
 good way of seeing what they
  look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets while employers say they cannot find the people
 with the skills they need and that tells you that
 better degrees don 't automatically translate into better skills and better jobs and better lives  so with pisa we try to change this
 by measuring the knowledge and skills of
  we took a very special angle to this we were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school  
 but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know
 and apply their knowledge in novel situations now some people have criticized
 us for this they say you know such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people because we test students with problems they haven 't seen before
  but if you take that logic you know you should consider life unfair because
 the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school but whether we are prepared for change 
 whether we are prepared for jobs that haven 't been created to use technologies that haven 't been invented to solve problems
 we just can 't
  and once hotly contested our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard in our latest assessment in two thousand and nine we measured
 seventy four school systems
 that together cover eighty seven percent of the economy  
 this chart shows you the performance of countries 
 in red sort of below oecd average yellow is so so and in green are the countries doing really well you can see shanghai korea singapore
  in asia  finland in europe  canada in north america
 doing really well  
 you can also see that there is a gap of almost three and a half school years between 15 year olds in shanghai and 15 year olds in chile and the gap grows to seven school years
 when you include the countries with really poor
  a world of difference in the way in which young people are prepared for today 's economy  
 but i want to introduce a
 second important dimension into this picture  educators like to talk about equity 
 with pisa we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity in terms of
 ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances  and we see that in some countries
  the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very very strong opportunities are unequally distributed a lot of potential of young children is wasted 
 we see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you 're born 
 we all want to be there in the upper right quadrant where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed  nobody and no country
  can afford to be there where performance is poor and there are large social disparities  
 and then we can debate you know is it better to be there where performance is strong at the price of large disparities  
 or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity  
 but actually if you look at how countries come out on this picture you see there are a lot of countries that actually
  are combining
 excellence with equity  
 in fact one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you don 't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence 
 these countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all a very important lesson  
  and that also challenges
 the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people 
 and ever since those results came out policymakers educators researchers from around the world have tried to figure out
 what 's behind the success of those systems  but let 's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started pisa and i 'm giving them a colored
  and i 'm making the size of the bubble
 proportional
 to the amount of money that countries spent on students 
 if money would tell you everything about the quality of learning outcomes you would find all the large bubbles at the top no 
 but that 's not what you see 
 spending per student only explains about well less than twenty percent
 of the performance variation among countries and luxembourg for example the most expensive system
 do particularly well what you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results  you also see
 and i think that 's one of the most encouraging findings
 that we no longer live  in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well educated countries and poor and badly educated ones a very very
  let 's look at this in greater detail the red dot shows you
 spending per student relative to a country 's wealth 
 one way you can spend money is by paying teachers well and you can see korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession  
 and korea also invests into long school days which drives up costs further  
 but not least koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop  they invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things 
 all that costs money how can korea afford all of this  
 the answer is students in korea learn in large classes this is the blue bar which is driving costs down  
 you go to the next country on the list luxembourg  and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for korea so luxembourg spends the same per student as korea does
 but you know parents and teachers and policymakers in luxembourg all like small classes you know it 's very pleasant to walk into a small class 
 so they have invested all their money into there and the blue bar class size is driving costs up  
 but even luxembourg can spend its money only once  
 and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well  students don 't have long hours of learning
  and basically teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching so you can see two countries spent their money very differently and actually how they spent their money
 matters a lot more than how much they invest in education  
 let 's go back to the year two thousand
 remember that was the year before the ipod was invented this is how the world looked then in terms of
  of pisa performance 
 the first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller no we spent a lot less on education about thirty five percent less on education  so you ask yourself  if education has become so much more expensive 
 has it become so much better  
 and the bitter truth really is that you know
  not in many countries but there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements  
 germany my own country  
 in the year two thousand  
 featured in the lower quadrant  below average performance 
 large social disparities and remember germany  we used to be one of those countries that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees 
 very disappointing results people were stunned by the results  and for the very first time the public debate in
  germany was dominated for months by education  
 not tax not other kinds of issues but education was the center of the public debate  and then policymakers began to respond to this  
 the federal government dramatically raised its investment in education 
 a lot was done
 to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage  and what 's really
  interesting is that this wasn 't just about
 optimizing
 existing policies 
 but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying german education  for example  
 traditionally  the education of the very young children was seen as the business of families and you would have cases where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children
 to kindergarten
  pisa has transformed that debate and pushed early childhood education right at the center
 of public policy in germany or traditionally  the german education divides children at the age of ten very young children 
 between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers
 and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers and that mainly along socioeconomic lines  and that paradigm
 is being challenged now too a lot of change  
 and the good news is nine years later you can see improvements in quality and equity 
 people have taken up the challenge done something about it or take korea at the other end of the spectrum in the year two thousand korea did already very well  
 but the koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence
 they took up the challenge  and korea was able to double
 the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading 
 well if you only focus on your brightest students you know what happens is disparities grow and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction 
 but still an impressive improvement a major overhaul of poland 's education helped to
  dramatically reduce between variability among schools  turn around many of the lowest performing schools 
 and raise performance by over half a school year  
 and you can see other countries as well portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system raise quality and improve equity 
 and so did hungary  
 so what you can actually see there 's been a lot of change  and even those
  people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like pisa is just an artifact of culture 
 of economic factors of social issues of homogeneity of societies and so on 
 these people must now concede that education improvement is possible  you know  poland hasn 't changed its culture  
 it didn 't change its economy it didn 't change the compositions of its population
  it didn 't fire its teachers it changed its education policies and practice very impressive and all that raises of course the question what can we learn
 from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity  high levels of performance  and raised outcomes and
 of course the question is can what works in one context
 provide a model elsewhere of course you can 't copy and paste
  education systems wholesale but
 these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high performing systems share  
 everybody agrees that education is important  everybody says that  
 but the test of truth is how do you weigh that priority against other priorities how do countries pay their teachers
 relative to other highly skilled workers would you want your child
 to become a teacher rather than a lawyer 
 how do the media talk about schools and teachers those are the critical questions  and what we have learned from pisa is that in high performing education systems  
 the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education their future more than consumption today  
 and you know what 's interesting  you won 't believe it but there are countries in which the
  most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school those things really exist  
 but placing a high value on education is just part of the picture  
 the other part is the belief that all children
 are capable of success you have some countries
 where students are segregated early in their ages  you know  students are divided up  reflecting the belief that only
  only some children can achieve world class standards  
 but usually that is linked to very strong social disparities  
 if you go to japan in asia  or finland in europe  
 parents and teachers in those countries expect every student to succeed  
 and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior when we asked students what counts for
  success in mathematics 
 students in north america would typically tell us you know it 's all about talent if i 'm not born as a genius in math i 'd better study something else  
 nine out of ten japanese students say that
 it depends on my own investment on my own effort and that tells you a lot about the system that is
  in the past different students were taught in similar ways high performers on pisa embrace diversity
 with differentiated pedagogical practices  they realize that
 ordinary students have extraordinary talents  
 and they personalize learning opportunities
 high performing systems also share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum  every student knows what
  matters every student knows what 's required
 to be successful 
 and nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers high performing systems are very careful
 in how they recruit and select their teachers and how they train them  
 they watch how they improve the performances of teachers in difficulties who are struggling  and how they structure teacher pay
  provide an environment also in which teachers work together
 to frame good practice  
 and they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers 
 in bureaucratic school systems teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching
  systems are very clear what good performance is they set very ambitious standards but then they enable their teachers to figure out what do i need to teach to my students today  
 the past was about
 delivered wisdom in education  now the challenge is to enable
 wisdom high performers have moved on from professional or from administrative forms of accountability and control sort of how do you check whether
  people do what they 're supposed to do in education
 to professional forms of work organization  
 they enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy  
 they provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pedagogical practices  
 the goal of the past was
 standardization
  have made teachers and school principals inventive  
 in the past the policy focus was on outcomes on provision 
 the high performing systems have helped teachers and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher the next school around their lives  
 and the most impressive outcomes of world class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system you 've seen finland doing so well on pisa but what makes finland so impressive
  is that only five percent
 of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools  every school succeeds this is where success is systemic  
 and how do they do that they invest resources where they can make the most difference they attract the strongest principals
 into the toughest schools and the most talented teachers into the most challenging classroom
  last but not least  those countries align policies across all areas of public policy they make them coherent over sustained periods of time and they ensure
 that what they do is consistently implemented 
 now  knowing what successful systems are doing doesn 't yet tell us how to improve 
 that 's also clear and that 's where some of the limits of international comparisons of pisa are 
 that 's where other
  forms of research need to kick in 
 and that 's also why pisa doesn 't venture into telling countries what they should be doing but its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing  
 and the example of pisa shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy
 through which we usually run education systems  
  some people argue that changing educational administration is like
 moving graveyards you just can 't rely on the people out there to help you with this but pisa has shown
 what 's possible in education  
 it has helped countries to see that improvement is possible  it has taken away excuses from those who are complacent
  countries to set meaningful targets
 in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world 's leaders if we can
 help every child  every teacher  
 every school  every principal every parent see what improvement is possible that only the sky is the limit to education improvement we have laid the foundations
 for better policies and better lives  thank you
