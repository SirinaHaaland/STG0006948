  there 's a man by the name of captain william swenson
 who recently was awarded the congressional medal of honor for his actions on september eight two thousand and nine
  on that day a column of american and afghan troops were making their way through a part of afghanistan to help
 protect a group of government officials a group of of afghan government officials who would be meeting with some local
 village elders  the column came under ambush  and was surrounded on three sides  and amongst many other
  captain swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out
 the dead 
 one of the people he rescued was a sergeant  
 and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter  
 and what was remarkable about this day is by sheer coincidence one of the medevac medics happened to have a gopro camera on his helmet
 and captured the whole scene on camera
 it shows captain swenson and his comrade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a
 gunshot to the neck  they put him in the helicopter  and then you see
 captain swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more
  saw this  
 and i thought to myself  where do people like that come from 
 what is that that is some deep deep emotion when you would want to do that there 's a love there  
 and i wanted to know why is it that i don 't have people that i work with like that you know 
 in the military they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain  in business we give bonuses to
  people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain we have it backwards right 
 so i asked myself where do people like this come from and my initial conclusion was that they 're just better people that 's why they 're attracted to the military these better people are attracted to this concept of service  
 but that 's completely wrong  what i learned
  and if you get the environment right  every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things and more importantly others have that capacity too 
 i 've had the great honor of getting to meet some of these who we would call heroes 
 who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others  and i asked them why would you do it why did you do it and they all say
  because they would have done it for me it 's this deep sense of trust and cooperation 
 so trust and cooperation are really important here  the problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings they are not instructions i can 't simply say to you trust me 
 and you will i can 't simply instruct two people to cooperate and they will it 's not how it works  it 's a feeling 
  if you go back fifty thousand years to the paleolithic era to the early days of homo sapiens  what we find is that the world was filled with danger  
 all of these forces working very very hard to kill us  nothing personal 
 whether it was the weather  lack of resources  maybe a saber toothed tiger  all of these things working to reduce our lifespan 
 and so we evolved into social animals where we lived together and worked together in what i
  call a circle of safety 
 inside the tribe where we felt like we belonged  
 and when we felt safe amongst our own  the natural reaction was trust and cooperation 
 there are inherent benefits to this it means i can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger  
 if we don 't trust each other  if i don 't trust
  that means you won 't watch for danger bad system of survival  
 the modern day is exactly the same thing  the world is filled with danger  things that are trying to frustrate our lives or reduce our success reduce our opportunity for success  
 it could be the ups and downs in the economy  
 the uncertainty of the stock market  it could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight  
 or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you it 's sometimes trying to put you out of business but at the very minimum
 is working hard to frustrate your
  growth and steal your business from you  we have no control over these forces  these are a constant  and they 're not going away  
 the only variable are the conditions inside the organization  
 and that 's where leadership matters because it 's the leader that sets the tone 
 when a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first to sacrifice their comforts and
  sacrifice the tangible results so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong remarkable things happen 
 i was flying
 on a trip  and i was witness to an incident
 where a passenger attempted to board before their number was called  and i watched the gate agent
 treat this man like he had broken the law like a
  criminal he was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon 
 so i said something i said why do you have treat us like cattle why can 't you
 treat us like human beings 
 and this is exactly what she said to me she said sir  if i don 't follow the rules i could get in trouble or lose my job 
 all she was telling me is that she doesn 't feel safe all she was telling me
  is that
 she doesn 't trust her leaders  
 the reason we like flying southwest airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people it 's because they don 't fear their leaders 
 you see  if the conditions are wrong we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other  
 and that inherently weakens the organization  when we feel safe inside the organization we will
  combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities  
 the closest analogy i can give to what a great leader is is like being a parent  
 if you think about what being a great parent is what do you want what makes a great parent  we want to give our child opportunities education  discipline them when necessary
  all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves 
 great leaders want exactly the same thing  they want to provide their people opportunity education discipline when necessary  build their self confidence give them the opportunity to try and fail  all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine
 for ourselves  charlie kim who 's the ceo of a company called next jump
 in new york city a tech company  he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family would you ever
  consider laying off one of your children we would never do it then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization  charlie implemented
 a policy of lifetime employment  if you get a job at next jump you cannot get fired for performance issues  
 in fact  if you have issues  they will coach you and they will give you support  just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a c
  from school  it 's the complete opposite this is the reason so many people have such a visceral
 hatred  anger at some of these banking ceos with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures it 's not the numbers  
 it 's that they have violated the very definition of leadership they have violated this deep seated social contract we know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests
  worse  they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests this is what so offends us not the numbers 
 would anybody be offended if we gave a $ one hundred and fifty million bonus to gandhi 
 how about a $ two hundred and fifty million bonus to mother teresa do we have an issue with that none at all  
 none at all great leaders would never sacrifice the people to save the numbers they would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the
  people bob chapman who runs a large manufacturing company in the midwest called 
 in two thousand and eight
 was hit very hard by the
 recession  and they lost
 thirty percent of their orders overnight  
 now in a large manufacturing company this is a big deal  and they could no longer afford their labor their labor pool  they needed to save ten million dollars
  so like so many companies today  the board got together and discussed layoffs 
 and bob refused you see bob doesn 't believe in head counts  bob believes
 in heart counts  and it 's much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count  
 and so they came up with a furlough program  every employee from secretary to ceo was required to take
  four weeks of unpaid vacation they could take it any time they wanted  and they did not have to take it consecutively  
 but it was how bob announced the program that mattered so much he said it 's better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot 
 and morale went up 
 they saved
  twenty million dollars  
 and most importantly  as would be expected when the people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization  the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate  
 and quite spontaneously nobody expected people started trading with each other those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less people would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take
 three leadership is a choice
  not a rank 
 i know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders they are authorities  and we do what they say because they have authority over us  
 but we would not follow them  
 and i know many people
 who are at the bottoms of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders  
 and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them  and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them this is what a leader
 is
 i heard a story
 of some marines
 who were out in theater  
 and as is the marine custom the officer ate last  and he let his men
 eat first  and when they were done  there was no food left for him  and when they went back out in the field
  field his men brought him some of their food
 so that he may eat 
 because that 's what happens  
 we call them leaders because they go first  
 we call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does  
 we call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain  
 and when we do the natural response
  people
 will sacrifice for us they will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader 's vision comes to life
 and when we ask them why would you do that why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person they all say the same thing 
 because they would have done it for me 
 and isn 't that the organization we would all like to work in thank you very much
