  and in the tradition of our families the great oral tradition of almost every black church we know honoring the culture from which we draw so much power we 're gonna start the way our mommas and grandmas would want us to start tmd in prayer  let the words of my
  the meditation of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight oh lord my strength and my redeemer vg 
 we call the names and rituals of our ancestors into this room today because from them we received a powerful blueprint for survival 
 strategies and tactics for healing carried across oceans by african women passed down to generations of black women in america who used those skills to navigate institutions of slavery and
 state sponsored discrimination in order that we might stand on this stage  we walk in the footsteps of those women our foremothers legends like ella 
  baker septima clark fannie lou hamer from whom we learned the power of organizing after she would had single handedly registered sixty thousand voters in jim crow mississippi tmd 
  of people so if you can imagine
 me and vanessa inspiring sixty thousand women to walk with us last year we were fired up  
 but today one hundred thousand black women and girls stand on this stage with us we are committed to healing ourselves to lacing up our sneakers 
 to walking out of our front door every single day for total healing and transformation in our communities because we understand
 that we are in the footsteps of a civil rights legacy like no other time before and that we are facing a health crisis like never ever before  and so we 've had a lot of moments
 great moments including the time we had on our pajamas we were working on our computer and michelle obama emailed us and invited us to the white house and we thought it was spam 
 but this moment here is an opportunity  it is an opportunity that we don 't take for granted
 and so we thought long and hard about how we would use it would we talk to the women we hope to inspire a million in the next year  or would we talk to you 
 we decided to talk to you and to talk to you about a question that we get all the time 
 so that the millions of women who hopefully will watch this will never have to answer it again  
 it is why are black women dying
  faster and at higher rates than any other group of people in america from preventable obesity related diseases 
 the question hurts me i 'm shaking a little bit
 it hurts my body because the weight represents so much  
 but we 're going to talk about it and invite you into an inside conversation today because it is necessary and because we need you
 each night before the first day of school my grandmother would sit me next to the stove and with expert precision use a hot comb to press my hair 
 my grandmother was legendary big  loud she filled up a room with laughter and oftentimes curse words she cooked a mean peach cobbler had eleven children a house 
  full of grandchildren and like every black woman i know like most all women i
  know she had prioritized the care of others over caring for herself 
 we measured her strength by her capacity to endure pain and suffering we celebrated her for it and our choice would prove to be deadly one night after pressing my hair before the first day of eighth grade my grandmother went to bed and never woke up  dead at 
  years old from a heart attack by the time i would graduate college i would lose two more
 family members to chronic disease  my aunt diane dead at fifty five my aunt tricia dead at sixty three after living with these losses the hole that they left i decided to calculate the life expectancy of the women in my family  
 staring back at me the number 
 i knew i could not sit by and watch another woman i loved die an early death tmd so we don 't usually put our business in the streets
 but i have to tell you the statistics 
 black women are dying at alarming rates  and i used to be a classroom teacher  and i was at south atlanta high school and i remember standing in front of my classroom  and i remember a statistic 
  that half of black girls will get diabetes unless diet and levels of activity change
  half of the girls in my classroom so i couldn 't teach anymore 
 so i started taking girls hiking which is why we 're called girltrek but vanessa was like that is not going to move the dial on the health crisis it 's cute she was like it 's a cute hiking club  
 so what we thought is if we could rally a million of their mothers
 eighty two percent of black women are over a healthy weight right now
  percent of us are obese  
 but the number that i cannot 
 that i cannot get out of my head is that every single day in america one hundred and thirty seven black women die from a preventable disease heart disease that 's every eleven minutes 
 one hundred and thirty seven is more than gun violence cigarette smoking and hiv combined every day 
 it is roughly the amount of people that were on my
  plane from new jersey to vancouver can you imagine that a plane filled with black women crashing to the ground
 every day and no one is talking about it vg
 so the question that you 're all asking yourselves right now is why why are black women dying we asked ourselves that same question why is what 's out there not working
 for them private weight loss companies government interventions public health campaigns i 'm going to tell you why 
 because they focus on weight loss or looking good in skinny jeans without acknowledging the trauma that black women hold in our bellies and bones that has been embedded in our very 
  dna  the best advice from hospitals and doctors the best medications from pharmaceutical companies to treat the congestive heart failure of my grandmother didn 't work because they didn 't acknowledge the systemic racism that she had dealt with since birth
 a divestment in schools discriminatory housing practices predatory lending a crack cocaine epidemic  mass incarceration putting more black bodies behind 
  bars than were owned at the height of slavery but  girltrek does for black women whose bodies are buckling under the weight of systems never designed to support them
  a member of girltrek in detroit  received the news that too many black mothers have received her son norman twenty three years old a father of two was gunned down while on an afternoon drive  
 imagine the grief that overcomes your body in that moment the immobilizing fear 
 now know this that just days after laying her son to rest danita kimball posted online i don 't know what to do or how
  to move forward  but my sisters keep telling me i need to walk so i will and then just days after that i got my steps in today for my baby norm it felt good to be out there to walk tmd 
 walking through pain is what we have always done my mom she 's in the middle right there my mom
  her mom walked down the steps of an abandoned school bus where she raised eleven kids as a sharecropper  and her mom stepped onto indian territory fleeing the terrors of the jim crow south 
 and her mom
 walked her man to the door as he went off to fight in the kentucky colored regiment 
 the civil war 
 they were born slaves but they wouldn 't die slaves change making it 's in my blood it 's what i do and this health crisis ain 't nothing compared to the road
  road we have traveled 
 so it 's like james cleveland i don 't feel no ways tired so we got to work we started looking at models of change we looked all over the world we needed something not only that was a part of our cultural inheritance like walking but something that was
  something that we could replicate across this country so we studied models like wangari maathai who won the nobel peace prize for inspiring women to plant fifty million trees in kenya she brought kenya 
  back from the brink of environmental devastation we studied these systems of change  and we looked at walking scientifically and what we learned is that walking just thirty minutes a day can
  and dementia 
 we know that walking is the single most powerful thing that a woman can do for her health 
 so we knew we were on to something because from harriet tubman to the women in montgomery when black women walk things change 
 vg so how did we take this simple idea of walking and start a revolution that would catch a fire in neighborhoods across america  we used the best practices of the civil rights movement we
  huddled up in church basements we did grapevine information sharing through beauty salons we empowered and trained mothers to stand on the front lines we took our message directly to the streets and 
  women responded women like lakeisha in chattanooga chrysantha in detroit 
  every day and commit to walking as a practice of self care once walking those women get to organizing first their families then their communities to walk and talk and solve 
  problems together they walk and notice the abandoned building they walk and notice the lack of sidewalks the lack of green space and they say no more women like susie paige in philadelphia who after walking daily past an abandoned building in her neighborhood 
  let me rally my team let me grab some supplies let me do what no one else has done for me and my community 
 tmd we know one woman can make a difference because one woman has already changed the world and her name is harriet tubman  and trust me i love harriet tubman i 'm obsessed with her 
  and i used to be a history teacher i will not tell you the whole history i will tell you four things  so i used to have an old saab the kind of canvas top that drips on your head when it rains and i drove all the way down to the eastern
  shore of maryland  and when i stepped on the dirt that harriet tubman made her first escape
 i knew she was a woman just like we are and that we could do what she had done and we learned four things from harriet tubman the first one 
 do not wait walk right now in the direction of your healthiest most fulfilled life because
  is a revolutionary act number two when you learn the way forward come back and get a sister 
 so in our case start a team with your friends your friends your family your church number three 
 rally your allies 
 every single person in this room
 is complicit in a tubman inspired takeover and number four find joy  
 the most underreported fact of harriet tubman is that she lived to be
  years old  and she didn 't live just an ordinary life uh uh she was standing up for the good guys she married a younger man she adopted a child i 'm not kidding she
 lived and i drove up to her house of freedom in upstate new york and she had planted apple trees and when i was there on a sunday they were blooming do you call it do they bloom the
 apples were in season
  and i was thinking she left fruit for us 
 the legacy of harriet tubman every single year  
 and we know that we are harriet  and we know that there is a harriet in every community in america vg 
 we also know that there 's a harriet in every community across the globe and that they could learn from our tubman doctrine as we call it the four steps 
 imagine the possibilities beyond the
  neighborhoods of oakland and newark to the women working rice fields in vietnam tea fields in sri lanka the women on the mountainsides in guatemala the indigenous reservations throughout the 
  vast plains of the dakotas  we believe that women walking and talking together to solve their problems is a global solution tmd and i 'll
  had an organizer training  and i was leaving and i got on the airplane and i saw someone i knew so i waved and as i 'm waiting in that long line that you guys know waiting for people to put their stuff away  
 i looked back and i realized i didn 't know the woman but i recognized her  and so i
 i blew her a kiss because it was sybrina fulton trayvon martin 's mom and she whispered thank you back to me 
 and i can 't help but wonder what would happen if there were groups of women walking on trayvon 's block that day
 or what would happen in the south side of chicago every day if there were groups of women and mothers and aunts and cousins walking 
 or along the polluted rivers of flint michigan 
 i believe that walking can transform our communities  because it 's already starting to vg 
 we believe that the personal is political our walking is for healing for joy for fresh air quiet time to connect and disconnect
  to worship  
 but it 's also walking so we can be healthy enough to stand on the front lines for change in our communities  and it is our call to action to every black 
  woman listening every black woman in earshot of our voice every black woman who you know think about it the woman working front desk reception at your job the woman who delivers your mail your neighbor
  lines for change in your community tmd and
 i 'll bring us back to this moment and why it 's so important for my dear dear friend vanessa and i 
 it 's because it 's not always easy for us and in fact we have both seen really really dark days 
 from the hate speech to the summer of police brutality and violence that we saw last year 
 to even losing one of our walkers  sandy bland who died in police custody
 but the most courageous thing we do every day is we practice faith that goes beyond the facts and we put feet to our prayers every 
 single day and when we get overwhelmed  we think of the words of people like sonia sanchez a poet laureate who says morgan where is your fire  
  and make jazz that took sit ins and marches and made us jump boundaries and barriers you 've got to find it and pass it on 
 so this is us finding our fire and passing it on to you so please stand with us walk with us as we rally a million women to reclaim the streets of the fifty highest need communities in this country  
 we thank you so much for this opportunity
