  like to try something new those of you who are able  please stand up
  ok so i 'm going to name some names 
 when you hear a name that you don 't recognize you can 't tell me anything about them  i 'd like you to take a seat
 and stay seated  the last person standing we 're going to see what they know
  so those of you who are still standing i 'd like you to turn around and take a look i 'd say half to most of the people are still standing  so let 's continue
  we look around again there are about four people still standing  and actually i 'm not going to put you on the spot i just say that to encourage transparency so you can be seated
  of you who recognized the first group of names know that these were
  been killed by the police over the last two and a half years what you may not know is that the other list is also
  who have been killed within the
  only one thing distinguishes the names that you know
 from the names that you don 't know gender  
 so let me first let you know that there 's nothing at all distinct about this audience that explains the pattern of recognition that we 've just seen  
 i 've done this exercise dozens of times around the country  i 've done it to women 's rights organizations
  i 've done it with civil rights groups  i 've done it with professors  i 've done it with students  i 've done it with psychologists  i 've done it with sociologists  
 i 've done it even with progressive members of congress and everywhere the awareness of the level of police violence that black women experience is exceedingly low
  would be the case i mean there are two issues involved here there 's police violence against 
 and there 's violence against women two issues that have been talked about a lot lately  
 but when we think about who is implicated by these problems  when we think about who is victimized by these problems 
 the names of these black women never come to mind
 now  communications experts tell us that when facts do not fit with the available frames 
 people have a difficult time incorporating new facts into their way of thinking about a problem 
 these women 's names have slipped through our consciousness because there are no frames for us to see them  no frames for us to remember them
 no frames for us to hold them  
 as a consequence reporters don 't lead with them  
 policymakers don 't think about them  and politicians aren 't encouraged or demanded that they speak to them  
 now you might ask why does a frame matter
 black people and an issue that affects women wouldn 't that necessarily include
 black people who are women and women who are black people 
 well  the simple answer is that this is a trickle down approach to social justice and many times
 it just doesn 't work  without frames that allow us to see how social problems impact all the members
  of a targeted group many will fall through the cracks of our movements left to suffer in virtual isolation
 but it 
  to be this way 
 many years ago i began to use the term intersectionality 
 to deal with the fact that many of our social justice problems like racism and
  sexism are
 often overlapping creating multiple levels of social injustice 
 now  the experience that gave rise to intersectionality was my chance encounter with a woman named emma degraffenreid 
  a working wife and a mother  i actually read about emma 's story from the pages of a legal opinion
 written by a judge who had dismissed emma 's claim of race and gender discrimination against a local
 car manufacturing plant emma like so many 
  women sought better employment for her family and for others
  she wanted to create a better life for her children and for her family 
 but she applied for a job  and she was not hired and she believed that she was not hired because she was a black woman 
 now  the judge in question dismissed emma 's suit  
 and the argument for dismissing the suit was that the employer did hire
  employer
 hired women 
 the real problem though that the judge was not willing to acknowledge was what emma was actually trying to say that the 
  that were hired  usually for industrial jobs maintenance jobs were all men and the
  only if the court was able to see how these policies came together would he be able to see the double discrimination
 that emma degraffenreid was facing 
 but the court refused to allow emma to put two causes of action together to tell her story because he believed that by allowing her to do that
  she would be able to have preferential treatment she would have an advantage by having two swings at the bat 
 when  african american men and white women only had one swing at the bat 
 but of 
  men or white women needed to combine a race and gender discrimination claim to tell the
  story of the discrimination they were experiencing why wasn 't the real unfairness
 law 's refusal to protect
  women simply because their experiences weren 't exactly the same as white women and 
  men rather than broadening the frame to include
 african american women the court simply tossed their case completely out of court 
 now as a student of antidiscrimination law as a feminist as an antiracist 
 i was struck
 by this case it felt to me like
  allowed to work at the plant  
 second of all the court doubled down on this exclusion by making it legally inconsequential and to boot 
 there was no name for this problem  
 and we all know that where there 's no name for a problem  you can 't see a problem and when you can 't see a problem you pretty much can 't solve it
  many years later  i had come to recognize that the problem
 that emma was facing was a framing problem  
 the frame that the court was using to see gender discrimination or to see race discrimination was partial  and it was distorting 
  the challenge that i faced was trying to figure out whether there was an alternative narrative a prism that would allow us to see 
 emma 's dilemma a prism that would allow us to rescue her from the cracks in the law that would allow judges to see her story 
  a simple analogy to an intersection
 might allow judges to better see emma 's dilemma  
 so if we think about this intersection the roads to the intersection would be the way that the workforce was structured by race and by gender 
 and then the traffic
 in those roads would be the hiring
  and the other practices that ran through those roads now because emma was both black and female she was positioned precisely where those roads overlapped 
 experiencing the simultaneous impact
 of the company 's gender and race traffic the law
 the law is like that ambulance that shows
  up
 and is ready to treat emma only if it can be shown that she was harmed on the race road or on the gender road but not where those roads intersected  
 so what do you call being impacted by multiple forces
 and then abandoned to fend for yourself intersectionality
  seemed to do it for me  i would go on to learn that
  women like other women of color like other socially marginalized people all over the world were facing all kinds of dilemmas and challenges as a consequence of
  all of these social dynamics come together
 and create challenges that are sometimes quite unique  but in the same way that intersectionality
 raised our awareness to the way that black women live their lives
  it also exposes the tragic circumstances under which 
  women die police violence against black women
 is very real  the level of violence that black women face is such that it 's not surprising
 that some of them do not survive their encounters with police
 black girls as young as seven  great grandmothers as old as 
 have been killed by the police  they 've been killed in their living rooms 
 in their bedrooms  they 've been killed in their cars  
 they 've been killed on the street  they 've been killed in front of their parents
  been killed
 in front of their children  they have been shot to death  
 they have been stomped to death  
 they have been suffocated to death  they have been manhandled to death  they have been tasered to death  
 they 've been killed when they 've called
  they 've been killed when they were alone and they 've been killed when they were with others  
 they 've been killed shopping while black  driving while black  
 having a mental disability while black  having a domestic disturbance while black  
 they 've even been killed
 being homeless while black  they 've been killed
  talking on the cell phone  laughing with friends  sitting in a car reported as stolen
 and making a u turn in front of the white house with an infant strapped in the backseat of the car  
 why don 't we know these stories  
  is it that their lost lives
 don 't generate the same amount of media attention and communal outcry as the lost lives of their fallen brothers 
 it 's time for a change  
 so what can we do 
 in two thousand and fourteen the african american policy forum began to demand that we say her name
 at rallies at protests 
 at conferences  at meetings 
 anywhere and everywhere that state violence against black bodies is being discussed  
 but saying her name is is not enough we have to be willing to do more we have to be willing to bear witness to bear
  witness to the often painful realities that we would just rather not confront  the everyday violence and humiliation that many 
 black women have had to face black women across color  age gender expression sexuality and ability  
 bearing in mind that some of the images that i 'm about to share with you may be triggering for some
 to collectively bear witness to some of this violence we
 're going to hear the voice of the phenomenal abby dobson  
 and as we sit with these women some who have experienced violence and
  who have not survived them  we have an opportunity to reverse what happened at the beginning
 of this talk when we could not stand for these women because we did not know their names 
 so at the end of this clip there 's going to be a roll call 
 several black women 's names will come up
  like those of you who are able to join us in saying these names as loud as you can randomly  disorderly 
 let 's create a cacophony of sound
 to represent our intention to hold these women up to sit
  to bear witness to them  to bring them into the light
  so i said at the beginning if we can 't see a problem  we can 't fix a problem  
  we 've come together to bear witness to these women 's lost lives  
 but the time now is to move from mourning and grief
 to action and transformation 
 this is something that we can do it 's up to us  
 thank you for joining us
