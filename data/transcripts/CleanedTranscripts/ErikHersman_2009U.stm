  so i 'm here to tell you a story of success from africa 
 a year and a half ago 
 four of the five people who are full time members at ushahidi  which means testimony in swahili  
 were ted fellows 
 a year ago in kenya
 we had  post election violence  and in that time
 we prototyped and built in about three days a system that would allow anybody with a mobile phone to send in information and reports on what was happening around them 
 we took what we knew about africa  the default device the mobile phone as our common denominator and went from there 
 we got reports like this
  this is just a couple of them from january 17th last year 
 and our system was rudimentary  it was
 very basic it was a mash up that used data that we collected from people and we put it on our map  
 but then we decided we needed to do something more we needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world 
 and so there is a team of developers
  from all over africa who are part of this team now from ghana from malawi from kenya there is even some from the u s 
 we 're building for smartphones so that it can be used in the developed world as well as the developing world 
 we are realizing that this is true  if it works in africa then it will work anywhere  
 and so we we build
  it in africa first and then we move to the edges 
 it 's now been deployed in the democratic republic of the congo it 's being used by ngos all over east africa  small ngos doing their own little projects
 just this last month it was deployed by al jazeera in gaza  
 but that 's actually not what i 'm here to talk about i 'm here to talk about the next big thing because what we 're finding out is that we have this capacity to report
 eyewitness accounts of what 's going on in real time we 're seeing this in
  like mumbai recently  
 where it 's so much easier to report now than it is to consume it there is so much information what do you do this is the twitter reports for over three days just covering mumbai  
 how do you decide what is important  what is the veracity level of what you 're looking at 
 so what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information
 because there is just too much information for us to
  to to actually do anything with right now 
 and what we 're actually really concerned with is this first three hours  what we are looking at is the first three hours  how do we deal with that information that is coming in you can 't understand 
  what is actually happening on the ground and around the world people are still curious  and trying to figure out what is going on but they
 don 't know
