  of course it is how do we know it  because of data  
 you look at supermarket sales you look at supermarket sales of 30 centimeter pies that are frozen
 and apple wins  no contest the majority of the sales are apple  
 but then supermarkets started selling smaller
 11 centimeter pies  and suddenly apple fell to fourth or fifth place 
 why what happened okay 
  you can buy the one that you want  you can get your first choice
  you have more data  you can see something that you couldn 't see when you only had smaller amounts of it  
 now the point here is that more data doesn 't just let us see more more of the same thing we were looking at more data allows us to see new  
 it allows us to see better  
 it allows us to
  it allows us to see
 what america 's favorite pie is not apple  
 now you probably all have heard the term big data 
 in fact you 're probably sick of hearing the term big data  it is true that there is a lot of hype around the term and that is very unfortunate 
 because big data is an extremely important tool by which society is going to advance
  in the past  we used to look at small data and think about what it would mean to try to understand the world and now we have a lot more of it  more than we ever could before 
 what we find is that when we have a large body of data we can fundamentally do things that we couldn 't do when we only had smaller amounts big
 data is important  and big data is new and when you think about it 
 the only way this planet is going to deal with its global challenges to feed people supply them with medical care  
 supply them with energy  electricity and to make sure they 're not burnt to a crisp because of global warming
 is because of the effective use of data  so what is new about big data what is the big
  to answer that question let 's think about what information looked like physically looked like in the past in
 one thousand nine hundred and eight on the island of crete archaeologists discovered
 a clay disc 
 they dated it from two thousand b c so it 's four thousand years old  
 now  there 's inscriptions on this disc but we actually don 't know what it means it 's a complete mystery  but the point is that this is what information used to look like four thousand years ago
 this is how society stored and transmitted information 
 now  society hasn 't advanced all that much 
 we still store information on discs  but now we can store a lot more information more than ever before
  and what we can do is we can reuse this information for uses that we never even imagined when we first collected the data 
 in this respect the data has gone from a stock
 to a flow from something that is stationary and static to something that is fluid
 and dynamic  there is if you will a liquidity to information
  the disc
 that was discovered off of crete that 's four thousand years old is heavy 
 it doesn 't store a lot of information  and that information is unchangeable 
 by contrast all of the files
 that edward snowden took from the national security agency in the united states fits on a memory stick
 the size of a fingernail
  and it can be shared at the speed of light  
 more data  more 
 now one reason why we have so much data in the world today is we are collecting things that we 've always collected information on 
 but another reason why is we 're taking things
 that have always been informational
 but have never been rendered into a data
  format and we are putting it into data  think for example the question of location 
 take for example martin luther if we wanted to know in the 1500s where martin luther was 
 we would have to follow him at all times maybe with a feathery quill and an inkwell and record it  
 but now think about what it
  looks like today you know
 that somewhere probably in a telecommunications carrier 's database there is a spreadsheet or at least a database entry
 that records your information of where you 've been at all times if you have a cell phone  and that cell phone has gps but even if it doesn 't have gps it can record your information 
 in this respect location has been datafied 
 now think for example of the issue of
 posture  the way that you are all sitting right now
  the way that you sit  the way that you sit  the way that you sit it 's all different  and it 's a function of your leg length and your back and the contours of your back 
 and if i were to put sensors maybe one hundred sensors into all of your chairs right now  i could create an index that 's fairly unique to you 
 sort of like a fingerprint but it 's not your finger  
 so what could we do with this
  researchers in tokyo
 are using it as a potential anti theft device in cars  
 the idea is that the carjacker sits behind the wheel  tries to stream off but the car recognizes that a non approved driver is behind the wheel  and maybe the engine just stops unless you type in a
 password into the dashboard to say hey  i have authorization to
  what if every single car in europe had this technology in it  what could we do then 
 maybe if we aggregated the data maybe we could identify telltale signs that best predict
 that a car accident is going to take place in the next five seconds  and then what we
  would be when the car senses that the person slumps into that position  
 automatically knows  hey  set an internal alarm that would vibrate the steering wheel  honk inside to say hey  wake up pay more attention to the road 
 these are the sorts of things we can do when we datafy more aspects of our lives
  so what is the value of big data  
 well think about it
  you have more information  you can do things that you couldn 't do before 
 one of the most impressive areas where this concept is taking place is in the area of machine learning machine learning is a
 branch of artificial intelligence which itself is a branch of computer science 
 the general idea is that instead of instructing a computer what do do we are going to simply throw data at the problem
 and tell the computer to figure it out for itself 
 and it will help you understand it by seeing its origins  
 in the 1950s a computer scientist at ibm named arthur samuel liked to play checkers  so he wrote a computer program so he could play against the computer  
 he played 
  because the computer only knew what a legal move was arthur samuel knew something else  arthur samuel knew
 strategy  so he wrote a small sub program alongside it
 operating in the background and all it did was score the probability that a given board configuration would likely lead to a winning board versus a losing board after every
  move he plays the computer
 he wins  he plays the computer  he wins  he plays the computer  he wins  
 and then arthur samuel leaves the computer to play itself it plays itself  it collects more data  it collects more data
  it increases the accuracy of its prediction  
 and then arthur samuel goes back to the computer and he plays it  and he loses  
 and he plays it  and he loses  and he plays it  and he loses  
 and arthur samuel has created a machine that surpasses his ability in a task that he taught it  
 and this idea of machine learning is going everywhere 
 how do you think we have
 are we any better off as a society
 enshrining all the rules of the road into software  no  memory is cheaper no algorithms are faster no  processors are better  no  
 all of those things matter  but that 's not why it 's because we changed the nature of the problem we changed the nature of the problem from one in which
 we tried to overtly and explicitly explain to the computer how to drive to one in which we say here 's a lot of data around the vehicle  you figure it out  
 you figure it out that that is a traffic light that that traffic light is red and not green  that that means that you need to stop
 and not go forward 
 machine learning is at the basis of many of the things that we do online  search engines  amazon 's personalization
  voice recognition systems  
 researchers recently have looked at
 the question of biopsies cancerous biopsies  
 and they 've asked the computer to identify by looking at the data and survival rates to determine
 whether cells are actually
 cancerous or not
  sure enough when you throw the data at it through a machine learning algorithm the
 machine was able to identify the twelve telltale signs that best predict that this biopsy of the breast cancer cells are indeed cancerous 
 the problem  
 the medical literature only knew nine of them 
  of the traits were ones that people didn 't need to look for but that the machine spotted
 now  there are
 dark sides to big data as well it will improve our lives but there are problems that we need to be conscious of 
 and the first one is the idea
 that we may be punished for predictions that the police may use big data for their purposes
 little bit like minority report now  it 's a term called predictive policing or algorithmic criminology  
 and the idea is that if we take a lot of data for example where past crimes have been we know where to send the patrols 
 that makes sense but the problem of course is that it 's not simply going to stop on location data  
 it 's going to go down to the level of the individual why don 't we use data
  about the person 's high school transcript  
 maybe we should use the fact that they 're unemployed or not their credit score their web surfing behavior whether they 're up late at night 
 their fitbit when it 's able to identify biochemistries will show that they have aggressive thoughts 
 we may have algorithms that are likely to predict what we are about to do and we may be held accountable before we 've actually acted
  privacy was the central challenge in a small data era in the big data age the challenge will be
 safeguarding free will 
 moral choice  human volition  human agency  
 there is another problem big data is going to steal our jobs
  big data and algorithms are going to challenge
 white collar professional knowledge work in the 21st century in the same way that factory automation
 and the assembly line challenged blue collar labor in the 20th century think about a lab technician who is looking through a microscope at a cancer biopsy and determining whether it 's cancerous or not 
 the person went to
  university the person buys property  he or she votes  he or she is a stakeholder in society  
 and that person 's job as well as an entire fleet of professionals like that person is going to find that their jobs are radically changed
 or actually completely eliminated  now we like to think that technology creates jobs over a period of time after a short
  period of dislocation  and that is true for the frame of reference with which we all live the industrial revolution because that 's precisely what happened  
 but we forget something in that analysis  there are some categories of jobs that simply get eliminated and never come back  
 the industrial revolution wasn 't very good if you were a horse  
  so we 're going to need to be careful
 and take big data and adjust it for our needs our very human needs 
 we have to be the master of this technology not its servant  we are just at the outset of the big data era  
 and honestly we are not very good at handling all the data that we can now collect  
 it 's not just a problem for the national security agency  businesses collect lots of data and they misuse it too
 and we need to get better at this and this will take time 
 it 's a little bit like the challenge that was faced by primitive man and fire this is a tool but this is a tool that unless we 're careful will burn us 
 big data is going to transform how we live  how we work and how we think 
 it is going to help us manage our careers and lead lives of
  satisfaction
 and hope
 and happiness and health  
 but in the past we 've often looked at information technology and our eyes have only seen the t the technology the hardware because that 's what was physical 
 we now need to recast our gaze at the i the information which is less apparent  but in some ways a lot more important
  humanity can finally learn from the information that it can collect as part of our timeless quest
 to understand the world and our place in it  and that 's why big data is a big deal
