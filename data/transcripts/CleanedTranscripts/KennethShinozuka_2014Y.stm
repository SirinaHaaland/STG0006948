  what 's the fastest growing threat to americans ' health 
 cancer  heart attacks  diabetes the answer is actually none of these it 's alzheimer 's disease  every sixty seven seconds
 someone in the united states is diagnosed with alzheimer 's 
 as the number of alzheimer 's patients triples by the year two thousand and fifty caring for them  as well as the rest of the aging population  will become an overwhelming societal challenge 
 my family has experienced firsthand the struggles of caring for an alzheimer 's patient 
 growing up in a family with three generations i 've always been very close to my grandfather 
 when i was four years old my grandfather and i were walking in a park in japan when he suddenly got lost  it was one of the scariest moments i 've ever experienced
  life and it was also the first instance that informed us that my grandfather had alzheimer 's disease  
 over the past twelve years his condition got worse and worse and his wandering in particular caused my family a lot of stress my aunt his primary caregiver really struggled to stay awake at night to keep an eye on him and even then often failed to catch him leaving the bed  
 i became really concerned about my aunt 's well being as well as my grandfather 's safety  i searched extensively for a solution that could help my family 's problems  but couldn 't find one 
 then one night about two years ago  
 i was looking after my grandfather and i saw him stepping out of the bed 
 the moment his foot landed on the floor  i thought  why don 't i put a pressure sensor on the heel of his foot  
 once he stepped onto the floor and out of the bed the pressure sensor would detect an increase in pressure caused by body weight and then wirelessly send an audible alert to the caregiver
  smartphone that way my aunt could sleep much better at night without having to worry about my grandfather 's wandering  so now i 'd like to perform a demonstration of this sock
  could i please have my sock model on the stage  
 great  
 so once
  so this is a drawing of my preliminary design 
 my desire to create a sensor based technology perhaps stemmed from my lifelong love for sensors and technology when i was six
  years old an elderly family friend fell down in the bathroom and suffered severe injuries  i became concerned about my own grandparents and decided to invent a smart bathroom system motion sensors would be installed 
  inside the tiles of bathroom floors to detect the falls of elderly patients whenever they fell down in the bathroom 
 but nonetheless my research experience really implanted in me a firm desire to use sensors to help the elderly people i really believe that sensors can improve the quality of life of the elderly 
 when i laid out my plan i realized that i faced three main challenges first  creating a sensor second designing a circuit and third coding a smartphone app this made me realize that my project was actually much harder to realize
  i initially had thought it to be 
 first i had to create a wearable sensor that was thin and flexible enough to be worn comfortably on the bottom of the patient 's foot  
 after extensive research and testing of different materials like rubber which i realized was too thick to be worn snugly on the bottom of the foot  i decided to print a film sensor with electrically conductive
  pressure sensitive ink particles once pressure is applied the connectivity between the particles increases  therefore i could design a circuit that would measure
  pressure by measuring electrical resistance  
 next i had to design a wearable wireless circuit  
 but wireless signal transmission consumes lots of power and requires heavy bulky batteries  
 thankfully i was able to find out about the bluetooth low energy technology which consumes very little power and can be driven by a coin sized battery  
 this prevented the system from dying in the middle of the night  
 lastly i had to code a smartphone app that would essentially transform
  the care giver 's smartphone into a remote monitor 
 for this i had to expand upon my knowledge of coding with java and xcode and i also had to learn about how to code for bluetooth low energy devices by watching youtube tutorials and reading various textbooks  
 integrating these components i was able to successfully create two prototypes one in which the sensor is embedded inside a sock
  and another that 's a re attachable sensor assembly that can be adhered anywhere that makes contact with the bottom of the patient 's foot  
 i 've tested the device on my grandfather for about a year now and it 's had a one hundred percent success rate in detecting the over nine hundred known cases of his wandering  
 last summer i was able to beta test my device at several residential care facilities in california 
 and i 'm currently incorporating the feedback to further improve the device into a marketable product
  testing the device on a number of patients made me realize that i needed to invent solutions for people who didn 't want to wear socks to sleep at night  
 so sensor data collected on a vast number of patients can be useful for improving
 patient care and also leading to a cure for the disease possibly 
 for example i 'm currently examining correlations between the frequency of a patient 's nightly wandering and his or her daily activities and diet  
  one thing i 'll never forget is when my device first caught my grandfather 's wandering out of bed at night at that moment i was really struck by the power of technology to change lives for the better 
 people living happily and healthfully that 's the world that i imagine thank you very much
