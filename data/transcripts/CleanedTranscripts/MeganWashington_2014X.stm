  know when i agreed to
 to do this whether i was expected to talk or to sing but when i was told that the
  i felt that i had to speak about something for a moment 
 i have a
 a problem  
 it 's not the worst thing in the world i 'm fine i 'm not on fire 
 i know that other people in the world have far worse things to to deal with but for me 
 language and music are inextricably linked through
  this one thing and the thing is that i have a stutter  
 it might seem
 curious given that i spend a lot of my life on the stage one would assume that i 'm
 comfortable in the public sphere and comfortable here speaking to you guys
  the truth is that i 've spent my life up until this
 point and including this point living in mortal dread
 of public speaking public singing  whole different thing 
 but we 'll get to that in a moment  i 've never really talked about it before so explicitly
  explicitly  i think that that 's because i 've always lived in hope that when i was a grown up i wouldn
 't have have one 
 i sort of lived with this idea that when i 'm grown i 'll have learned to speak french and when i
  learn how to manage my money and when i 'm grown i won 't have a stutter and then i 'll be able to public speak and maybe be the prime minister and anything 's possible and you know
 so i can talk about it now because i 've reached this
 point where
 i mean 
 pretty sure that i 'm grown now 
 and i 'm an adult woman
  woman who spends her life as a
 performer with a speech impediment  so i might as well come clean about it 
 there are some interesting angles to having a stutter for
 me the worst thing that can happen is
  my horror when i realized he thought i was making fun of
  forgotten their name when i
 hesitate before saying it and it is a very weird thing because proper nouns
 are the worst if i 'm going to use the word
  wednesday in a sentence  and
 i 'm coming up to the word and i can feel that i 'm going to stutter or something i can
 change the word to tomorrow or the day after tuesday or
 something else it 's clunky but you can get away with it because over time i 've developed this
 loophole
  method of using speech
 where right at the last minute you
 change the thing and you trick your brain  
 but with people 's names you can 't change them 
 when i was singing a lot of jazz i worked a lot with a
 pianist whose name was steve as you can
 probably gather s 's and t 's together or independently are my kryptonite  
 but i would have to introduce the band over this rolling vamp  
 and when i got around to steve i 'd often find myself stuck
  and it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable and it totally kills the vibe  so after a few instances of this steve
 happily became seve and
 we got through it that way 
 i 've had a lot of therapy and a common form of treatment is to use this technique that 's called smooth speech
  which is where you almost sing everything that you say 
 you kind of join everything together in this very singsong  kindergarten
 teacher way  and it makes you sound very serene like you 've had lots of valium
  i do use that i do  i use it when i have to be on
 panel shows  or when i have to do
 radio interviews when the economy of airtime is paramount 
 i get through it that way for my
  but as an artist who feels that their work is is based solely on a platform of honesty
 and being
 real that feels often like cheating  
 which is why before i sing  i wanted to tell you what singing means to me  
 it 's more than making
  nice
 sounds  and it 's more than making nice songs  
 it 's more than feeling known or understood it
 's more than
 making you feel the the things that i feel  it 's not about mythology or mythologizing myself to you
  somehow through some miraculous
 synaptic function of the human brain  it 's impossible to stutter when you sing
  and when i was younger that was a method of treatment that worked very well for me singing
 so i did it a lot 
 and that 's why i 'm here today
  time when i feel fluent
 it is the only time when what comes out of my mouth is comprehensively exactly what i intended 
 so i know that this is a ted talk but now i 'm going to
  this is a song that i wrote last year thank you very much
