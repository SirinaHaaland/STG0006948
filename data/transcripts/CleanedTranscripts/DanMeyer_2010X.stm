  to please recall a time when you really loved something a movie an album a song or a book and you recommended it wholeheartedly
 to someone you also really liked and you anticipated that reaction you waited for it and it came back and the person hated it
  way of introduction that is the exact same state in which i spent every working day of the last six years 
 i teach high school math  i sell a product to a market that doesn 't want it but is forced by law to buy it i mean it
 's just a losing proposition  so there 's there 's a useful stereotype about students that i see a useful stereotype about you all i could give you guys an
 algebra two final exam  and i would expect no higher than a twenty five percent pass rate 
 and both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the u s today 
 to start with i 'd like to break math down into two categories one is computation this is the stuff you 've forgotten for example factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one 
 this stuff is also really easy to relearn provided you have a really
  strong grounding in reasoning math reasoning we 'll call it the the application of math processes to the world around us
 this is hard to teach this is what we would love students to retain even if they don 't go into mathematical fields this is also something that the way we teach it in the u s all but ensures they won 't retain it  
 so i 'd like to talk about why that is why that 's
  can do about it and to close with why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher
  so first  five symptoms that you 're doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom  one is a lack of initiative your students don 't self start 
 you finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re explain the entire thing at their desks
 students lack perseverance they lack retention you find yourself
  three months later wholesale there 's an aversion to word problems which describes ninety nine percent of my students  and then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation
  this is really destructive 
 david milch  creator of deadwood and other amazing tv shows has a really good description for this he swore off creating
 contemporary drama shows set in the present day because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of for example
  men no disrespect it shapes the neural pathways he said in such a way that they expect simple problems he called it an impatience with irresolution you 're impatient with things that don 't resolve quickly you expect 
 problems that wrap up in twenty two minutes three commercial breaks and a laugh track  and i 'll put it to all of
  what you already know that no problem worth solving is that simple
  i am very concerned about this because i 'm going to retire in a world that my students will run
  i 'm doing bad things to my own future and well being when i teach this way i 'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks particularly mass adopted textbooks 
  teach math reasoning and patient problem solving  it 's functionally equivalent to turning on two and a half men and calling it a day
  's an example from a physics textbook it applies equally to math notice  
 first of all here that you have exactly three pieces of information there each of which will figure into a formula somewhere eventually which the student will then compute
  i believe in real life and ask yourself what problem have you solved ever that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance where you didn 't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out 
 sufficient information and had to go find some 
 i 'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that 
 and the textbook  i think knows how it 's hamstringing students because watch this this is the practice problem set when it comes time to do the actual problem set we have problems like this right here where 
 we 're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit  and if the student still doesn 't recognize the stamp this was molded from it helpfully explains
  problem you can return to to find the formula you could literally i mean this pass this particular unit without knowing any physics just knowing how to decode a textbook that 's
 a shame  
 so i can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math here 's a really cool problem i like this it 's about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift but what you have here is actually four separate layers and i 'm curious
 which of you can see the four separate layers and
 how when they 're compressed together and presented to the student all at once how that creates this impatient problem solving i
 'll define them here  you have the visual
  you also have the mathematical structure  talking about grids measurements labels points  axes that sort of thing you have substeps which all lead to what we really want to talk about which section is the steepest  
 so i hope you can see i really hope you can see how what we 're doing here is taking a compelling
  question a compelling answer but we 're paving a smooth  straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way that 's all we 're doing here 
 so i want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students we can have everything we 're looking for in terms of patient problem solving so right here i start with the
  and i immediately ask the question which section is the steepest  and this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers so you get people arguing against each other friend versus friend 
 in pairs  journaling whatever  
 and then eventually we realize it  it 's getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line and we realize how great would it be if we just had some a b c and d labels to talk about them more easily  
  as we start to define what what does steepness mean we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down specifically what that means  and then and only then we throw down that mathematical structure 
 the math serves the conversation the conversation doesn 't serve the math and
 at that point i 'll put it to you that nine out of ten classes are good to go on the whole slope steepness
  but if you need to your students can then develop those substeps together 
 do you guys see how this right here compared to that which one creates that patient problem solving that math reasoning  it 's been obvious in my practice to me 
 and i 'll yield the floor here for a second to einstein who i believe has paid his dues 
 he talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important  and yet in my practice  in the u s here  we just give problems to students we don 't involve them in the formulation of the problem 
 so ninety percent of what i
 with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving 
 and here 's how it works  i like this question  it 's about a water tank the question is how long will it take you to fill it up  
  they have to formulate those  and then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you 'll need none of it 's a distractor so we lose that students need to decide all right well does the height matter  does 
  the side of it matter  does the color of the valve matter what matters here such an underrepresented question in math curriculum 
 in textbooks we go out and we take a picture of it 
 so now we have the real deal how long will it take it to fill it up  
 and then even better is we take a video a video of someone filling it up 
 and it 's filling up slowly agonizingly slowly it 's tedious students are looking at their watches rolling their eyes  and they 're all wondering at some point
  how you know you 've baited the hook right
  and that question off this right here is really fun for me because like the intro i teach kids because of my inexperience i teach the kids 
  that are the most remedial all right  and i 've got kids who will not join a conversation about math because
  formula better than me  so i won 't talk about it but here  every student is on a level playing field of intuition
 everyone 's filled something up with water before  so i get kids answering the question how long will it take i 've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation we put names on the board  
 attach them to guesses
 and kids have bought in here  and then we follow the process i 've described  and the best part here
 or one of the better parts is that we don 't get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher 's edition we instead just watch the end of the movie 
 and that 's terrifying because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher 's edition  that 's great but
 it 's scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical but those conversations have been so valuable among the
  most valuable  so i 'm here to report some really fun games with students who come pre installed with these viruses day one of the class  these are the kids who
  who now one semester in i can put something on the board  totally new  totally foreign  and they 'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year which is just so fun
  're no longer averse to word problems because we 've redefined what a word problem is 
 we 're no longer intimidated by math because we 're slowly redefining what math is this has been a lot of fun  
 i encourage math teachers i talk to to use multimedia because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color 
 to encourage student intuition for that level playing field to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation 
 to let students build the problem because einstein
  said so and to finally in total just be less helpful
 because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways it 's buying you out of your obligation for patient problem solving and math reasoning 
 to be less helpful and why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high quality curriculum in our front pocket  
 it 's ubiquitous and fairly cheap  
 and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses
 has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous i put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got
 six thousand views in two weeks 
 i get emails still from from teachers in countries i 've never visited saying wow yeah we had a good conversation about that oh and by the way here 's how i made your stuff better 
 which wow  
 i put this problem on my blog recently in a grocery store which line do you get into the one that has one cart and nineteen items
 the line with with four carts and three five two and one items  and the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom 
 but it eventually got me on good morning america a few weeks later  which is just bizarre right
  patient problem solving
