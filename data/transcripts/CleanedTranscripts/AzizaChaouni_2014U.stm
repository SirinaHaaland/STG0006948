  i would like to share with you today a project that has changed how i approach and practice architecture the fez river rehabilitation project 
 my hometown of fez morocco  boasts one of the largest walled medieval cities in the world called the medina  nestled in a river valley
  the entire city is a unesco world heritage site  since the 
  as the population of the medina grew basic urban infrastructure such as green open spaces and sewage quickly changed and got highly stressed  
 one of the biggest casualties of the situation
 was the fez river which bisects the medina in its middle and has
  been considered for many centuries as the city 's very soul 
 in fact one can witness the presence of the river 's extensive water network all throughout the city in places such as private and public fountains  
 unfortunately  because of the pollution of the river  it has been
  this process of erasure was coupled with the destruction of many houses along the river banks to be able to make machineries enter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina 
 those urban voids quickly became illegal parking or trash yards 
 actually the state of the river before entering the medina is pretty healthy 
 then pollution takes
  its toll mainly due to untreated sewage and chemical dumping from crafts such as tanning  
 at some point i couldn 't bear the desecration of the river  such an important part of my city  and i decided to take action especially after i heard 
  that the city received a grant to divert sewage water and to treat it 
  river became possible and with luck and actually a lot of pushing my partner takako tajima and i were commissioned by the city to work with a team of engineers to uncover the river  
 however we were sneaky and we proposed more to convert riverbanks
 into pedestrian pathways and then to connect these pathways back to the city fabric  and finally to
  convert the urban voids along the riverbanks into public spaces that are lacking in the medina of fez 
 i will show you briefly now two of these public spaces 
 the first one is the rcif plaza which sits actually right on top of the river  which you can see here in dotted lines
 this plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub that
  compromised the urban integrity of the medina  that has the largest pedestrian network in the world 
 and right beyond the historic bridge that you can see here right next to the plaza you can see that the river looked like a river of trash
  instead what we proposed is to make the plaza entirely pedestrian
  to cover it with recycled leather canopies and to connect it to the banks of the river  
 the second site of intervention is also an urban void along the river banks and it used to be an illegal parking and we proposed to transform it into the first playground in the medina 
 the playground is constructed using recycled tires and also is coupled with a constructed wetland that not only cleans the water of the river but also retains it when floods
  occur  as the project progressed and received several design awards  new stakeholders intervened and changed the project goals
 and design the only way for us to be able to bring the main goals of the project ahead was for us to do something very unusual that usually 
 architects don 't do it was for us to take our design ego and our sense of
  authorship and put it in the backseat and to focus mainly on being activists and on trying to coalesce
 all of the agendas of stakeholders and focus on the main goals of the project that is to uncover the river  treat its water and provide public spaces for all 
 we were actually very lucky and many of those goals happened or are in the process of happening like you can see here in the rcif plaza
  how it looked like about six years ago
  this is how it looks like today it 's still under construction but actually it is heavily used by the local population  
 and finally  this is how the rcif plaza will look like when the project is completed  
 this is the river  covered used as a trash yard  then after many years of work the river
  and finally you can see here the river when the project will be completed  
 so for sure the fez river rehabilitation will keep on changing and adapting to the sociopolitical landscape of the city 
 but we strongly believe that by reimagining the role and the agency of the architect we have set up the core idea of the project into motion 
 that is to transform the river from sewage to public space for all 
 thereby making sure that the city of fez will remain a living city for its inhabitants rather than a mummified heritage  thank you very much
