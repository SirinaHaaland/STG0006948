  journalist was asking him a question about the news feed  and the journalist was asking him why is this so important 
 and zuckerberg said a squirrel dying in your front yard
 may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying
 in africa and i want to talk about what a web based on that idea of relevance might look like so when i was growing up
 in a really rural area in maine the internet meant something very different to me  it meant
 a connection to the world it meant something that would connect us all together  and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society
  but there 's this shift in how information is flowing online and it 's invisible  
 and if we don 't pay attention to it it could be a real problem  
 so i first noticed this
 in a place i spend a lot of time my facebook page i 'm progressive politically big surprise but i 've always
 gone out of my way to meet conservatives i like hearing what they 're thinking about
  like seeing what they link to i like learning a thing or two  and so i was surprised when i noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my facebook feed  
 and
 what it turned out was going on was that facebook was looking at which links i clicked on and it was noticing that actually i was clicking more on my liberal friends
  than on my conservative friends ' links and without consulting me about it it had edited them out they disappeared
  so facebook isn 't the only place that 's doing this kind of invisible algorithmic editing of the web 
 google 's doing it too 
 if i search for something and you search for something even right now at the very same time
  we may get very different search results  even if you 're logged out one engineer told me there are fifty seven signals
 that google looks at
 everything from what kind of computer you 're on to what kind of browser you 're using
 to where you 're located that it uses to personally tailor your query results think about it for a second  there is no standard
  and you know the funny thing about this is that it 's hard to see you can 't see how different your search results are from anyone else 's 
 but a couple of weeks ago i asked a bunch of friends to google egypt 
 and to send me screen shots of what they got  
 so here 's my friend
 scott 's screen shot  and here 's my friend daniel 's screen shot 
  you don 't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are but when you do read the links it 's really quite remarkable  
 daniel didn 't get anything about the protests in egypt at all in his first page of google results  scott 's results were full of them  and this was the big story of the day at that time that 's how different these results are becoming  
 so it 's not just google and facebook
  this is something that 's sweeping the web there are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization yahoo news the biggest news site on the internet is now personalized different people get different things  
 huffington post the washington post the new york times all flirting with personalization in various ways and this this moves us very quickly
 toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see  but not necessarily what we need to
 as eric schmidt said 
 it will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them 
 so i do think this is a problem  and
 i think if you take all of these filters together you take all these algorithms you get what i call a filter bubble and your filter bubble is
 your own personal  unique universe of information that you live in online  and what 's in your filter bubble
 depends on who you are  and it depends on what you do but the thing is that you don 't decide what gets in and more importantly 
 you don 't actually see
 what gets edited out  so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at netflix
 and they were looking at the netflix queues and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed 
 which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses they enter the queue they just zip right out 
 so iron man zips right out and waiting for superman can wait for a really long time 
 what they discovered was that in our netflix queues there 's this epic struggle going on
 between our future aspirational selves
 and our more impulsive present selves you know we all want to be someone who has watched rashomon but right now
 we want to watch ace ventura for the fourth time 
 so the best editing gives us a bit of both it gives us a little bit of justin bieber and a little bit of afghanistan
  it gives us some information vegetables it gives us some information dessert  
 and the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters these personalized filters is that because they 're mainly looking at what you click on first
 it can throw off that balance  and instead of a
  you can end up surrounded by information junk food
 what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong in a broadcast society this is how the founding mythology goes in a broadcast society  
 there were these gatekeepers the editors  and they controlled the flows of information 
 and along came the internet and it swept them out of the way and it allowed all of us to connect together  and it was awesome  but that 's not
  actually what 's happening right now what we 're seeing is more of a passing of the torch
 from human gatekeepers
 to algorithmic ones  and the thing is that the algorithms don 't yet have the kind of embedded ethics
 that the editors did so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us if they 're going to decide what we get to
  see and what we don 't get to see then we need to make sure that they 're not just keyed to relevance 
 we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable
 or challenging or important this is what ted does other points of view  
 and the thing is we 've actually been here before as a society  
  and fifteen it 's not like newspapers
 were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities  then people noticed that they were doing something really important 
 that in fact you couldn 't have a functioning democracy
 if citizens didn 't get a good flow of information 
 that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter and then journalistic ethics developed  it wasn 't perfect  but it got us through the last century
  and so now we 're kind of back in one thousand nine hundred and fifteen on the web  and we need the new gatekeepers
 to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they 're writing i know that there are a lot of people here from facebook and from google larry and 
 people who have helped build the web as
  and i 'm grateful for that but we really need you to make sure
 that these algorithms
 have encoded in them
 a sense of the public life a sense of civic responsibility 
 we need you to make sure that they 're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters  
 and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide
 what gets through and what doesn 't because i think
 we really need the internet to be
  that thing
 that we all dreamed of it being we need it to connect us all together  we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives 
 and it 's not going to do that
 if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one
