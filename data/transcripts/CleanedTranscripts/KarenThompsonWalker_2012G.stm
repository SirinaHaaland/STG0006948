  three thousand miles off the coast of chile in one of the most remote regions of the pacific ocean twenty american sailors watched their ship flood with seawater 
 they 'd been struck by a sperm whale  which had ripped a catastrophic hole in the ship
  their ship began to sink beneath the swells  the men huddled together in three small whaleboats 
 these men were ten thousand miles from home more than one thousand miles from the nearest scrap of land 
 in their small boats they carried only rudimentary navigational equipment and limited supplies of food and water 
 these were the men of the whaleship essex  whose story would later inspire parts of moby dick even in today 's
 world their situation would be really dire  but think about how much worse it would have been then no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong no search party was coming to look for these men 
 so most of us have never experienced a situation as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves  but we all know what it 's like to be afraid 
 we know how fear feels 
 but i 'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about what our fears mean 
  up we 're often encouraged to think of fear
 as a weakness just another childish thing to discard like baby teeth or roller skates  
 and i think it 's no accident that we think this way  neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings are hard wired to be optimists 
 so maybe that 's why we think of fear sometimes as a danger in and of
  we like to say to one another don 't panic in english fear is something we conquer it 's something we fight it 's something we overcome  
 but what if we looked at fear in a fresh way  
 what if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination something that can be as profound and insightful as storytelling itself 
 it 's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination in young children  whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid  when i was a child i lived in california which
  is you know mostly a very nice place to live but for me as a child california could also be a little scary 
 i remember how how frightening it was to see the chandelier that hung above our dining table swing back and forth during every minor earthquake 
 and i sometimes couldn 't sleep at night terrified that the big one might strike while we were sleeping
 and what we say about kids who have fears like that is that that they have a vivid imagination
  but at a certain point most of us learn to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up we learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed  and not every earthquake brings buildings down  
 but maybe it 's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults the same incredible imaginations that produced
 twenty four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship the time had come for the men to make a plan  but they had very few options 
 in his fascinating account of the disaster  nathaniel philbrick wrote that these men were just about as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on earth 
 the men knew that the nearest islands they could reach were the marquesas islands
  but they 'd heard some frightening rumors  they 'd been told that these islands and several others nearby were populated by cannibals 
 so the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered and eaten for dinner 
 another possible destination was hawaii  but given the season the captain was afraid they 'd be struck by severe storms  
 now the last option was the longest and the most difficult to sail
 thousand five hundred miles due south in hopes of reaching a certain band of winds that could eventually push them toward the coast of south america  
 but they knew that the sheer length of this journey would stretch their supplies of food and water 
 to be eaten by cannibals to be battered by storms to starve to death before reaching land 
 these were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men and as it turned out
  the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died 
 now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name 
 what if instead of calling them fears we called them stories  
 because that 's really what fear is if you think about it it 's a kind of unintentional storytelling that we are all born knowing how to do  
 and fears and storytelling have the same components they have the same architecture
  like all stories fears have characters in our fears the characters are us 
 fears also have plots  they have beginnings and middles and ends you board the plane the plane takes off the engine fails 
 our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel  picture a cannibal human teeth sinking into human skin human flesh
  flesh roasting over a fire 
 fears also have suspense  
 if i 've done my job as a storyteller today you should be wondering what happened to the men of the whaleship essex 
 our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense 
 just like all great stories  our fears focus our attention on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature what will happen next
 in other words our fears make us think about the future  and humans by the way are the only creatures capable of thinking about the future in this way of projecting ourselves forward in time 
 and this mental time travel is just one more thing that fears have in common with storytelling 
 as a writer i can tell you that a big part of writing fiction is learning to predict how one event
 story will affect all the other events
 and fear works in that same way  in fear just like in fiction one thing always leads to another  
 when i was writing my first novel the age of miracles i spent months trying to figure out what would happen if the rotation of the earth suddenly began to slow down
  what would happen to our days what would happen to our crops what would happen to our minds
  and then it was only later that i realized how very similar these questions were to the ones i used to ask myself as a child frightened in the night
 if an earthquake strikes tonight i used to worry  what will happen to our house what will happen to my family  
 and the answer to those questions always took the form of a story 
 so if we think of our fears as more than just fears but as stories  we should think of ourselves as the authors of those stories  but just as importantly
 we need to think of ourselves as the readers of our fears and how we choose to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives 
 now some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others  i read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs  and the author found that these people shared a habit that he called productive paranoia 
 which meant that these people instead of dismissing their fears these people read them closely they studied them and then they translated that fear into preparation and action  
 so that way  if their
  worst fears came true their businesses were ready  and sometimes of course our worst fears do come true 
 that 's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear once in a while our fears can predict the future  
 but we can 't possibly prepare for all of the fears that our imaginations concoct
  how can we tell the difference between the fears worth listening to
 and all the others  i think the end of the story of the whaleship essex offers an illuminating if tragic example  
 after much deliberation the men finally made a decision  terrified of cannibals  they decided to forgo the closest islands
 and instead embarked on the longer and much more difficult route to south america  after more than two months at sea  the men
  ran out of food as they knew they might and they were still quite far from land  
 when the last of the survivors were finally picked up by two passing ships less than half of the men were left alive  
 and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism  
 herman melville who used this story as research for moby dick wrote years later and from dry land
  of these miserable men of the essex might in all human probability have been avoided
 had they immediately after leaving the wreck  steered straight for tahiti  but as melville put it they dreaded cannibals 
 so the question is  why did these men dread cannibals so much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation
  why were they swayed by one story so much more than the other looked at from this angle  theirs becomes a story about reading  
 the novelist vladimir nabokov said that the best reader has a combination of two very different temperaments the artistic and the scientific 
 a good reader has an artist 's passion a willingness to get caught up in the story  but just as importantly the
  also needs the coolness of judgment of a scientist  which acts to temper and complicate the reader 's intuitive reactions to the story 
 as we 've seen the men of the essex had no trouble with the artistic part  they dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios  
 the problem was that they listened to the wrong story 
 of all the narratives their fears wrote they responded only to the most lurid the most vivid the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture 
 cannibals
 but perhaps if they 'd been able to read their fears more like a scientist with more coolness of judgment  
 they would have listened instead to the less violent but the more likely tale the story of starvation  
 and headed for tahiti  just as melville 's sad commentary suggests
  an amazing act of the imagination
