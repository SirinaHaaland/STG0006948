  i got one of those spam emails and it managed to get through my spam filter i 'm not quite sure how but it turned up in my inbox and it was from a guy called solomon
  james veitch  i have an interesting business proposal i want to share with you solomon 
 now my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button right i was looking at my phone i thought i could just delete this  
 or i could do what i think we 've all
 always wanted to do
  so i knew i was dealing with a professional
  i said how much is it worth he said we will start with smaller quantity
  this isn 't the first time i 've shipped bullion my friend no no
  i think if we 're going via the postal service it ought to be signed for that 's a lot of gold 
 he said it will not be easy to convince my company to do larger quantity shipment i said solomon i 'm completely with you on this one i 'm putting together a visual
 for you to take into the board meeting hold tight
  we have any statisticians in the house but there 's definitely something going on 
 i said solomon attached to
  find a helpful chart i 've had one of my assistants run the numbers we 're
 ready for shipping as much gold as possible 
 there 's always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings and this was it for solomon he said i will be so much happy if the deal goes well because i 'm going to get a very good commission as well and i said that 's amazing what are you going to spend your cut on 
 and he said on realestate what about you
  like thirty different varieties  also you can cut up carrots and you can dip them
  you have to understand this had been going for like weeks albeit hitherto the greatest weeks  of my life but i had to knock it on the head it was getting
  friends were saying james do you want to come for a drink i was like i can 't i 'm expecting an email about some gold 
 so i figured i had to knock it on the head i had to take it to a ridiculous conclusion  so i concocted a plan i said 
 solomon i 'm concerned about security when we email each other we need to use a code 
  i spent all night coming up with this code we need to use in all further correspondence lawyer 
 gummy bear  
 bank cream egg  
 legal fizzy cola bottle claim peanut m & ms documents jelly beans western union  a giant gummy lizard 
  because you have to be consistent then
  you have to use the code 
 what followed is the greatest email i 've ever received 
 i 'm not joking this is what turned up in my inbox  this was a good day 
 the business is on
 i am trying to raise the balance for the gummy
 so he can submit all the needed fizzy cola bottle jelly beans to the creme egg 
 for the peanut m & ms process to start 
 send one thousand five hundred pounds via a giant
  it got me thinking like what would happen if i just spent as much time as could replying to as many scam emails as i could and
 that 's what i 've been doing
 for three years
  all i 'm doing is wasting their time and i think any time they 're spending with me is time they 're not spending scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings  right  and
 if you 're going to do
  this and i highly recommend you do
 get yourself a pseudonymous email address don 't use your own email address that 's what i was doing at the start and it was a nightmare i 'd
 wake up in the morning and have a thousand emails about penis enlargements  
 only one of which was a legitimate response 
 to a medical question i had but i 'll tell you what though guys i 'll tell
  any day is a good day any day is a good day if you receive an email that begins like this 
 i am winnie mandela 
 the second wife of nelson mandela the former south african president i was like oh that winnie mandela 
 laughter i know so many 
 i need to transfer forty five million dollars out of the country because of my husband nelson mandela 's health condition let that sink in 
 she sent me this
  which is hysterical 
 and this and this looks fairly legitimate this is a letter of authorization but to be honest if there 's nothing written on it it 's just a shape i
 said winnie i 'm really sorry to hear of this given that nelson died three months ago i 'd describe his health condition as
  health condition you can have not being alive  
 she said kindly comply with my bankers instructions one love
