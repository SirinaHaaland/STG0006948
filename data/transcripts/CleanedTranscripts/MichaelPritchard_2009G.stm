  like to talk about a couple of things today
 the first thing is water  
 now i see you 've all been enjoying the water that 's been provided for you here at the conference over the past couple of days and i 'm sure you 'll feel that it 's from a safe source 
 but what if it wasn
  what if it was from a source like this 
 then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhea  
 i talked a lot in the past about statistics  and the provision of safe drinking water for all 
 but they just don 't seem to get through  and i think i 've worked out why
  's because using current thinking  the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving  
 so we just switch off  us  governments
 and aid agencies well today i 'd like to show you that through thinking differently
  the problem has been solved 
 by the way  since i 've been speaking another thirteen thousand people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea 
 and four children
 have just died 
 i invented lifesaver bottle because i got angry 
 i like most of you was sitting down the day after christmas in two thousand and four when i was watching the devastating news of the asian tsunami
 as it rolled in playing out on tv  the days and weeks that followed people fleeing to the hills  being forced to drink contaminated water
 or face death 
 that really stuck with me  then a few months later  hurricane katrina slammed into
  here 's a first world country let 's see what they can do day one nothing 
 day two nothing do you know it took five days to get water to the superdome 
 people were shooting each other on the streets
 for tv sets and water 
 that 's when i decided i had to do something now i spent a lot of time in my garage over the next weeks and months
 and also in my kitchen much to the dismay of my wife 
 laughter however after a few failed prototypes  i finally came up with this  the lifesaver bottle 
 okay now for the science bit  before lifesaver the best hand filters were only capable of filtering down to about two hundred nanometers
  the smallest bacteria is about two hundred nanometers  so a 200 nanometer bacteria is going to get through a 200 nanometer hole  
 the smallest virus on the other hand is about 
  nanometers  so that 's definitely going to get through those two hundred nanometer holes lifesaver pores
 are fifteen nanometers  so nothing is getting through okay
 i 'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration would you like to see that i spent all the time setting this up so i guess i should we 're in the fine city of oxford  so
 someone 's done that up fine city of oxford so what i 've done is i 've gone and got some water from the river cherwell  and the river thames that flow through here and this is the water  
 but i got to thinking you know if we were in the middle of a flood zone
 in bangladesh the water wouldn 't look like this
  this  so i 've gone and got some stuff to add into it and this is from my pond have a smell of that mister cameraman okay 
 right we 're just going to pour that in there audience ugh michael
 pritchard okay  we 've got some
  runoff from a sewage plant farm  so i 'm just going to put that in there put that in there there we go 
 and some other bits and pieces  chuck that in there  and
 i 've got a gift here from a friend of mine 's rabbit  so we 're just going to
 put that in there as well
  simply you just scoop the water up today i 'm going to
 use a jug just to show you all let 's get a bit of that poo in there  that 's not dirty enough let 's just stir that up a little bit
  okay  so i 'm going to take this
  the top give it
 a few pumps  okay  that 's all that 's necessary  now as soon as i
 pop the teat sterile drinking water is going to come out
 there we go mind the electrics that is safe sterile drinking water
  let 's see chris 's program throughout the rest of the show okay 
 okay  
 lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world 
 it 'll last for six thousand liters  and when it 's expired using failsafe technology the system will shut off  protecting the user
  the cartridge out pop a new one in it 's good for another six thousand liters  
 so let 's look at the applications  traditionally in a crisis what do we do we ship water  
 then after a few weeks we set up camps and people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water  
 what happens when twenty thousand people congregate in a camp
 diseases spread more resources are required  the problem just becomes
 but by thinking differently  and shipping these people can stay put 
 they can make their own sterile drinking water and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives
  it doesn 't require a natural disaster
 for this to work  using
 the old thinking of national infrastructure and pipe work is too expensive when you run the numbers on a calculator you run out of noughts  
 so here is the thinking different bit  instead of shipping water  and
  processes to do it let 's use mother nature  she 's got a fantastic system she picks the water up from there  desalinates it for free  
 transports it over there and dumps it onto the mountains rivers and streams and where do people live  near water 
 all we 've go to do is make it sterile 
 how do we do that well  we could use the lifesaver bottle or we could use one of these  the same technology in a jerry can this will
  process twenty five thousand liters of water 
 that 's good enough for a family of four for three years  
 and how much does it cost 
 about half a cent a day to run thank you 
 so by thinking differently and processing water at the point of use
  mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water  they can get it from a source nearby  
 so with just eight billion dollars  
 we can hit the millennium goal 's target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water
  to put that into context the u k government spends about twelve billion pounds a year on foreign aid 
 but why stop there 
 with twenty billion dollars  everyone can have access to safe drinking water  
 so the three and a half billion people that suffer every year as a result  
 and the two million kids that die every year 
 will live
