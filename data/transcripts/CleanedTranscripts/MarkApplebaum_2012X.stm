  thought if i skipped it might help my nerves but i 'm
 actually having a paradoxical reaction to that so that was a bad idea anyway i was really delighted to receive the invitation
 to present to you some of my music and some of my
 work as a composer  presumably because it appeals to my well known and abundant narcissism and i
 'm not kidding i just think we should just say that and
 move forward so but the thing is a dilemma quickly arose and that is that i 'm really bored with music and i 'm really bored
 with the role of the composer  and so i decided to put that idea boredom
 as the focus of my presentation to you today  
 and i 'm going to share my music with you  but i hope that i 'm going to do so in a way that tells a story tells a story about how i used boredom as a catalyst for creativity and invention 
 and how boredom actually forced me to change the fundamental question that i was asking in my discipline  
  in a sense pushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort of most traditional narrow definition of a composer what i 'd like to do today is to start with an excerpt of a piece of music at the piano
  was a piece by beethoven  and so i was not functioning as a composer just now i was functioning in the role of the interpreter  and there i am interpreter 
 so an interpreter of what of a piece of music right but we can ask the question but
 is it music and i say this rhetorically because of course by just about any standard we would have to concede that this is of course a piece of music
 but i put this here now because
 just to set it in your brains for the moment because we 're going to return to this question it 's going to be a kind of a refrain as we go through the presentation 
 so here we have this piece of music by beethoven  and my problem with it is it 's boring
  i mean you i 'm just like a
 hush huh it 's like 
  's very familiar to me i had to practice it as a kid and i 'm really sick of it so 
 i would so what i might like to try to do is to change it to transform it in some ways to personalize it so i might take the opening like this idea music
 and then i might substitute 
 music and then i might improvise on that melody that goes forward from
 that would be the kind of thing that i would do and it 's not necessarily better than the beethoven in fact i think
 it 's not better than it the thing is 
 it 's more interesting to me  it 's less boring for me i 'm really leaning into me  because i because i have to think about what decisions i 'm going to make on the fly as
  that beethoven text is running in time through my head and i 'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations i 'm going to make to it 
 so this is an engaging enterprise for me  and i 've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there 
 and now my face appears twice so i think we can agree that this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise 
  and it 's interesting to me for a while but then i get bored with it and by it i actually mean the piano  because it becomes it 's this familiar instrument  it 's timbral range is actually pretty compressed 
 at least when you play on the keyboard and if you 're not doing things like listening to it after you 've lit it on fire or something like that you know it gets a little bit boring and so pretty soon i go through other instruments they become 
  familiar and eventually i find myself designing and constructing my own instrument and i brought one
  play a little bit on it for you so you can hear what it sounds like
  mounted on my instruments 
 music i can actually do all sorts of things i can play with a a violin bow i don 't have to use the chopsticks
  and with a bank of live electronics i can change the sounds radically 
 music like that and like this 
 music and so forth  so this gives you a little bit of an idea of the
  sound world of this instrument which i think is quite interesting and
 it puts me in the role of the inventor and the nice thing about this instrument is called the mouseketeer and
 the cool thing about it is i 'm the world 's greatest mouseketeer player okay so
 in that regard  this is one of the things this is one of the privileges of being and here 's another role the inventor
 and by the way when i told you that i 'm the world 's greatest if you 're keeping score we 've had narcissism and solipsism and now a healthy dose of egocentricism i know some of you are just you know 
 this is also a really enjoyable role i should concede also that i 'm the world 's worst mouseketeer player and it was this distinction that i was most worried about when i was on that prior side
  of the tenure divide  i 'm glad i 'm past that we 're not going to go into that i 'm crying on the inside there are still scars
 anyway  but i guess my point is that all of these
 these enterprises are engaging to me in their multiplicity but as i 've presented them to you today they 're actually solitary
 enterprises and so pretty soon i want to commune with other people  and so
 i 'm delighted that in fact i get to compose works for them i get to write  sometimes for soloists and i get to work with one person sometimes full orchestras and i work with a lot of people and this is probably the capacity the role creatively
 for which i 'm probably best known professionally now some of my scores as a composer look like this 
 and others look like this and some look like this and i make all of these by hand and it 's
  it takes a long long time to make these scores 
 and right now i 'm working on a piece that 's one hundred and eighty pages in length and it 's just a big chunk of my life and i 'm just pulling out
 hair i have a lot of it and that 's a good thing i suppose so this gets really boring and really tiresome for me so after a while
 the process of notating is not only boring but i actually want the notation to be more interesting 
 and so that 's pushed me to do other projects like this one this is an excerpt from a score called the metaphysics of notation
  the full score is seventy two feet wide it 's a bunch of crazy pictographic notation let 's zoom in on one section of it right here you can see it 's rather detailed 
 i do all of this with drafting templates with straight edges with french curves  and by freehand  
 and the seventy two feet was actually split into twelve
  panels that were installed
 around the cantor arts center museum
 lobby balcony  
 and it appeared for one year in the museum and during that year 
 it was experienced as visual art most of the week except as you can see in these pictures on fridays from noon til one and only during that time various performers came and interpreted these strange and undefined pictographic glyphs
  this was a really exciting experience for me it was gratifying musically but i think the more important thing is it was exciting because i got to take on another role especially given that it appeared in a museum and that is as visual artist we
 're going to fill up the whole thing don 't worry i am multitudes  
 laughter so one of the things is that i mean some people would say like oh you 're being a dilettante and maybe that 's true  i can understand how i mean because i don 't have a pedigree in visual art and i don 't have any training
 but it 's just something that i wanted to do as an extension of my composition as an extension of a kind of creative impulse  
 i can understand the question though but is it music i mean there 's not any traditional notation  
 i can also understand that sort of implicit criticism in this piece s tog which i made when i was living in copenhagen i took the copenhagen subway map and i renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations  and the players who are synchronized with stopwatches
  follow the timetables which are listed in minutes past the hour  so this is a case of actually adapting something or maybe stealing something and then turning it into a musical notation 
 another adaptation would be this piece  i took
 the idea of the wristwatch and i turned it into a musical score i made my own faces and had a company fabricate them and the players
 players follow these scores they follow the second hands and as they pass over the various symbols the players respond musically here 's another example from another piece and then its realization  so in 
  these two capacities  i 've been scavenger in the sense of taking like the subway map right or thief maybe  and i 've also been designer in the case of making the wristwatches and once again this is 
  on is that of the performance artist some of my pieces have these kind of weird theatric elements and i often perform them i want to show you a clip from a piece called echolalia this is actually being performed
  by brian mcwhorter who is an extraordinary performer let 's watch a little bit of this and please notice the instrumentation
  hear you were laughing nervously because you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp the intonation was a little
 you can see
 the mayhem continues and there 's you know there were no clarinets and trumpets and flutes and violins here 's a piece that has an even more unusual more peculiar instrumentation this is
  this was based on the experience of actually watching two people having a virulent argument in sign language which produced no decibels to speak of but affectively psychologically was a very loud experience 
 so yeah i get it with like the weird appliances and then the total absence of
 conventional instruments and this glut of conductors people might you know wonder yeah is this music 
 but let 's move on to a piece where clearly i 'm behaving myself and that is my concerto for orchestra you 're going to notice a lot of conventional instruments in this clip
  in fact is not the title of this piece i was a bit mischievous in fact to make it more interesting i put a space right in here  
 and this is the actual title of the piece let 's continue with that same excerpt
  so with all these theatric elements this pushes me in another role and that would be  possibly  the dramaturge 
 i was playing nice i had to write the the orchestra bits right okay but then there was this other stuff right there was the florist and i can understand that once again we 're putting pressure on the ontology of music as we know it conventionally  
 but let 's look at one
  last piece today i 'm going to share with you  this is going to be a piece called aphasia and it 's for hand gestures synchronized to sound 
 and this invites yet another role and final one i 'll share with you which is that of the choreographer  
 and the score for the piece looks like this and it instructs me  the performer to
 make various hand gestures at very specific times synchronized with
  an audio tape and that audio tape is made up exclusively of vocal samples i recorded
 an awesome singer  and i took the sound of his voice in my computer and i
 warped it in countless ways to come up with the soundtrack that you 're about to hear and i 'll perform just an excerpt of aphasia for you here
  kind of weird stuff is it music  here 's how i want to conclude  i 've decided ultimately that this is the wrong question that this is not the important question the important question is
 and i follow this question not worrying about is it music not worrying about the definition of the thing that i 'm making i allow my creativity to push me in directions that are simply interesting to 
  me and i don 't worry about the likeness of the result to some notion  some paradigm of what music composition is supposed to be  
  to what extent might you change the fundamental question in your discipline 
 and okay  i 'm going to put one extra little footnote in here because like i realized i mentioned some psychological defects earlier 
 and we also along the way had a fair amount of
 obsessive behavior and there was some delusional behavior and things like that and here i think we could say that this is an argument for self loathing and a kind of schizophrenia at least in the popular use of the term
  and i really mean dissociative identity disorder  okay anyway  
 despite those perils i would urge you to think about the possibility that you might take on roles in your own work whether they are neighboring or far flung from your professional definition and with that i thank you
