  is there life beyond earth in our solar system  wow what a powerful question 
 you know as a scientist planetary scientist we really didn 't take that
  carl sagan always said it takes extraordinary evidence
 for extraordinary claims and the claims of having life beyond earth
 need to be definitive they need to be loud and they need to be everywhere for us to be able to believe it
  how do we make this journey what we decided to do is first look for those
 ingredients for life the ingredients of life
 are liquid water we have to have a solvent  can 't be ice has to be liquid  
 we also have to have energy  we also have to have organic material
 things that make us
  but also things that we need to consume so we have to have these elements
 in environments for long periods of time for us to be able to be confident that life 
 in that moment when it starts  can spark and then grow and evolve  
 well i have to tell you
 that early in my career when we
  at those three elements i didn 't believe that they were beyond earth in any length of time and for any real quantity  
 why we look at the inner planets  venus is way too hot it 's got no water 
 mars dry and arid it 's got no water and beyond mars the water in the solar system is all frozen  
 but recent observations have changed all that it 's now turning our attention to the right
  places for us to take a deeper look
 and really
 start to answer our life question  
 so when we look out into the solar system where are the possibilities  we 're concentrating our attention on four locations  
 the planet mars
 and then three moons of the outer planets
 and small enceladus  so what about mars  let 's go through the evidence 
 well mars we thought was initially moon like full of craters  arid
 and a dead world and so about fifteen years ago we started a series of missions to go to mars and see if
 water existed on mars in its past that changed its geology we ought to be able to notice that 
 and indeed we started to be surprised right away our higher resolution images show deltas and river valleys and gulleys that were there in the past 
 and in fact
  which has been roving on the surface now for about three years has really shown us
 that it 's sitting in an ancient river bed where water flowed rapidly  
 and not for a little while perhaps hundreds of millions of years  
 and if everything was there including organics perhaps life had started  curiosity has also drilled
 drilled in that red soil and brought up other material  
 and we were really excited when we saw that because it wasn 't red mars  it was gray material it 's gray mars we brought it into the rover  we tasted it 
 and guess what 
 we tasted organics carbon  hydrogen oxygen nitrogen phosphorus sulfur they were all there 
 so mars in its past with a lot of water perhaps plenty of time
  could have had life could have had that spark  could have grown  and is that life still there we don 't know that  
 but a few years ago we started to look at a number of craters during the summer  dark lines would appear down the sides of these craters  the more
  more craters we saw  the more of these features we now know more than a dozen of them 
 a few months ago the fairy tale came true  we announced to the world that we know what these streaks are 
 it 's liquid water 
 these craters are weeping during the summer 
 liquid water is flowing down these craters  so what are we going to do now now that we see the water
 it tells us that mars has all the ingredients necessary for life in its past it had perhaps two thirds of its northern hemisphere there was an ocean  
 it has weeping water right now liquid water on its surface it has organics  it has all the right conditions  
 so what are we going to do next we 're going to launch a series of missions
 to begin that search
  for life on mars and now it 's more appealing than ever before 
 as we move out into the solar system 
 here 's the tiny moon enceladus
  this is not in what we call the traditional habitable zone  this area around the sun this is much further out 
 this object should be ice
 over a silicate core  but what did we
 cassini was there since two thousand and six  and after a couple years looked back after it flew by enceladus and surprised us all enceladus 
 is blasting sheets of water out into the solar system and sloshing back down onto the moon 
  cassini just a few months ago also flew through the plume 
 and it measured silicate particles where does the silica come from it must come from the ocean floor  
 the tidal energy is generated by saturn  pulling and squeezing this moon is melting that ice  creating an ocean  but it 's also doing that to the core 
  the only thing that we can think of that does that here on earth as an analogy 
 are hydrothermal vents hydrothermal vents deep in our ocean were discovered in 
 oceanographers were completely surprised  and now there are thousands of these below the ocean 
 what do we find  the
  when they go and look at these hydrothermal vents they 're teeming with life regardless of whether the water
 is acidic or alkaline
 doesn 't matter  so hydrothermal vents are a fabulous abode for life here on earth 
 so what about enceladus  well we believe because it has water and has had it for a significant period of time 
 and we believe it has hydrothermal vents
 with perhaps the right organic
  material it is a place where life could exist  and not just microbial
 maybe more complex
 because it 's had time to evolve  another moon very similar is europa  galileo visited
 jupiter 's system
 of europa
 europa we also know 
 has an under the ice crust ocean  galileo mission told us that but we never saw any plumes  
 but we didn 't look for them  
 hubble just a couple years ago  observing
 europa  saw plumes of water spraying from the cracks in the southern hemisphere just
  exactly
 like
 enceladus 
 these moons 
 which are not in what we call a traditional habitable zone that are out in the solar system have liquid water 
 and if there are organics there there may be life 
 this is a fabulous set of discoveries because these moons have been in this environment like that
  for billions of years 
 life started here on earth  we believe after about the first five hundred million and look where we are 
 these moons are fabulous moons 
 another moon that we 're looking at is titan  
 titan is a huge moon of saturn  it perhaps is much larger than the planet mercury
  it has an extensive atmosphere it 's so extensive and it 's mostly
 nitrogen with a little methane and ethane that you have to peer through it with radar and on the surface cassini has found liquid  
 we see lakes  
 actually almost the size of our black sea in some places and this area
 is not liquid water
  methane 
 if there 's any place in the solar system where life is not like us 
 where the substitute of water is another solvent and it could be methane it could be titan  
 well is there life beyond earth in the solar system we don 't know yet  but we 're hot on the pursuit  
 the data that we 're receiving is really exciting
  and telling us forcing us to think about this in new and exciting ways  
 i believe we 're on the right track that in the next ten years  we will answer that question  and if we answer it 
 and it 's positive 
 then life is everywhere in the solar system  
 just think about that we may not be alone
