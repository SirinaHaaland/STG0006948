  i get asked a lot what the difference between my work is and typical pentagon long range strategic planners  and the answer i like to offer is what
 they typically do is they think about the future of wars in the context of war
  what i 've spent fifteen years doing in this business and it 's taken me almost fourteen to figure it out
 is i think about the future of wars in the context of everything else so i tend to specialize on the scene between war
 and peace the material i 'm going to show you is one idea from a book with a lot of ideas  it 's the one that takes me around the world right now interacting with foreign militaries quite a bit  
 the material was generated in two years of work i did for the secretary of defense thinking about a new national grand strategy for the united states
 going to present a problem and try to give you an answer  here 's my favorite bonehead concept from the 1990s in the pentagon the theory of 
 asymmetrical strategies why do we call it that because it 's got all those a 's lined up i guess
  this is gobbledygook for if the united states fights somebody we 're going to be huge  they 're going to be small  and if they try to fight us in the traditional straight up manner we 're going to kick their ass  
 which is why people don 't try to do that any more 
 i met the last air force general who had actually shot down an enemy plane in combat  he 's now a one star general that 's how distant we are
 from even meeting an air force willing to fly against ours  so that overmatched capability creates problems
  catastrophic successes the white house calls them 
 and we 're trying to figure that out  because it is an amazing capability the question is what 's the good you can do with it
 ok the theory of 
  area denial asymmetrical strategies gobbledygook that we sell to congress because if we just told them we can kick anybody 's asses they wouldn
  buy us all the stuff we want so we say 
 asymmetrical strategies and their eyes glaze over 
 and they say will you build it in my district 
 here 's my parody and it ain 't much of one
  's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space i don 't know the million man swim the
 united states has to access that battle space instantaneously they throw up 
  area denial asymmetrical strategies a banana peel on the tarmac trojan horses on our computer networks reveal all our achilles ' heels
  prometheus approach largely a geographic definition focuses almost exclusively on the start of conflict  we field the first half team
 in a league that insists on keeping score until the end of the game  that 's the problem we can run the score up against anybody and then get our asses kicked in the second half
 what they call fourth generation warfare here 's the way i like to describe it instead there is no battle
  military cannot access  they said we couldn 't do afghanistan we did it with ease  they said we couldn 't do iraq  
 we did it with one hundred and fifty combat casualties in six weeks we did it so fast we weren 't prepared for their collapse 
 there is nobody we can 't take down the question is what do you do with the power  
 so there 's no trouble accessing battle spaces what we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow and creating the peace space that allows us to move on
 the defense department over here beats the hell out of you the
 state department over here says come on boy i know you can make it and that poor country runs off that ledge does that cartoon thing
 and then drops 
 this is not about overwhelming
  because if you fire real ammo into a crowd of women and children rioting
 you 're going to lose friends very quickly  
 this is not about projecting power but about staying power which is about legitimacy with the locals 
 who do you access in this transition space you have to create internal partners  you have to access coalition partners  we asked the indians for seventeen thousand peace keepers i know their senior leadership they
 wanted to give it to us but
 they said to us you know what in that transition space you 're mostly hat not enough cattle  
 we don 't think you can pull it off we 're not going to give you our seventeen thousand peace keepers for fodder we asked
 the russians for forty thousand they said no i was in china in august i said you should have fifty thousand peace keepers in iraq  it 's your oil not ours 
 which is the truth it 's their oil  
 and the chinese
  you 're absolutely right in a perfect world we 'd have fifty thousand there  but it 's not a perfect world and your administration isn 't getting us any closer 
 but we have trouble accessing our outcomes  
 we lucked out frankly on the selection  we face different opponents across these three 
 and it 's time to start admitting you can 't ask the same 19 year old to do it all day in and day out  it 's just too damn hard 
 we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war
  we don 't do the everything else so well  frankly we do it better than anybody and we still suck at it we have a brilliant secretary of war we don 't have
 a secretary of everything else  because if we did that guy would be in front of the senate still testifying over abu ghraib the
 problem is he doesn 't exist there is no secretary of everything else 
 i think
 we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war i call that the leviathan
  force  what we need to build is a force for the everything else i call them the system administrators 
 what i think this really represents is lack of an a to z rule set for the world as a whole for processing politically bankrupt states we have one for processing economically bankrupt states it 's the imf sovereign bankruptcy plan 
 ok  we argue about it every time we use it  argentina just went through it broke a lot of rules they got out on the far end we said
  it 's transparent a certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non zero outcome  we don 't have one for processing politically bankrupt states that frankly everybody wants gone 
 like saddam like mugabe like kim jong il
 people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions like the two hundred and fifty thousand dead so far in sudan what would an a to z system look like
  what i call front half
 and back half 
 and let 's call this red line i don 't know mission accomplished 
 what we have extant right now at the beginning of this system is the u n security council as a grand jury  what can they
  they can indict your ass  
 they can debate it they can write it on a piece of paper  they can put it in an envelope and mail it to you and then say in no uncertain terms 
 please cut that out 
 that gets you about four million dead in central africa over the 1990s that gets you two hundred and fifty thousand dead in the sudan in the last fifteen months  
  answer their grandchildren some day what you did about the holocaust in africa and you better have an answer 
 we don 't have anything to translate
 that will into action what we do have is the u s enabled leviathan force that says you want me to take that guy down i 'll take that guy down i 'll
 do it on tuesday it will cost you twenty billion dollars
  but here 's the deal as soon as i can 't find anybody else to air out i leave the scene immediately that 's called the powell doctrine 
 way downstream we have the international criminal court  they love to put them on trial they 've got milosevi right now  
 what are we missing a functioning executive that will translate will into action
 because we don 't have it every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing we
  an imminent threat since the cuban missile crisis in one thousand nine hundred and sixty two but we use this language from a bygone era
 to scare ourselves into doing something because we 're a democracy and that 's what it takes and if that doesn 't work we scream he 's got a gun just as we rush in 
 and then we look over the body and we find an old cigarette lighter and we say
  jesus it was dark do
 you want to do it france france says no
  but i do like to criticize you after the fact 
 what we need downstream is a great power enabled what i call that sys admin force we should have had two hundred and fifty thousand troops streaming into iraq
 on the heels of that leviathan sweeping towards baghdad  what do you get then no looting no military disappearing  no arms
  no ammo disappearing  no muqtada al sadr i 'm wrecking his bones
 no insurgency 
 talk to anybody who was over there in the first six months we had six months to feel the lob to get the job done 
 and we dicked around for six months and then they turned on us  why because they just got fed up 
 they saw what we did to saddam they said you 're that powerful you can resurrect this country you 're america 
 what we need is an international reconstruction fund sebastian
  mallaby washington post great idea model on the imf  instead of passing the hat each time  ok  where are we going to find this guy g20 that 's easy  
 check out their agenda since nine eleven all security dominated 
 they 're going to decide up front how the money gets spent just like in the imf you vote according to how much money you put in the kitty 
 here 's my challenge to the defense department you 've got to build this force you 've got to seed this force you 've got to track coalition
  partners  create a record of success  you will get this model you tell me it 's too hard to do i 'll walk this dog
 right through that six part series on the balkans  
 we did it just like that i 'm talking about regularizing it  making it transparent would you like mugabe gone  would you like kim jong il who 's killed about two million people would you like him gone
  this is why it matters to the military they 've been experiencing an
 identity crisis since the end of the cold war i 'm not talking about the difference between reality and desire which i can do because i 'm not inside the beltway i 'm
 talking about the 1990s the berlin wall falls  
 we do desert storm the split starts to emerge between those in the military who see a future they can live with and those who see a future that starts to scare them like the u s submarine community which
  the soviet navy disappear overnight ah 
 so they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of 
 problem is you need a big sexy opponent to fight against and if you can 't find one you 've got to make one up  china all grown up going to be
  looker the
 rest of the military got dragged down into the muck across the 1990s and they developed this very derisive term to describe it  military operations other than war  
 i ask you who joins the military to do things other than war
  actually most of them jessica lynch never planned on shooting back  most of them don 't pick up a rifle 
 i maintain this is code
  inside the army for we don 't want to do this they spent the 1990s working the messy scene between 
  globalized parts of the world what i call the core and the gap the
 clinton administration wasn 't interested in running this for eight years after screwing up the relationship on day one inauguration day with gays in the military which was deft
  so we were home alone for eight years and what did we do home alone we bought one military and we operated another  it 's like the guy who goes to the doctor and says doctor  it hurts
 when i do this the
 doctor says stop doing that you idiot i used to give this brief inside the pentagon in the early 1990s i 'd say you 're buying
  you are so right can you come back next year and remind us again 
 some people say nine eleven heals the rift jerks the long term transformation gurus out of their thirty thousand foot view of history drags them down in to the muck and says you want a networked opponent i 've got one he 's everywhere go find him
  mootw
 how we pronounce that acronym
 from crap to grand strategy because that 's how you 're going to shrink that gap  
 some people put these two things together  and they call it empire which i think is a boneheaded concept empire is about the enforcement of not just minimal rule sets which you cannot do 
 but maximum rule sets which you must do it 's not our system of governance never how we 've sought to interact with the
  i prefer that phrase system administration we enforce the minimal rule sets for maintaining connectivity to the global economy certain bad things you cannot do how
 this impacts the way we think about the future of war  
 this is a concept which gets me vilified throughout the pentagon it makes me very popular as well  everybody 's got an opinion 
 going back to the beginning of our country
 historically defenses meant protection of the homeland security has meant everything else
 written into our constitution two different forces two different functions  
 raise an army when you need it and maintain a navy for day to day connectivity 
 a department of war  a department of everything else a big stick a baton stick 
  we merged these two things together
 in the defense department our long term rationale becomes we 're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the soviets 
 to attack america is to risk blowing up the world we connected national security to international security
 with about a seven minute time delay  that 's
  not our problem now  
 they can kill three million in chicago tomorrow and we don 't go to the mattresses with nukes  that 's the scary part the question is how do we reconnect
 american national security with global security
 to make the world a lot more comfortable 
 and to embed and contextualize our employment of force around the planet
 's happened since is that bifurcation i described  
 we talked about this going all the way back to the end of the cold war let 's have a department of war and a department of something else  some people say hell nine eleven did it for you 
 now we 've got a home game and an away game the
 department of homeland security is a strategic feel good measure it
 's going to be the department of agriculture for the
 thousands standing around 
 i supported the war in iraq  he was a bad guy with multiple priors it
 's not like we had to find him actually killing somebody live to arrest him  
 i knew we 'd kick ass in the war with
  i knew we 'd have a hard time with what followed but i know this organization doesn 't change until it experiences failure  
 what do i mean by these two different forces
  this is the hobbesian force  i love this force i don 't want to see it go that plus nukes rules out great power war  this
 is the military the rest of the world wants us to build it 's why i travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries  
 what does this mean  it means you 've got to stop pretending you can do these two very disparate skill sets with the same
 switching back  morning afternoon  evening morning afternoon  evening  
 handing out aid  shooting back handing out aid  shooting back  it 's too much the 19 year olds get tired from the switching ok 
 that force on the left you can train a 19 year old to do that that force on the right is more
  you need the experience  what does this mean in terms of operations  
 the rule is going to be this 
 that sys admin force is the force that never comes home does most of your work 
 you break out that leviathan force only every so often but here 's the promise you make to the american public to your own people to the world you break out that leviathan
  you promise you guarantee that you 're going to mount one hell of a immediately
  don 't plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace other differences
 leviathan traditional partners they all look like the brits and their former colonies 
 laughter including us i would remind you the rest wider array of partners international organizations
  organizations private voluntary organizations contractors you 're not going to get away from that 
 leviathan force it 's all about joint operations between the military services  we 're done with that what we need to do is inter agency operations 
 which frankly condi rice was in charge of 
 and i 'm amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed  i call the leviathan force your dad 's military 
  i call the sys admin force your mom 's military it 's everything the man 's military hates  
 gender balanced much more older  educated married with children the force on the left 
 up or out the force on the right in and out the force on the left respects posse comitatus restrictions on the use of force inside the
 u s the force on the right 's going to obliterate it 
 that 's where the national guard 's going to be the force on the left is never coming under the purview of the international criminal court sys admin force has to 
 different definitions of network centricity 
 one takes down networks one puts them up 
  you 've got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that do we need a bigger budget do we need a draft to pull this off absolutely not i
 've been told by the revolution of military affairs crowd for years  
 we can do it faster cheaper smaller just as lethal i say great i 'm going
 to take the sys admin budget out of your hide here 's the larger point you 're going to build the sys admin force inside the u s military
  but ultimately you 're going to civilianize it  probably two thirds inter agency ize it  
 internationalize it so yes it begins inside the pentagon  but over time it 's going to cross that river 
 i have been to the mountain top i can see the future i may not live long enough to get you there  
 but it 's going to happen we 're going to have a department of something else between war and peace  
 last slide who gets custody of the kids  this is
  the marines in the audience get kind of tense 
 and this is when they think about beating the crap out of me after the talk 
 read max boon  this is the history of the marines 
 marines are like my west highland terrier they get up every morning they want to dig a hole and they want to kill something
 i don 't want my marines handing out aid i want them to be marines
 that 's what keeps the sys admin force from being a pussy force it keeps it from being the u n 
 you shoot at these people the marines are going to come over and kill you 
 department of navy
  strategic subs go this way  surface combatants are over there and the news is they may actually be that small 
 i call it the smart dust navy i tell young officers you may command five hundred ships in your career  bad news is they may not have anybody on them 
 carriers go both ways because they 're a swing asset you
 'll see the pattern airborne just like carriers armor goes this way here 's the dirty secret of the air force you can win by bombing
  but you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace  shinseki was right with the argument 
 air force  strategic airlift goes both ways  bombers  fighters
 go over here special operations command down at tampa trigger pullers go this way
  civil affairs that bastard child comes over here
  return to the army the point about the trigger pullers and special operations command no off season these guys are always active
 they drop in do their business 
 disappear see me now don 't talk about it later 
 i was never
  i want the rules to be as loose as possible because when the thing gets prevented in chicago with the three million dead that perverts our political system beyond all recognition these are the guys who are going to kill them first  
 so it 's better off to have them make some mistakes along the way than to see that 
  component national guard reserves overwhelmingly sys admin how are you going to get them to work for this force  most firemen in this country do it for free  this is not about money  this is about being up front with these guys and gals  
 last point intelligence community the muscle and the defense agencies go this way  what
  be the cia  open analytical open source should come over here the information you need to do this is not secret  
 it 's not secret 
 read that great piece in the new yorker about how our echo boomers nineteen to twenty five over in iraq taught each other how to do sys admin work over the internet in chat rooms  
 they said al qaeda could be listening they said well jesus they already know this stuff 
 take a gift in the left hand these are the sunglasses that don 't scare
  people simple stuff  censors and transparency the overheads go in both directions
