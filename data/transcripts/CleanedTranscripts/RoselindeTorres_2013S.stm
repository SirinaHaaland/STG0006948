  what makes a great leader today 
 many of us carry this image of this all knowing superhero
 who stands and commands and protects his followers
 that 's kind of an image from another time  and what 's also outdated
 are the leadership development programs that are based on success models for a world that was not a world that is
 or that is coming  we conducted a study of four thousand
  and we asked them  let 's see the effectiveness of your leadership development programs
 fifty eight percent of the companies cited significant talent gaps for critical leadership roles 
 that means that despite corporate training programs 
 assessments coaching all of these things more than half the companies had failed to grow enough great leaders 
 you may be asking yourself
 is my company helping me to prepare to be a great 21st century leader  the odds are probably not 
 now  i 've spent twenty five years of my professional life
 observing what makes great leaders  i 've worked inside fortune five hundred companies
 i 've advised over two hundred ceos  and i 've cultivated more leadership pipelines than you can imagine  
 but a few years ago  i noticed a disturbing trend in leadership preparation  
 i noticed that despite all the efforts there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing about individuals 
 one story was
  superstar leader who moves to a new unit and fails  destroying unrecoverable value  and then there were stories
 like sidney the ceo who was so frustrated because her company is cited as a best company for leaders  
 but only one of the top fifty leaders is equipped to lead their crucial
  and then there were stories like the senior leadership team of a once thriving business
 that 's surprised by a market shift  finds itself having to force the company to reduce its size in half
 or go out of business now these recurring stories
 cause me to ask two questions  why are the leadership gaps widening when there 's so much more investment in leadership
  development and
 what are the great leaders doing distinctly different
 to thrive and grow 
 one of the things that i did  i was so consumed by these questions and also frustrated by those stories 
 that i left my job
 so that i could study
  this full time  and i took a year to travel to different parts of the world
 to learn about effective and ineffective leadership practices in companies  countries and nonprofit organizations 
 and so i did things like travel to south africa  where i had an opportunity to understand how nelson mandela was ahead of his time in anticipating and navigating his political social and economic context 
 i also met
 a number of nonprofit leaders who despite very limited financial resources were making a huge impact in the world 
 often bringing together seeming adversaries  
 and i spent countless hours
 in presidential libraries trying to understand how the environment had shaped the leaders the moves that they made  and then the impact of those moves beyond their
  tenure  
 and then when i returned to work full time 
 in this role  i joined with wonderful colleagues who were also interested in these questions  
 now from all this i distilled
 the characteristics of leaders
 who are thriving and what they do differently and then i also distilled the preparation practices
  that enable people to grow to their potential i want to share some of those with you now what
 makes a great leader in the 21st century in a 21st century world which is more global  digitally enabled and transparent with faster speeds of information flow and innovation 
 and where nothing big gets done without some kind of a complex matrix
  development practices will stunt your growth as a leader 
 in fact 
 traditional assessments like narrow three hundred and sixty surveys or outdated performance criteria will give you false positives  
 lulling you into thinking that you are more prepared than you really are 
 leadership in
  is defined and evidenced by three questions where are you looking to anticipate the next change
 to your business model or your life the answer to this question
 is on your calendar 
 who are you spending time with on what topics 
 where are you traveling what are you reading  and then how are you distilling this into understanding potential discontinuities
 and then making a decision to do something right now so that you 're prepared and ready  
 there 's a leadership team that does a practice
 where they bring together each member collecting  here are trends that impact me here are trends that impact another team member 
 and they share these  and then make decisions to course correct a strategy or to anticipate a new move
 great leaders are not 
 they see around corners  shaping their future not just reacting to it 
 the second question is what is the diversity measure of your personal and professional stakeholder network you know 
 we hear often about good ol ' boy
  they 're certainly alive and well in many institutions 
 but to some extent we all have a network of people that we 're comfortable with 
 so this question is about your capacity to develop relationships with people that are very different than you 
 and those differences can be biological  physical functional  political cultural socioeconomic  
 and yet despite all these differences 
 they connect with you
 and they trust you
  enough to cooperate with you in achieving a shared goal great leaders understand that having a more diverse network
 is a source
 of pattern identification at greater levels and also of solutions because you have people that are thinking differently than you are 
 third question are you courageous enough to abandon
 a practice that has made you successful in the past 
 there 's an expression go along to get along but if you follow this advice  
 chances are as a leader you 're going to keep doing what 's familiar and comfortable 
 great leaders dare to be different they don 't just talk about risk taking they actually do it
  and one of the leaders shared with me the fact that the most impactful development comes
 when you are able to build the emotional stamina to withstand people telling you that your new idea
 is nave or reckless or just plain stupid now interestingly the people who will join you
 are not your usual suspects in your network
  they 're often people that
 think differently and therefore are willing to join you
 in taking a courageous leap  and it 's a leap  not a step 
 more than traditional leadership programs  
 answering these three questions will determine your effectiveness as a 21st century leader 
 so what makes a great leader in the
 i 've met many and they stand out 
 they are women and men who are preparing themselves not for the comfortable predictability of yesterday
 but also for the realities of today
 and all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow  thank you
