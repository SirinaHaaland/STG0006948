  you 're standing on a street anywhere in america
 and a japanese man comes up to you and says excuse me  what is the name of this block and you say i 'm sorry well  this is oak street that 's elm street
  well  blocks don 't have names streets have names  blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets he leaves a little confused and disappointed so
 now imagine you 're standing on a street anywhere in japan you turn to a person next to you and say excuse me  what is the name of this street 
 they say oh well that 's block seventeen and this is block sixteen 
 and you say ok but what is the name of this street
  streets don 't have names  blocks have names just look at google maps here there 's block fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen 
 all of these blocks have names  and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks 
 and you say then ok then how do you know your home address he said well easy this is district eight  there 's block
  but walking around the neighborhood i noticed that the house numbers don 't go in order he says of course they do they go in the order in which they were built 
 the first house ever built on a block is house number one  the second house ever built is house number two  third is house number three it 's easy it 's obvious 
 so  i love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn 't even know we had and realize that the opposite of them may also be true 
 so for example there are doctors in china who believe
  it 's their job to keep you healthy so any month you are healthy you pay them and when you 're sick you don 't have to pay them because they failed at their job they get rich when you 're healthy not sick 
 in most music we think of the one as the downbeat the beginning of the musical phrase  one two three four  but in west african music the one is thought of as the end of the phrase like the period at the end of a sentence so you can hear it not just in the phrasing but the way they
  count off their music two three four one  and this map is also accurate
