  i think for for people like me in the world of the making of things  the canary in the mine wasn 't
  and so the question that we might not have birds
 became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared 
 and the question was were the birds singing  now i 'm not a scientist that 'll be really clear  
 but you know we 've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be what is a bird  well  in my world  this is a rubber duck
  it comes in california with a warning this product contains chemicals known by the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm 
 this is a bird 
 what kind of culture would produce a product of this kind and then label it and sell it to children 
 i think we have a
  someone heard the six hours of
 talk that i gave
 called the monticello dialogues on npr  and sent me this as a thank you note 
 we realize that design is a signal of intention but it also has to occur
 within a world
 of affairs
 in
  that was one sentence
  henry james would be proud this is i put it down at the bottom but
 that was extemporaneous obviously the fundamental issue is that for me design is the first signal of human intentions so what are our intentions
 and what would our intentions be if we wake up in the morning we have designs on the world well what would our intention be as a species
 now that we 're the dominant species and it 's not just stewardship
  and dominion debate because really dominion is
 is implicit
 in stewardship because how could you dominate something you had killed and stewardship 's implicit in dominion because you can 't be steward of something if you can 't dominate it so
 the question is what is the first question
 for designers now as guardians let 's say the state for example which reserves the right to kill the right to be duplicitous
 and so on
 the question we 're asking the guardian at this point is are we meant how are we meant  to secure local societies create world peace
 and save the environment but i don 't know that that 's the common debate  commerce on the other hand is relatively quick
  essentially creative highly effective and
  and fundamentally honest because we can 't exchange
 value for very long if we don 't trust each other  so we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work but the question we bring to it is how do we love all the children
 of all species for all time  
 and so we start our designs with that question because what we realize today is that modern culture appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy 
 if we come here and say well  i didn 't intend to cause global warming on the way here and we say that 's not part of my plan then we realize it 's part of our de
  facto plan because it 's the thing that 's happening because we have no other plan  and i was at the white house for president bush meeting with every federal department and agency and i pointed out
 that they appear to have no plan if the end game is global warming they 're doing great if the end game is mercury toxification of our children downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the clean air act 
 then i see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as brain death for all
  no child left behind 
 so 
 the question is how many federal officials are ready to move to ohio and pennsylvania with their families  
 so if if you don 't have an endgame of something delightful then you 're just moving chess pieces around if you don 't know you 're taking the king 
 so perhaps we could develop a strategy of change which requires humility and in my business as an architect
 's unfortunate the word humility and the word architect have not appeared in the same paragraph since the fountainhead so
 if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility  reflect on this
 it took us five thousand years to put wheels on our luggage 
 so as kevin kelly pointed out there is no endgame there is an infinite
 and we 're playing in that infinite game  and so we call it cradle to cradle 
 and our goal is very simple  this is what i presented to the white house 
 our goal is a delightfully diverse safe healthy and just world with clean air clean water soil and power economically equitably ecologically and elegantly enjoyed  period 
 what don 't you like about this which part of this don 't you like
 so we realized we want full diversity even though it can be difficult to remember what de gaulle said when asked what it was like to be president of france he said what do you think it 's like trying to run a country with four hundred kinds of cheese 
 but at the same time we realize that our products are not safe and healthy so we 've designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million this is a baby blanket by pendleton that will give your child nutrition instead of alzheimer 's later in life 
  ourselves what is justice and is justice blind or is justice blindness
 and at what point did that uniform turn from white to black water
 has been declared a human right by the united nations air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes is there anybody here who doesn 't breathe
  clean soil is a critical problem the nitrification the dead zones in the gulf of mexico a fundamental issue that 's not being addressed
 we 've seen the first form of solar energy that 's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind here in the great plains and so that hegemony is leaving  and if we remember sheikh yamani when he formed opec  
 they asked him when will we see the end of the age of
 oil i don 't know if you remember his answer but it was the stone age didn 't end because we ran out of stones
  we see that companies acting ethically in this world are outperforming those that don 't we see the flows of materials
 in a rather terrifying prospect this is a hospital monitor from los angeles sent to china this woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous
 release four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens ' environment  which is from copper on the other hand we see great signs of hope here 's dr 
  has given eyesight to two million people for free  
 we see in our material flows that car steels don 't become car steel again because of the contaminants of the coatings bismuth antimony copper and so on they become building steel on the other hand 
 we 're working with berkshire hathaway warren buffett and shaw carpet the largest carpet  company in the world we 've developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable
  down to the parts per million
  landscape was that of farmers who have been farming the same piece of ground for forty centuries 
 you can 't farm the same piece of ground for forty centuries without understanding nutrient flow 
 my childhood summers were in the puget sound of washington  among the first growth and big growth my grandfather had been a lumberjack in the olympics 
 so i have a lot of tree karma i am working off 
 i went to yale for graduate school
  studied in a building of this style by le corbusier  affectionately known in our business as brutalism if we look at the world of architecture we see with 
 tower for berlin 
 the question might be well where 's the sun and this might have worked in berlin but we built it in houston  
 and the windows are all closed and with most products appearing not to have been designed for indoor use this is actually a vertical gas chamber
  when i went to yale we had the first energy crisis and i was designing the first solar heated house in ireland as a student which i then built which would give you a sense of my ambition 
 and richard meier who was one of my teachers kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism and he would say bill you 've got to understand solar energy has nothing to do with architecture
  we did the first so called green office in america for environmental defense we started asking manufacturers what were in their materials 
 they said they 're proprietary they 're legal go away the only indoor quality work done in this country at that time was sponsored by r j reynolds tobacco company and it was to prove there was no danger from secondhand smoke in the workplace  
 so
  a sudden here i am graduating from high school in one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine and this happens and we realize that away went away remember we used to throw things away and we 'd point to away  
 and yet noaa has now shown us for example you see that little blue thing above hawaii that 's the pacific gyre it was recently dragged for plankton by scientists and they found six times as much plastic as plankton 
 when asked they said it 's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn 't flush
  something as elegant as a tree imagine this design assignment design something that makes oxygen sequesters carbon fixes nitrogen distills water accrues solar energy as fuel makes complex sugars and food
  creates microclimates
 changes colors with the seasons and 
  we 're looking at the same criteria as most people you know can i afford it does it work do i like it we 're adding the jeffersonian agenda and i come from
 charlottesville where i 've had the privilege of living in a house designed by thomas jefferson  we 're adding life  liberty
 and the pursuit of happiness 
 we look at the word competition i 'm sure most of you 've used it you know 
 most people don 't realize it comes from the latin competere  which means strive together it means the way olympic athletes train with each other they get fit together and then they compete the williams sisters compete one wins wimbledon  
 so we 've been looking at the idea of competition as a way of of cooperating in order to get fit together and the chinese government has now i work with the chinese government now
 has
 has taken this up we 're also looking at survival of the fittest not in just competition
  terms in our modern context of destroy the other or beat them to the ground but really to fit together and build niches and have growth that is good  now most environmentalists don 't say growth is good 
 because in our lexicon asphalt is two words assigning blame
  but if we look at asphalt as our growth then we realize that all we 're doing is destroying the planetary 's fundamental underlying operating system so when we see e
  mc squared come along from a poet 's perspective  we see energy as physics chemistry as mass and all of a sudden you get this biology and we have plenty of energy so we 'll solve that problem but the biology problem 's tricky because as we
 as we put through all these toxic materials that we disgorge we will never be able to recover that and as francis crick pointed out nine years after discovering dna with mr watson 
 that life itself
  has to have growth as a precondition it has to have free energy sunlight and it needs to be an open system of chemicals  
 so we 're asking for human artifice to become a living thing and we want growth we want free energy from sunlight and we want an open metabolism for chemicals 
 then the question becomes not growth or no growth but what do you want to grow 
 so instead of just growing destruction  we want to grow the things that we might enjoy
  and someday the fda will allow us to make french cheese
  so therefore we have these two metabolisms and i worked with a german chemist michael braungart and we 've identified the two fundamental metabolisms the biological one i 'm sure you understand but also the technical one where we take materials and put them into closed cycles 
 we call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition biological nutrition
  can supply about five hundred million humans  
 which means that if we all wore birkenstocks and cotton the world would run out of cork and dry up  so we need materials in closed cycles but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million for cancer birth defects mutagenic effects disruption of our immune systems biodegradation
 persistence heavy metal content knowledge of how we 're making them and their production and so on our first product was a textile where we analyzed
  thousand chemicals in the textile industry using those intellectual filters we eliminated [ seven thousand nine hundred and
 sixty two ] we were left with thirty eight chemicals 
 we have since databased the four thousand most commonly used chemicals in human manufacturing  and we 're releasing this database into the public in six weeks  
 so designers all over the world can analyze their products down to the
  developed a protocol so that companies can send these same messages all the way through their supply chains  because when we asked most companies we work with about a trillion dollars
  and where does it go customers so we need some help there so the biological
  the first fabrics the water coming out was clean enough to drink technical nutrients this is for shaw carpet infinitely reusable carpet here 's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet  
 biotechnical nutrients the model u for ford motor a cradle to cradle car
 concept car shoes for nike where the uppers are polyesters infinitely recyclable the bottoms are are
 biodegradable soles  wear your old shoes in your new shoes out there is no
 finish line the idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever some of the materials go back to soil
 it 's all solar powered here 's a building at oberlin college we designed that makes more energy than it needs to operate
 and purifies its own water  here 's a building for the gap where the ancient grasses of san bruno california are on the roof  
 and this is our project for ford motor company it 's the revitalization of the river rouge in dearborn this is obviously a color photograph
  these are our tools
 these are how we sold it to ford we saved ford thirty five million dollars doing it this way 
 day one  which is the equivalent of the ford taurus at a four percent margin of an order for nine hundred million dollars worth of cars 
 here it is it 's the world 's largest green roof  ten and a half acres this is the roof  
 saving money  and this is the first species to arrive
 here these are killdeer  they showed up in five days
 and we now
  auto workers
 learning bird songs on the internet
 we 're developing now protocols for cities that 's the home of technical nutrients the country the home of biological and putting them together and so i will finish by showing you a new city we 're designing for the chinese government we 're doing twelve cities for china
 right now based on cradle to cradle
  our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for four hundred million people in twelve years we did a mass energy balance if they use brick they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal they
 'll have cities with no energy and no food  
 we signed a memorandum memorandum of understanding here 's madam deng nan deng xiaoping 's daughter for china to adopt cradle to cradle because if they toxify themselves being the lowest cost producer send it to the lowest cost distribution 
  and then we send them all our money what we 'll discover is that we have what effectively when i was a student was called mutually assured destruction  
 now we do it by molecule these are our cities we 're building a new city next to this city  look at that landscape this is the site  
 we don 't normally do green fields but this one
 is about to be built so they brought us in to intercede this is their plan  
 it 's a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape  and they brought us in and said what would you do
 this is what they would end up with which is another color photograph
  so this is the existing site  so this is what it looks like now and here 's our proposal 
 so the way we approached this is we studied the hydrology very carefully we studied the biota  the ancient biota the current farming and and the protocols we studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city
 will have fresh air fresh water and
 direct sunlight in every single apartment at some point during the day  
 we then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure  we lay out the building areas 
 we start to integrate commercial and mixed use so the people all have centers and places to be the transportation is all
  so that there 's
 always a place that 's alive  the waste systems
 all connect if you flush a toilet
  your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants which are sold as assets not liabilities because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas  
 the waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat
  and then it makes natural gas which then goes back into the city
 to power the fuel for the cooking
 for the city so this is these are fertilizer gas plants  and then the compost is all taken back
 to the roofs of the city  where we 've got farming because what we 've done is lifted up
 the city  the landscape into the air to
 to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings
  the solar power of all the factory centers and all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city  and this is the concept for the top of the city we 've lifted the earth
 up onto the roofs the farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next we inhabit the city with work live space on all the ground floors  
 so this is the existing city  and this is the new city
