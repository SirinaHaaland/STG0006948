  i 'm here to tell you about the real search for alien life  
 not little green humanoids arriving in shiny ufos although that would be nice  but it 's the search for planets orbiting stars far away 
 every star in our sky is a sun  and if our sun has planets mercury venus
  earth mars  etc surely those other stars should have planets also and they do  
 and in the last two decades astronomers have found thousands of exoplanets  
 our night sky is literally teeming with exoplanets we know statistically speaking that every star has at least one planet  
 and in the search for planets  and in the future planets that might be like earth we 're able to help address some of the most amazing
  and mysterious questions
 that have faced humankind for centuries  why are we here 
 why does our universe exist  how did earth form and evolve  how and why did life originate and populate our planet 
 the second question that we often think about is are we alone 
 is there life out there  who is out there
  this question has been around for thousands of years since at least the time of the greek philosophers  but i 'm here to tell you just how close we 're getting
 to finding out the answer to this question  it 's the first time in human history that this really is within reach for us 
 now when i think about the possibilities for life out there  i think of the fact that our sun
 is but one of many stars this is a photograph of a real galaxy we think
  our milky way looks like this galaxy it 's a collection of bound stars  but our [ sun ] is one of hundreds of billions of stars
 and our galaxy is one of upwards of hundreds of billions of galaxies  
 knowing that small planets are very common you can just do the math  
 and there are just so many stars and so many planets out there that surely there must be life somewhere out there
  there  well the biologists get furious with me for saying that because we have absolutely no evidence for life beyond earth yet
  well  if we were able to look at our galaxy from the outside
 and zoom in to where our sun is we see a real map of the stars and the highlighted stars are those with known exoplanets  
 this is really just the tip of the iceberg
 this animation is zooming in onto our solar system and you 'll see here the planets as well as some spacecraft that are also orbiting our sun  
 now if we can imagine going to the west coast of north america and looking out at the night sky 
 here 's what we 'd see on a spring night  and you can see the constellations overlaid and
  so many stars with planets  there 's a special patch of the sky where we have thousands of planets  this is where the kepler space telescope focused
 for many years  let 's zoom in
 and look at one of the favorite exoplanets   this star is called 
 it 's a system of about five planets  and by the way most of these exoplanets  we don 't know too much about
  we know their size and their orbit and things like that but there 's a very special planet here called 
 this planet is in a zone that is not too far from the star so that the temperature may be
 just right for life  here the artist 's conception is just zooming in and showing you what that planet might be like 
 so many people have this romantic notion of astronomers going to the
  telescope on a lonely mountaintop and looking at the spectacular night sky through a big telescope  
 but actually we just work on our computers like everyone else
  and we get our data by email or downloading from a database  so instead of coming here to tell you about
 the somewhat tedious nature of the data and data analysis and the complex computer models we
  i have a different way to try to explain to you some of the things that we 're thinking about exoplanets  here 's a travel poster
 where the grass is always redder on the other side that 's because
 orbits a red star and we 're just speculating that perhaps the plants there if there is vegetation
 that does photosynthesis it has different pigments and looks red enjoy the gravity
  this planet is more massive than earth and has a higher surface gravity relax on 
 where your shadow always has company 
 laughter we know of a dozen planets that orbit two stars 
 and there 's likely many more out there if we could visit one of those planets you literally would see two sunsets
 and have two shadows  so actually science fiction got some
  things right tatooine from star wars 
 and i have a couple of other favorite exoplanets to tell you about 
 this one is kepler 10b it 's a hot  hot planet it orbits over fifty times closer to its star than our earth does to our sun  
 and actually it 's so hot  we can 't visit any of these planets but if we could we would melt long before we got there  we think the surface is hot enough to melt rock and has liquid
  lava lakes
 this planet we know the mass and the size and it has a fairly low density it 's somewhat warm  we actually don 't know really anything about this planet but one possibility is that it 's a water world
 like a scaled up version of one of jupiter 's icy moons
 that might be fifty percent water by mass and in this case
 would have a thick steam atmosphere
 overlaying an ocean 
 not of liquid water  
 but of an exotic form of water a superfluid not quite a gas not quite a liquid 
 and under that wouldn 't be rock but a form of high pressure ice like ice ix 
 so out of all these planets out there  and the variety is just simply astonishing  we mostly want to find the planets
 that are goldilocks planets we call them not too big not too small not too hot not too
 but just right for life  but to do that we 'd have to be able to look at the planet 's atmosphere
 because the atmosphere acts like a blanket trapping heat the greenhouse effect we have to be able to assess the greenhouse gases on other planets  
 well science fiction got some things wrong  the star trek enterprise had to travel vast distances at incredible speeds
 to orbit other planets so
  that first officer spock could analyze the atmosphere to see if the planet was habitable or if there were lifeforms there  
 well we don 't need to travel at warp speeds to see other planet atmospheres  
 although i don 't want to dissuade any budding engineers from figuring out how to do that we actually can and do study planet atmospheres from here
  from earth orbit this is a picture a photograph of the hubble space telescope
 taken by the shuttle atlantis as it was departing after the last human space flight to hubble they installed a new camera actually that we use for exoplanet atmospheres  
 and
 so far we 've been able to study dozens of exoplanet atmospheres about six of them in great detail  
 but those are not small planets like earth they 're big hot planets that are easy to
  have the right technology yet to study small exoplanets  but nevertheless i wanted to try to explain to you
 how we study exoplanet atmospheres  i want you to imagine for a moment a rainbow  
 and if we could look at this rainbow closely  we would see that some dark lines are missing  
 and here 's our sun the white light of our sun split up not by raindrops but by a spectrograph  and you can see all these dark vertical lines some are very narrow
  some are wide some are shaded at the edges  
 and this is actually how astronomers have studied objects in the heavens literally for over a century 
 so here  each different atom and molecule has a special set of lines a fingerprint if you will  
 and that 's how we study exoplanet atmospheres  
 and i 'll just never forget when i started working on exoplanet atmospheres twenty years ago how many people told me this will never happen we 'll never be able to study them why are you bothering
 that 's why i 'm pleased to tell you about all the atmospheres studied now and this is really a field
 of its own so when it comes to other planets  other earths in the future when when we can observe them what kind of gases would we be looking for 
 well you know our own earth has oxygen in the atmosphere to twenty percent by volume that 's a lot of oxygen  
 but without plants and photosynthetic life  there would be no oxygen virtually
  no oxygen in our atmosphere  so oxygen is here because of life and our goal then is to look for gases in other planet atmospheres 
 gases that don 't belong that we might be able to attribute to life  
 but which molecules should we search for i actually told you how diverse exoplanets are we expect that to continue in the future when we find other
  and that 's one of the main things i 'm working on now i have a theory about this it reminds me that nearly every day  i receive an email email or emails
 from someone with a crazy theory about physics of
 gravity or cosmology or some such so please don 't email me one of your crazy theories 
 well  i had my own crazy theory but who does the mit professor go to 
 well i emailed a
 nobel laureate in physiology or medicine and he said
  talk to me so i brought my two biochemistry friends and we went to talk to him about our crazy theory  and that theory was that life produces all small molecules
  so many molecules like everything i could think of but not being a chemist  think about it carbon dioxide carbon monoxide
  molecular hydrogen molecular nitrogen methane methyl chloride so many gases they also exist for other reasons but just life even produces ozone
  we go to talk to him about this and immediately he shot down the theory he found an example that that didn 't exist so 
 we went back to the drawing board and we think we have found something very interesting in another field 
 but back to exoplanets the point is that life produces so many different types of gases literally thousands of gases and so what we 're doing now is just trying to figure out
 on which types of exoplanets  which gases could be
  be attributed to life  
 and so when it comes time when we find gases in exoplanet atmospheres that we won 't know if they 're being produced by intelligent aliens
 or by trees or a swamp or even just by simple single celled microbial life  so working on the models and thinking about biochemistry
  it 's all well and good but a really big challenge ahead of us is how how are we going to find these these planets there are actually many ways to find planets several different ways 
 but the one that i 'm most focused on is how can we open a gateway
 so that in the future we can find hundreds of earths  we have a real shot at finding signs of life  
 and actually i just finished leading a two year project in this very special phase
  the stowed position  
 the central truss would expand 
 with the petals snapping into place 
 now this has to be made very precisely literally the petals to microns and they have to deploy to millimeters  and this whole structure would have to fly tens of thousands of kilometers
 away from the telescope it 's about tens
  meters in diameter and the goal is to block out the starlight to incredible precision
 so that we 'd be able to see the planets directly  
 and it has to be a very special shape because of the physics of defraction 
 now this is a real project that we worked on literally you would not believe how hard just so you believe it 's not just in movie format here 's a real photograph of
  deployment test bed in the lab  and in this case i just wanted you to know that that central truss has heritage left over from large radio deployables in space 
 so after all of that hard work where we try to think of all the crazy gases that might be out there  
 and we build the very complicated space telescopes that might be out there  what are we going to find 
 well in the best case we will find
  here is earth as a pale blue dot  and this is actually a real photograph of earth
 taken by the voyager one spacecraft four billion miles away  and that red light is just scattered light in the camera optics  
 but what 's so awesome to consider is that if there are intelligent aliens
 orbiting on a planet
 around a star near to us and they build complicated space telescopes of the kind that we 're trying to build all
  see is this pale blue dot a pinprick of light and so sometimes when i pause to think about
 my
 professional struggle and and huge ambition  it 's hard to think about that in contrast to the vastness of the universe  
 but nonetheless  i am devoting the rest of my life
 to finding another earth and i can guarantee
 that in the next generation of space telescopes in the second generation 
 we will have the capability to find and identity other earths  and the capability to split up the starlight
 so that we can look for gases and assess the greenhouse
 gases in the atmosphere  estimate the surface temperature and look for for signs of life  but there 's more in this case of searching for
  other planets like earth  we are making a new kind of map of the nearby stars
 and of the planets orbiting them including [ planets ] that actually might be inhabitable by humans  
 and so i envision that our descendants hundreds of years from now will embark on an interstellar journey to other worlds  
 and they will look back at all of us
 as the generation who first found
 and i give you for a question rosetta mission manager fred jansen fred jansen 
 you mentioned halfway through that the technology to actually look at
 the spectrum of an
  exoplanet like earth is not there yet when do you expect this will be there and what 's needed 
 actually what we expect is what we call our next generation hubble telescope  and this is called the james webb space telescope and that will launch in two thousand and eighteen  
 and that 's what we 're going to do we 're going to look at a special kind of planet called transient exoplanets  and that will be our first shot
 at studying small planets for for gases that might indicate the planet is habitable  jc i 'm going to ask you one
  sara as the generalist  so i
 am really struck by the notion in your career of the the opposition you faced that when you began thinking about exoplanets there was extreme skepticism in the scientific community that they existed
 and you proved them wrong what did it take to take that on ss well  the thing is that as scientists we 're supposed to be skeptical because our job to make sure that what the other person is saying actually makes sense or not 
 but
 i think you 've seen it from this session
 it 's like being an explorer you have this immense curiosity this stubbornness this sort of resolute will that you will go forward no matter what other people say jc 
 i love that thank you sara
