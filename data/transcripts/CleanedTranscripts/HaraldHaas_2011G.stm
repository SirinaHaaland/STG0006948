  do you know that we have one point four million cellular radio masts deployed worldwide  
 and these are base stations and we also have
 more than five billion of these devices here these are cellular mobile phones
  and with these mobile phones we transmit more than six hundred terabytes of data every month this is a six with fourteen zeroes a very large number 
 and
 wireless communications has become
 a utility like electricity and water  we use it everyday we use it in our everyday lives now in our private lives in our business lives
  to be asked sometimes very kindly to switch off the mobile phone at events like this for good reasons and
 it 's this importance why i decided
 to look into the issues that this technology has because it 's so fundamental to our lives  and one of the issues is capacity 
 the way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves in particular radio waves  
 and radio waves
  are limited  they are scarce they are expensive  and we only have a certain range of it and it 's this limitation
 that doesn 't cope with the demand of wireless data transmissions and the number of bytes and data which are transmitted every month  
 and we are simply running out of spectrum  
 there 's another
  that is efficiency these one point four million cellular radio masts or base stations consume a lot of energy 
 and mind you most of the energy is not used to transmit the radio waves  it is used to cool the base stations  
 then the efficiency of such a base station is only at about five percent  
 and that creates a big problem  
 then there 's another issue that you 're all aware of you have to switch off your mobile phone during flights in hospitals
  are security issues and
 security is another issue 
 these radio waves penetrate through walls  they can be intercepted  and somebody can make use of your network if he has bad intentions  
 so these are the main four issues but on the other hand we have
 fourteen billion of
  and light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum  
 so let 's look at this in the context of the entire electromagnetic spectrum  where we have gamma rays  you don 't want to get close to gamma rays it could be dangerous 
 x rays useful when you go to hospitals  
 then there 's ultraviolet light it 's good for a nice suntan but otherwise dangerous for the human body  infrared
 due to eye safety regulations can be only used with low power  and then we have the radio waves
  mentioned  and in the middle there we have this visible light spectrum  it 's light  and light has been around
 for many millions of years  
 and in fact it has created us has created life  has created all the stuff of life  so it 's inherently safe
 to use and wouldn 't it be great to use that for wireless communications not only that i compared
  spectrum i compared the radio waves spectrum the size of it with the size of the visible light spectrum  and guess what 
 we have ten thousand times more of that spectrum  
 which is there for us to use  
 so not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum  let 's compare that with a number i 've just mentioned 
 we have one point four million expensively deployed inefficient radio cellular base stations
 and multiply that by ten thousand then you end up at fourteen billion fourteen billion is the number of light bulbs installed already  
 so we have the infrastructure there look at the ceiling you see all these light bulbs go to the main floor  you see these light bulbs can we use them for communications 
  one thing we need to do is
 we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs  florescent lights with this new technology of led led light bulbs  
 an led is a semiconductor it 's an electronic device  and it has a very very nice acute
 property
  its intensity can be modulated at very high speeds  and it can be switched off at very high speeds  and this is a fundamental basic property that
  that we exploit with our technology
  so let 's show how we do that let 's go to the closest neighbor to the visible light spectrum go to remote controls 
 you all know remote controls have an infrared  led basically you switch on the led and if it 's off you switch it off and it creates a simple
 low speed data stream in ten thousand bits per second twenty thousand bits per second  not usable for a youtube video
  what we have done is we have
 developed a technology with which we can
 furthermore replace
 the remote control of our light bulb  we transmit with our technology not only a single data stream  we transmit thousands of data streams in parallel at even higher speeds  
 and the technology we have developed it 's called sim ofdm and it 's spacial modulation
  modulation these are the only technical terms i 'm not going into details but this is how we enabled
 that light source to transmit data  
 you will say okay this is nice a slide created in ten minutes but not only that what we 've done is
 we have
 also developed a demonstrator and i 'm showing for the first time in public this
  light demonstrator  and what we have here is no ordinary desk lamp  
 we fit in an led light bulb  worth three u s dollars 
 put in our signal processing technology  and then what we have here is a little hole  
 and the light goes through that hole there 's a receiver the receiver will convert these little subtle changes in the amplitude that we create there
  into an electrical signal  and that signal is then converted back to a high speed data stream 
 in the future we hope that we can integrate this little hole into
 these smart phones  and not only
 integrate a photo detector here but maybe use the camera inside  
 so what happens when i switch on that light
 as you would expect it 's a light a desk lamp
 put your book beneath it and you can read it 's illuminating the space  but at the same time you see this
 video coming up here  and that 's a video a high definition video
 that is transmitted through that light
  this is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here but let me do this 
 once again still don 't believe 
 it is this light that transmits
  if you look at the light it is illuminating as you would expect  you don 't notice with your human eye  you don 't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude that we
 impress onto this light bulb  it 's serving the purpose of illumination  but at the same time 
 we are able to transmit this data and you see even light from the ceiling comes down
  do i have to have the light on all the time to have this working and the answer is yes but you can dim down the light
  level that it appears to be off  and you are still able to transmit data
 that 's possible so
 i 've mentioned to you the four challenges capacity  
 we have ten thousand times more spectrum ten thousand times more leds installed already in the infrastructure there  
 you would agree with me hopefully  there 's no issue of capacity anymore 
 efficiency this is data through illumination it 's first of all
  and if you do the the energy budget the data transmission comes for free
 highly energy efficient  i don 't mention the high energy efficiency of these led light bulbs  if the whole world would deploy them you would save
 hundreds of power plants 
 that 's aside  and then i 've mentioned the availability  you will agree with me that we have lights in the hospital  
 you need to see what to do you have lights in an aircraft  
 so it 's everywhere in a
 light look around everywhere look at your smart phone it has a flashlight  an led flashlight these are potential sources for high speed data transmission  
 and then there 's security 
 you would agree with me that
 light doesn 't penetrate through walls  
 so no one if i have a light here if i have secure data no one on the other side of this room through that wall would be able to read that data
 and there 's only data where there is light so if i don 't want that receiver to receive the data then
 what i could do  
 turn it away so the data goes in that direction not there anymore now we can in fact see where the data is going to
  for me the applications of it to me are beyond
 imagination at the moment we have had a century of very nice smart application developers  and
 you only have to notice where we have light there is a potential way to transmit data  but i can give you a few examples
  well you may see the impact
 already now 
 this is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean  
 and they use light to illuminate space down there  and this light can be used to transmit wireless data that these things [ use ] to communicate with each other 
 intrinsically safe environments like this petrochemical plant
 you can 't use rf it may generate antenna sparks but you can use light you see plenty of light there
  cars can communicate with each other and prevent accidents in the way that they exchange information traffic lights can communicate to the car
 and so on  and then you have these millions of street lamps deployed around the world and every street lamp could
  be a free access point we call it in fact
 and then we have these aircraft cabins there are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin  and
 each of these lights could be a potential transmitter of wireless data so you could enjoy your most favorite
  need to do is to fit a small microchip to every
 potential illumination device  and this would then combine two basic functionalities illumination and wireless
  and it 's this symbiosis that i personally believe could solve the four essential problems that face us in wireless communication these days  
 and in the future  you would not only have
 fourteen billion light bulbs  you may have fourteen billion li fis deployed worldwide for a
 cleaner a greener  and even a brighter future
