  so little billy goes to school  and he sits down and the teacher says what does your father do 
 and little billy says my father plays the piano
  teacher rings up the parents and says very shocking story from little billy today just heard that he claimed that you play the piano in an opium den 
 and the father says i 'm very sorry  yes it 's true i lied  but how can i tell an 
  eight year old boy that his father is a politician
  as a politician myself standing in front of you or indeed meeting any stranger anywhere in the world when i eventually reveal the nature of my profession they look at me as though i 
  'm somewhere between a snake a monkey and an iguana  
  four hundred years of maturing democracy 
 colleagues in parliament who seem to me as individuals reasonably impressive an increasingly educated  energetic informed population  
 and yet a deep deep sense of disappointment 
 my colleagues in parliament
 include in my new intake
  army officers ranging from colonels down to regimental sergeant majors 
 all of them  however  including myself as we walk underneath those strange stone gargoyles just down the road  feel that we 've become less than the sum of our parts feel as
  and this isn 't just a problem in britain  it 's a problem across the developing world  and in middle income countries too in jamaica for example
 look at jamaican members of parliament you meet them  and they 're often people who are rhodes scholars who 've studied at harvard
  and yet you go down to downtown kingston and you are looking at one of the most depressing sites that you can see in any middle income country in the world 
 a dismal  depressing landscape of burnt and half abandoned buildings  
 economics doctorate at harvard  over eight hundred people were killed in the streets in drug related violence  
 ten years ago however  the promise of democracy seemed to be extraordinary 
 george w bush stood up in his state of the union address in two thousand and three
 and said that democracy was the force that would beat most of the ills of the
  world he said because democratic governments respect their own people and respect their neighbors  freedom will bring peace  
 distinguished academics at the same time argued that democracies had this incredible range of side benefits they would bring prosperity
  overcome sectarian violence  ensure that states would never again harbor terrorists  since then what 's happened  
 well what we 've seen is the creation in places like iraq and afghanistan 
 of democratic systems of government which haven 't had any of those side benefits in afghanistan for example  we haven 't just had one election or two elections we 've gone through three elections presidential and parliamentary 
 and what do we find
 do we find a flourishing civil society a vigorous rule of law and good security no  
 what we find in afghanistan is a judiciary that is weak and corrupt a very limited civil society which is largely ineffective 
 a media which is beginning to get onto its feet but a government that 's deeply
  perceived as being deeply corrupt  and security that is shocking security that 's terrible  
 in pakistan
  in lots of sub saharan africa 
 again you can see democracy and elections are compatible with corrupt governments with states that are unstable and dangerous  
 and when i have conversations with people i remember having a conversation for example in iraq with a community
  that asked me
 whether the riot we were seeing in front of us this was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building 
 was a sign of the new democracy 
 the same i felt was true in almost every single one of the middle and developing countries that i went to
  and to some extent the same is true of us well 
 what is the answer to this is the answer to just give up on the idea of democracy well
 obviously not it would be absurd if we were to engage again in the kind of operations we were engaged in in iraq and afghanistan if we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation in which
 we were imposing
  other than a democratic system anything else
 would run contrary to our values  it would run contrary to the wishes of the people on the ground  it would run contrary to our interests 
 i remember in iraq for example that we went through a period of feeling that we should delay democracy we went through a period of feeling that the lesson learned from bosnia was 
  that elections held too early enshrined sectarian violence enshrined extremist parties 
  made  let 's not have elections for two years let 's invest in voter education let 's invest in democratization  
 the result was that i found stuck outside my office a huge crowd of people this is actually a photograph taken in libya but i saw the same scene in iraq of people standing outside screaming
  and when i went out and said what is wrong with the interim provincial council  
 what is wrong with the people that we have chosen  
 there is a sunni sheikh  there 's a shiite sheikh there 's the seven leaders of the seven major tribes there 's a christian there 's a sabian  there are female representatives there 's every political party in this council what 's wrong with the people
  the problem isn 't the people that you chose  the problem is that you chose them 
 i have not met  in afghanistan in even the most remote community  anybody who does not want a say in who governs them 
 most remote community i have never met a villager who does not want a vote 
 so we need to acknowledge that despite the dubious
  statistics despite the fact that eighty four percent of people in britain feel politics is broken  
 despite the fact that when i was in iraq we did an opinion poll in two thousand and three and asked people what political systems they preferred and the answer came back that seven 
  percent wanted the united states five percent wanted france three percent wanted britain
  and nearly forty percent wanted dubai which is after all not a democratic state at all but a relatively prosperous minor monarchy 
 democracy is a thing of value
 for which we should be fighting  but in order to do so
 we need to get away from instrumental arguments  we need to get away from saying
 democracy matters because of the other things it brings
  we need to get away from feeling in the same way  human rights matters because of the other things it brings or
 women 's rights matters for the other things it brings  
 why should we get away from those arguments because they 're very dangerous if we set about saying for example  
 torture is wrong because it doesn 't extract good
  or we say you need women 's rights because it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force you leave yourself open to the position where the government of north korea 
  can turn around and say well actually we 're having a lot of success extracting good information with our torture at the moment 
  is not instrumental it 's not about the things that it brings  the point about democracy is not that it delivers
 legitimate effective prosperous
 rule of law  it 's not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors  the point about democracy is
  democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty it
 reflects an idea of dignity the dignity of the individual 
 the idea that each individual should have an equal vote an equal say in the formation of their government 
 but if we 're really to make democracy vigorous
  ready to revivify it we need to get involved in a new project
 of the citizens and the politicians 
 democracy is not simply a question of structures  it is a state of mind it is an activity 
 and part of that activity is honesty  
 after i speak to you today  i 'm going on a radio program called any
  and the thing you will have noticed about politicians on these kinds of radio programs
 is that they never ever say that they don 't know the answer to a question it doesn 't matter what it is if
 you ask about child tax credits  the future of the penguins in the south antarctic 
 asked to hold forth on whether or not the developments in chongqing contribute to sustainable development in carbon capture  and we will have an answer
  we need to stop that to stop pretending to be omniscient beings 
 politicians also need to learn occasionally to say that certain things that voters want  certain things that voters have been promised  
 may be things
 that we cannot deliver or perhaps that we feel we should not deliver 
 and the second thing we should do is understand the genius of our societies
 our societies have never been so educated have never been so energized have never been so healthy 
 have never known so much cared so much or wanted to do so much  and it is a genius of the local 
 one of the reasons why we 're moving away from banqueting halls such as the one in which we stand banqueting halls with extraordinary images
 on the ceiling of kings enthroned  
 the entire drama played out here on this space where the king of england had his head lopped off  why we 've moved from spaces like this thrones like that 
 towards the town hall is we 're moving more and more towards the energies of our people and we need to tap that that can mean different things in different countries in britain
 it could mean looking to the french  learning from the french  getting directly elected mayors in place in a french commune system  
 in afghanistan it could have meant instead of concentrating on the big presidential and parliamentary elections we should have done what was in the afghan constitution from the very beginning which is to get direct local elections going at a district level and
  elect people 's provincial governors 
 but for any of these things to work 
 the honesty in language the local democracy it 's not just a question of what politicians do  it 's a question of what the citizens do  for politicians to be honest  
  the public needs to allow them to be honest  and the media which mediates between the politicians and the public needs to allow those politicians to be
  honest  if local democracy is to flourish  it is about the active and informed engagement of every citizen
