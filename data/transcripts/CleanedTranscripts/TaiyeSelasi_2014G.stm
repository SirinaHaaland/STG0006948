  i went on my first book tour  
 in thirteen months i flew to fourteen countries and gave some hundred talks every talk in every country
  comes from england and the states whenever i heard this opening sentence no matter the country that concluded it
 england america ghana nigeria i thought but that 's not
  i was born in england and grew up in the united states  
 my mum born in england and raised in nigeria  currently lives in ghana  
 my father was born in gold coast a british colony raised in ghana 
 and has lived for over thirty years in the kingdom of saudi arabia for this reason my 
 also called me
  i went to louisiana a museum in denmark where i shared the stage with the writer colum mccann 
 we were discussing the role of locality in writing when suddenly it hit me  i 'm not
  i 'm not a national
 at all how could i come from a nation  how can a human being come from a concept 
 it 's a question that had been bothering me for going on two decades 
 from newspapers textbooks conversations 
 i had learned to speak of countries as if they were eternal singular naturally occurring things 
 but i wondered
 to say that i came from
  that the country was an absolute some fixed point in place in time a constant thing but was it  
 in my lifetime countries had disappeared czechoslovakia  
 appeared timor leste failed somalia my parents came from countries that didn 't exist when they were born 
 to me a country this thing that could be
  born die expand  contract hardly seemed the basis for understanding a human being and so it came as a huge relief to discover
 the sovereign state  what we call countries are actually various expressions of sovereign statehood an idea that came into fashion only four hundred
  when i learned this beginning my masters degree in international relations 
 i felt a sort of surge of relief it was as i had suspected history was real  
 cultures were real but countries were invented 
 for the next ten years i sought to re or un define myself my world my work my experience  beyond the logic of the state  
 in two thousand and five i wrote an essay
  is an afropolitan sketching out an identity that privileged culture over country it
 was thrilling how many people could relate to my experience  and instructional how many others didn 't buy my sense of self 
 how can selasi claim to come from
  when she 's never known the indignities of traveling abroad on a ghanian passport now if i 'm honest  i knew just what she meant  
 i 've got a friend named layla who was born and raised in ghana  her parents are 
 of lebanese descent  layla who speaks fluent twi knows accra like the back of her
  when we first met years ago  i thought she 's not from ghana 
 in my mind she came from lebanon  despite the patent fact that all her formative experience took place in suburban accra 
 i like my critics was imagining some ghana where all ghanaians had brown skin or none held u k passports
  fallen into the limiting trap that the language of coming from countries sets the privileging of a fiction the singular country 
 over reality 
 human experience  
 speaking with colum mccann that day  the penny finally dropped
  i have no relationship with the united states  all fifty of them  not really  
 my relationship is with brookline the town where i grew up  with new york city where i started work with lawrenceville
  where i spend thanksgiving  
 what makes america home for me is not my passport or accent  
 but these very particular experiences and the places they occur  
 despite my pride in ewe culture the black stars and my love of ghanaian food  
 i 've never had a relationship with the republic of ghana  writ large  
 my relationship is with
  where my mother lives where i go each year with the little garden in  dzorwulu where my father and i talk for hours 
 these are the places that shape my experience  my experience is where i 'm from  
 what if we asked  instead of where are you from where are you a local 
 this would tell us so much more about who and how similar we are tell me you 're from france and i see what a set of
 adichie 's dangerous single story the myth of the nation of france  
 tell me you 're a local of fez and paris better yet goutte d 'or 
 and i see a set of experiences our experience is where we 're from  
 so where are you a local i propose a  three step test
  think of your daily rituals whatever they may be making your coffee driving to work harvesting your crops saying your prayers  
 what kind of rituals are these where do they occur  in what city or cities in the world do shopkeepers know your face 
 as a child i carried out fairly standard suburban rituals in boston with adjustments made
  for the rituals my mother brought from london and lagos 
 we took off our shoes in the house we were unfailingly polite with our elders we ate slow cooked spicy food 
 in snowy north america  ours were rituals of the global south  
 the first time i went to delhi or to southern parts of italy i was shocked by how at home i felt the rituals were familiar
 number one rituals 
 now  think of your relationships of the people who shape your days  
 to whom do you speak at least once a week be it face to face or on facetime be reasonable in your assessment i 'm not talking about your facebook friends 
 i 'm speaking of the people who shape your weekly emotional
  my mother in accra  my twin sister in boston  my best friends in new york these relationships are home for me r 
 number two relationships we
 're local where we carry out our rituals and relationships  but how we experience our locality depends in part
 on our restrictions by restrictions i mean where are you able to live what passport do you hold are you restricted by say racism from
  fully at home where you live 
 by civil war dysfunctional governance economic inflation from living in the locality where you had your rituals as a child  
 this is the least sexy of the rs less lyric than rituals and relationships  but the question takes us past where are you now
  take a piece of paper and put those three words on top of three columns 
 then try to fill those columns as honestly as you can 
 a very different picture of your life in local context of your identity as a set of experiences  may emerge so let 's try it  
 i have a friend named olu he 's thirty five years old his
  parents born in nigeria came to germany on scholarships olu was born in nuremberg and lived there until age ten when his family moved to lagos he studied in london  then came to berlin  
 he loves going to nigeria the weather the food the friends
 but hates the political corruption there  where is olu from  i have another friend named udo he 's also
  old  udo was born in crdoba in northwest argentina where his grandparents migrated from germany what is now poland  after the war 
 udo studied in buenos aires and nine years ago came to berlin  
 he loves going to argentina the weather the food the friends but hates the economic corruption there  
 where is udo from with his blonde hair and blue eyes udo could pass for german
  but holds an argentinian passport so needs a visa to live in berlin  that udo is from argentina
 has largely to do with history that he 's a local of buenos aires and berlin that has to do with life 
 olu who looks nigerian needs a visa to visit nigeria 
 he speaks yoruba with an english accent and english with a german one to claim that he 's not really nigerian
 though denies his experience in lagos the rituals he practiced growing up his relationship with family and friends 
 meanwhile  though lagos is undoubtedly one of his homes olu always feels restricted there 
 not least by the fact that he 's gay  
 both he and udo are restricted by the political conditions of their parents ' countries from living where some of their most meaningful
  rituals and relationships occur  
 to say olu is from nigeria and udo is from argentina distracts from their common experience their rituals their relationships and their restrictions are the same 
 of course when we ask where are you from we 're using a kind of shorthand it 's quicker to say nigeria than 
  as with google maps we can always zoom in closer from country to city to neighborhood  but that 's not quite the point 
 the difference between where are you from 
 and where are you a local isn 't the specificity of the answer it 's the intention of the question  
 replacing the language of nationality with the language of locality
 asks us to shift our focus to where real life occurs
 even that most glorious expression of countryhood the world cup 
 gives us national teams comprised mostly of multilocal players 
 as a unit of measurement for human experience  the country doesn 't quite work  
 that 's why olu says i 'm german but my parents come from nigeria
  in that sentence belies the inflexibility of the units one fixed and fictional entity bumping up against another 
 i 'm a local of lagos and berlin suggests overlapping experiences  layers that merge together that can 't be denied or removed 
 you can take away my passport but you can 't take away my experience  that i carry within me where i 'm from comes wherever i go 
 to be clear
  i 'm not suggesting that we do away with countries there 's much to be said for national history more for the sovereign state 
 culture exists in community and community exists in context geography tradition collective memory these things are important  
 what i 'm questioning is primacy all of those introductions on tour began with reference to nation as if knowing what country
  i came from would tell my audience who i was 
 what are we really seeking though when we ask where someone comes from and what are we really seeing when we hear an answer 
 here 's one possibility  basically countries represent power where are you from
  it 's possible that without realizing it we 're playing a power game especially in the context of multi ethnic countries as any recent immigrant knows the question 
 where are you from or where are you really from is often code for why are you
  then we have the scholar william 
  deresiewicz 's writing of elite american colleges 
 students think that their environment is diverse if one comes from missouri and another from pakistan never mind that all of their parents are doctors or bankers i
 'm with him to call one student american another pakistani then triumphantly claim student body diversity ignores the fact that these students are locals of the same milieu  
 the same holds true on the
  other end of the economic spectrum 
 a mexican gardener in los angeles and a nepali housekeeper in delhi have more in common in terms of rituals and restrictions than nationality 
  implies  perhaps my biggest problem with coming from countries is the myth of going back to them  
  to ghana  it 's not because i wasn 't born there  my father can 't go back either the country in which he was born that country no longer exists 
 we can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it something somewhere will always have changed most of all ourselves 
 people 
  talking about is human experience this notoriously and gloriously disorderly affair 
 in creative writing locality bespeaks humanity  the more we know about where a story is set the more local color and texture  the more human the characters start 
  to feel  the more relatable not less the myth of national identity and the vocabulary of coming from
  all of us are multi multi 
 to begin our conversations with an acknowledgement of this complexity brings us closer together i think not further apart so
 the next time that i 'm introduced  i 'd love to hear the truth
  a human being like everybody here she isn 't a citizen of the world but a citizen of worlds she is a local of new york rome and accra
