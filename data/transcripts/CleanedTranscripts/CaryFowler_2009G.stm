  i 've been fascinated with with crop diversity for about thirty five years from now  ever since i stumbled across a fairly obscure
 academic article by a guy named jack harlan  and he described the diversity within crops all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such as a
  genetic resource  
 and he said this genetic resource 
 and i 'll never forget the words stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine 
 i figured he was either really on to something or he was one of these academic nutcases  so i looked a little
  and what i figured out was that he wasn 't a nutcase he was the most respected scientist in the field 
 what he understood was that biological diversity crop diversity
 is the biological foundation of agriculture  
 it 's the raw material  the stuff of evolution in our agricultural crops not a trivial matter  and he also understood
 that that foundation was crumbling  literally crumbling
  that indeed a mass extinction was underway
 in our in our fields in our agricultural system 
 and that this mass extinction was taking place with very few people noticing and even fewer caring 
 now i know that many of you don 't stop to think about diversity in agricultural systems and let 's face it that 's logical  you don 't see it in the newspaper every
  day  and when you go into the supermarket you certainly don 't see a lot of choices there  you see apples that are red yellow and green and that that 's about it  
 so  let me show you a picture of one form of diversity 
 here 's some beans  and
 there are about thirty five or forty different varieties of beans on this picture now  imagine each one of these
  varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poodle from a great dane if i wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world  
 and i put thirty or forty of them on a slide it would take about ten slides because there about four hundred breeds of dogs in the world 
 but there are thirty five to forty thousand different varieties
  going to show you all the beans in the world  
 and i had a slide like this  and i switched it every second  
 it would take up my entire ted talk and i wouldn 't have to say anything  
 but the interesting thing is that this diversity and the tragic thing is
 that this diversity is being lost  we have about two hundred thousand different varieties of wheat and we have about
 two to four hundred thousand
  varieties of rice  but it 's being lost  and i want to give you an example of that it 's a bit of a personal example in fact in the united states in the 
 that 's where we have the best data farmers and gardeners were growing seven thousand one hundred named varieties of apples  
  hundred of those are extinct 
 no longer to be seen again  
 i used to have a list of these extinct apples and when i would go out and give a presentation i would pass the list out in the audience i wouldn 't tell them what it was but it was in alphabetical order  
 and i would tell them to look for their their names their family names their mother 's maiden name  
 and at the end of the speech i would ask how many people have found a name
  and i never had fewer than  two thirds of an audience hold up their hand  and i said you know what 
 these apples come from your ancestors and your ancestors gave them
 the greatest honor they could give them they gave them their name  
 the bad news is they 're extinct  the good news is a third of you didn 't hold up your hand
  your apple 's still out there  find it  make sure it doesn 't join the list 
 so i want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the fowler apple
 is still out there  and there 's an old book back here and i want to read a piece from it
  the apples of new york and this is the second volume see we used to have a lot of apples  and the fowler apple is described in here
 i hope this doesn 't surprise you
 as a beautiful fruit 
 i don 't know if we named the apple
  us but 
 but 
 to be honest the description goes on and it says that it doesn 't rank high in quality however 
 and then he has to go even further it sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine as grown in new york the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size
  and i guess there 's a lesson to be learned here  and the lesson is so why save it  i get this question all the time why don 't we just save the best one  
 and there are a couple of answers to that question one thing is that there is no such thing as a best one
  today 's best variety is tomorrow 's lunch for insects or pests or disease the other thing is
 that maybe that fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that 's not economical right now
 has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we 're going to need for climate change
 that the others don 't  so it 's not necessary  thank god that the fowler apple
  best apple in the world it 's just necessary or interesting that it might have one
 good unique trait and for that reason we ought to be saving it  why as a raw material as
 a trait we can use in the future think of diversity
 as giving us options 
  of course are exactly what we need in an era of climate change
 i want to show you two slides but first i want to tell you that we 've been working at the global crop diversity trust with a number of scientists particularly at stanford
 and university of washington to
 ask the question what 's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops to be able to adapt to this 
 in short the answer is that
  in the future in many countries  the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter
 than anything those crops have seen in the past  the coldest growing seasons of the future  hotter than the hottest of the past 
 is agriculture adapted to that i don 't know can fish play the piano 
  if agriculture hasn 't experienced that how could it be adapted 
 now  the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world and the place where climate change ironically is going to be the worst is in south asia and sub saharan africa so i 've picked two examples here  
 and i want to show you 
 in the histogram before you now  the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures going back
  far as we have temperature data and you can see that there 's some difference between one growing season and another some are colder some are hotter and it 's a bell shaped curve  the tallest bar is the average temperature for the most
 number of growing seasons in the future  later this century it 's going to look like the red  
 totally out of bounds  the agricultural system and more importantly the crops in the field
 in india have never experienced this before here 's
  south africa the same story  but the most interesting thing about south africa is we don 't have to wait for two thousand and seventy for there to be trouble by two
 thousand and thirty if the maize or corn varieties which is the dominant crop fifty percent of the nutrition in southern africa are still in the field
 in two thousand and thirty we 'll have a thirty percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in
  thirty percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population that 's a food crisis  it 's global in nature  we will watch children starve to death on tv 
 now  you may say that twenty years is a long way off  it 's two breeding cycles for maize  we have two rolls of the dice to get this right 
 we have to get climate ready crops in the field and we have to do that rather quickly
  now  the good news is that we have conserved we have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity agricultural diversity  mostly in the form of seed 
 and we put it in seed banks which is a fancy way
 of saying a freezer 
 if you want to conserve seed for a long term and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers  you dry it and then you freeze it
  unfortunately these seed banks
  are located around the world in buildings and they 're vulnerable disasters have happened in recent years we lost the gene bank the seed bank in iraq and afghanistan you can guess why  
 in rwanda in the solomon islands and then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures and all kinds of things
  and every time something like this happens  
 it means extinction we lose diversity and i 'm not talking about losing diversity in in the same way that you lose your car keys i 'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs 
 actually losing it never to be seen again so 
 a number of us got together and decided that you know enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility
 that can really offer protection
 for our biological diversity of
 maybe
  not the most charismatic diversity you don 't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do
 a panda bear  but it 's very important diversity  so we needed a really safe place and we went
 quite
 far north to find it to svalbard in fact this is above mainland norway you can see greenland there that 's
  degrees north  it 's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane  
 it 's a remarkably beautiful landscape i can 't even begin to describe it to you it 's otherworldly beautiful 
 we worked with the norwegian government and with the norgen the norwegian genetic resources program 
 to design this facility what you see is an artist 's conception of this facility
 is built in a mountain in svalbard  the idea of svalbard was that it 's cold  so we we get natural freezing temperatures  but
 it 's remote  it 's remote and accessible so it 's safe and we don 't depend on mechanical refrigeration
  this is more than just an artist 's dream
  it 's now a reality  and this next picture
 shows it in context in svalbard 
 and here 's the front door of this facility  when you open up the front door 
 this is what you 're looking at it 's pretty simple it 's a hole in the ground it 's a tunnel and you go into the tunnel  chiseled in solid rock about one hundred and thirty meters there
 are now a couple of security doors so you won 't see it quite like this again
  when you get to the back you get into an area that 's really my favorite place i think of it as sort of a cathedral  and i know that this
 tags me as a bit of a nerd but some of the happiest days of my life have been spent
  you were to walk into
 into one of these rooms
  you would see this it 's not
 very exciting but if you know what 's there it 's pretty emotional 
 we have now about four hundred and twenty five thousand samples of unique
 crop varieties there 's seventy thousand samples of different
  varieties of rice
 in this facility right now 
 about a year from now we 'll have over half a million samples we 're going up to over a million and someday we 'll basically have samples about five hundred seeds
 of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state
 in this facility  this is a backup system for world agriculture it 's a backup system for all the seed banks
 storage is free  it operates like a like a safety deposit box norway owns the mountain
 and the facility  but the depositors own the seed  
 and if anything happens  then they can come back and get it this particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the united states of
  an international institution from syria  i think it 's interesting in that
 this facility i think is
 almost the only thing i can think of these days where countries  literally every country in the world because we have seeds from every country in the world
 all the countries of the world have gotten together to do something that 's both long term  sustainable
 and positive  i can 't think of anything else that 's happened in my lifetime that way i can 't look you in the eyes
 and tell you that i have a solution for climate change for
 the water crisis agriculture takes seventy percent of fresh water supplies on earth  
 i can 't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution for those things or the energy crisis  or world hunger or peace in conflict i can 't look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a simple solution for that but i can look you in the eyes
 and tell you that we can 't solve any of those problems
 if we don 't have crop diversity because i challenge you to think of
 an effective  efficient  sustainable
 solution to climate change if we don 't have crop diversity because quite literally
  agriculture doesn 't adapt to climate change  neither will we and if crops don 't adapt
 to climate change  neither will agriculture  neither will we 
 so this is not something pretty and nice to do there are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist just for the existence value of it it is i agree a nice thing to do  
  a very real sense
 i believe that we as an international community should get organized to complete the task  
 the svalbard global seed vault is a wonderful gift that norway and others have given us  but it 's not the complete answer 
 we need to collect the remaining diversity that 's out there  we need to put it into good seed banks that can offer
 those seeds to researchers in the future  we need to catalog it it 's a library of life
  now i would say we don 't have a card catalog for it and we need to support it financially my big idea would be that
 while we think of it as commonplace to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university 
 we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat
  thirty million dollars in an endowment
 would take care of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever  so we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms 
 and my final thought is that
 we of course  by conserving wheat rice potatoes and the other crops we may 
 quite simply end up saving
