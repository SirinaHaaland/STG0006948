  a cheery thought on this map every country that s colored blue has more than twenty percent of its population over the age
  of sixty five this is the world we live in and this is the world your children will live in
 for twelve thousand years the distribution of ages in the human population has looked like a pyramid with the oldest on top it s already flattening out
 by two thousand and fifty it s going to be a column and will start to invert
 this is why it s happening
 the average lifespan s more than doubled
  since eighteen forty and it s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day
 and this is why that s not entirely a good thing
 because over the age of sixty five your risk of getting alzheimer s or parkinson s disease will increase exponentially
 by two thousand and fifty they ll be about thirty two million
 people in the united states over the age of eighty and unless we do something about it half of them will have alzheimer s disease and three million more will have parkinson s disease
 right now those and other neurologic diseases for which we have no cure or prevention cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year it will be well over a trillion dollars by two thousand and fifty
 alzheimer s disease starts when a protein that should be folded up properly misfolds into a kind of demented origami
 so one
  approach we re taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular scotch tape to hold the protein into its proper shape
 that would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do
 interestingly enough other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein which suggest that the approach might be a general one and
  might be used to cure many neurologic diseases not just alzheimer s disease there s also a fascinating connection to cancer here because people with neurologic diseases have a very 
  low incidence of most cancers and this is a connection that most people aren t pursuing right now but which we re fascinated by
  for additional private help here because the government has dropped the ball on much of this i m afraid
 in the meantime while we re waiting for all these things to happen here s what you can do for yourself if you want to lower your risk of parkinson s disease caffeine is protective to some extent nobody knows why
 head injuries are bad for you they lead to parkinson s disease and the avian flu is also not a good idea
 as far as protecting yourself against alzheimer s disease well it turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for alzheimer s disease 
 you should also keep your blood pressure down because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for alzheimer s disease it s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma which is just alzheimer s disease of the eye
  lose it applies so you want to stay mentally stimulated but hey you re listening to me
 so you ve got that covered and one final thing wish people like me luck okay because the clock is ticking for all of us thank
