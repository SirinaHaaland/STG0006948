  three and a half years ago  i made one of the best decisions of my life 
 as my new year 's resolution  i gave up dieting stopped worrying about my weight and learned to eat mindfully  
 now i eat whenever i 'm hungry
 and i 've lost ten pounds  this was me
 at age thirteen when i started my first diet  i look at that picture now  and i think 
 you did not need a diet you needed a fashion consult 
 but i thought i needed to lose weight and when i gained it back of course i blamed myself
 for the next
 three decades  i was on and off various diets no matter what i tried the weight i 'd lost always came back  
 i 'm sure many of you know the feeling 
 as a neuroscientist  i wondered  why is this so hard 
  how much you weigh depends on how much you eat and how much energy you burn what most people don 't realize is that hunger and energy use are controlled by the brain 
 mostly without your awareness 
 your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes  and that is a good thing because your conscious mind
 how do we put this politely 
  it 's good that you don 't have to remember to breathe when you get caught up in a movie 
 you don 't forget how to walk because you 're thinking about what to have for dinner 
 your brain also has its own sense of what you should weigh  no matter what you consciously believe 
 this is called your set point  but that 's a misleading term because it 's actually
  a range of about ten or fifteen pounds you can
 use lifestyle choices to move your weight up and down within that range  but it 's much much harder to stay outside of it  
 the hypothalamus  the part of the brain that regulates body weight there
 are more than a dozen chemical signals in the brain that tell your body to gain weight 
 more than another dozen that tell your body to lose it
  the system works like a thermostat  
 responding to signals from the body by adjusting hunger activity and metabolism to keep your weight stable as conditions change 
 that 's what a thermostat does right it keeps
 the temperature in your house the same
 as the weather changes outside 
 now you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter  but that 's not going to change
  the setting on the thermostat  which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up 
 your brain works exactly the same way  
 responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal 
 if you lose a lot of weight your brain reacts as if you were starving
  whether you started out fat or thin your brain 's response is exactly the same 
 we would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to lose weight or not but it can 't 
 if you do
 lose a lot of weight you become hungry and your muscles burn less energy dr rudy leibel of columbia university
 has found that people who have lost ten percent of their body
  weight
 burn two hundred and fifty to four hundred calories less because their metabolism is suppressed that 's a lot of food 
 this means that a successful dieter must eat this much less forever than someone of the same weight who has always been thin  
 from an evolutionary perspective your body 's resistance to weight loss makes sense when food was scarce  our ancestors ' survival
 depended on conserving energy  
 and regaining the weight when food was available would have protected them against the next shortage 
 over the course of human history  starvation has been a much bigger problem than overeating this may explain
 a very sad fact  set points can go up  but they rarely go down
  now if your mother ever mentioned that life is not fair this is the kind of thing she was talking about 
 successful dieting doesn 't lower your set point  
 even after you 've kept the weight off for as long as seven years your brain keeps trying to
 make you gain it back if that weight loss had been due to a long famine that would be
  sensible response in our modern world of drive thru burgers it 's not working out so well for many of us 
 that difference between our ancestral past and our abundant present
 is the reason that dr yoni freedhoff of the university of ottawa would like to take some of his patients back to a time when food was less available 
 and it 's also the reason that
  changing the food environment is really going to be the most effective solution
 to obesity  sadly a temporary weight gain
 can become permanent if
 you stay at a high weight for too long probably a matter of years for most of us  your brain may decide that that 's the new normal
  classify eaters into two groups those who rely on their hunger and those who try to control their eating through willpower like most dieters
 let 's call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters  
 the interesting thing is that intuitive eaters are less likely to be overweight and they spend less time
  thinking about food controlled eaters are more vulnerable
 to overeating in response to advertising super sizing and the all you can eat buffet 
 and a small indulgence like eating one scoop of ice cream 
 is more likely
 to lead to a food binge in controlled eaters
 children are especially vulnerable to this cycle of dieting and then binging  
 several long term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early teenage years
 are three times more likely to become overweight five years later  even if they started at a normal weight 
 and all of these studies found
 that the same factors
  that predicted weight gain
 also predicted the development of eating disorders  the other factor by the way  those of you who are parents was being teased by family members
 about their weight so don 't do that 
 laughter i left almost all my graphs at home  but i couldn 't resist throwing in just this one because i 'm a geek and that 's how i roll
 this is a study that looked at the risk of death over a 14 year period
 based on four healthy habits eating enough fruits and vegetables  exercise three times a week not smoking  and drinking in moderation  
 let 's start by looking at the normal weight people in the study  
 the height of the bars is the risk of death  and those zero one
  the horizontal axis are the number of those healthy habits that a given person had and as you 'd expect  the healthier the lifestyle the less likely people were to die during the study  
 now let 's look at what happens in overweight people the ones that had no healthy habits had a higher risk of death  adding just one healthy habit pulls overweight people back into the normal range 
 for obese people with no healthy
  habits the risk is very high seven times higher than the healthiest groups in the study  but a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too 
 in fact  if you look only at the group with all four healthy habits you can see that weight makes very little difference you can take control of your health by taking control of your
  even if you can 't lose weight and keep it off 
 diets don 't have very much reliability  
 five years after a diet most people have regained the weight forty percent of them have gained even more if you
 think about this the typical outcome of dieting
 is that you 're more likely to gain weight in the long run than to lose it  
 if i 've convinced you that dieting might be a problem the next question is what do you do about
 and my answer in a word is mindfulness  i 'm not saying you need to learn to meditate or take up yoga  
 i 'm talking about mindful eating 
 learning to understand your body 's signals
 so that you eat when you 're hungry and stop when you 're full because a lot of weight gain boils down to eating when you 're not hungry
 how do you do it  
 give yourself permission to eat as much as you want and then work on figuring out what makes your body feel good sit down to regular meals
 without distractions think about how your body feels when you start to eat and when you stop and let your hunger decide when you should be done it took about a year for me to learn this  but it 's really been worth it
  much more relaxed around food than i have ever been in my life  i
 often don 't think about it i forget we have chocolate in the house  it 's like aliens have taken over my brain it 's just completely different 
 i should say that
 this approach to eating probably won 't make you lose weight unless you often eat when you 're not hungry
 don 't know of any approach that makes
 significant weight loss in a lot of people and that is why a lot of people are now focusing on preventing
 weight gain instead of
 promoting weight loss let 's face it  if diets worked we 'd all
  why do we keep doing the same thing and expecting different results  
 diets may seem harmless  but they actually do a lot of collateral damage 
 at worst they ruin lives weight obsession leads to eating disorders especially in young kids 
 in the u s we have
 eighty percent
  say they 've been on a diet  our daughters have learned to measure their worth by the wrong scale  
 even at its best dieting is a waste of time and energy it takes willpower which you could be using
 to help your kids with their homework
 or to finish that important work project  and because willpower is limited any strategy that relies on its consistent
  application
 is pretty much guaranteed to eventually fail you
 when your attention moves on to something else  
 let me leave you with one last thought 
 what if we told all those dieting girls that it 's okay to eat when they 're hungry  
 what if we taught them to work with their appetite instead of fearing it
  think most of them would be happier and healthier  and as adults many of them would probably be thinner 
 i wish someone had told me that back when i was thirteen
