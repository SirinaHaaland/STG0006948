  this man is wearing what we call a bee beard 
 a beard full of bees now this is what many of you might picture when you think about honeybees
  or maybe anything that has more legs than two  and let me start by telling you i gotcha  i understand that but 
 there are many things to know and i want you to open your minds here keep them open  and change your perspective about honeybees  notice that this man is not getting stung  
 he probably has a queen bee tied to his chin and the other bees are attracted to it  so this really demonstrates our relationship with
  honeybees  and that goes deep back for thousands of years we 're very co evolved because we depend on bees for pollination and even more recently as an economic commodity 
 many of you may have heard that honeybees are disappearing not just dying  but they 're gone we don 't even find dead bodies 
 this is called colony collapse disorder and it 's bizarre researchers around the globe still do not know
  know what 's causing it 
 but what we do know is that with the declining numbers of bees the costs of over one hundred and thirty fruit and vegetable crops that we rely on for food is going up in price  
 so honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture 
 here you can see some pictures of what are called green roofs or urban agriculture  we 're familiar with the image on the
  left that shows
 a local neighborhood garden in the south end that 's where i call home i have a beehive in the backyard and perhaps a green roof in the future when we 're further utilizing urban areas where there are stacks of
 garden spaces  check out this image above the orange line in boston try to spot the beehive 
 it 's there it 's on the rooftop right on the corner there and it 's been there for a couple
  of years now  the way that urban beekeeping currently operates is that the beehives are quite hidden  
 and it 's not because they need to be it 's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea  
 and that 's why i want you today to try to think about this think about the benefits of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing
  let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works so we know flowers we know fruits and vegetables even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat rely on 
  pollinators but you 've got male and female parts to a plant here and basically pollinators are attracted to plants for their nectar  
  eventually an apple in this case will be produced you can see the orientation the stem is down the blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it but that 's a basic overview of how pollination works  
 and let 's think about urban living not today and not in the past but what about in a hundred years 
 what 's it gonna look like  we have huge
  challenges these days of habitat loss we have more and more people billions of people in one hundred years god knows how many people and how little space there will be to fit all of them  so we need to change the way that we see cities 
 and looking at this picture on the left of new york city today you can see how gray and brown it is we have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back into the
  contributing to global climate change no doubt what about in one hundred years if we have green rooftops everywhere and gardening and we create our own crops right in the cities  we save on the costs of transportation we save
 on a healthier diet  and we also educate and create new jobs locally we need bees for the future of our cities and urban living 
 here 's some data that we collected through our company with best bees where we deliver install and manage
  honeybee hives for anybody who wants them in the city  in the countryside  and we introduce honeybees  and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop or fire escape for even that matter  and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is 
 there 's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed in these numbers  so let 's look at the first metric here overwintering survival now this has been a huge problem for many years basically since the late
 1980s when the varroa mite came and brought many different viruses bacteria and fungal diseases with it  
 overwintering success is hard and that 's when most of the colonies are lost and we found that in the cities bees are surviving better than they are in the country 
 a bit counterintuitive right we think oh bees countryside
  but that 's not what the bees are showing the bees like it in the city furthermore  they also produce more honey
 the urban honey is delicious the bees in boston on the rooftop of the seaport hotel where we have hundreds of thousands of bees flying overheard right now that i 'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by 
 are going to all of the local community gardens and making delicious  healthy honey
 that just tastes like the flowers in our city
  for urban hives in terms of honey production is higher as well as the overwintering survival compared to rural areas  again a bit counterintuitive  
 and looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee health we can go back to the year nine hundred and fifty and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in ireland 
 so the problems of bees today isn 't necessarily something new 
  has been happening since over a thousand years ago  but what we don 't really notice are these problems in cities  so one thing i want to encourage you to think about is the idea of what an urban island is 
 you think in the city maybe the temperature 's warmer why are bees doing better in the city this is a big question now to help us understand why they should be
  perhaps there 's more pollen in the city with the trains coming in to urban hubs they can carry pollen with them very light pollen and it 's just a big supermarket in the city a lot of linden trees live along the railroad tracks 
 perhaps there are fewer pesticides in the cities than there are in [ rural ] areas  
 perhaps there are other things that we 're just not thinking about yet but that 's one idea to think about urban islands  and
 colony collapse disorder is not the only thing affecting honeybees honeybees
 are dying  and it 's a huge huge grand challenge of our time 
 what you can see up here is a map of the world and we 're tracking the spread of this varroa mite now the varroa mite is what changed the game in beekeeping  
 and you can see at the top right the years are changing we 're coming up to modern times and you can see
  the varroa mite finally came to north america and to the united states  and that is when the game changed for
 for honeybees in the united states many of us will remember our childhood growing up maybe you got stung by a bee you saw bees on flowers think of the kids today 
 their childhood 's a bit different they don 't experience this the bees just aren 't around anymore  so we need bees and they 're disappearing and it 's a big problem 
 what can we do here so what i do is honeybee research i got my ph d studying honeybee health
  i started in two thousand and five
 studying honeybees in two thousand and six honeybees started disappearing so suddenly like this little nerd kid going to school working with bugs 
 became very relevant in the world  
 and it worked out that way so my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier i don 't research what 's killing the bees per se  i 'm not one of the many researchers around the world 
  who 's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees we 're looking at ways to make bees
  healthier through vaccines through yogurt like probiotics and other types of therapies in ways that can be fed orally to bees and this process is so easy even a 7 year old can do it 
 you just mix up some pollen sugar and water and whatever active ingredient you want to put in and you just give it right to the bees no chemicals involved just immune boosters  
 humans think about our own health in a prospective way  we exercise we eat healthy we take
  vitamins why don 't we think about honeybees in that same type of way bring them to areas where they 're thriving
 and try to make them healthier before they get sick  i spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines with needles 
 like years years at the bench oh my gosh it 's three a m and i 'm still pricking
  that 's what we do 
 i 'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives because they can be anything  i mean really open your mind with this 
 you can paint a hive to match your home  you can hide a hive inside your home 
  and they 're beautiful here i mean we matched the new color of the inside of their rooms to do some type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets 
 and these bees are terrific and they also will use
 herbs that are growing in the garden that 's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking and the honey they do live events they 'll use that honey at their bars honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there 
 we also have a classroom hives project
  where this is a nonprofit venture we 're spreading the word around the world for how honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom or into the museum setting behind glass and used as an educational tool 
 this hive that you see here has been in fenway high school for many years now the bees fly right into the outfield of fenway park 
 nobody notices it if you 're
  other images here in telling a part of the story that really made urban beekeeping terrific is in new york city beekeeping was illegal until two thousand and ten 
 that 's a big problem because what 's going to pollinate all of the gardens and the produce locally  hands  i mean  locally in
  a terrific company called green city growers and they are going and pollinating their squash crops by hand with q tips and if they miss that three day window there 's no fruit their clients aren 't happy and people go hungry so this is important  
 we have also some images of honey from brooklyn now this was a mystery in the new york times where the honey was very red and the new york state forensics department came in and they actually did some science to match 
  the red dye with that found in a maraschino cherry factory down the street
 so you can tailor your honey to taste however you want by planting bee friendly flowers  paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping they 've had hives 
  on the rooftop of their opera house for many years now and that 's what really got people started thinking wow we can do this  and we should do this 
  integrating beehives  and i 'll show you an ending note here
