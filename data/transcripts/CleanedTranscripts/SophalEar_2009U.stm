  i normally teach courses on
 how to rebuild states after war  but today i 've got a personal story to share with you this is a picture of my family my four
  and this picture is taken in vietnam  so how did a cambodian family end up in vietnam in one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven 
 well to explain that i 've got a short video clip to explain the khmer rouge regime during
 and american bombing campaigns  
 led by peasant born pol pot the khmer rouge evacuates people to the countryside
 in order to create a rural communist utopia  much like mao tse tung 's cultural revolution in china 
 the khmer rouge closes the doors to the outside world  but after four years
  the grim truth seeps out 
 in a country of only seven million people one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders their
 bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields sophal ear so notwithstanding the 1970s narration on april 
 we lived in phnom penh and my parents were told by the khmer rouge to evacuate the city because of impending
 american bombing for three days  and here is a picture of the khmer rouge they were young soldiers typically
 child soldiers and this is very normal now of modern day conflict because they 're easy to bring into wars 
 the reason that they gave about american bombing wasn 't all that far off i mean from one thousand nine hundred and sixty five to one thousand nine hundred and seventy three there were
 more munitions that fell on cambodia than in all of world war ii japan
  including the two nuclear bombs of august 
 the khmer rouge didn 't believe in money  so the equivalent of the federal reserve bank in cambodia was bombed but not just that they actually
 banned money i think it 's the only precedent in which money has ever been stopped from being used and we know money is the root of all evil but it didn 't actually stop evil from happening in cambodia in fact
  my family was moved from phnom penh to pursat province this is a picture of what pursat looks like it 's actually a very pretty area of cambodia 
 where rice growing takes place and in fact they were forced to work the fields so my father and mother ended up
 in a sort of concentration camp labor camp  and it was at
  that time that my mother got word from the commune chief that the vietnamese were actually
 asking for their citizens to go back to vietnam  
 and she spoke some vietnamese as a child having grown up with vietnamese friends  and she decided  
 despite the advice of her neighbors that she would take the chance and and claim to be vietnamese so that
 we could have a chance to survive because at this point they 're forcing everybody to work and they 're giving about
 in
  diet i guess they 're giving porridge with a few grains of rice and at about this time actually my father
 got very sick  and he didn 't speak vietnamese so
 he died actually in january one thousand nine hundred and seventy six and it
 made it possible in fact for us to take on this plan so the khmer rouge took us from a place called pursat to kaoh tiev which is across from the border from
  vietnam  and there they had a detention camp where
 alleged vietnamese would be tested  language tested  and my mother 's vietnamese was so bad that
 to make to make our story more credible she 'd given all the boys and girls new vietnamese names but she 'd given the boys girls ' names  and the
  it wasn 't until she met a vietnamese lady who told her this and then tutored her for two days
 intensively that she was able to go into her exam and you know this was a moment of truth
  if she fails we 're all headed to the gallows if she passes  we can leave to vietnam  and she actually of course i 'm here she passes  
 and we end up in hong ngu on the vietnamese side and then onwards to chau doc  and this is a picture of hong ngu vietnam today
 idyllic place on the mekong delta but for us it meant freedom and freedom from from persecution from the khmer rouge
  last year the khmer rouge tribunal which the u n is helping cambodia take on started and i decided that as a matter of record i should file a civil complaint with the tribunal
 about my father 's passing away and i got word last month that
  complaint was officially accepted by the khmer rouge tribunal  and it 's for me a matter of
 justice for history and accountability for the future because cambodia remains a pretty
 lawless place at times  five years ago my mother and i went back to chau doc and she was able to return to a place that
  just come out of cambodia i 'm happy actually today to present her she 's here today with us in the audience  thank you mother
