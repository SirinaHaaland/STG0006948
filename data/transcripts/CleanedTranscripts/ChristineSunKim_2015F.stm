  my favorite musical symbol it means to play softly if you 're playing a musical instrument and you notice a p in the
  you need to play softer two p 's even softer  four p 's extremely soft  
 this is my drawing of a p tree 
 which demonstrates no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p 's there may be you 'll never reach complete silence 
 that 's my current definition of silence a very obscure sound
 'd like to share a little bit about the history of american sign language asl plus a bit of my own background  
 french sign language was brought to america during the early 
 and as time went by mixed with local signs it evolved into the language we know today as
  of about two hundred years 
 i was born deaf  
 and i was taught to believe that sound wasn 't a part of my life  
 and i believed it to be true  
 yet i realize now that that wasn 't the case at all sound was very much a part of my life  really on my mind
  every day 
 as a deaf person living in a world of sound it
 's as if i was living in a foreign country blindly following its rules customs behaviors and norms
 without ever questioning them
  so how is it that i understand sound  well i watch how people behave and respond to sound 
 you people are like my loudspeakers and amplify sound i learn and mirror that behavior 
 at the same time  i 've learned that i create sound  and i 've seen how people respond to me
  i 've learned  for example don 't slam the door don 't make too much noise when you 're eating from the 
 don 't burp  
 and when you 're eating make sure you don 't scrape your utensils on the plate 
 all of these things i term sound etiquette 
 maybe i think about sound etiquette more than the average hearing person
  does i 'm hyper vigilant around sound  
 and i 'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation
 around sound about what 's to come next  hence this drawing  tbd to be decided  
  to be announced 
 and you notice the staff there are no notes contained in the lines that 's because the lines already contain sound through
 the subtle smudges and smears 
 in deaf culture movement is equivalent to sound 
  typical staff contains five lines  
 yet for me signing it with my thumb sticking up like that doesn 't feel natural that 's why you 'll notice in my drawings i stick to four lines on paper 
 in the year two thousand and eight i had the opportunity to travel to berlin germany for an artist residency there 
 prior to this time i had been working as a painter
 during this summer i visited different museums and gallery spaces 
 and as i went from one place to the next i noticed there was no visual art there 
 at that time  sound was trending  and this struck me 
 there was no visual art everything was auditory 
 now sound has come into my art territory
 is it going to further distance me from art  
 i realized that doesn 't have to be the case at all i actually know sound  i know it so well
 that it doesn 't have to be something just experienced through the ears it could be felt tactually 
 or experienced as a visual or even as an idea
  so i decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice  
 and everything that i had been taught regarding sound  i decided to do away with and unlearn  
 i started creating a new body of work and when i presented this to the art community i was blown away with the amount of support
  and attention i received  i realized 
 sound
 is like money  power control
 social currency 
 in the back of my mind i 've always felt that sound was your thing a hearing person 's thing
  and sound is so powerful
 that it could either disempower me and my artwork or it could empower me  
 i chose to be empowered 
 there 's a massive culture around spoken language  and just because
 i don 't use my literal voice to communicate in society 's eyes
 it 's as if i don 't have a voice at all  
 so i need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice 
 and that way i 'm able to maintain relevancy in society today so at school at work and institutions i work with many
  and their voice becomes my voice and identity 
 they help me to be heard  
 and their voices hold value and currency  
 ironically by borrowing out their voices  i 'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency
 kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate 
 if i didn 't continue this practice  i feel that i could just fade off into oblivion and not maintain any form of social currency  
 so with sound as my new art medium  i delved into the world of music
  and i was surprised to see the similarities between music and asl 
 for example a musical note
 cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper and the same holds true for a concept in
  meaning that subtle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds i
 'd like to share with you a piano metaphor to have you have a better understanding of how asl works so envision a piano
 asl is broken down into many different grammatical parameters
  assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano
 such as facial expression body movement speed hand shape
 and so on as you play the piano
 english is a linear language as if one key is being pressed at a time  
  asl is more like a chord all ten fingers need to come down simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in asl 
 if just one of those keys were to change the chord 
 it would create a completely different meaning the same applies to music in regards to pitch  tone and volume
  by playing around with these different grammatical parameters you can express different ideas for example take the sign to look at this is the sign to look at 
 i 'm looking at you 
 staring at you
  i then started thinking what if i was to look at asl through a musical lens if i was to create a sign and repeat it over and over
  it could become like a piece of visual music  
 for example this is the sign for day as the sun rises and sets  
 this is all day 
 if i was to repeat it and slow it down visually it looks like a piece of music 
 all
  represented in this drawing  
 and this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights
  i feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two 
 this represents how time is
  and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time  for example
 1h is one hand 2h is two hand 
 present tense happens closest and in front of the body 
 future is in front of the body and the past is to your back 
 so the first example is a long time ago
  and the last one  which is my favorite with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it once upon a time 
 common time is a musical term
 with a specific time signature of four beats per measure  yet when i see the word common time
  comes to mind for me is at the same time 
 so notice rh right hand  lh left hand we have the staff across the head and the chest
 now we 're going to do it in both the head and the chest  kind of like common time or at the same time  
 yes  got it that means to fall in love in international [ sign ] 
 international [ sign
  as a note is a visual tool
 to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world 
 the second one i 'd like to demonstrate is this please follow along with me again  
 and now this 
  so let 's do all three together 
 fall in love
  notice how all three signs are very similar they all happen at the head and the chest  
 but they convey quite different meanings  so it 's amazing to see how asl is alive and thriving just like music is  
 however  in this day and age we live in a very
  and just because asl has no sound to it it automatically holds no social currency  
 we need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency
 and allow asl to develop its own form of currency
 without sound  and this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive
 society 
 and maybe people will understand
 that you don 't need to be deaf to learn asl nor do you have to be hearing to learn music
 asl is such a rich treasure that i 'd like you to have the same experience  
 and i 'd like to invite you to open your ears to open your eyes  
 take part in our culture and experience our visual language  and you never know
  might just fall in love with us
