  want to alarm anybody in this room but it 's just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar 
 also the person to your left is a liar  also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar
  we 're all liars what i 'm going to do today is i 'm going to show you what the research says about why we 're all liars how you can become a liespotter
 and why you might want to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking and ultimately to trust building 
 now speaking of trust ever since i
  i can 't even get a coffee date at starbucks 
 my husband 's like honey deception  maybe you could have focused on cooking how about french cooking 
 so before i get started what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to clarify my goal for you 
 which is not to teach a game of gotcha  liespotters aren 't those nitpicky kids those kids in the back of the room
  that are shouting gotcha gotcha your eyebrow twitched 
 you flared your nostril i watch that tv show ' lie to me ' i know you 're lying no 
 liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge of how to spot deception  they use it to get to the truth  
 and they do what mature leaders do everyday they have difficult conversations with difficult people  sometimes during very difficult times  
 and they start up that path by accepting a core proposition
 and that proposition is the following  lying is a cooperative act 
 think about it a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie  
 so i know it may sound like tough love but
 look if at some point you got lied to it 's because you agreed to get lied to truth number one about lying lying 's a cooperative act now
  not all lies are harmful  sometimes we 're willing participants
 in deception for the sake of social dignity  maybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret secret  we say nice song 
 honey you don 't look fat in that no 
 or we say  favorite of the digiratti you know i just fished that email out of my spam folder  so sorry 
 but there are times when we are
 are unwilling participants in deception and that can have dramatic costs for us 
 last year saw nine hundred and ninety seven billion dollars in corporate fraud alone in the united states 
 that 's an eyelash under a trillion dollars that 's seven percent of revenues deception can cost billions think enron  madoff the mortgage
  or in the case of double agents and traitors like robert hanssen or aldrich ames lies can betray our country they can compromise our security  
 they can undermine democracy they can cause the deaths of those that defend us deception is actually serious business 
 this con man  henry oberlander he was such an effective con man  british authorities say he could have undermined the entire banking system of the western
  and you can 't find this guy on google you can 't find him anywhere he was interviewed once and he said the following he said look i 've got one rule and this was henry 's rule  he said look 
 everyone is willing to give you something they 're ready to give you something for whatever it is they 're hungry for 
 and that 's the crux of it if you don 't want to be deceived you have to know what is it that you 're hungry for 
 and we all kind of hate to admit it we
 wish we were better husbands better wives smarter more powerful taller
 richer the list goes on 
 lying is an attempt to bridge that gap 
 to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were how we wish we could be with what we 're really like  
 and boy are we willing to fill in those gaps in our lives with lies on a given day  studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from ten to two hundred times now granted many of those are white lies  
 but in another
  study it showed that strangers lied three times within the first ten minutes of meeting each other now
 when we first hear this data  we recoil we can 't believe how prevalent lying is we 're essentially against lying  
 but if you look more closely the plot actually thickens 
 we lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers  
 extroverts lie more than introverts
  men lie eight times more
 about themselves than they do other people women lie more to protect other people 
 if you 're an average married couple 
 you 're going to lie to your spouse in one out of every ten interactions now you may think that 's bad if you 're unmarried that number drops to three 
 lying 's complex  it 's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives we 're deeply
  ambivalent about the truth  we parse it out on an as needed basis sometimes for very very good reasons other times
 just because we don 't understand the gaps in our lives  
 that 's truth number two about lying  we 're against lying  
 but we 're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries it 's as old as breathing it
 's part of our culture it 's part of our history 
 think dante shakespeare
  the bible news of the world 
 lying has evolutionary value to us as a species researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species the larger the neocortex the more likely it is to be deceptive  
 now you might remember koko does anybody remember koko the gorilla who was taught
 sign language koko was taught to communicate via sign language here 's koko with her kitten it 's her cute little fluffy pet kitten  
 koko once blamed her pet kitten for ripping a sink out of the wall 
 laughter we 're hardwired to become leaders of the pack it 's starts really really early  how early  
 well babies will fake a cry  pause  wait to see who 's coming and then go right back
  by the time you enter college you 're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions by the time we enter this work world
 and we 're breadwinners we enter a world that is just cluttered with spam
  ponzi schemers a deception epidemic in short what one author calls a 
 society  it 's been very confusing for a long time now 
 what do you do  
 well there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass trained liespotters get to the truth ninety percent of the time the rest
  of us we 're only fifty four percent accurate  
 why is it so easy to learn 
 there are good liars and bad liars there are no real original liars we all make the same mistakes  we all use the same techniques 
 so what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to show you two patterns of deception and then we 're going to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves we 're going to start with speech
  not have sexual relations with that woman
 miss lewinsky i never told anybody to lie not a single time never  and these allegations are false
 and i need to go back to work for the american people
  denial  studies show that people who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather than informal language  we also heard distancing language that woman 
 we know that liars will unconsciously distance themselves from their subject  
 using language as their tool 
 now if bill clinton had said well to
  or richard nixon 's favorite in all candor he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language as it 's called qualifying language like that further discredits the subject  
 now if he had repeated the question in its entirety or
 if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail
 and we 're all really glad he didn 't do that he would have further discredited himself  freud had it right freud said look there 's much more to it than speech
  keep a secret  if his lips are silent  
 he chatters with his fingertips and we all do it no matter how powerful you are we all chatter with our fingertips  
 i 'm going to show you dominique strauss kahn with obama who 's chattering with his fingertips 
 now
 this brings us to our next pattern which is body language
  body language  here 's what you 've got to do you 've really got to just throw your assumptions out the door let the science temper your knowledge a little bit  because we think liars fidget all the time well guess what they 're known to freeze their upper bodies when they 're lying  we think
 liars won 't look you in the eyes well guess what they look you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth  we think warmth and smiles convey honesty sincerity
  a trained liespotter can spot a fake smile a mile away can you all spot the fake smile here you can consciously contract
 the muscles in your cheeks 
 but the real smile 's in the eyes  the crow 's feet of the eyes they cannot be consciously contracted especially if you overdid the botox don 't overdo
  nobody will think you 're honest 
 now we 're going to look at the hot spots can you tell what 's happening in a conversation can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone 's words and someone 's actions  
 now i know it seems really obvious but when you 're having a conversation with someone you suspect of deception  
 attitude is by far the most overlooked but telling of indicators an honest person
 is going to be cooperative they 're going to show they 're on your side  they 're going to be enthusiastic they 're going to be willing and
  helpful to getting you to the truth  
 they 're going to be willing to brainstorm name suspects  provide details they 're going to say hey maybe it was those guys in payroll that forged those checks they 're
 going to be infuriated if they sense they 're wrongly accused throughout the entire course of the interview not just in flashes they 'll be infuriated throughout the entire course of the interview  
 and if you ask someone honest what should happen to whomever did forge those checks an honest
  person is much more likely to recommend strict
 rather than lenient punishment  
 now let 's say you 're having that exact same conversation with someone deceptive that person may be withdrawn look down lower their voice pause be kind of herky jerky 
 ask a deceptive person to tell their story they 're going to pepper it with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places 
 and then they 're going to tell their story in
  strict chronological order and what a trained interrogator does is they come in
 and in very subtle ways
 over the course of several hours they will ask that person to tell that story backwards  and then they 'll watch them squirm and track which questions produce the highest volume of deceptive 
  tells why do they do that well  we all do the same thing  we rehearse our words but we rarely rehearse our gestures we say yes we shake our heads
  convincing stories we slightly shrug our shoulders we commit terrible crimes and we smile at the delight in getting away with it now that smile is known in the trade as duping delight and we 're going to see that in several videos moving forward but we 're going to start
 for those of you who don 't know him this is presidential candidate john edwards who shocked america by fathering a child out of wedlock we 're going to see him talk about getting a paternity test see
  now if you can spot him
 saying yes while shaking his head no slightly shrugging his shoulders john edwards i 'd be happy to participate in one i know that it 's not possible that this child could
 be mine because of the timing of events so i know it 's not possible happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen interviewer are you going to do that soon
  those head shakes are much easier to spot once you know to look for them  there are going to be times when someone makes one expression
 while masking another that just kind of leaks through in a flash  murderers are known to leak sadness your new joint venture partner might shake your hand celebrate go out to dinner with you and then leak an expression of anger  
 and we 're not all going to become facial expression
  experts overnight here  but there 's one i can teach you that 's very dangerous and it 's easy to learn  and that 's the expression of contempt  
 now with anger you 've got two people on an even playing field  it 's still somewhat of a healthy relationship but when anger turns to contempt  you 've been dismissed  
 it 's associated with moral superiority and for that reason it 's very
  hard to recover from here 's what it looks like  
 it 's marked by one lip corner pulled up and in it 's the only asymmetrical expression and in the presence of contempt  
 whether or not deception follows and it doesn 't always follow
 look the other way go the other direction reconsider the deal say no thank you i 'm not coming up for just one more nightcap thank you 
 science has surfaced many many more indicators  we know for example we know liars
  will shift their blink rate point their feet towards an exit  
 they will take barrier objects and put them between themselves and the person that is interviewing them they 'll alter their vocal tone often making their vocal tone much lower 
 now here 's the deal  
 these behaviors
 are just behaviors they 're not proof of deception  they 're red flags we 're human beings we make deceptive
  flailing gestures all over the place all day long they don 't mean anything in and of themselves but when you see clusters of them that 's your signal look listen probe  ask some hard questions get out of that very comfortable mode of knowing 
 walk into curiosity mode ask more questions 
 have a little dignity  treat the person you 're talking to with rapport don 't try to be like those folks on law & order and those other tv shows that pummel their subjects into submission
 don 't be too aggressive it doesn 't work 
 now we 've talked a little bit about how to talk to someone who 's lying and how to spot a lie and as i promised we 're now going to look at what the truth looks like  
 but i 'm going to show you two videos two mothers
 one is lying one is telling the truth and these were surfaced by researcher david matsumoto in california and i think they 're an excellent example of what the truth looks like
  this mother diane downs  
 shot her kids at close range  drove them to the hospital while they bled all over the car claimed a  scraggy haired stranger did it and you 'll see when you see the video  she can 't even pretend to be an agonizing mother what you want to look for here
 is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes
 and her very very cool demeanor and if you look closely you 'll see duping delight
  throughout this video diane downs at night when i close my eyes i can see christie reaching her hand out to me while i 'm driving and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth  and that
 maybe it 'll fade too with time but i don 't think so that bothers me the most 
 now i 'm going to show you a video of an actual
  grieving mother  erin runnion confronting her daughter 's murderer and torturer in court 
 here you 're going to see no false emotion just the authentic expression of a mother 's agony erin runnion 
 i wrote this statement on the third anniversary of the night you took my baby  and you hurt her and you
 crushed her
 you terrified her until her heart stopped and she fought  and i know she
 you but i know she looked at you with those amazing brown eyes  and you still
 wanted to kill her and i don 't understand it  and i never will pm 
 okay there 's no doubting the veracity of those emotions  now the technology around what the truth looks like is progressing
  the science of it  we know for example that we now have
 specialized eye trackers and infrared brain scans mri 's that can decode the signals that our bodies send out when we 're trying to be deceptive  and these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit  
 and they will prove incredibly useful some day  
 but you 've got to ask yourself in the meantime who do you want on your side of the meeting someone who 's trained in getting to the truth or some guy who 's going to drag a
  the door  liespotters
 rely on human tools  they know as someone once said character 's who you are in the dark 
 and what 's kind of interesting is that today we have so little darkness our world is lit up twenty four hours a day it 's transparent
 with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their
  lives in public it 's a much more noisy world so one challenge we have is to remember 
 oversharing  that 's not honesty 
 our manic tweeting and texting can blind us to the fact that the subtleties of human decency character integrity that 's still what matters that 's
  what 's going to matter so in this much noisier world it might make sense for us to be
 just a little bit more
 explicit about our moral code 
 when you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking listening you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie 
 you start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit because you signal to everyone around you you say hey  my
  going to be an honest one my world is going to be one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized and marginalized and when you do that 
 the ground around you starts to shift
 just a little bit  and that 's the truth
