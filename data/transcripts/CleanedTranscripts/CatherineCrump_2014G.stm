  the shocking police crackdown on protestors in ferguson missouri in the wake of the police shooting of michael brown  underscored the extent to which advanced military weapons and equipment  designed for the battlefield are making their way to
  across the united states  although much tougher to observe this same thing is happening with surveillance equipment 
  mass surveillance is enabling local police departments to gather vast quantities of sensitive information about each and every one of us in a way that was never previously possible 
 location information can be very sensitive
  if you drive your car around the united states it can reveal if you go to a therapist  attend an alcoholics anonymous meeting if you go to church or if you don 't go to church 
 and when that information about you is combined with the same information about everyone else  
 the government can gain a detailed portrait of how private citizens interact
  this information used to be private  
 thanks to modern technology the government knows far too much about what happens behind closed doors 
 and local police departments make decisions about who they think you are based on this information 
 one of the key technologies driving mass location tracking is the innocuous sounding automatic license plate reader if you haven 't seen one it 's probably because you didn 't know what to look for
 they 're everywhere
  mounted on roads or on police cars automatic license plate readers capture images of every passing car and convert the license plate into machine readable text so that they can be checked against hot lists
 of cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing  
 but more than that increasingly local police departments are keeping records not just of people wanted for wrongdoing
 but of every plate that passes them by  resulting in the collection of mass quantities of data about where americans have gone
  did you know this was happening
 when mike katz lacabe asked his local police department for information about the plate reader data they had on him this is what they got
  in addition to the date time and location the police department had photographs that captured where he was going and often who he was with 
 the second photo from the top is a picture of mike and his two daughters getting out of their car in their own driveway  
 the government has hundreds of photos like this about mike going about his daily life  and if you drive a car in the united states
  i would bet money that they have photographs
 like this of you going about your daily life mike hasn 't done anything wrong  why is it okay that the government is keeping all of this information  
 the reason it 's happening is because as the cost of storing this data has plummeted
  the police departments simply hang on to it just in case it could be useful someday  
 the issue is not just that one police department is gathering this information in isolation or even that multiple police
  departments are doing it 
 at the same time the federal government is collecting all of these individual pots of data and pooling them together into one vast database with hundreds of millions of hits  showing where americans have traveled 
 this document from the federal drug enforcement administration which is one of the agencies primarily interested in this is one of several that reveal the existence of this database
  meanwhile in new york city the nypd has driven police cars equipped with license plate readers past mosques in order to figure out who is attending  
 the uses and abuses of this technology aren 't limited to the united states in the u k the police department put  80 year old john kat
  on a plate reader watch list after he had attended dozens of lawful political demonstrations where he liked to sit on a bench and sketch the attendees 
 license plate readers aren 't the only mass location tracking technology available to law enforcement agents today 
 through a technique known as a cell tower dump  law enforcement agents can uncover who was using one or more cell towers at a particular
  a technique which has been known to reveal the location of tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people 
 also  using a device known as a stingray  law enforcement agents can send tracking signals inside people 's houses to identify the cell phones located there 
  and if they don 't know which house to target they 've been known to drive this technology around through whole neighborhoods  
  military weapons and equipment so too do police departments across the united states possess high tech surveillance gear  
 just because you don 't see it  doesn 't mean it 's not there  
 the question is what should we do about this i think this poses a serious civil liberties threat  history has shown that once the police have massive quantities of data tracking the movements of innocent people it gets abused 
 maybe for blackmail maybe for political
  advantage or maybe for simple voyeurism
