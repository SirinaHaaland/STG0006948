  really extraordinary honor for me i spend most of my time in jails in prisons on death row  
 i spend most of my time in very low income communities in the projects and places where there 's a great deal of hopelessness  and being here at ted and seeing the stimulation
  it has been very very energizing to me and one of the things that 's emerged in my short time here is that ted has an identity  
 and you can actually say things here
 that have impacts around the world and sometimes when it comes through ted it has meaning and power
 that it doesn 't have when it doesn 't and i mention that because i think identity is really important  and we 've had some fantastic presentations
  and i think what we 've learned is that  if you 're a teacher your words can be meaningful but if you 're a compassionate teacher they can be especially meaningful 
 if you 're a doctor you can do some good things but if you 're a caring doctor you can do some other things  
 and so i want to talk about the power of identity  
 and i didn 't learn about this actually practicing law and doing
  the work that i do i actually learned about this from my grandmother  i grew up in a house
 that was the traditional african american home that was dominated by a matriarch and that matriarch was my grandmother
  she was tough  she was strong  she was powerful 
 she was the end of every argument in our family  
 she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family  she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved her parents were born in slavery in virginia in the
  the one thousand eight hundred and eighty 's and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world
 and my grandmother was tough but she was also loving when i would see her as a little boy she 'd come up to me and she 'd give me these hugs and she 'd squeeze me so tight i could barely breathe
 and then she 'd let me go and an hour or two later if i saw her she 'd come over to me and she 'd say bryan do you still feel me
  she 'd leave me alone and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her 
 and the only challenge was that she had ten children my mom was the youngest of her ten kids and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her it would be difficult to get her time and attention my cousins would be running around everywhere and i remember 
 when i was about eight or nine years old waking up one morning going into the living room and all of my cousins were running around and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me
 and at first i thought we were playing a game and i would look at her and i 'd smile but she was very serious  
 and after about fifteen or twenty minutes of this she got up and she came across the room
 and she took me by the hand
 and she said come on bryan you and i are going to have a talk and i remember this just like it happened yesterday  i never will
  you make sure you don 't do that i said sure then she sat me down and she looked at me
 and she said i want you to know i 've been watching you 
 and she said i think you 're special she said i think you can do anything
  the first thing i want you to promise me is that you 'll always love your mom 
 she said that 's my baby girl and you have to promise me now you 'll always take care of her well i adored my mom so i said yes mama i 'll do that 
 then she said the second thing i want you to promise me is that you 'll always do the right thing
 even when the right
  then finally she said the third thing i want you to promise me is that you 'll never drink alcohol 
 well i was nine years old so i said yes mama i 'll do that i grew up in the country in the rural south and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger when i was about
 fourteen or fifteen one day my brother came home and he had this six pack of beer
  where he got it
 and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some and they offered it to me 
 i said no no no that 's okay you all go ahead i 'm not going to have any beer my brother said come on we 're doing this today you always do what we do i had some your sister had some have some beer
  up on that conversation mama had with you 
 i said well what are you talking about he said oh mama tells all the grandkids that they 're special 
 i was devastated 
 and i 'm going to admit something to you i 'm going to tell you something i probably shouldn
 i know this might be broadcast broadly but i
 'm fifty two years old  and i 'm going to admit to you that i 've never had a drop of alcohol 
 applause i don 't say that because i think that 's virtuous i say that because there is power
 in identity  when we create the right kind of identity we can say things to the world around us that they don 't actually believe makes sense we
 can get them to do things that they don 't think
 they can do 
 when i thought about my grandmother of course she would think all her grandkids were special  my grandfather was in prison during prohibition my male uncles died of  alcohol related diseases  and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to 
 well i 've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system this country is very different today than it was forty years ago 
  there were three hundred thousand people in jails and prisons today there are two point three million
 the united states now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world  we have seven million people on probation and parole and mass incarceration in my judgment 
 has fundamentally changed our world  
 in poor communities in communities of color there is this despair there is this hopelessness
  that is being shaped by these outcomes one out of three black men between the ages of eighteen and thirty is in jail in prison on probation or parole 
 in urban communities across this country los angeles philadelphia baltimore washington fifty to sixty percent
 of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on probation or parole our system isn 't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around
  they 're also distorted by poverty we have a system of justice in this country
 that treats you much better if you 're rich and guilty
 than if you 're poor and innocent wealth not culpability shapes outcomes  
 and yet  we seem to be very comfortable 
 the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems we 've been disconnected  
 it 's interesting to me we 're looking at some very interesting developments in
  our work my state of alabama like a number of states actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction right now in alabama thirty four percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote we
 're actually projecting in another ten years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it 's been
 since prior to the passage of the voting rights act and there is this stunning silence
  i represent children a lot of my clients are very young the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence 
  children to die in prison we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country and we 're actually doing some litigation the only country in the world  
 i represent people on death row it 's interesting this question of the death
  in many ways we 've been taught to think that the real question is do people deserve to die for the crimes they 've committed  and that 's a very sensible question 
 but there 's another way of thinking about where we are in our identity  
 the other way of thinking about it is not do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit but do we deserve to kill i mean
 it 's fascinating death penalty in america is defined by error for every
  nine people who have been executed we 've actually identified one innocent person who 's been exonerated and released from death row a kind of astonishing error rate
 one out of nine people
 innocent i mean it 's fascinating in aviation we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash  
 but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem  it 's not our problem  it 's not our burden  it 's not our struggle
 i talk a lot about these issues i talk about
 race and this question of whether we deserve to kill and it 's interesting when i teach my students about african american history i tell them about slavery 
 i tell them about terrorism the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to world war ii we don 't really know very much about it but for african americans in this country
  that was an era defined by terror 
 in many communities people had to worry about being lynched they had to worry about being bombed it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives and these older people come up to me now
 and they say mr stevenson you give talks you make speeches you tell people to stop saying we 're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation 's history after nine eleven 
 they tell me to say no tell them that we grew up with that and that era of terrorism 
  was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid 
 and yet we have in this country this dynamic where we really don 't like to talk about
 our problems we don 't like to talk about our history
 and because of that we really haven 't understood what it 's meant to do the things we 've done historically we
 're constantly running into each other we 're constantly creating tensions and conflicts we have a hard time talking about race 
 and i believe it 's because we
  are unwilling
 to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation in south africa 
 people understood that we couldn 't overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation  
 in rwanda even after the genocide there was this commitment but in this country we haven 't done that i was giving 
 some lectures in germany about the death penalty it was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said
  troubling to hear what you 're talking about he said
 we don 't have the death penalty in germany and of course we can never have the death penalty in germany 
 and the room got very quiet and this woman said   
 there 's no way with our history  
 we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings  it would be unconscionable for us
 to in an intentional and deliberate
  way set about executing people and i thought about that what would it feel like to be living in a world
 where the nation state of germany was executing people especially if they were disproportionately jewish  i couldn 't bear it 
 it would be unconscionable and yet in this country
  in the states of the old south we execute people
 where you 're eleven times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black twenty two times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white
 in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched  and yet there is this disconnect  
 well i believe that our identity is at risk  that when we actually don 't care about these difficult things
 the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated  
 we love innovation  we love technology we love creativity we love entertainment  
 but ultimately  those realities
 are shadowed by suffering
  it becomes necessary to integrate the two 
 because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful 
 more committed more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world  and 
  for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor  the disadvantaged
  those who will never get to ted 
 but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives 
 you know ultimately we all have to believe things we haven 't seen we do  as rational as we are as committed to intellect as we are innovation  creativity  
 development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart  
 and it 's that mind heart connection that i believe
  compels us
 to not just be attentive attentive to all the bright and dazzly things  but also the dark and difficult things  
 vaclav havel the great czech leader talked about this he said  
 when we were in eastern europe and dealing with oppression we wanted all kinds of things but mostly what we needed was hope an orientation of the spirit a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness
 well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities
 have to be engaged in there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human
 until we pay attention to suffering to poverty to exclusion to unfairness to injustice now i will warn you that this
  kind of identity
 is a much more challenging identity
 than ones that don 't pay attention to this 
 it will get to you i had the great privilege when i was a young lawyer of meeting rosa parks and
 ms parks used to come back to montgomery every now and then and she would get together with two of her dearest friends these older women 
 johnnie carr who was the
 organizer of the montgomery bus boycott amazing
  virginia durr a white woman whose husband clifford durr  represented dr king and these women would get together and just talk and every now and then ms carr would call me and she 'd say bryan 
 ms parks is coming to town we 're going to get together and talk do you want to come over and listen 
 and i 'd say yes ma 'am i do and she 'd say well what are you going to do when you get here i said i 'm going to listen and i 'd go over there and i
 i would just listen it would be so energizing and so empowering and one time i was over there
 listening to these women talk and after a couple of hours ms parks turned to me and she said now bryan  tell me what the equal justice initiative is tell me what you 're trying to do and
 i began giving her my rap i said well we 're trying to challenge injustice we 're trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted we 're trying to confront
 bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice we 're trying to end life without parole sentences for children we 're trying to do something about the death penalty we 're trying to reduce the
  prison population we 're trying to end mass incarceration i gave her my whole rap and when i finished she looked at me and she said
 we need to find ways to to embrace these challenges these problems the suffering  
 because ultimately our humanity depends on everyone 's humanity 
 i 've learned very simple things doing the work that i do  it 's just taught me very simple things i 've come to understand and to believe
 that each of us is more than the worst thing we 've ever done i believe that for every person on the
  planet  
 i think if somebody tells a lie they 're not just a liar  
 i think if somebody takes something that doesn 't belong to them they 're not just a thief i think even if you kill someone you 're not just a killer  
 and because of that there 's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law 
 i also believe
 that in many parts of this country  and certainly in many parts of this globe that the opposite of poverty is
  not wealth  
 i don 't believe that i actually think in too many places the opposite of poverty is justice  
 and finally i believe
 that despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating  
 we will ultimately not be judged by our technology  we won 't be judged by our design we
  be judged by our intellect and reason ultimately you judge the character of a society 
 not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged but by how they treat the poor  
 the condemned  
 the incarcerated because it 's in that nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are 
 i sometimes get out of balance i 'll end with this story i sometimes push too hard
  hard i do get tired as we all do  sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important  
 and i 've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to to do these very harsh sentences and i go to the jail and i see my client who 's thirteen and fourteen and he 's been certified to stand trial as an adult i start thinking well how did that happen 
  judge turn you into something that you 're not 
 and the judge has certified him as an adult but i see this kid and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking well gosh if the judge can turn you into something that you 're not the judge must have magic power 
 yeah bryan the judge has some magic power you should ask for some of that and because i was up too late wasn 't thinking real straight i started working on a motion  
 and i had a client who was fourteen years old a young poor black kid and i started working on this motion and the head of the motion was motion to try my poor
  male client like a privileged white 
 and i put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct there was a crazy line in there about how there 's no conduct in this county it 's all misconduct and
 the next morning i woke up and i thought
  did i dream that crazy motion or did i actually write it and to my horror not only had i written it  but i had sent it to court a
 couple months
 went by and i had just forgotten all about it 
 and i finally decided oh gosh i 've got to go to the court and do this crazy case and i got into my car and i was feeling really overwhelmed overwhelmed
  and i got in my car
 went to this courthouse and i was thinking this is going to be so difficult so painful and
 i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the courthouse and as i was walking up the steps of this courthouse there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse  when this man saw me he came over to me and he said who are you 
 i said i 'm a lawyer he said you 're a lawyer i said yes sir and this man came over to me and he hugged me 
 and he whispered in my ear he said i 'm so
  have to tell you it was energizing 
 it connected deeply with something in me about identity 
 about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community to a perspective that is hopeful
 well i went into the courtroom and as soon as i walked inside the judge saw me coming in he said mr stevenson did you write this crazy motion i said yes sir i did and we started arguing and people started coming in because
  had written these crazy things  
 and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers and before i knew it the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race  that we were talking about poverty  
 that we were talking about inequality  
 and out of the corner of my eye i could see this janitor pacing back and forth and he kept looking through the window and he could hear all of this holler he kept pacing back and forth  and finally this older black man with this very worried look on his face
 came into the courtroom and sat down behind me  almost at counsel table 
 about ten minutes later the judge said we would take a break and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court 
 and this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man he said jimmy what are you doing in this courtroom and this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy
 and he looked at me and he said i came into this courtroom to tell this young
  keep your eyes on the prize  hold on i 've come to ted because i believe that many of you understand
 that the moral arc of the universe is long but it bends toward justice that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity 
 that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone 
 that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions
 of humanity
  and justice  and more than anything for those of you who share that i 've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize  hold on  thank you
  this community to help you on your way and to do something on this issue  other than writing a check what could we do bs well there are
  opportunities all around us if you live in the state of california for example there 's a referendum coming up this spring where actually there 's going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics 
  of punishment for example here in california we 're going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years one billion dollars
 law enforcement and safety  and i think that opportunity exists all around us ca there 's been this huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that
 it 's about increased incarceration rates what would you say to someone who believed that bs well actually the violent crime rate has remained
  the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn 't really in violent crime categories it was this misguided war on drugs  that 's where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population 
 and we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle for low level property 
  crimes  rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victimized i believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by
  crime not do less  and i think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one  and i think that 's the orientation that we have to change ca bryan you 've
 struck a massive chord here you 're an inspiring person thank you so much
