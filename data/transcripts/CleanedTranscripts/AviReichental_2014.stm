  was a cobbler  
 back in the day  he made custom made shoes i never got to meet him  he perished in the holocaust  
 but i did inherit his love for making
 that it doesn 't exist that much anymore you see while the industrial revolution
 did a great deal to improve humanity  it eradicated the very skill
 that my grandfather loved  and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it  but all of that is about to change
  all started with
 this the very first part that was ever printed it 's a little older than ted  it was printed in one thousand nine 
 by
 chuck hull  who invented 3d printing but the thing that i want to talk to you about today the big idea that i want to discuss with you
  to catapult us into the future  
 but rather that it 's actually going to connect us with our heritage  and it 's going to usher in a new era of localized 
 distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication 
  you all know your shoe size how many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples 
 anybody  
 wouldn 't it be awesome if you could for the first time get eyewear that actually fits you perfectly and doesn
 't require
  any hinge assembly  so chances are the hinges are not going to break  
 but the implications of 3d printing go well beyond the tips of our noses  
 when i met amanda for the first time she could already stand up and walk a little bit even though she was paralyzed from the waist down  
 but she complained to me that her suit was uncomfortable  it was a beautiful robotic
  suit made by ekso bionics  
 but it wasn 't inspired by her body  it wasn 't made to measure  so she challenged me to make her something
 that was a little bit more feminine a little bit more elegant  
 and lightweight  and like good tailors we thought that we would measure her digitally  
 and we did we built her an amazing suit the incredible part about what
  i learned from amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3d printing and we say to ourselves it 's going to replace traditional methods 
 amanda looked at it and she said it 's an opportunity for me
 to reclaim my symmetry
 and to embrace my authenticity and you know what she 's not standing still she now wants to walk in high heels
  it doesn 't stop there 3d printing is changing personalized medical devices as we know
  another opportunity to emotionally reconnect
 with your symmetry and as we sit here today you can go wireless on your braces with clear
  your dental restorations millions of in the ear hearing aids are already 3d printed today millions of people are served today from these devices
 what about full knee replacements 
 from your data  made to measure where all of the tools and guides are 3d printed
 is using 3d printing to make the next generation leap engine that will save
 fuel to the tune of about fifteen percent and cost
 for an airline of about fourteen million dollars good for g e right  and their customers and the environment but you know the even better news
 is that this technology is no longer reserved for deep pocketed corporations  planetary resources a startup
 for space explorations is going to put out its first space probe later this year
 it was a fraction of a nasa spaceship  it costs a fraction of its cost  and it 's made with less than a dozen moving parts  and it 's going to be out in space later this year  
 google is taking on this very audacious project of making the block phone the ara  it 's only possible because of the development of
  printing that for the first time will make functional 
 usable modules that will go into it a real moonshot  powered by 3d printing 
 how about food  
 what if we could for the first time make incredible delectables like
  what if we could completely change the experience like you see with that absinthe
 serving that is completely 3d printed and
 what if we could begin to put ingredients and colors and flavors in every taste  which means not only delicious foods but the promise of personalized
  nutrition around the corner  
 and that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3d printing with 3d printing complexity is free the printer doesn 't care
 if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape  
 and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it 
 many people think that
  be the end of manufacturing as we know it 
 i think that it 's the opportunity to put tomorrow 's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job opportunities 
 and with that everybody can become an expert maker and an
  expert manufacturer that will take new tools not everybody knows how to use cad  so we 're developing 
 perceptual devices that will allow you to touch and feel your designs as if you play with digital clay  
 when you do things like that and we also developed things that take physical photographs that are instantly printable  it will make it easier to create content
  we will also have the unintended  like democratized counterfeiting
 and ubiquitous illegal possession  
 so many people ask me will we have a 3d printer in every home i think it 's the wrong question to ask the right question to ask is how will 3d printing change my life
  in other words what room in my house will 3d printing fit in so everything that you see here has been 3d printed  
 including these shoes
 at the amsterdam fashion show now these are not my grandfather 's shoes
 these are shoes that represent the continuation of his passion for hyper local manufacturing my
 grandfather didn 't get to see nike printing
  cleats for
 the recent super bowl 
 and my father didn 't get to see me standing in my hybridized 3d printed shoes he passed away three years ago  
 but chuck hull the man that invented it all is right here in the house today  
 and thanks to
  i can say thanks to his invention i can say that i am a cobbler too  and by standing in these shoes
 i am honoring my past while manufacturing the future  thank you
