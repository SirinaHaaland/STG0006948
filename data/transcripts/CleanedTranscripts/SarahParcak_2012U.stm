  a child growing up in maine  one of my favorite things to do was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of maine  because my parents told me it would bring me luck  
 but you know  
 these shells they 're hard to
  they 're covered in sand they 're difficult to see 
 however over time i got used to looking for them i started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them
 this grew into a passion for finding things a love for the past and archaeology 
 and eventually when i started studying egyptology i realized that that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn 't enough because all of the sudden in egypt 
 my beach
 had grown from a tiny beach in maine
 to one eight hundred miles long next to the nile and my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities  
 this is really what brought me to using satellite imagery for trying to map the past i knew that i had to see differently 
 so i want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared this is a site located
  in the eastern egyptian delta called mendes  and the site visibly appears brown  but when we use the infrared
 and we process it all of the sudden using false color the site appears as bright pink  
 what you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape
 caused by the building materials and activities of the ancient egyptians
  what i want to share with you today
 is how we 've used satellite data
 to find an ancient egyptian city called itjtawy  missing for thousands of years 
 itjtawy was ancient egypt 's capital for over four hundred years at a period of time called the middle kingdom  about four thousand years ago
  the site is located in the faiyum of egypt and the site is really important because in the middle kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient egyptian art  
 architecture and religion  
 egyptologists have always known the site of itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it indicated within the red circles here 
  but somewhere within this massive flood plain  this area is huge it 's four miles by three miles in size
  city of itjtawy  and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east it covered over the city  so 
 how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape 
 finding it randomly would be the equivalent
 of locating a needle in a haystack blindfolded wearing baseball mitts 
 so what we did is we used nasa topography data to map out the landscape very subtle
  changes we started to be able to see where the nile used to flow 
 but you can see in more detail and even more interesting this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of itjtawy  
 so we collaborated with egyptian scientists
 to do coring work which you see
  when i say coring it 's like ice coring but instead of layers of climate change you 're looking for layers of human occupation 
 and five meters down  underneath a thick layer of mud 
 we found a dense layer of pottery  what this shows is that at this possible location of itjtawy five meters down  we have a layer of occupation for several 
  hundred years dating to the middle kingdom dating to the exact period of time we think itjtawy is 
 and agate that shows that there was a jeweler 's workshop here  these might not look like much  but when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry from the middle kingdom  
 these are the stones that were used so we have a dense layer of occupation dating to the middle kingdom at this site we also have evidence of an elite jeweler 's workshop showing that whatever was there was a very important city
  here yet but we 're going to be returning to the site in the near future
 to map it out and even more importantly  we have funding to train young egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well 
 so i wanted to end with my favorite quote from the middle kingdom it was probably written at the city of itjtawy four thousand years ago
  knowledge is the greatest of all callings there 's nothing like it in the land so as it turns out  ted was not founded in
