  one point three billion years ago in a distant  distant galaxy two black holes locked into a spiral  
 falling inexorably towards each other
  three suns ' worth of stuff into pure energy in a tenth of a second 
 for that brief moment in time  
 the glow was brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies in all of the known universe  
 it was a very
 big bang  
  but they didn 't release their energy in light i mean you know they 're black holes  all that energy was pumped
 into the fabric of space and time itself  making the universe explode in gravitational waves let me give you a sense of the timescale
 at work here one point three billion years ago  earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life
  people and even god save us the internet and
 about twenty five years ago 
 a particularly audacious set of people rai weiss at mit  kip thorne and ronald drever at caltech
 decided that it would be really neat to build a giant laser detector with which to search for the gravitational waves from things like colliding black holes
 most people thought they were nuts
  but enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts that the us national science foundation decided to fund their crazy idea  
 so
 after decades of development  construction and imagination
 and a breathtaking amount of hard work they built their detector
  called ligo  the laser interferometer 
 observatory 
 for the last several years ligo 's been undergoing a huge expansion in its accuracy a tremendous improvement in its detection ability  it 's now called advanced ligo as a result 
 in early september of two thousand
  ligo turned on for a final test run while they sorted out a few lingering details  and on september fourteen
 of two thousand and fifteen  just days after the detector had gone live 
 the gravitational waves from those colliding black holes
 passed through the earth and they passed through you and me and they passed through the detector
  in my life more emotionally intense than that one is the birth of my daughter  the other is when i had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill
  you know it was the payoff of my career  basically  
 everything i 'd been working on it 's no longer science fiction allan
  so that 's my very good friend and collaborator 
 scott hughes a theoretical physicist at mit who
 has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and the signals that they could impart on observatories like ligo for the past twenty three years  
 so let me take a moment to tell you what i mean by a gravitational wave a
 gravitational wave
 is a ripple in the shape of space and time as the wave passes by
  stretches space and everything in it in one direction and compresses it in the other 
 this has led to countless instructors of general relativity doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity it stretches and expands it stretches and expands 
 so the trouble with gravitational waves is that they 're very weak they 're preposterously weak  for example the waves that hit
  us on september fourteen and yes  every single one of you stretched and compressed under the action of that wave
 when the waves hit they stretched the average person
 by one part in ten to the twenty one that 's a decimal place twenty zeroes and a one 
 that 's why everyone thought the ligo people were nuts even with
  a laser detector five kilometers long and that 's already crazy they would have to measure the length of those detectors
 to less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus of an atom  and that 's preposterous  
 so towards the end of his classic text on gravity
  the hunt for gravitational waves as follows he said the technical difficulties to be surmounted in constructing such detectors
 are enormous  
 but physicists are ingenious and with the support of a broad lay public all obstacles will surely be overcome
  coming back to ligo scott likes to say that ligo acts like
 an ear more than it does like an eye  i want to explain what that means  
 visible light has a wavelength a size that 's much smaller than the things around you the features on people 's
  your cell phone  
 and that 's really useful because it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you by looking at the light coming from different spots in the scene about you 
 sound is different 
 audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to fifty feet long 
 and that makes it really difficult in fact in practical purposes impossible to make an image of something you really care about your child 's
  we use sound to listen for features like pitch and tone and rhythm and volume
 to infer a story behind the sounds that 's alice talking that 's bob interrupting silly bob 
 so the same is true of gravitational waves  
 we can 't use them to make simple images of things out in the universe  but by listening to changes in the
  amplitude and frequency of those waves we can hear the story that those waves are telling  
 and at least for ligo  the frequencies that it can hear
 are in the audio band  so if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air into sound 
 we can literally hear the universe speaking to us 
 for example  listening to gravity
  just in this way can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes  something my colleague scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about sh 
 if the two black holes are non spinning you get a very simple chirp whoop 
 if the two bodies are spinning very rapidly i have that same chirp  but with a modulation on top of it so it kind of goes 
 it 's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform
  so on september fourteen two thousand and fifteen a date that 's definitely going to live in my memory ligo heard
 this [ whirring sound ]
 so
 if you know how to listen 
 that is the sound of sh two black holes each of about thirty solar masses that were whirling around at a rate comparable to what goes on in your blender 
 aa it 's worth
  pausing here to think about what that means 
 two black holes the densest thing in the universe  
 one with a mass of  twenty nine suns and one with a mass of thirty six suns 
 whirling around each other one hundred times per second before they collide just imagine the power of that it
 's fantastic  
 and we know it
 because we heard it 
 that 's the lasting
  importance of ligo it
 's an entirely new way to observe the universe that we 've never had before  it 's a way that lets us hear the universe
 and hear the invisible 
 and there 's a lot out there that we can 't see in practice or even in principle  so supernova
  i would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae  they 're very useful we 've learned a lot about the universe from them  
 the problem is all the interesting physics happens in the core and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron and carbon and silicon we 'll never see through it it 's opaque to light 
 gravitational waves go through iron
 as if it were glass
 totally transparent  the big bang  i would love to be able to explore the first few moments of the universe
  but we 'll never see them  because
 the big bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow with gravitational waves we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning  
 perhaps most importantly  i 'm positive that there are things out there
 that we 've never seen that we may never be able to see and that we haven 't even imagined
  things that we 'll only discover by listening and in fact even in that very first event  ligo found things
 that we didn 't expect here 's my colleague and one of the key members of the ligo collaboration  matt evans my colleague at mit  addressing exactly that
  dinosaur bones with which we do this archeology  so it lets us really get a whole nother angle on what 's out there in the universe and how the stars came to be
  detectors that can listen to the universe to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos  
 our job is to dream up and build new observatories a whole new generation of observatories on the ground in space i mean 
 what could be more glorious than listening to the big bang itself  
 our job now is to dream big  
 dream with us thank you
