  i came here to show you
 the fotokite it 's a tethered flying camera  
 but before i do that i want to tell you a bit about where it came from what motivated it so i was born in russia and
  three years ago in two thousand and eleven there were the russian federal elections 
 there were massive irregularities reported and people came out to protest which was very unlikely for russia  
 and
 no one really knew how significant these protests were because for whatever reason the world media largely ignored it 
 now there was a group of photographers who kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby usually photographing things like the sphinx 
 the pyramids who
  to be right around the corner and they they flew a camera
 and they took some snapshots some panoramas of this demonstration just completely independent entity  completely random occurrence  
 and the image when i saw it it really struck me 
 here 's one of the panoramas  so
 in a single image you can really see
  you just can 't consider this insignificant all in a single image which was really cool to me  
 and i think in the future journalism and many other professions  there are flying cameras already quite commonly out there but
 i think  you wait a few months a few years and
 for many professions it 's really going to be a requirement  
 and it make sense it 's such a unique perspective  nothing really communicates this scale for example in context in a way that this does 
 but there are a few
 hurdles and they are quite basic and quite fundamental 
 one is piloting so for this image  they flew a camera a
 five kilogram device with an slr under it
 it 's
 quite heavy  lots of spinning
  sharp things  
 it 's a bit uncomfortable to fly probably also for the operator in fact  you can see that on the back of the pilot 's shirt it says no questions until landing 
 in russian and in english
 because people are curious and they 'll go tap you and then you lose your focus and things happen and these guys are great they 're professionals
  careful in what they do so in the protests maybe you noticed they flew over the river so it was quite safe  but
 this doesn 't necessarily apply to all people and all conditions so we really have to make piloting easier 
 the other problem is regulations or rather the lack of good regulation for many good reasons it 's just difficult to come up with common sense laws
  has a smartphone with a camera right there are more and more of them  you hear about people with google glass being attacked you hear about actually a drone pilot a hobbyist was attacked two weeks ago because he was flying near a beach 
 here 's some personal input i didn 't expect just yesterday i was attacked by a guy who claimed that i was filming him 
 i was checking my email right here
 easy way to get input for your talk
 but i think there are better solutions i think we have to defuse the situation
 we have to come up with responsible solutions that address the privacy issues and the safety accountability issues
 but still give us that perspective  and this is one potential solution  so
  's kind of special about it is there 's a leash  it 's literally a dog leash it 's very convenient 
 and the neat thing about it is to fly it  there 's no joysticks nothing like this you just turn it on
 and you point in the direction that you want to fly you give it a little twist that 's kind of the way you communicate
  the interaction is super simple it 's like a personal flying pet it just always maintains a certain angle to you and if i move around with it it 'll actually follow
  and of course we can build on top of this so this leash has some additional electronics you can turn it on and now  it 's like
 telling your dog to fly lower if you have such a dog  so i can press a button and
 and manipulate it rather easily so i just shifted its position  and it 's really safe   i don 't know about you guys in the front row
  at least in principle you have to agree that you feel safer because there is a physical connection 
 live demos are hard right things go wrong all the time but no matter what this thing will actually prevent this thing from going into you what 's more it tells you immediately 
  that i am the one responsible for this device you don 't have to look for someone controlling it 
 and and launch it  and if i can do this
 on stage live then i can show each and every one of you in five minutes how to operate one of these devices  
 so now we have two eyes in the sky
 and now the trick is getting them back 
 so my question now to you is 
 well it 's a nice solution it 's very accessible it 's safe  what would you use it for what would you use
 such a camera for in your life  thank you
