  i grew up in a very small village in canada  and i 'm an undiagnosed
 dyslexic 
 i had a really hard time in school in fact my mother told me eventually that i was the little kid in the village who cried
  cried all the way to school  
 i ran away  i left when i was twenty five years old to go to bali  
 and there i met my incredible wife  cynthia and together over twenty years we built an amazing jewelry business 
  it was a fairy tale  and then we retired then she took me to see a film that i really didn 't want to see it ruined
 my life 
 the inconvenient truth and mr gore  i have four kids 
 and even if part of what he says is true  they 're not going to have the life that i
  and i decided at that moment
 that i would spend the rest of my life doing whatever i could
 to improve their possibilities so
 here 's the world  and here we are in bali  it 's a tiny little island sixty miles by ninety miles  it has an intact
  cynthia and i were there we had had
 a wonderful life there  and we decided to do something unusual we decided to give
 back
 locally  and here it is it 's called the green school  i know it doesn 't look like a school 
 but it is something we decided to do and it is extremely extremely green the classrooms have no walls
  the teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard  the desks are not square 
 at green school  the children are smiling an unusual thing for school especially for me  and we practice holism  
 and for me it 's just the idea that if this little girl
 graduates as a
  chances are she 'll demand a whole world
 a whole world to live on our children spend one hundred and eighty one days
 going to school in a box the people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum
 out of the same materials  
 so if this gentleman had had a holistic education
  would he be sitting there  would he have had more possibilities in his life 
 the classrooms have natural light  they 're beautiful they 're bamboo 
 the breeze passes through them and when the natural breeze isn 't enough 
 the kids deploy bubbles but not the kind of bubbles you know these bubbles are made from natural cotton
 and rubber from the rubber tree
  so we basically turned the box into a bubble and these kids know that painless climate control
 may not be part
 of their future  we pay the bill at the end of the month but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren 
 we have to teach the kids
 that the world is not
 indestructible 
 these kids did a little graffiti on their desks  
 and then they signed up for two extra courses the first one was called sanding
 and the second one was called re waxing but since that happened they own
 those desks  they know they can control their world
 're on the grid we 're not proud of it  but an amazing alternative energy company in paris
 is taking us off the grid with solar  and this thing
 is the second vortex to be built in the world in a two and a half meter drop on a river when the turbine drops in 
 it will produce eight thousand watts of electricity day and night  
 and you know what these
 there 's nowhere to flush  and as long as we 're taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water you 're all really smart just do the math 
 how many people times how much water 
 there isn 't enough water these are compost toilets and nobody at the school wanted to know about them
 especially the principal 
 and they work people use them people are okay
  it 's something you should think about doing not many things didn 't work  the beautiful canvas and rubber skylights
 got eaten by the sun in six months we had to replace them with recyclable plastic 
 the teachers dragged giant pvc whiteboards into the classrooms
  so we had some good ideas we took old automobile windshields put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard 
 green school sits in south central bali  
 and it 's on twenty acres of rolling garden there 's an amazing river traveling through it and you can see there
 how we manage to get across the river 
 i met a father the other day  he looked a little crazed i said
  welcome to green school he said i 've been on an airplane for twenty four hours i asked him 
 why he said i had a dream once about a green school and i saw a picture of this green school i got on an airplane 
 in august i 'm bringing my sons 
 this was a great
  but more than that people are building green houses around green school  so their kids can walk to school on the paths  
 and people are bringing their green industries hopefully their green restaurants 
 to the green school  it 's becoming a community  it 's becoming a green model 
 we had to look at everything 
 no petrochemicals in the pavement no pavement these are volcanic stones laid by hand there are no sidewalks
 the sidewalks are gravel they flood when it rains but they 're green this is the school buffalo  
 he 's planning to eat that fence for dinner all the fences at green school are green and
 when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gate they found out the fence was made out of
  they took the tapioca roots up to the
 kitchen sliced them thinly and made delicious chips  landscaping  
 we manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms we dropped them gently in 
 we made space for these guys
 who are bali 's last black pigs  and the school cow
 is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower
 on the playing field these young ladies
 are living in a rice culture  but they know something that few people know in a rice culture they know how to plant organic rice 
 they know how to look after it  they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it  
 they 're part of the rice cycle
 and these skills will be valuable for them in their future  this young man is picking organic vegetables
  we feed four hundred people lunch every day
 and it 's not a normal lunch there 's no gas  local balinese women cook the food on sawdust burners
 using secrets that only their grandmothers know the food
 is incredible green school is a place of pioneers  local and global
  and it 's a kind of microcosm of the globalized world the kids are from twenty five countries when i see them together  i know
 that they 're working out how to live in the future  green school is going into its third year with one hundred and sixty children  
 it 's a school where you do learn reading one of my favorites writing
 i was bad at it arithmetic but
  you also learn other things you learn bamboo building you practice
 ancient balinese arts this is called mud wrestling in the rice fields 
 the kids love it  the mothers aren 't quite convinced 
 laughter we 've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives and
  local means that
 twenty percent of the population of the school has to be balinese 
 and this was a really big commitment  and we were right  and people are coming forward from all over the world
 to support the balinese scholarship fund  because these kids will be bali 's next green leaders  
 the teachers are as diverse as the student body  and the amazing thing is that
 volunteers are popping up a man came from java with a new kind of organic agriculture a woman came from africa with music  
 and together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed
 to creating a new generation of global green leaders  
 the green school effect we don 't know what it is we need
  someone to come and study it  but what 's happening our learning different kids dyslexic we 've renamed them
 prolexic are doing well in these beautiful beautiful
 classrooms  and all the kids are thriving  and how did we do all this on giant grass
  it 's bamboo it comes out of the ground like a train  it grows as high as a coconut tree in two months
 and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this it 's as strong
 and dense as teak and it will hold up
 any roof when the architects came they brought us these things  and you 've probably seen things like this the yellow box was called the administration complex
 we squashed it we rethought it but mainly
 we renamed it the heart of school and that changed everything forever  it 's a double helix  
 it has administrators in it and many many other things 
 and the problem of building it when the balinese workers
 saw long reams of plans
  they looked at them and said what 's this so we built
 big models  we had them engineered by the engineers and balinese carpenters like this
 measured them with their bamboo rulers  selected the bamboo and built the buildings
 using
  and the balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building
 and when the scaffolding came down  
 we realized that we had a cathedral a cathedral to green and a cathedral to
  the heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it  from the time the foundations were finished in three months it had roofs
 and floors it may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world  but many people believe that it 's the most beautiful 
 is this doable in your community  we believe it is green school is a model we built for the world
  it 's a model we built for bali
  and you just have to follow these simple simple rules be local  let the environment lead
 and think about how your grandchildren
 might build so mr gore  thank you you ruined my life  but you gave me an incredible
  and if you 're interested in being involved in finishing green school and building the next fifty around the world  please come and see us thank you
