  humans have long held a fascination for the human brain  
 we chart it  we 've described it  we 've drawn it  we 've mapped it  
 now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by
  technology think
 google maps think gps the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation so let 's take a look at the brain  
 most people when they first look at a fresh human brain they say it doesn 't look what you 're typically looking at when someone shows you a brain typically what you 're looking at is a fixed brain  it 's gray  and this outer layer this is the vasculature which is incredible
  around a human brain  this is the blood vessels twenty percent of the oxygen coming from your lungs  twenty percent of the blood pumped from your heart is servicing 
  this one organ that 's basically if you hold two fists together it 's just slightly larger than the two fists 
  going on in the human brain  
 so for example they can see in the back part of the brain which is just turning around there there 's the cerebellum that 's keeping you upright right now it 's keeping me standing it 's involved in coordinated movement 
  on the side here this is temporal cortex this is the area where primary auditory processing so you 're hearing my words you 're sending it up into higher language processing centers towards the front of the brain is the place in which all
  of the more complex thought decision making it 's the last to mature in late adulthood this is where all your decision making processes are going on it 's the place where you 're deciding right now you probably aren 't going to order the steak for dinner  
 so if you take a deeper look at the brain one of the things if you look at it in cross section what you can see is that
 can 't really see a whole lot of structure there  but there 's actually a lot of structure there it 's cells and it 's wires all wired together  so about a hundred years ago some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells 
 and that 's shown here in the the very light blue you can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained and what you can see is it 's very non uniform you see a lot more structure there 
 so the outer part of that brain is the neocortex it 's one continuous processing unit if you will  but you can also see things underneath there as well
  all of these blank areas are the areas in which the wires are running through they 're probably less cell dense so there 's about  eighty six billion neurons in our brain and as you can see they 
  're very non uniformly distributed and how they 're distributed really contributes to their underlying function and of course as i mentioned before  since we can now start to map brain function we can start to tie these into the individual cells so let 's
  take a deeper look let 's look at neurons  so as i mentioned there are eighty six billion neurons there are also these smaller cells as you 'll see these are support cells astrocytes glia 
 and the nerves themselves are the ones who are receiving input they 're storing it they 're processing it  each neuron is connected via synapses to up to ten thousand other neurons in your brain 
 and each neuron
  itself is largely unique the unique character of both individual neurons and neurons within a collection of the brain are driven by fundamental properties of their underlying 
  biochemistry these are proteins they 're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement  they 're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with
  they 're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do so if we zoom in to an even deeper level 
 all of those proteins are encoded by our genomes  we each have twenty three pairs of chromosomes we get one from mom one from dad and on these chromosomes 
  are roughly twenty five thousand genes they 're encoded in the dna and
  thousand genes are turned on
 and at what level they 're turned on and so our project is seeking to look at this readout understanding which of these twenty five thousand genes is turned on  
 so in order to undertake such a project we obviously need brains  so we sent our lab technician out
  we were seeking normal human brains what we actually start with is a medical examiner 's office this a place where the dead are brought in  we are seeking normal human brains 
 there 's a lot of criteria by which we 're selecting these brains we want to make sure that we have normal humans between the ages of twenty to sixty they died a somewhat natural death with no injury to the brain
  no drugs on board we do a toxicology workup 
 and we 're very careful about the brains that we do take we 're also selecting for brains in which we can get the tissue we can get consent to take the tissue
 within twenty four hours of time of death  because what we 're trying to measure the rna which is the readout from our genes is
 very labile and so so we have to move very
  side note on the collection of brains  because of the way that we collect and because we require consent we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains males are much more likely to 
  die an accidental death in the prime of their life  and men are much more likely to have their significant other 
 so the first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what 's called an mr this is magnetic resonance imaging
  mri  it 's a standard template by which we 're going to hang the rest of this data so we collect this mr and you can think of this as our satellite view for our map the next thing we do is we 
  collect what 's called a diffusion tensor imaging this maps the large cabling in the brain and again you can think of this as almost mapping our interstate highways if you will 
  and then it 's sliced into one centimeter slices  
 and those are frozen solid  and they 're shipped to seattle and in seattle  we take these this is a whole human hemisphere and we put them into what 's basically a glorified meat slicer there 's a blade here that 's going to cut across a section of
 the tissue and transfer it to a microscope slide we 're going to then apply one of those stains to it  and we scan it and then what we get is our
  so this is where experts come in and they make basic anatomic assignments you could consider this state boundaries if you will those pretty broad outlines 
 from this we 're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces 
 which then we can put on a smaller cryostat  and this is just showing this here this frozen tissue and it 's being cut  this is twenty microns thin so this is about a baby hair 's width and remember it 's frozen and so
  you can see here old fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied we take a microscope slide  
 then we very carefully melt onto the slide  this will then go onto a robot that 's going to apply one of those stains to it
 and our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this so again this is what they can see under the microscope you can see collections and configurations of large and small cells in clusters and various places and from there it 's routine
  they understand where to make these assignments and they can make basically what 's a reference atlas this is a more detailed map 
 our scientists then use this to go back to another piece of that tissue and do what 's called laser scanning microdissection  so the technician takes the instructions they scribe along a place there  and then the laser actually cuts
  you can see that blue dot there cutting  and that tissue falls off you can see on the microscope slide here that 's what 's happening in real time there 's a container underneath that 's collecting that tissue  
 we take that tissue  we purify the rna out of it using some basic technology
 and then we put a florescent tag on it  we take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray now this may look like a bunch of dots to you but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human
  that we spotted down on glass this has roughly sixty thousand elements on it so we repeatedly measure various genes of the twenty five thousand genes in the genome and when we take a 
  sample and we hybridize it to it  we get a unique fingerprint if you will  quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample now we do this over and over again this process for any given brain we 're taking over a thousand samples for
  each brain  this area shown here is an area called the hippocampus it 's involved in learning and memory and it contributes to about seventy samples of those thousand samples  
 so each sample gets us about fifty thousand data points
 with repeat measurements a thousand samples so roughly we have fifty million data points for a given human brain  
 we 've done right now two human brains worth of data
 we 've put all of that together into one thing and i 'll show you what that synthesis looks like it 's basically a large data set of information that 's all freely available to any scientist around the world they don 't even
 have to log in to come use this tool  mine this data find interesting things out with this 
 so here 's the modalities that we put together you 'll start to recognize these things from what we 've collected before
 here 's the mr it provides the framework there 's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn  it allows you to zoom in  it allows you to highlight individual structures 
 but most importantly  we 're now mapping into this anatomic framework which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on so the red levels are where a gene is turned on to a great degree green is the sort of cool areas where it 's
  not turned on and each gene gives us a fingerprint and remember that we 've assayed all the twenty five thousand genes in the genome and have all of that data available 
 so what can scientists learn about this data  we 're just starting to to look at this data ourselves there 's some basic things that you would want to understand two great
  prozac and wellbutrin these are commonly prescribed antidepressants now remember we 're assaying genes genes send the instructions to make proteins proteins are 
  targets for drugs so drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off etc  so if you want to understand the action of drugs you want to understand how they 're acting in the ways you want them to 
 and also in the ways you don 't want them to in the side effect profile etc you want to see where those genes are turned on and for the first time
  can actually do that we can do that in multiple individuals that we 've assayed too so now we can look
 throughout the brain we can see this unique fingerprint  and we get confirmation we get confirmation that indeed the gene is turned on for something like prozac in serotonergic 
 structures things that are already known be affected but we also get to see the whole thing we also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before and we see these genes turned on there
  as interesting a side effect as it could be 
 one other thing you can do with such a thing is you can  because it 's a pattern matching exercise because there 's unique fingerprint  we can actually scan through the entire genome and find 
 other proteins that show a similar fingerprint  so if you 're in drug discovery for example you can go through an entire listing of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug targets and
  optimize  
 most of you are probably familiar with genome wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying scientists have recently discovered the gene 
  or genes which affect x and so these kinds of studies are routinely published by scientists and they 're great they analyze large populations they look at their entire genomes and they try to find hot spots of activity
 causally to genes but what you get out of such an exercise is simply a list of genes it tells you the what  but it doesn 't tell you the where  and so it 's very important for
 those researchers that we 've created this resource now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity they can start to look at common pathways other things that they simply haven 't been able to do before  
 so i think this
 audience in particular can understand the importance of individuality  and i think every human  we all have different
 genetic backgrounds we all have lived separate lives  but the fact is our genomes are greater than ninety nine percent similar we 're similar at the genetic
  and what we 're finding is actually even at the brain biochemical level  we are quite similar  and so this shows it 's not ninety nine percent but it 's roughly ninety percent correspondence 
 at a reasonable cutoff  so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated  and then we find some outliers some things that lie beyond the cloud and those genes are interesting but they 're very subtle  so i think
  though we celebrate all of our differences  we are quite similar even at the brain level  
 now what do those differences look like  this is an example of a study that we did to follow up and see what exactly those differences were and they 're quite subtle  these are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type these are two genes that we found
  as good examples one is called reln it 's involved in early developmental cues disc1 is a gene that 's deleted in schizophrenia these aren 't schizophrenic individuals 
 but they do show some population variation  and so what you 're looking at here in donor one and donor four which are the exceptions to the other two that genes 
  are being turned on in a very specific subset of cells it 's this dark purple precipitate within the cell that 's telling us a gene is turned on there  
  due to an individual 's genetic background or their experiences  we don 't know those kinds of studies require much larger populations  
 so i 'm going to leave you with a final note about the complexity of the brain and how much more we have to go i think these resources are incredibly valuable 
 they give researchers a handle on where to go but we only looked at a handful
  of individuals at this point we 're certainly going to be looking at more i 'll
 just close by saying that that the the tools are there  and this is truly an unexplored undiscovered continent this is the
 the new frontier if you will and so for those who are undaunted but humbled by the complexity of the brain the future awaits
