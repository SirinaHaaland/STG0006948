  over a million people are killed each year in disasters 
 two and a half million people will be permanently disabled or displaced 
 and the communities will take twenty to thirty years to recover and billions of economic losses
 if you can reduce the initial response by one day you can reduce the overall recovery
 by a thousand days or three years see how that works 
 if the initial responders can get in save lives  mitigate whatever flooding danger there is that means the
  other groups can get in to restore the water the roads the electricity  which means then the construction people the insurance agents all of them can get in to rebuild the houses  which 
  then means you can restore the economy and maybe even make it better and more resilient to the next disaster 
  it 'll make a difference of six months in that person getting their home repaired  
 and that 's why i do disaster robotics because robots can make a disaster go away faster 
 now you 've already seen a couple of these these are the
 these are two types of of uavs a rotorcraft or hummingbird a fixed wing a hawk 
 and they 're used extensively since two thousand and five hurricane katrina let me show
  you how this hummingbird  this rotorcraft works  fantastic for structural engineers being able to see damage from angles you can 't get from binoculars on the ground 
  or from a satellite image or anything flying at a higher angle 
  this hawk now this hawk can be used for geospatial surveys that 's where you 're pulling imagery together and getting 3d reconstruction we used both of 
  these at the oso mudslides up in washington state  because the big problem was geospatial and hydrological understanding of the disaster not the search and rescue the search 
  and rescue teams had it under control and knew what they were doing the bigger problem was that river and mudslide might wipe them out and flood the responders
 and not only was it challenging to the responders and property damage  it 's also putting at risk the future of salmon fishing along that part of washington state  so they needed to understand what was going on 
 in seven hours going from arlington driving from the incident command post to the site  flying the uavs processing the data  driving back to arlington command post seven hours
  them in seven hours data that they could take only two to three days to get any other way
 and at higher resolution  it 's a game changer  
 and don 't just think about the uavs i mean they are sexy but remember 
 eighty percent of the world 's population lives by water and that means our critical infrastructure is underwater the parts that we can 't get to like the bridges and things
  like that  and that 's why we have unmanned marine vehicles 
 one type of which you 've already met which is sarbot a square dolphin it goes underwater and uses sonar  
 well  why are marine vehicles so important and why are they very very important they get overlooked think about the japanese tsunami
 four hundred miles of
  the amount of coastland devastated by hurricane katrina in the united states 
 you 're talking about your bridges your pipelines  your ports wiped out and if you don 't have a port you don 't have a way to get in enough relief supplies to support a population that was a huge problem at the haiti earthquake  
 so we need marine vehicles now let 's look at a viewpoint from the sarbot of what they were seeing we were working on a
  fishing port  we were able to reopen that fishing port using her sonar in four hours 
 that fishing port was told it was going to be six months before they could get a manual team of divers in and it was going to take the divers two weeks they were going to miss the fall fishing season which was the major economy for that part which is kind of like their
  all the robots i 've shown you have been small  
 and that 's because robots don 't do things that people do they go places people can 't go and a great example of that is bujold unmanned ground 
  vehicles are particularly small  so bujold 
  was used extensively at the world trade center to go through towers one two and four you 're climbing into the rubble rappelling down going deep in spaces 
  and just to see the world trade center from bujold 's viewpoint  look at this you 're talking about a disaster where you can 't fit a person or a dog and it 's on fire  
  so hot on one of the robots  the tracks began to melt and come off 
 robots don 't replace people or dogs or hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins 
 they do things new they assist the responders the experts in new and innovative ways  
 the biggest problem is not making the robots smaller though it 's not making them more
  it 's not making more sensors  the biggest problem is the data  the informatics because these people need to get the right data at the right time  
 so wouldn 't it be great if we could have experts immediately access the robots without having to waste any time of driving to the site so whoever 's there use their robots over
  let 's think about that let 's think about a chemical train derailment in a rural county what are the odds that the experts your chemical engineer your railroad transportation engineers 
 have been trained on whatever uav that particular county happens to have probably like none  so we 're using these kinds of interfaces to allow people to use the robots without knowing what robot they 're using 
  robots give you what they give the experts is data  
 the problem becomes who gets what data when one thing to do is to ship all the information to everybody and let them sort it out 
 well  the problem with that is it overwhelms the networks  
 and worse yet it overwhelms the cognitive abilities of each of the people trying to get that one nugget
 of information they need to make the decision that 's going to make the difference  
 so we need to think about those kinds of challenges so it 's the data
  going back to the world trade center we tried to solve that problem by just recording the data from  bujold only when she was deep in the rubble because that 's what the
  team said they wanted 
 what we didn 't know at the time was that the civil engineers would have loved needed the data as we recorded the box beams the serial numbers  the locations as we went into the rubble  
 we lost valuable data so the challenge is getting all the data and getting it to the right people 
 now  here 's another reason we 've learned that some
 some buildings things like schools hospitals city halls get inspected four times by different agencies throughout the response phases 
 now we 're looking if we can get the data from the robots to share not only can we do things like
 compress that sequence of phases to shorten the response time but now we can begin to do the response in parallel 
 everybody can see the data we can shorten it that way 
 so really
  disaster robotics is a misnomer it 's not about the robots  it 's about the data applause
 so my challenge to you the next time you hear about a disaster  look for the robots they may be underground  they may be underwater 
 they may be in the sky  but they should be there  look for the robots  because robots are coming to the rescue
