  say about film making is about this film in thinking about
 some of the wonderful talks we 've heard here michael moschen and some of the talks about music 
 this idea that there is a narrative line  and that music exists in time a film also exists in time it 's an experience
  you should go through emotionally
  and in making this film i felt that so many of the documentaries i 've seen were all about
 learning something or knowledge or driven by talking heads and driven by ideas  and i wanted this film to be driven by emotions and really to follow my journey  
 so instead of doing the talking head thing instead it 's composed of scenes
 and we meet people along the way we only meet them once they don 't come back several
  times so it really chronicles a journey  it 's something like life that once you get in it you can 't get out there
 are two clips i want to show you the first one is
 a kind of hodgepodge its just three little moments four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight  it 's not the way they occur in the film because they are part of much
  they play off each other in a wonderful way  and that ends with a little clip of my father of lou 
 talking about something that is very dear to him which is the accidents of life  i think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental 
 and perhaps not planned at all 
 and those three clips will be followed by a scene of
 perhaps what to me is really his greatest building which is a building in dhaka bangladesh  he built the
  and i think you 'll enjoy this building it 's never been seen
 it 's been still photographed but never photographed by a film crew we were the first film crew in there  
 so you 'll see images of this remarkable building 
 a couple of things to keep in mind when you see it  
 it was built entirely by hand i think they got a crane the last year  it was built entirely by hand off bamboo
  people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads  dumping them in the forms  it is the capital of the country and it took  twenty three years to build  
 which is something they seem seem to be very proud of over there it took as long as the taj mahal  unfortunately it took so long that lou never saw it finished  
 he died
 in
  that when when you see that building that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished  
 and that really struck me about about my father in the sense that he had such belief
 that somehow 
 doing these things giving in the way that he gave that something good would come out of it even in the middle of a war there was a war with pakistan at one point and the construction stopped totally and he kept working 
 because he felt well when the war is done
 they 'll need this building
 so those are the two clips i 'm going to show
 roll that tape richard saul wurman 
 i remember
 hearing him talk at penn  and i came home and i said to my father
  and he 's sort of ugly funny voice  
 and he 's a teacher at school i know you 've never heard of him  
 but just mark this day that someday you will hear of him  because he 's really an amazing man
  when he was in rome moshe safdie
 he was a real nomad and you know when i knew him when i was in the office he would come in from a trip and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely and he would pack up and go 
 you know he 'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him i mean
 as tragic as his death was in a railway station  it was so
  consistent with his life you know i mean i often think i 'm going to die in a plane or i 'm going to die in an airport or
 die jogging without an identification on me i don 't know why i sort of carry that from that memory of the way he died but
 he he was a sort of a nomad at heart
  our existences are really and how full of influence by circumstance
  on
 the
  morning workers
 who come all the time here and enjoy the walking city 's beauty and the atmosphere
 and this is the nicest place of bangladesh
  well actually i 'm here because i 'm the architect 's son
  never saw it finished
  like ours in thirty fifty years back  it was nothing  only paddy fields  
 and since we invited him here  he felt that he has got a responsibility  
 he wanted to be a moses here  he gave us democracy
 he is not a political man  but in this guise he has given us the institution for democracy  from where we can
  he didn 't care for how much money this country has or whether he would be able to
 ever finish this building  but somehow he has been able to do it build it here and this is the largest project he has got in here the poorest country in the world nk 
 it cost him his life sw 
 yeah
  he paid  he paid his life for this and that is why he is great
  but he was also human  now his failure
 to satisfy
 the family life is an inevitable association of great people but i think his son will understand this and will have no sense of
 grudge  or sense of being neglected i
 think he cared in a very different manner but it takes a lot of time to understand that in social
 aspect of his life he was just like a child he was not at all matured
  he could not say no to anything  and that is why that he cannot say no to things we got this building today 
 you see only that way you can be able to understand him 
 there is no other shortcut  no other way to really understand him but i think
 he has given us this building
  we feel all the time for him that 's why he has given love for us
 he could not probably give the right kind of love for you but for us he has given the people the right kind of love that is important you
 have to understand that he had an enormous amount of love  he loved everybody to love
  he sometimes did not see the very closest ones and that is inevitable for men of his stature
