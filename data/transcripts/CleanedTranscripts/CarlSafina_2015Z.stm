  have you ever wondered what animals think and feel let 's start with a question 
 does my dog really love me or does she just want a treat 
 well  it 's easy to see
 that our dog really loves us
  easy to see right what 's going on
 in that fuzzy little head what is going on 
 something 's going on but why is the question always
 do they love us why is it always about us why are we such
  i found a different question to ask animals 
 who are you 
 there are capacities of the human mind that we tend to think are capacities
 only of the human mind but is that true what are other beings doing
  are they thinking and feeling is there a way to know i think there is a way in  i think there are several ways in we can look at evolution  
 we can look at their brains and we can watch what they do the
 first thing to remember is our brain is inherited the first neurons
 came from jellyfish 
 jellyfish gave rise to the first chordates the first chordates gave rise to the first vertebrates the vertebrates came out of the sea and here we are  
 but it 's still true
 that a neuron a nerve cell looks the same in a crayfish a bird
 or you what does that say about the minds of crayfish can we tell anything about
  that well it turns out that
 if you give a crayfish a lot of little tiny electric shocks every time it tries to come out of its burrow it will develop anxiety  
 if you give the crayfish the same drug
 used to treat anxiety disorder in humans  it relaxes and comes out and explores 
 how do we show
  how much we care about crayfish anxiety  mostly we boil them 
 octopuses use tools as well as do most apes
 and they recognize human faces how do we celebrate the ape like intelligence of this invertebrate
  if a grouper chases a fish into a crevice in the coral it will sometimes go to where it knows a moray eel is sleeping
 and it will signal to the moray follow me and the moray will understand that signal 
 the moray may go into the crevice and get the fish but the fish may bolt and the grouper may get
  this is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about 
 how do we celebrate that ancient partnership  mostly fried 
 a pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us
 than it does about them sea otters use tools
 and they take time away from what they 're doing to show their babies what to do which is called teaching
 don 't teach killer whales teach and killer whales share food  
 when evolution makes something new it uses the parts it has in stock 
 off the shelf  before it fabricates a new twist and our brain has come to us through the enormity of the deep sweep of time  
  at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain what you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain it 's a good thing ours is bigger because we 're also really insecure 
 laughter but uh oh there 's a dolphin a bigger brain with more convolutions 
  we see brains but what does that have to say about minds well we can see
 the working of the mind in the logic of behaviors so
 these elephants you can see obviously they are resting  
 they have found a patch of shade under the palm trees under which to let their babies sleep  
 while they doze but remain vigilant  
 we make perfect sense
 of that image just as they make perfect sense of what they 're doing because under the arc of the same sun on the same plains listening to the howls of the same dangers  
 they became who they are and we became who we are 
 we 've been neighbors for a very long time no one would mistake these elephants as being relaxed they 're obviously very concerned
  about something what are they concerned about 
 it turns out that if you record the voices of tourists and you play that recording from a speaker hidden in bushes 
 elephants will ignore it because tourists never bother elephants  but if you record
 the voices of herders who carry spears and often hurt elephants in confrontations
  at water holes  the elephants will bunch up and run away from the hidden speaker 
 not only do elephants know that there are humans  they know that there are different kinds of humans  and that some are ok and some are dangerous  they have been watching us for much longer than we have been watching them
  they know us better than we know them 
 we have the same imperatives take care of our babies find food  try to stay alive  
 whether we 're outfitted for hiking
 in the hills of africa or outfitted for diving under the sea we are basically the same we are kin under the skin  
 the elephant has the same skeleton  the killer whale has the same skeleton as do we
  we see helping where help is needed  we see curiosity in the young  
 we see the bonds of family connections  
 we recognize affection courtship is courtship  
 and then we ask
  when you get general anesthesia it makes you unconscious which means you have no sensation of anything  consciousness is simply the thing that feels like something  
 if you see if you hear if you feel if you 're aware of anything you are conscious  and they are conscious  
 some people say well there are certain things that make humans humans and one of those things is empathy empathy is the
  ability to match moods with your companions 
 it 's a very useful thing if your companions start to move quickly you have to feel like you need to hurry up we 're all in a hurry now  
 the oldest form of empathy is contagious fear  if your companions suddenly startle and fly away  it does not work very
  empathy is old but empathy like everything else in life 
 comes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration so there 's basic empathy 
 you feel sad it makes me sad i see you happy it makes me happy then there 's something that i call sympathy 
  i 'm sorry to hear that your grandmother has just passed away  
 i don 't feel that same grief  but i get it i know what you feel and it concerns me and then if we 're motivated to act on sympathy  i call that compassion 
 far from being
 the thing that makes us human human empathy is far from perfect we round up empathic creatures
  we kill them and we eat them now maybe you say ok well those are different species that 's just predation  and humans are predators  
 but we don 't treat our own kind too well either 
 people who seem to know only one thing about animal behavior know that you must never attribute human thoughts and emotions to other species
  i think that 's silly  because attributing human thoughts and emotions to other species
 is the best first guess about what they 're doing and how they 're feeling  
 because their brains are basically the same as ours  they have the same structures the same hormones that create mood and motivation in us
 are in those brains as well  
  not scientific
 to say that they are hungry when they 're hunting and they 're tired when their tongues are hanging out and then say when they 're playing with their children and acting joyful 
  and happy we have no idea if they can possibly be experiencing anything that is not scientific 
  the hundreds of scientific references that i put in my book and i realized that the answer was right in the room with me  when my dog gets off the rug
 and comes over to me not to the couch to me and she rolls over on her back and exposes her belly 
 she has had the thought i would like my belly rubbed  
 i know that i can go over to carl he will understand
  what i 'm asking  i know i can trust him because we 're family he 'll get the job done and it will feel good 
 she has thought
 and she has felt and it 's really not more complicated than that but we see other animals and we say oh look killer
  they 've known each other for decades  
 they know exactly who they are they know who their friends are they know who their rivals are their life follows the arc of a career  
 they know where they are
  all the time 
 this is an elephant named philo he was a young male this is him four days later 
 humans not only can feel grief  we create an awful lot of it 
 we want to carve
  we wait for them to die 
 elephants once ranged from the shores of the mediterranean sea all the way down to the cape of good hope 
 in one thousand nine hundred and eighty there were vast strongholds of elephant range in central and eastern africa  
 and now their range is shattered into little shards this is the geography of an animal that we are driving to extinction 
 a fellow being the most
  magnificent creature on land 
 of course we take much better care of our wildlife in the united states in yellowstone national park  
 we killed every single wolf  we killed every single wolf south of the canadian border actually but in the park park rangers did that in the 
 and then sixty years later they had to bring them back because the elk numbers had gotten out of control
  and then people came people came by the thousands to see the wolves  the most accessibly visible wolves
 in the world 
 and i went there and i watched this incredible family of wolves a pack is a family it has some breeding adults and the young of several generations  
 and i watched the most famous most stable pack in yellowstone national park
 and then when they wandered just outside the border 
 two of their adults were killed including the mother  which we sometimes call the alpha female 
 the rest of the family immediately descended into sibling rivalry 
 sisters kicked out other sisters that one on the left tried for days to rejoin her family  they wouldn 't let her because they were jealous of
 she was getting too much attention from two new males and she was the precocious one 
 that was too much for them she wound up wandering outside the park and getting shot 
 the alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family as winter was coming in 
 he lost his territory his hunting support 
 the members of his family and his mate
  we cause
 so much pain to them  the mystery is why don 't they hurt us more than they do 
 this whale had just finished eating part of a grey whale with his companions who had killed that whale those people in the boat had nothing at all
  he had just finished tearing a seal into three pieces with two companions  the seal weighed about as much as the people in the boat they had nothing to fear  
 they eat seals  
 why don 't they eat us  
 why can we trust them
 around our toddlers why is it that killer whales have returned to researchers
  lost in thick fog
 and led them miles until the fog parted and the researchers ' home was right there on the shoreline and that 's happened more than one time 
 in the bahamas there 's a woman named denise herzing and she
 studies spotted dolphins and they know her she knows them very well she knows who they all are they know her they recognize the research boat when she shows up
  it 's a big happy reunion except one time showed up and they didn 't want to come near the boat  and that was really strange 
 and they couldn 't figure out what was going on until somebody came out on deck and announced that one of the people onboard had died during a nap in his bunk  
 how could dolphins know that one of the human hearts had
  would they care and why would it spook them these mysterious things just hint at
 all of the things that are going on in the minds that are with us on earth that we
 almost never think about at all at an aquarium in south africa was a little baby
  dolphin named dolly 
 she was nursing  
 and one day a keeper took a cigarette break and he was looking into the window into their pool smoking 
 dolly came over and looked at him 
 went back to her mother  nursed for a minute or two came back to the window
 and released a cloud of milk that enveloped her head like
  dolphin got the idea of using milk to represent smoke when human beings use one thing to represent another we call that
 art 
 the things that make us human are not the things that we think make us human 
 what makes us human is that of all these things that our minds and their minds have we are the most extreme
 we are the most compassionate most violent most creative
 and most destructive animal that has ever been on this planet and we are all of those things all jumbled up together  
 but love is not the thing that makes us human it 's not special to us we are
  not the only ones who care about our mates we are not the only ones who care about our children 
 albatrosses frequently fly six 
 sometimes ten thousand miles over several weeks to deliver one meal one big meal to their chick who is waiting for
  they nest on the most remote islands in the oceans of the world and this is what it looks like 
 passing life from one generation to the next is the chain of being if that stops it all goes away  
 if anything is sacred that is and into that sacred relationship comes our plastic trash all of these birds have plastic in them now  
 this is an albatross six months old
  ready to fledge
 died 
 packed with red cigarette lighters 
 this is not the relationship we are supposed to have with the rest of the world  but we who have named ourselves after our brains 
 never
 think about the consequences when we welcome new human life into the world we welcome
 our babies into the company of other creatures  we paint animals on the walls we don 't paint cell phones we don 't paint work cubicles  we paint animals to show them that we are not alone 
 we have company 
 and every one of those animals in every painting of noah 's ark deemed worthy of salvation is in
  mortal danger now and their flood is us  
 so we started with a question do they love us we
 're going to ask another question are we capable of using what we have
 to care enough to simply let them continue
 thank you very much
