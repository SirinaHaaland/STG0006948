  to start this talk with a question to everyone 
 you know that all over the world  people fight
 for their freedom  fight for their rights  some battle oppressive governments others
 oppressive societies  which battle do you think is harder  allow me to try to answer this question
 in the few coming minutes  let me take you back two years ago
 in my life  it was the bedtime of my son aboody  he was five at the time after finishing his bedtime
  rituals  he looked at me and he asked a question 
 mommy are we bad people i was shocked 
 why do you say such things aboody 
 earlier that day  i noticed some bruises on his face when he came from school  he wouldn 't tell me what happened
  he was ready to tell 
 two boys hit me today in school
  they told me ' we saw your mom on facebook you and your mom should be put in jail '
 i 've never been afraid to tell aboody anything i 've been always a
 proud woman of my achievements  but those questioning eyes of my son
 were my moment of truth when it all came
  together 
 you see  i 'm a saudi woman
 who had been put in jail for driving a car in a country where women are not supposed to drive cars  
 just for giving me his car keys my own brother was detained twice
  and he was harassed to the point he had to quit his job as a geologist  leave the country with his wife and two year old son 
 my father had to sit in a friday sermon listening to the imam condemning condemning women drivers and calling them prostitutes
 amongst tons of worshippers some of them our friends and family of my own father 
 i was faced with an organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rumors shared
  gatherings in the streets and in schools 
 it all hit me  it came into focus that those kids did not mean to be rude to my son  they were just influenced
 by the adults around them and it wasn 't about me and it wasn 't a punishment for taking the wheel
 and driving a few miles  it was a punishment for daring to challenge
 the society 's rules  
 but my story goes beyond this
 moment of truth of mine  allow me to give you a briefing
 about my story  
 it was may two thousand and eleven  and i was complaining to a work colleague about the harassments i had to face trying to find a ride back home  although i have a car and an international driver 's license
 as long as i 've known women in saudi arabia have been always complaining about the ban  but it 's been twenty years since anyone tried to do anything about it 
 a whole generation ago 
 he broke the good bad news in my face 
 but there is no law banning you from driving 
 i looked it up and he was right there wasn 't an actual law in saudi arabia  it was just a custom and traditions that are enshrined
 in rigid
 religious fatwas and imposed on women 
 that realization ignited the idea of june seventeen where we encouraged women to take the wheel and go drive  
 it was a few weeks later  
 we started receiving all these man wolves will rape you if you go and drive a courageous woman her name is najla hariri she 's a saudi woman in the city of jeddah
 she drove a car and she announced but she didn 't record a video 
 we needed proof  
 so i drove i posted a video on youtube 
 and to my surprise  it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day  what happened next of course i started receiving threats
 to be killed raped just to stop this campaign the saudi authorities remained very quiet
 that really creeped us out i was in the campaign with other saudi women and even men activists  
 we wanted to know how the authorities
 respond on the actual day june seventeen when women go out and drive  so this time i asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car it went fast we
 were arrested signed a pledge not to drive again
  arrested again  he was sent to detention for one day  and i was sent to jail  
 i wasn 't sure why i was sent there because i didn 't face any charges in the interrogation  but what i was sure of was my innocence i didn 't break a law  and i kept my abaya
  leaving today 
 outside the jail the whole country went into a frenzy  some attacking me badly  
 and others supportive and even collecting signatures in a petition to be sent to the king to release me  
 i was released after nine days  june seventeen comes
 the streets were packed with police cars and religious police cars
  hundred brave saudi women
 broke the ban and drove that day  none were arrested  we broke the taboo 
 so i think by now  everyone knows that we can 't drive  or women are not allowed to drive in saudi arabia  but maybe few know why
  allow me to help you answer this question there was this
 official study that was presented to the shura council it 's the consultative council appointed by the king in saudi arabia
 and it was done by a local professor a university professor  he claims it 's done based on a unesco study and the
  the percentage of rape adultery  illegitimate children 
 even drug abuse  prostitution in countries where women drive is higher than countries where women don 't drive 
 i know i was like this i was shocked i was like 
 we are the last country in the world where women don 't drive so if you look at the map of the world that only leaves two countries saudi arabia and the other
  society is the rest of the world  we started a hashtag on twitter mocking the study  and it made headlines around the world
  customs that deal with women as if they are inferior
 and they need a guardian to protect them  so they need to take permission from this guardian whether verbal or written all their lives  we are minors until the day we die  
 and it becomes worse when it 's enshrined in religious fatwas based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law or the
  what 's worst when they become codified as laws in the system  
 and when women themselves believe in their inferiority  and they even fight those who try
 to
 question these rules  
 so for me it wasn 't only about these attacks i had to face  it was about living two totally different
 perceptions of my personality
  of my person
 the villain
 back in my home country and the hero outside 
 just to tell you two stories happened in the last two years one of them is when i was in jail  i 'm pretty sure when i was in jail everyone
 saw titles in the international media something like this
 during these nine days i was in jail  but in my home country  it was a totally
  it was more like this manal  al sharif faces charges of disturbing public order
 and
 inciting women to drive i know 
 manal  al sharif withdraws from the campaign ah it 's okay this is my favorite 
 manal  al sharif breaks down and confesses ' foreign forces incited me ' 
 and it goes on
  trial and flogging me in public 
 so it 's a totally different picture  i was asked last year to give a speech at the oslo freedom forum  
 i was surrounded by this love and the support of people around me and they looked at me as an inspiration at the
 same time i flew back to my home country 
 they hated that speech so much  the way they called it a betrayal to the saudi country and the saudi people and they even started a hashtag called # oslotraitor
 on twitter some ten thousand tweets were written in that hashtag  while the opposite hashtag
 there was like a handful of tweets written they even started a poll more than thirteen thousand voters answered this poll  whether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech ninety percent said yes  she 's a traitor  
 so it 's these two totally different perceptions of my personality
 for me i 'm a proud saudi woman and i do love my country and because i love my country  i 'm doing this 
 because i believe a society will not be free if the women of that society are not free
  you learn lessons from these things that happen to you  i learned to be always there 
 the first thing i got out of jail of course after i took a shower i went online  i opened my twitter account and my facebook page  
 and i 've been always very respectful to those people who are opining to me i would listen to what they say and i would never defend myself with words only
  i would use actions when they said i should withdraw from the campaign  i filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate of traffic police for not issuing me a driver 's license 
 there are a lot of people also very big support like those three thousand people who signed the petition to release me
 we sent a petition to the shura council in favor of lifting the ban on saudi women and there were like three thousand five hundred
  believed in that and they signed that petition 
 there were people like that i just showed some examples who are amazing who are believing in women 's rights in saudi arabia and trying  and they are also facing a lot of hate because of speaking up and voicing their views 
 saudi arabia today is taking small steps toward enhancing women 's rights the shura council that 's appointed by the king by royal decree of
 king abdullah last year there were thirty women assigned to that council like twenty percent
  twenty percent of the council 
 the same time finally that council after rejecting our petition four times for women driving they finally accepted it last february 
 after being sent to jail or sentenced lashing or sent to a
  the spokesperson of the traffic police said we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers  
 the grand mufti who is the head of the religious establishment in saudi arabia he said it 's not recommended for women to drive it
 used to be haram forbidden by the previous grand mufti  
 so for me it 's not about only these
  's about women themselves a friend once asked me she said so when do you think this women driving will happen 
 i told her only if women stop asking ' when ' and take action to make it now 
 so it 's not only about the system it 's also about us women to drive our own life i 'd say  
 so i have no clue really how i became an activist
  know how i became one now  
 but all i know and all i 'm sure of in the future when someone asks me my story  i will say i 'm proud
 to be amongst those women who lifted 
  the ban and celebrated everyone 's freedom so
 the question i started my talk with who do you think is more difficult to face oppressive governments or oppressive societies
  hope you find clues to answer that from my speech  thank you everyone
