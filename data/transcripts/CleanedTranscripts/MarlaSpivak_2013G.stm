  this is our life with bees  
 and this is our life without bees 
 bees are the most important pollinators of our fruits and vegetables and flowers and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals more than
  one third of the world 's crop production is dependent on bee pollination but the ironic thing is that bees are not out there pollinating our food
 intentionally they 're out there because they need to eat bees get all of the protein they need in their diet from pollen
 and all of the carbohydrates they need from
  and as they move from flower to flower basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart they end up providing this valuable pollination service 
 in parts of the world where there are no bees  or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees  people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand 
 these people are moving pollen from flower to flower with a paintbrush  
 now this business of hand pollination
  is actually not that uncommon tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers with a hand held vibrator 
 now this one 's the tomato tickler 
 laughter now this is because
 the pollen within a tomato flower is held very securely within the male part of the
  and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it 
 so bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it 
 and they do this by shaking their flight muscles at a frequency similar to the musical note c 
 so they vibrate the flower they sonicate it and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee 's body and she takes it home as food
  growers now put bumblebee colonies inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes because they get much more efficient pollination when it 's done naturally
 and they get better quality tomatoes  
 so there 's other  maybe more personal reasons to care about bees  
 there 's over twenty thousand species of bees in the world and they 're absolutely gorgeous
  these bees spend the majority of their life cycle hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem and very few of these beautiful species have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees 
 now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative for the other 
  species because there 's something about honeybees that draws people into their world humans have been drawn
  to honeybees since early recorded history  mostly to harvest their honey which is an amazing natural sweetener 
 i got drawn into the honeybee world completely by a fluke 
 i was eighteen years old and bored  and i picked up a book in the library on bees and i spent the night reading it 
 i had never thought about insects living in complex societies it was like the best of science fiction come true
 and even stranger 
 there were these people these beekeepers that loved their bees like they were family  and when i put down the book i knew i had to see this for myself so i went to work 
  for a commercial beekeeper a family that owned two thousand hives of bees in new mexico  
 honeybees can be considered a
  colony is the organism and it 's comprised of forty thousand to fifty thousand individual bee organisms  
 now this society has no central authority  nobody 's in charge  so how they come to collective decisions and how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor how they communicate where the flowers are
  all of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing 
 my personal favorite and one that i 've studied for many years is their system of healthcare  so bees have social healthcare
 so in my lab we study how bees keep themselves healthy for example we study hygiene where some bees are able to locate and weed out sick individuals from the nest 
 from the colony and it keeps the colony healthy 
 and more recently
  we 've been studying resins that bees collect from plants so bees fly to some plants and they scrape these very very sticky resins off the leaves  
  and they take them back to the nest where they cement them into the nest architecture where we call it propolis 
  it 's a natural antibiotic it kills off
 bacteria and molds and other germs within the colony and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity  
 humans have known about the power of propolis since biblical times  we 've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies
 for human medicine  but we didn 't know how good it was
  honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses that have kept them healthy and thriving
 for over fifty million years  
 so seven years ago when honeybee colonies were reported to be dying en masse  first in the united states
  it was clear that there was something really really wrong 
 in our collective conscience in a really primal way  we know we can 't afford to lose bees
  so what 's going on 
 bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes  and i 'll go through each of these the bottom line is 
 bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape
 and a dysfunctional food system now we have the best
 data on honeybees so i 'll use them as an example in the united states bees in fact have been in decline since world war ii 
 we have half the number of managed hives in the united states now compared to one thousand nine hundred and forty five we 're down to about two million hives of bees we think 
 and the reason is after world war ii we changed our farming practices  
 we stopped planting cover crops we stopped planting clover and alfalfa
  natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers 
 clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees 
 and after world war ii we started using herbicides to kill off the weeds in our farms 
 many of these weeds are flowering plants that bees require for their survival  
  started growing larger and larger crop monocultures now
 we talk about food deserts  places in our cities neighborhoods that have no grocery stores the very farms
 that used to sustain bees are now agricultural food deserts dominated by one or two plant species like corn and soybeans 
 since world war
  have been systematically eliminating
 many of the flowering plants that bees need for their survival  
 and these monocultures extend even to crops that are good for bees like almonds 
 fifty years ago beekeepers would take a few colonies hives of bees into the almond orchards for pollination
  and also because the pollen in an almond blossom is really high in protein it 's really good for bees
 now the scale of almond monoculture demands that most of our nation 's bees over one point five million hives of bees  
 be transported across the nation to pollinate this one crop 
 and they 're trucked in
  and they must be trucked out because after bloom the almond orchards are a vast and flowerless landscape 
 bees have been dying over the last fifty years and we 're planting more crops that need them 
 there has been a three hundred percent increase in crop production that requires bee pollination 
 and then there 's pesticides  after world war
  we started using pesticides on a large scale and this became necessary because of the monocultures that put out a feast for crop pests  
 recently  researchers from penn state university have started looking at the pesticide residue in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food  
 and they 've found that every batch of pollen that a honeybee
  collects has at least six detectable pesticides in it  
 and this includes every class of insecticides  herbicides  fungicides  and even
 inert and unlabeled ingredients that are part of the pesticide formulation that can be more toxic than the active
  is holding up a large mirror how much is it going to take to contaminate humans 
 one of these class of insecticides the neonicontinoids is making headlines around the world right now you 've probably heard about it 
 this is a new class of insecticides it moves through the plant so that a crop pest
  would take a bite of the plant and get a lethal dose and die 
 if one of these neonics  we call them is applied in a high concentration such as in this ground application  enough of the compound moves 
  through the plant and gets into the pollen and the nectar  where a bee can consume in this case a high dose
  and die in most agricultural settings on most of our farms it 's only the seed
 that 's coated with the insecticide  
 and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and nectar and if a bee consumes this lower dose either nothing happens or the bee becomes intoxicated 
 and disoriented and she may not find her way home  
  parasites public enemy number one for bees is this thing it 's called varroa destructor it 's aptly named  it 's this big  blood sucking parasite
 that compromises the bee 's immune system and circulates viruses  let me put this all together for you 
 i don 't know what it feels like to a bee
  have a big bloodsucking parasite running around on it and i don 't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus  
 but i do know what it feels like when i have a virus the flu  
 and i know how difficult it is for me to get to the grocery store to get good nutrition  
 but what if i lived in a food desert 
 and what if i had to travel a long distance to get to the grocery store  and i finally got my weak body out there
 and i consumed in my food  enough of
  pesticide a neurotoxin that i couldn 't find my way home  and this is what we mean
 by multiple and interacting causes of death  
 and it 's not just our honeybees all of our beautiful wild species of bees are at risk including those 
  bumblebees these bees are providing backup for our honeybees
  the pollination insurance alongside our honeybees  we need all of our bees  so what are we going to do 
 what are we going to do about this big bee bummer that we 've created  it turns out  it 's hopeful it 's hopeful 
 every one of you out there can help
  and don 't contaminate these flowers this bee food with pesticides  so go online
 and search for flowers that are native to your area and plant them plant them in a pot on your doorstep plant them in your front yard in your lawns in your boulevards  campaign to have them planted in public gardens
  spaces meadows  
 set aside farmland  we need a beautiful diversity of flowers that blooms over the entire growing season from spring to fall  
 we need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees but also for migrating butterflies and birds and other wildlife  
 and we need to think carefully about putting back in cover crops
  our soil
 and nourish our bees  
 and we need to diversify our farms  we need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows to disrupt
 the agricultural food desert
 and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system that we 've created  so
 maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure to a big huge
  problem just go plant flowers
 but when bees have access to good nutrition  we have access to good nutrition through their pollination services  
 and when bees have access to good nutrition they 're better able to engage their own natural defenses their healthcare that they have relied on for millions of years
  the beauty of helping bees this way for me is that
 every one of us needs to behave a little bit more like a bee society an insect society 
 where each of our individual actions can contribute to a grand solution an emergent property 
 that 's much greater than the mere sum of our individual actions  
 so
 let the small
  act
 of planting flowers and keeping them free of pesticides
 be the driver of large scale change on behalf of the bees  thank you
  sign of things bottoming out what 's your hope depression level on this maria spivak yeah at least in the united states  an average of thirty percent of all bee hives are lost every winter 
 about twenty years ago we were at a 15 percent loss  so
 it 's getting precarious
  can maintain the same number they can recuperate some of their loss  we 're kind of at a tipping point we can 't really afford to lose that many more 
 we need to be really appreciative of all the beekeepers out there
