  i 'm a creative technologist and the focus of my work is on public installations  
 one of my driving passions is this idea of exploring nature and trying to find hidden
  it seems to me that there is this latent potential everywhere
 all around us everything gives out some kind of data whether it 's sound or smell or vibration 
 through my work i 've been trying to find ways to harness and unveil this 
 and so
 this basically led me to a subject called cymatics  now cymatics is the process of visualizing sound
 by basically vibrating a medium
  such as sand or water as you can see there 
 so  if we have a quick look at the history of cymatics beginning with the observations of resonance by da vinci  galileo the english scientist robert hook and then ernest 
  chladni he created an experiment using a metal plate  covering it with sand and then bowing it
  moving on from this the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called hans jenny in the  1970s he actually coined the term cymatics then bringing us into the present day is a fellow collaborator of mine and cymatics expert  
 john stewart reed he 's kindly recreated for us the chladni experiment 
 what we can see here is the metal sheet this time connected to a sound driver
 and being fed by
 as the frequencies increase  so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate 
 as you can see with your own eyes 
 so 
 what excites me about cymatics well  for me cymatics is an almost magical tool it 's like
 a looking glass into a hidden world
 through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen 
 devices like the cymascope which you can see here have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns and the list of scientific applications is growing every day for 
  example in oceanography a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created by basically visualizing the sonar beams
  that the dolphins emit  and hopefully in the future we 'll be able to gain some deeper understanding of how they communicate 
 we can also use cymatics for healing and education this is an installation developed with school children where their hands are tracked it allows them to control and position cymatic patterns and the reflections that are caused by them 
 we can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form this image here is created from a snippet of beethoven 's ninth
  symphony playing through a cymatic device  so it kind of flips things on its head a little bit this is pink floyd 's machine 
 playing in real time through the cymascope 
 we can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature and we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature  so for example here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature
  then on the right we can see a cymatically created snowflake  and here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish and there is thousands of these  
 so what does this all mean well 
 there is still a lot to explore in its early days and there 's not many people working in this field but consider for a moment that sound does have form we 've seen that it can affect matter
  and cause form within matter then sort of
 take a leap and think about the universe forming and think about the immense sound of the universe forming  and if we
 kind of ponder on that then perhaps cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself
  the substance of things not seen
