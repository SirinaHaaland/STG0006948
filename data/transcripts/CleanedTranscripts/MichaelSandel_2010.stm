  one thing the world needs one thing this country desperately needs
 is a better way of conducting our political debates we need to rediscover the lost
  you think about the arguments we have most of the time it 's shouting matches on cable television ideological food fights on the floor of congress 
 i have a suggestion 
 look at all the arguments we have these days over health care over bonuses and bailouts on wall street
  over the gap between rich and poor over affirmative action and same sex marriage  lying just beneath the surface
 of those arguments with passions raging on all sides are big questions
 of moral philosophy big questions of justice
  but we too rarely
 articulate and defend
 and argue about those big moral questions in our politics so what i would like to do today
 is have something of a discussion first  let me take a famous philosopher
 who wrote about those questions of justice and morality give you a very short lecture
 on aristotle of ancient athens aristotle 's
  theory of justice and then have a discussion here to see whether aristotle 's ideas actually inform
 the way we think and argue about questions today so are you ready for the lecture
  according to aristotle justice means giving people what they deserve
 that 's it that 's the lecture now
 you may say well that 's obvious enough the real questions begin
 when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why 
 take the example of flutes  suppose we 're distributing flutes who should get the best ones  let 's see what
 people what what would you say
 who should get the best
 flute you can just call it out michael sandel 
 at random you would do it by lottery  or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them
  that was aristotle 's answer too 
 but here 's a harder question  why
 do you think those of you who voted this way that the best flutes should go to the best flute players peter the greatest benefit to all ms 
 the greatest benefit to all we 'll hear better music if the best flutes should go to
  the best flute players  that 's peter ms all right  well  
 it 's a good reason we 'll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music  
 but
 peter aristotle doesn 't agree with you that that 's the reason 
  that 's all right  aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players  he said  
 that 's what flutes are for
 to be played well  he says that to reason about just distribution of a thing 
 we have to reason about and sometimes argue about the purpose of the thing or the social activity in this case musical performance
  and the point the essential nature of musical performance is to produce excellent music it 'll be a happy byproduct that
 we 'll all benefit  but
 when we think about justice aristotle says  what we really need to think about is the essential
  nature of the activity in question and
 the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing one of the reasons
 that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy  
 but to honor and recognize
 the excellence of the best musicians  
  flutes may seem the distribution of flutes may seem a
 trivial case  let 's take a contemporary example of the dispute about justice it
 had to do with golf casey martin a few years ago casey martin
 did any of you hear about him he was a very good golfer  but he had a disability he had a bad leg a circulatory
  that made it very painful for him to walk the course in fact it carried risk of injury  
 he asked the pga the professional golfers ' association for permission to use a golf cart
 in the pga tournaments they said no  now that would give you an unfair advantage he sued  
  and his case went all the way to the supreme court believe it or not the case over the golf cart
  because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated  
 provided
 the accommodation does not
 change the essential nature of the activity  
 he says i 'm a great golfer i want to compete  but i need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next
  suppose you were on the supreme court suppose you were deciding the justice of this case
 how many here would say that casey martin does have a right to use a golf cart and how many say no 
 he doesn 't all right let 's take a poll show of hands  how many would rule in favor of casey martin 
  how many would not how many would say he doesn 't  all right we have a good division of opinion here someone who would not
 grant casey martin the right to a golf cart what would be your reason  raise your hand and we 'll try to get you a microphone what would be your reason
  of you i imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worry about an unfair advantage  what about
 those of you who say he should be given a golf cart  how would you answer the objection yes
  to reply tell us charlie  why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart
  who has an answer for charlie  what would you say audience the endurance element is a very important part of the game  
 walking all those holes ms walking all those holes  that 's part of part of the game of golf
  are you a golfer warren i am not a golfer
 in the case in the lower court they brought in golfing greats to testify
 on this very issue 
 is walking the course essential to the game and they brought in jack nicklaus and arnold palmer  and what do you suppose they all said yes
  they agreed with warren  
 they said yes  walking the course is strenuous physical exercise the fatigue factor is an important part of golf  and so it would change the fundamental nature of the game
 to give him the golf cart  now  notice something interesting
 well i should tell you about the supreme court first the supreme court
 decided  what do you suppose they said they said yes
  that casey martin must be provided a golf cart  seven to two they ruled what was interesting about their
 ruling
 and about the discussion we 've just had
 is that the discussion about the right  the justice of the matter depended on
 figuring out what is
 the essential
  nature of golf  
 and the supreme court justices wrestled with that question 
 and justice stevens  writing for the majority said he had read all about the history of golf  
 and
 the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole
  in as few strokes as possible  and that walking was not essential but incidental now there were two dissenters one of whom was justice scalia 
 he wouldn 't have granted the cart 
 and he had a very interesting dissent  it 's interesting because he rejected the aristotelian premise
 underlying the majority 's opinion he said it 's not possible to determine the essential nature
  nature of a game like golf here 's how he put it 
 to say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object 
 but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement 
 that is what distinguishes games from productive activity
 it is quite impossible to say that any of a game 's arbitrary rules is essential 
 so there you have justice scalia taking on the aristotelian premise of the majority 's opinion 
 justice scalia 's opinion is questionable
 for two reasons first
  no real sports fan would talk that way 
 if we had thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary  rather than designed to call forth
 the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring we wouldn 't care about the outcome of the
  objectionable on a second ground on the face of it it seemed to be this debate about the golf cart
 an argument about fairness what 's an unfair advantage  
 but if fairness were the only thing at stake there would have been an easy and obvious solution  
  let everyone
 ride in a golf cart if they want to then the fairness objection goes away  
 but letting everyone ride in a cart would have been i suspect more anathema
 to the golfing greats
 and to the 
 even than making an exception for casey martin  why  because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart
  was not only the essential nature of golf  but relatedly the question what
 abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic
 talents  let me put the point as delicately as possible
  are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game 
 after all there 's no running or jumping  
 and the ball stands still 
 so if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while
  riding around in a golf cart  it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer  the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes
  that illustrates
 that
 with golf as with flutes  it 's hard to decide the question
 of what justice requires without grappling
 with the question what is the essential nature of the activity in question and
 what qualities what excellences
 connected with that activity are worthy of honor and recognition 
 let 's take a final example that 's prominent in contemporary political debate
  are those who favor state recognition
 only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman and there are those who favor state recognition
 of same sex marriage how many here favor the first policy  
 the state should recognize traditional marriage only  
 and how many favor the second
  now put it this way  
 what ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage  
 the opponents of same sex marriage say
 that the purpose of marriage  fundamentally is procreation and that 's what 's worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging  
 and the defenders of
 same sex marriage say no procreation is not the only purpose of marriage  
 what about a lifelong mutual loving commitment that 's really what marriage is about 
 so with flutes with golf carts and even with a fiercely contested question like same sex marriage  
 aristotle has a point very hard to
  about justice without first arguing
 about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition 
 so let 's step back from these cases
 and see how they shed light
 on the way we might
  the terms of political discourse in the united states  and for that matter around the world there is a tendency to think
 that if we engage too directly
 with moral questions in politics that 's a recipe for disagreement  
 and for that matter a recipe for intolerance and coercion so better to shy away from to ignore  the moral and the religious convictions that people bring to civic life
 it seems to me that our discussion reflects the opposite  that a better way
 to mutual respect
 is to engage directly
 with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life rather than to require
 that people leave their deepest moral convictions outside politics before they enter
 that it seems to me is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument  thank you very much
  open education your lecture series was one of the first to do it big what 's your vision for the next phase of this
  i think that it is possible in the classroom 
 we have arguments on some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions 
 and i think we can do that in public life more generally and so my real dream would be to take the the public television series that we 've created of the course it 's available now online free for everyone anywhere in the world
 and to see whether we can partner with institutions
  universities in china in india in africa around the world to try to promote
 civic education
 and also a richer kind of democratic debate ca 
 so you picture at
 some point live in real time you could have this kind of conversation inviting questions but with people from china and india joining in ms right  we did a little bit of it here with
 one thousand five hundred people in long beach  and we do it in a classroom at harvard with about one thousand students wouldn 't it be interesting
 to take this
 way of thinking and arguing 
 engaging seriously with big moral questions 
 exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup students in beijing
  and mumbai and in cambridge massachusetts and create a global classroom that 's what i would love to do
