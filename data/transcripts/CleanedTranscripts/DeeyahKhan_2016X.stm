  when i was a child  i knew i had superpowers 
 that 's right i thought i was absolutely amazing because i could understand
  and relate to the feelings of brown people like my grandfather a conservative muslim guy 
 and also i could understand my afghan mother my pakistani father 
 not so religious but laid back fairly liberal and of course i could understand and relate to the feelings of white people 
 the white norwegians of my country 
 you know white brown whatever i loved them all i understood them all even if they didn 't always understand each
  other they were all my people my father though was always really worried  he kept saying that
 even with the best education i was not going to get a fair shake  i would still face discrimination according to him and that the only way to be accepted by white people would be to become famous 
 now mind you he had this conversation with me when i was seven years old
 so while i 'm seven years old he said look so it 's either got to be sports or it 's got to be music he didn 't know anything about sports bless him
 so it was music  so when i was seven years old he gathered all my toys all my dolls  and he threw them all away 
 in exchange he gave me a crappy little casio keyboard
  and he forced me basically to practice for hours and hours every single day 
 very quickly he also had me performing for larger and larger audiences 
 and bizarrely i became almost a kind of poster child for norwegian multiculturalism  
 i felt very proud of course because
 even the newspapers
  at this point were starting to write nice things about brown people  so i could feel that my superpower was growing 
 so when i was twelve years old  walking home from school i took a little detour because i wanted to buy my favorite sweets called salty feet 
 i know they sound kind of awful
 but i absolutely love them they 're basically these little salty licorice bits
 in the shape of feet  and now that i say it out loud i realize how
 but be that as it may i absolutely love them  so on my way into the store there was this grown white guy in the doorway
 blocking my way so i tried to walk around him  and as i did that he stopped me and he was staring at me 
 and he spit in my face and he said get out of my way you little black bitch you little paki bitch
 go back home where you came from 
 i was absolutely horrified i was staring at him  i was too afraid to wipe the spit off my face 
 even as it was mixing with my tears  i remember looking around hoping that any minute now a grown up is going to come and make
  this guy stop but instead people kept hurrying past me and pretended not to see me  
 i was very confused because i was thinking well 
 my white people come on where are they what 's going on how come they 're not coming and rescuing me 
 so needless to say i didn 't buy the sweets i just ran home as fast as i could 
 things were still ok though  i thought as time went on the more successful i became i eventually started also attracting
  harassment from brown people  some men in my parent 's community felt that it was unacceptable and dishonorable
 for a woman to be involved in music and to be so present in the media  
 so very quickly  i was starting to become attacked
 at my own concerts  i remember one of the concerts  i was onstage i lean
  audience and the last thing i see is a young brown face 
 and the next thing i know is some sort of chemical is thrown in my eyes and i remember i couldn 't really see and my eyes were watering but i kept singing anyway  
 i was spit in the face in the streets of oslo this time by brown men 
 they even tried to kidnap me at one point  the death threats were endless
  remember one older bearded guy stopped me in the street one time and he said the reason i hate you so much is because you make our daughters think they can do whatever they want 
 a younger guy warned me to watch my back he said music is un islamic and the job of whores and if you keep this up you are going to be raped and your stomach will be cut out so that another whore like you will not be born
  again i was so confused i couldn 't understand what was going on my brown people now starting to treat me like this how come 
 instead of bridging the worlds  the two worlds  i felt like i was falling between my two worlds  
 i suppose for me spit was kryptonite 
 so by the time i was seventeen years old  the death threats were endless and the harassment was constant it got
  so bad at one point my mother sat me down and said look we can no longer protect you we can no longer keep you safe so you 're going to have to go 
 so i bought a one way ticket to london  i packed my suitcase
 and i left my biggest heartbreak at that point was that nobody said anything i had a very public exit from norway
  my brown people my white people nobody said anything nobody said hold on this is wrong 
 support this girl protect this girl because she is one of us nobody said that instead i felt like you know at the airport 
 on the baggage carousel you have these different suitcases going around and around and there 's always that one suitcase left at the end  the one that nobody wants
  the one that nobody comes to claim i felt like that i 'd never felt so alone  i 'd never felt so lost 
 so after coming to london  i did eventually resume my music career 
 different place  but unfortunately the same old story  i remember a message sent to me saying that i was going to be killed and that rivers of blood 
  were going to flow and that i was going to be raped many times before i died by this point i have to say i was actually
  getting used to messages like this but what became different
 was that now they started threatening my family  so once again  i packed my suitcase i left music
 and i moved to the us 
 i 'd had enough i didn 't want to have anything to do with this anymore  and i was certainly not going to be killed for something that wasn 't even my dream it was my father 's choice
  so i
 i kind of got lost i kind of fell apart  but i decided that what i wanted to do
 is spend the next however many years of my life supporting young people and to try to be there in some small way  whatever way that i could 
 i started volunteering
 for various organizations that were working with young muslims inside
 inside of europe
 and to my surprise what i found was so many of these young people
 were suffering and struggling 
 they were facing so many problems with their families and their communities who seemed to care more about their honor and their reputation than the happiness and the lives of their own kids 
 i started feeling like maybe i wasn 't so alone maybe i wasn 't so weird
  maybe there are more of my people out there  the thing is what most people don 't understand is that there are
 so many of us growing up in europe who are not free to be ourselves we 're not allowed to be who we are
 we are not free
 to marry or to be in relationships with people that we choose we can 't even pick our own career this is the norm
 in the muslim heartlands of europe  even in the freest societies in the world we 're not free 
 our lives our dreams our future does not belong to us  it belongs to our parents and their community 
 i found endless stories of young people
 who are lost to all
  who are invisible to all of us but who are suffering and they are suffering alone 
 kids we are losing to forced marriages to honor based violence and abuse 
 eventually i realized after several years of working with these young people that i will not be able to keep running   i can 't spend the rest of my life being scared and 
  hiding and that i 'm actually going to have to do something 
  allows abuse like this to continue  
 so i decided that i wanted to put my childhood superpower to some use by trying to make people on the different sides of these issues understand what it 's like to be a young person stuck
 between your family and your country  so i started making films and i
 started telling these stories and i also wanted people to understand the deadly consequences of us not taking these problems seriously 
 so the first film i made was about banaz  
 she was a 17 year old kurdish girl in london  
 she was obedient she did whatever her parents wanted 
 she tried to do everything right  she married some guy that her parents chose for her even though he beat and raped her constantly 
 and when she tried to go to
  her family for help they said well you got to go back and be a better wife 
 because they didn 't want a divorced daughter on their hands because of course that would bring dishonor on the family  
 she was beaten so badly her ears would bleed  
 and when she finally left
 and she found a young man that she chose and she fell in love with the community and the family found out and she disappeared
  she was found three months later she 'd been stuffed into a suitcase and buried underneath the house 
 she had been strangled  she had been beaten to death
 by three men  three cousins on the orders of her father and uncle 
 the added tragedy of banaz 's story is that she had gone to the police in england
  five times asking for help  telling them that she was going to be killed by her family the police didn 't believe her so they didn 't do anything 
 and the problem with this is that not only are so many of our kids facing these problems
 within their families and within their their families ' communities but they 're also
  in the countries that they grow up in 
 when their own families betray them they look to the rest of us 
 and when we don 't understand we lose them  
 so while i was making this film several people said to me well deeyah you know this is just their culture this is just what those people do to their kids and we can 't really interfere 
 i can assure you
 being murdered is not my culture 
 you know and surely people who look like me young women who come from backgrounds like me  should be subject to the same rights the same protections as anybody else in our country why not 
 so for my next film i wanted to try and understand why some of our young muslim kids in europe
 are drawn to extremism and violence  but with that topic i also recognized that i was going to have to face my worst fear  
 the brown men with beards  
 the same men or similar men to the ones that have hounded me for most of my life 
 men that i 've been afraid of most of my life men that i 've also deeply disliked
  for many many years  so i spent the next two years
 interviewing convicted terrorists  jihadis and former extremists 
 what i already knew what
 was very obvious already was that religion  politics europe 's colonial baggage also western foreign policy failures of recent years 
 were all a part of the picture  
 but what i was more interested in
  finding out was what are the human what are the personal reasons why some of our young people are susceptible to groups like this 
 and what really surprised me
 was that i found wounded human beings 
 instead of the monsters that i was looking for that i was hoping to find quite frankly because it would have been very satisfying i found broken people
  just like banaz  i found that these young men were torn apart from trying to bridge the gaps between their families and the countries that they were born in 
 and what i also learned is that extremist groups terrorist groups are taking advantage of these feelings of our young people and channeling that cynically channeling that toward violence come to us
 reject both sides your family and your country because they reject you 
 for your family their honor is more important than you and for your country a real norwegian brit or a french person will always be white and never you they
 're also promising our young people the things that they crave significance
  a sense of belonging and purpose a community that loves and accepts them  
 they make the powerless feel powerful the invisible
 and the silent are finally seen and heard 
 this is what they 're doing for our young people  why are these groups doing this for our young people and not us  
 the thing is i 'm not trying to justify
  or excuse any of the violence 
 what i am trying to say is that we have to understand why some of our young people are attracted to this 
 i would like to also show you actually
 these are childhood photos of some of the guys in the film  what really struck me is that so many of them
 i never would have thought this but so
  many of them have absent or abusive fathers  and several of these young guys ended up finding caring and compassionate
 father figures within these extremist groups 
 i also found men brutalized by racist violence  but who found a way to stop feeling like victims by becoming violent
  in fact i found something to my horror that i recognized  i found the same feelings
 that i felt as a 17 year old as i fled from norway  
 the same confusion  the same sorrow the same
 feeling of being betrayed
 and not belonging to anyone the
 same feeling of being lost and torn between cultures
  said that i did not choose destruction  i chose to pick up a camera instead of a gun and the reason i did that is because of my superpower i could see
 that understanding is the answer instead of violence  seeing human beings with all their virtues and all their flaws instead of continuing 
  the caricatures the us and them the villains and victims i 'd also finally come to terms
  with the fact that
 my two cultures didn 't have to be on a collision course but instead became a space where i found my own voice  
 i stopped feeling like i had to pick a side but this took me many many years 
 there are so many of our young people today who are struggling with these same issues and they 're struggling with this alone  
 and this leaves them open like wounds  and for
  some the worldview of radical islam becomes the infection that festers in these open wounds 
 there 's an african proverb
 that says 
 if the young are not initiated into the village they will burn it down just to feel its warmth 
 i would like to ask
 to muslim parents and muslim communities
 will you love and care for your children without forcing them to meet your expectations can you choose them instead of your honor 
 can you understand why they 're so angry and alienated when you put your honor before their happiness 
 can you try to be a friend to your child so that they can trust you and want to share with you their experiences rather than having to seek it somewhere else 
 and to our
  young people tempted by extremism can you acknowledge that your rage is fueled by pain 
 will you find the strength to resist those cynical old men who want to use your blood for their own profits 
 can you find a way to live 
 can you see that the sweetest revenge is for you to live a happy full and free life a life
  defined by you and nobody else why do you want to become just another dead muslim kid 
 and for the rest of us  when will we start listening to our young people  
 how can we support them in redirecting their pain into something more constructive  they think we don 't like them
  they think we don 't care what happens to them  they think we don 't accept them  can we find a way to make them feel differently 
 what will it take for us to see them and notice them before they become either the victims or the perpetrators of violence can we make ourselves care 
  about them and consider them to be our own and not just be outraged when the victims of violence look like
  can we find a way to reject hatred
 and heal the divisions between us the thing is we cannot afford to give up on each other or on our kids even if they 've given up on us  
 we are all in this together  
 and in the long term  revenge and violence will not work against extremists  
 terrorists want us to huddle in our houses in fear  closing our doors and our hearts they want us to tear open more wounds in our societies
 so that they can use them to spread their infection more widely  they want us to become like them  intolerant hateful and cruel 
 the day after the paris attacks a friend of mine sent
 this photo of her daughter this is a white girl and an arab girl
  they 're best friends this image is the kryptonite for extremists 
 these two little girls with their superpowers are showing the way forward towards a society that we need to build
 together a society that includes and supports  rather than rejects our kids
 thank you for listening
