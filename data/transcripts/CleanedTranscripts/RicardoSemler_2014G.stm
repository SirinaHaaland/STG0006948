  on mondays and thursdays  i learn how to die  i call them my terminal days my wife fernanda doesn 't like the term but
 a lot of people in my family died of melanoma cancer and my parents and grandparents had it and i
  kept thinking one day i could be sitting in front of a doctor who looks at my exams and says ricardo things don 't look very good you have six months or a year to live 
 and you start thinking about what you would do with this time and you say i 'm going to spend more time with the kids i 'm going to visit these places i 'm going to go up and down mountains and places and i 'm going to
 do all the things i didn 't do when i had the time but of course
  we all know these are very bittersweet
 memories we 're going to have it 's very difficult to do you spend a good part of the time crying probably  
 so i said i 'm going to do something else  
 every monday and thursday  i 'm going use my terminal days and i will do during those days  whatever it is i was going to do
  think about
 the opposite of work we many times think it 's leisure and you say ah
 i need some leisure time and so forth but the fact is that leisure is a very busy thing 
 you go play golf and tennis and you meet people and you 're going for lunch and you 're late for the
  it 's a very crowded thing that we do the opposite of work
 is idleness  but very few of us know what to do with idleness when you look at the way that we distribute our lives in general  
 you realize
 that in the periods in which we have a lot of money we have very little time 
 and then when we finally have time  we have neither the money nor the health  
 so we started thinking about that as a company for the last thirty years
  this is a complicated company with thousands of employees hundreds of millions of dollars of business that makes
 rocket fuel propellent systems  runs four thousand atms in brazil does income tax preparation for
 dozens of thousands so this is not
 a simple business we looked at it and we
  let 's devolve to these people let 's give these people
 a company where we take away all the boarding school aspects of this is when you arrive this is how you dress this is how you go to meetings this is what you say this is what you don 't say and let 's see what 's left  
 so we started this about thirty years ago and we started dealing with this very issue  and so we said look  the retirement the whole issue of how we distribute our graph
  instead of going mountain climbing when you 're eighty two why don 't you do it next week and we 'll do it like this we 'll sell you back your wednesdays for ten percent of your salary  
 so now if you were going to be a violinist which you probably weren 't you go and do this on wednesday
  and what we found we thought 
 these are the older people who are going to be really interested in this program and the average age of the first people who adhered were twenty nine of course  and so
  started looking and we said we have to do things in a different way so we started saying things like  
 why do we want to know what time you came to work what time you left etc can 't we exchange this for a contract for buying something from you some kind of work  
 why are we building these headquarters is it not an ego issue that we want to look solid and big and important
  but we 're dragging you two hours across town because of it so we started asking questions one by one we
 'd say it like this one  
 how do we find people we 'd go out and
 try and recruit people and we 'd say look when you come to us we 're not going to have two or three interviews and then you 're going to be married to us for life that 's not how we do the rest of our lives so 
 come have your interviews
  anyone who 's interested in interviewing you will show up 
 and then we 'll see what happens out of the intuition that rises from that instead of just filling out the little items of whether you 're the right person and then come back 
 spend an afternoon spend a whole day talk to anybody you want make sure we are the bride you thought we were and not all the bullshit we put into our own ads 
 slowly we went to a process where we 'd say things like  we don 't want anyone to be a leader
 in the company if they haven 't been interviewed and approved by their future subordinates 
 every six months  everyone gets evaluated anonymously as a leader 
 and this determines whether they should continue in that leadership position which is many times situational as you know  
 and so if they don 't have seventy eighty percent of a grade 
 they don 't stay
  probably the reason why i haven 't been ceo for more than ten years  and
 over time  we started asking other questions we said things like why
 can 't people set their own salaries  what do they need to know 
 there 's only three things you need to know how much people make inside the company  how much people make somewhere else
  in a similar business
 and how much we make in general to see whether we can afford it so let 's give people these three pieces of information  so we started having in the cafeteria 
 a computer where you could go in and you could ask what someone spent  how much someone makes  what they make in benefits  what the company makes  what the margins are  and so forth  
 and this is twenty five years ago 
 as this information started coming to people  we said things like  we don 't want to see your expense report  we don 't want to know how many holidays
  're taking  we don 't want to know where you work we had at one point fourteen different offices around town and we 'd say  go to the one that 's closest to your house to the customer that you 're going to visit today 
 don 't tell us where you are 
 and more even when we had thousands of people five thousand people  we had two people in the h r department  and thankfully one of them has retired
 the question we were asking was 
 how can we be taking care of people people are the only thing we have we can 't have a department that runs after people and looks after people  
 so as we started finding that this worked and we 'd say we 're looking for and this is i think  the main thing i was looking for in the terminal days and in the company which is 
 how do you set up for wisdom  we 've come from an age
  of revolution industrial revolution an age of information an age of knowledge  but we 're not any closer to the age of wisdom  
 how we design how do we organize for more wisdom  
 so for example many times  what 's the smartest or the intelligent decision doesn 't jive  so we 'd say things like  
 's agree that you 're going to sell fifty seven widgets per week  
 if you sell them by wednesday  please go to the beach 
 don 't create a problem for us for manufacturing for application then we have to buy new companies we have to buy our competitors we have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many widgets so go to the beach and start again on monday 
 applause so the process is looking for wisdom
  in the process of course we wanted people to know everything and we wanted to be truly democratic about the way we ran things so our board
 had two seats open
 with the same voting rights for the first two people who showed up and so we had cleaning ladies
 voting on a board
 meeting which had a lot of other very important people in suits and ties  and the fact is that they kept us honest  this process
  we started looking at the people who came to us we 'd say  now wait a second people come to us and they say  where am i supposed to sit how am i supposed to work where am i going to be in five years ' time 
 and we looked at that and we said we have to start much earlier where do we start we said oh kindergarten seems like a good place  so
 we set up a foundation which now has for eleven
  three schools 
 where we started asking the same questions how do you redesign school for wisdom it
 is one thing to say  we need to recycle the teachers we need the directors to do more  but the fact is that
 what we do with education is entirely obsolete  the teacher 's role is entirely obsolete going from a math class to biology to
  we started thinking  what could it look like  and we put together
 people including people who like education people like
 paulo freire  and two ministers of education in brazil and we said if we were to design a school from scratch what would it look like and so we created this school which is called
 lumiar and
  one of them is a public school and lumiar says the following let 's divide this role of the teacher into two 
 one guy we 'll call a tutor a tutor in the old sense of the greek 
  the kid
 what 's happening at home  what 's their moment in life  etc  but please don 't teach because the little you know compared to google we don 't want to know keep that to yourself
  passion and expertise  and it could be their profession or not 
 and we use the senior citizens who are twenty five percent of the population with wisdom that nobody wants anymore  so we bring them to school
 and we say  teach these kids whatever you really believe in so we have violinists teaching math we
  kinds of things where we say  
 don 't worry about the course material anymore we have approximately ten great threads that go from two to seventeen things like  
 how do we measure ourselves
 as humans  so there 's a place for math and physics and all that there  
 how do we express ourselves  so there 's a place for music and literature etc but also for grammar 
 and then we have things that everyone has forgotten  which are probably the most important things in life  the very
  important things in life  we know nothing about we know nothing about love  we know nothing about death we know nothing about why we 're here  
 so we need a thread in school that talks about everything we don 't know  
 so that 's a big part of what we do 
  we started going into other things we 'd say why do we have to scold the kids and say sit down and come here and do that and so forth we said  let 's get the kids to do something we call a circle which meets once a week  
 and we 'd say you put the rules together and then you decide what you want to do with it so can you all hit yourself on the head sure for a week try 
 they came up with the very same rules that we had except they 're theirs  and then they have
  power  which means they can and do suspend and expel kids so that
  not playing school they really decide and then in this same
 vein we keep a digital mosaic  because this is not constructivist or montessori
  or something it 's something where we keep the brazilian curriculum
 with six hundred tiles of a mosaic which we want to expose these kids to by the time they 're seventeen 
 and follow this all the time and we know how they 're doing and we say  you 're not interested in this now let 's wait a year  
 and the kids are in groups that don 't have an age category so the six year old kid who is ready for that with an 11 year old that eliminates all of the gangs and the groups and this stuff that we have in the schools
  general  and they have a zero to one hundred percent grading which they do themselves with an app every couple of hours until we know 
  thirty seven percent of the way we 'd like them to be on this issue so that we can send them out in the world with them knowing enough about it and so
 the the courses are
 world cup soccer or building a bicycle and people will sign up for a
  building a bicycle now try to build a bicycle without knowing that pi is three point 
  can 't and try any one of you using three point one four one six for something  
 you don 't know anymore  so this is lost and that 's what we try to do there which is
 looking for wisdom in that school and that brings us back to this graph and this distribution of our life  i accumulated a
  lot of money when i think about
 it when you think and you say  now is the time to give back well if you 're giving back you took too much 
 i keep thinking of warren buffet waking up one day and finding out he has thirty billion dollars more than he thought he had and he looks
  this and he says i 'll give it to someone who really needs this i 'll give it to bill gates 
 and
 my guy who 's my financial advisor in new york he says  look you 're a silly guy because you would have four point one times more money today if you had made money with money instead of sharing as you go 
  i taught
 mbas at mit for a time and i ended up one day at the mount auburn cemetery it is a beautiful cemetery in cambridge and i was walking around it was my birthday and i was thinking  
 and the first time around i saw these tombstones and these wonderful people who 'd
 done great things and i thought what do i want to be remembered for
  and i did another stroll around and the second time another question came to me which did did me better which was why do i want to be remembered at all 
 and that i think took me different places 
 when i was fifty my wife fernanda and i sat for a whole afternoon  we had a big pit
 with fire  and i threw everything i had ever done into that fire  this
  hundreds and hundreds of articles and dvds everything there was 
 and that did two things one it freed our five kids from following in our steps our shadow they don 't know what i do which is good and
 i 'm not going to take them somewhere and say  one day all of this will be yours the five kids know nothing  which is good
  and the second thing is i freed myself from this anchor of past achievement or whatever  i 'm free to start something new every time and to decide things from scratch in part of those terminal days 
 and some people would say oh so now you have this time these terminal days and so you go out and do everything no 
 we 've been to the beaches so we 've been to samoa and maldives and mozambique so that 's
  i 've climbed mountains in the himalayas i 've gone down sixty meters to see hammerhead sharks  i 've spent fifty nine days on the back of a camel from chad to timbuktu i 've gone to the magnetic north pole on a dog sled
  so we 've been busy
 'm not retired  i don 't feel retired at all and so i 'm writing a new book we started three new companies in the last
 two years  i 'm now working on getting this school system
 for free out into the world and i 've found very interestingly enough that nobody wants it for free  and so i 've been trying for ten years to get the public system
  to take over this school rationale much as the public schools we have which has instead of forty three out of one hundred 
 as their rating  as their grades has ninety one out of one hundred  
 but for free nobody wants it so maybe we 'll start charging for it and then it will go somewhere  
 but getting this out is is one of the things we want to do  and i think what this leaves us as a message for all of you i think is a little bit like this 
 we 've all learned how to go on sunday night to
 email and work from home  but very few of us have learned how to go to the movies on monday afternoon  
 and if we 're looking for wisdom we need to learn to do that as well  
 and so  what we 've done all of these years is very simple is use the little tool  which is ask three whys in a row  because the first why you always have a good answer for the second why it
 starts getting difficult by the third why you don 't
  really know why you 're doing what you 're doing what i want to leave you with is the seed and the thought
 that maybe if you do this  you will come to the question what for  
 what am i doing this for and hopefully  as a result of that and over time
 i hope that with this and that 's what i 'm wishing you you 'll have a
  and yet so
 deeply wise also the pieces i 'm trying to put together are this  
 your ideas are so radical how in business for example these ideas have been out for a while 
 probably the percentage of businesses that have taken some of them is still quite low are there any times you 've seen some big company take on one of your ideas and you 've gone
  branson with his people saying oh i don 't want to control your holidays anymore  or netflix does a little bit of this and that but
 i don 't think it 's very important i 'd like to see it happen maybe a little bit in a bit of a missionary zeal  but that 's a very personal one  but the fact is that it takes a leap of faith
 about losing control and almost nobody who is in control is ready to take leaps of faith it will have to come from kids and other people who are starting companies
  in a different way ca 
 so that 's the key thing from your point of view the evidence is there in the business point of view this works but people just don 't have the courage to rs they don 't even have the incentive
 you 're running a a company with a 90 day mandate  it 's a quarterly report if you 're not good in ninety days you 're out so you say here 's a great program that in less than one generation and the guy says get out of here
  is the problem 
 what you 're trying to do in education seems to me incredibly profound everyone
 is bothered about their country 's education system  no one thinks that we 've caught up yet to a world where there 's google and all these technological options  so you 've got actual evidence now that the kids so far going through your system there 's a dramatic increase
  in performance  how do we help you move these ideas forward 
 rs i think it 's that problem of ideas whose time has come and  i 've never been very evangelical about these things we put it out there  
 suddenly you find people there 's a group in japan which scares me very much which is called the 
  they 've invited me i 've always been scared to go
 and there is a group in holland that has six hundred small  dutch companies 
 it 's something that will flourish on its own part of it will be wrong  and it doesn 't matter this will find its own place and i 'm afraid of the other one which says 
  this is so good you 've got to do this let 's set up a system and put lots of money into it and then people will
  you have asked extraordinary questions your whole life it seems to me that 's the fuel that 's driven a lot of this 
 do you have any other questions for for us for ted for this group here rs 
 i always come back to variations of
 the question that my my son asked me when he was three we were sitting in a jacuzzi and he said dad why do
  there is no other question nobody has any other question we have variations of this one question from three onwards  so
 when you spend time in a company in a bureaucracy in an organization and you 're saying boy how many people do you know who on their death beds said boy i wish i had spent more time at the office so there 's a whole thing of
 having the courage
  not in a week not in two months not when you find out you have something
 to say 
 no what am i doing this for stop everything  let me do something else and it will be okay it will be much better than what you 're doing if you 're stuck in a process ca 
 so that strikes me as a profound and quite beautiful way to end this penultimate day of ted ricardo semler
