  our world has many superheroes  
 but they have the worst of all superpowers invisibility 
 for example the catadores workers who collect recyclable materials for a living
  from social inequality  unemployment  and the abundance of solid waste
 from the deficiency of the waste collection system catadores provide a heavy  honest
 and and essential work that benefits the entire population  but they are not acknowledged for it 
 here in brazil  they collect ninety percent
 of all the waste that 's actually recycled  
 most of the  catadores work independently  
 picking waste from the streets and selling to junk yards at very low prices 
 they may collect over three hundred kilos in their bags  shopping carts 
 bicycles and
  are carts built from wood or metal and found in several streets in brazil  much like graffiti and street art 
 and this is how i first met these marginalized superheroes  
 i am a graffiti artist and activist and my art is social  environmental and political in nature 
 in two thousand and seven  i took my work beyond walls and onto the carroas as a new urban support for
  my message  but at this time  giving voice to the catadores by adding art
 and humor to the cause it became more appealing  which helped call attention to the catadores
 and improve their self esteem and also they are famous now on the streets on mass media and social
  the thing is 
 i plunged into this universe and have not stopped working since 
 i have painted over two hundred carroas in many cities and have been invited to do exhibitions and trips worldwide  
 and then i realized
 that catadores in their invisibility are not exclusive to brazil  i met them in argentina
  and even in developed countries such as the united states and japan  
 and this was when i realized that i needed to have more people join the cause because it 's a big challenge  
 and then i created a collaborative movement called pimp my
  therapists and much more but
  they also receive safety shirts  gloves raincoats and eyeglasses to see in high definition the city while their 
 are renovated by our incredible volunteers and then they receive safety items too reflective tapes  horns and mirrors then finally painted by 
  a street artist and become part of part of this huge amazing mobile art exhibition 
 but to meet the demand in other cities including outside of brazil  we have created pimpx which is
 inspired by tedx and it 's a simplified
  crowdfunded edition of pimp my carroa so now everybody can join in two years
  eight hundred volunteers
 and two hundred street artists and more than one thousand donors have been involved in the pimp my carroa movement 
 whose actions have even been used in teaching recycling at a local school 
 so catadores are leaving invisibility behind
 and becoming increasingly respected and valued because of their pimped carroas they are able to fight back to prejudice
 increase their income and their interaction with society
