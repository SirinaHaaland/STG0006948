  to take a look at this baby  
 what you 're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch  but today i 'm going to talk to you about something you can 't see what 's going
  up in that little brain of hers  
 the modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what 's going on up there is nothing short of rocket science  
 and what we 're learning
 is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers and poets described as the celestial openness of the child 's mind
  what we see here is a mother in india  and she 's speaking koro which is a newly
  discovered language and she 's talking to her baby 
 what this mother and the eight hundred people who speak koro in the world understands is that to preserve this language they need to speak it to the babies 
 and therein lies a critical puzzle why is it that you can 't preserve a language by speaking to you and i to the adults  
 what we see here is that language has a critical period for learning  
 the way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis and you
 'll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language  
 the babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven  and then there 's a systematic decline after puberty we fall off the map
  no scientists dispute this curve  but laboratories all over the world are trying to figure out why it works this way 
 work in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development and that is the period in which babies try to master which sounds are used in their language 
 we think by studying how the sounds are learned we 'll have a model for the rest of language and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood for
  social emotional and cognitive development  
 so we 've been studying the babies using a technique that we 're using all over the world and the sounds of all languages  the baby sits on a parent 's lap  and we train them to turn their heads 
  when a sound changes like from ah to ee if they do so at the appropriate time the black box lights up and a panda bear
  what have we learned  well babies all over the world are what i like to describe as citizens of the world 
 they can discriminate all the sounds of all languages no matter what country we 're testing and what language we 're using 
 and that 's remarkable because you and i can 't do that 
  listeners we can discriminate the sounds of our own language
  but not those of foreign languages  
 so the question arises when do those citizens of the world turn into the language bound listeners that we are and the answer  before their first birthdays  
 what you see here is performance on that head turn task for babies tested in tokyo and the united states here in seattle 
 as they listened to ra and la sounds important to english but not to japanese 
 so at six to eight months the babies are
  totally equivalent 
 two months later something incredible occurs the babies in the united states are getting a lot better babies in japan are getting a lot worse but both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language that they are going to learn  
 so the question is what 's happening
 during this critical two month period this is the critical period for sound development but what 's going on up there 
 so there are two things going on the first is that the babies are listening intently to us and they 're taking statistics as they listen to
  us talk they 're taking statistics  so listen to two mothers speaking motherese the universal language we use when we talk to kids first in english and then in japanese
  production of speech when babies listen what they 're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear  
 and those distributions grow  and what we 've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics and the statistics of japanese and english are very very different 
 english has a lot of rs and ls the distribution shows and the
 of japanese is totally different where we see a group of intermediate sounds which is known as the japanese r 
 so babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains it changes them from the citizens of the world to the
  culture bound listeners that we are but we as adults are no
  those statistics we are governed by the representations in memory that were formed early in development  
 so what we 're seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about we 're arguing from a mathematical standpoint that the learning of language material may slow down when our distributions stabilize it
 's raising lots of questions about bilingual people  bilinguals must keep two sets of statistics in mind at once and flip between
  them  one after the other depending on who they 're speaking to so we asked ourselves can the babies take statistics on a brand new language 
 and we tested this by exposing american babies who 'd never heard a second language to mandarin for the first time during the critical period  
 we knew that when monolinguals were tested in taipei and seattle on the mandarin sounds they showed the same pattern six to eight months they 're totally equivalent
  months later something incredible happens but the taiwanese babies are getting better not the american babies what we did was expose american babies during this period 
 to mandarin it was like having mandarin relatives come and visit for a month and move into your house and talk to the babies for twelve sessions here 's
 what it looked like in the laboratory
  so what have we done to their little brains 
  we had to run a control group to make sure that coming into the laboratory didn 't improve your mandarin skills so a group of babies came in and listened to english and we can see from the graph that exposure 
  to english didn 't improve their mandarin but look at what happened to the babies exposed to mandarin for twelve sessions they were as good as the babies in taiwan who 'd been listening for ten 
  and a half months what it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language whatever you put in front of them they 'll take statistics on
  but we wondered what role the human being played in this
 learning exercise  so we ran another group of babies in which the kids
 got the same dosage the same twelve sessions but over a television set 
 and another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen  what did we do to their
  what you see here is the audio result no learning whatsoever and the video result
 no learning whatsoever it takes a human being for babies to take their statistics 
 the social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics we want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening as babies are in front of televisions
  as opposed to in front of human beings thankfully  we have a new machine magnetoencephalography 
 that allows us to do this it looks like a hair dryer from mars  but it 's completely safe completely noninvasive and silent
 we 're looking at millimeter accuracy with regard to spatial and millisecond accuracy
 using three hundred and six squids these are superconducting
  quantum interference devices
 to pick up the magnetic fields that change as we do our thinking we 're the first in the world to record
 babies in an meg machine while they are learning so this is little emma 
 she 's a six monther and she 's listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears you can see she can move around
  we 're tracking her head with little pellets in a cap so she 's free to move completely unconstrained  it 's a technical tour de force what are we seeing 
 we 're seeing the baby brain as the baby hears a word in her language the auditory areas light up and then subsequently areas surrounding it that we think 
 are related to coherence getting the brain coordinated with its different areas and causality one brain area causing another to activate
 we are embarking
 on a grand and golden age of knowledge about child 's brain development  we 're going to be able to see a child 's brain as they experience an emotion 
 as they learn to speak and read as they solve a math problem as they have an idea  and we 're going to be able to invent brain based interventions for children who have difficulty learning
  as the poets and writers described  we 're going to be able to see i think that wondrous openness  utter and complete openness of the mind of a child 
 in investigating the child 's brain  we 're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human 
 and in the process we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives  thank you
