  i want to tell you about the future of money  let 's start with a story about this culture that lived in micronesia in the early 
 called the yap now i want to tell you about the yap
  their form of money is really interesting they use these limestone discs called rai stones  now the yap don 't actually move these rai stones around or exchange 
  them the way we do with our coins because rai stones can get to be pretty massive  
  there 's a story about these sailors that were transporting a stone across the ocean when they ran into some trouble and the stone actually fell in
  the sailors got back to the main island and they told everyone what had happened  and everyone decided that actually yes  the sailors had the stone and
 why not it still counted even though it was at the bottom of the ocean
  it was still part of the yap economy
 you might think that this was just a small culture
 a hundred years ago but things like this happen in the western world as well  and the yap actually still use a form of these stones 
 in one thousand nine hundred and thirty two the bank of france asked the united states to convert their holdings from dollars into gold  
 but it was too inconvenient to think about actually shipping all of that gold over to europe  so instead
  someone went to where that gold was being stored and they just labeled it as belonging to france now 
 and everyone agreed that france owned the gold  it 's just like those rai stones  
 the point i want to make with these two examples is that
 there 's nothing inherently valuable about a dollar or a stone or a coin  the only reason these things
  have any value is because we 've all decided they should  and because we 've decided that they do 
 money is about the exchanges and the transactions that we have with each other 
 money isn 't anything objective  it 's about a collective story that we tell each
  other about value a collective fiction and that 's a really powerful concept 
 in the past two decades we 've begun to use digital money 
 so i get paid via direct deposit 
 i pay my rent via bank transfer i pay my taxes online and every month a small amount of money is deducted from my paycheck and invested in mutual funds in my
  retirement account 
 all of these interactions are literally just changing one 's and zero 's on computers  there 's not even anything physical like a stone or a coin 
 digital money makes it so that i can pay someone around the world in seconds  
 now when this works  it 's because there are large institutions underwriting every one or zero that changes on a computer 
 and when it doesn 't it 's often the fault of those large
  institutions or at least  it 's up to them to fix the problem and a lot of times they don 't there 's a lot of friction in the system 
 how long did it take the us credit card companies to implement chip and pin  half my credit cards still don 't work in europe 
 that 's friction 
 transferring money across borders and across currencies is really expensive
  friction 
 an entrepreneur in india can set up an online business in minutes  but it 's hard for her to get loans and to get paid 
 friction 
 our access to digital money and our ability to freely transact is being held captive by
  these gatekeepers and there 's a lot of impediments in the system slowing things down 
 that 's because digital money isn 't really mine  it 's entries in databases that belong to my bank my credit card company or my investment firm  
 and these companies have the right to say no 
 if i 'm a paypal merchant and paypal wrongly flags me for fraud that 's it my account gets frozen
 i can 't get paid 
 these institutions are standing in the way of innovation  
 how many of you use facebook photos  google photos  instagram 
 my photos are everywhere  they are on my phone  they 're on my laptop they 're on my old phone they 're in dropbox  they 're on all these different websites
  and services and most of these services don 't work together  they don 't inter operate 
 and as a result my photo library is a mess
  the same thing happens when institutions control the money supply a lot of these services
  and as a result this blocks what we can do with payment  and it makes transaction costs go up 
 so far we 've been through two phases of money 
 in an analog world we had to deal with these physical objects and money moved at a certain speed
 the speed of humans in a digital world money can reach much farther
  at the mercy of these gatekeeper institutions money only moves at the speed of banks we
 're about to enter a new phase of money  the future of money is programmable 
 when we combine software and currency 
 money becomes more than just a static unit of value  and we don 't have to rely on institutions for security 
 in a programmable world we
  remove humans and institutions from the loop  and when this happens we won 't even feel like we 're transacting anymore 
 money will be directed by software and it will just safely and securely flow
 are the first step of this evolution
  are digital money that isn 't run by any government or bank  it 's money designed to work in a world without intermediaries 
 bitcoin is the most ubiquitous 
 but there are hundreds of them there 's
  stellar dogecoin and those are just a few of the more popular ones  
 and these things are real money  the sushi restaurant down my street takes bitcoin i have an app on my phone that
  i can use to buy sashimi  
 but it 's not just for small transactions in march there was a transaction that moved around one hundred thousand bitcoins 
 that 's the equivalent of forty million us dollars 
 are based on a special field of mathematics called cryptography
  cryptography is the study of how to secure communication  and it 's about two really important things  masking information so it can be hidden in plain sight  
 and verifying a piece of information 's source  
 cryptography underpins so many of the systems around us and it 's so powerful that at times the us government has actually classified it as a
  was critical to decoding enemy transmissions and turning the tide of the war 
 today  anyone with a modern web browser is running a pretty sophisticated cryptosystem 
 it 's what we use to secure our interactions on the internet 
 it 's what makes it safe for us to type our passwords in and to send financial information to websites 
 so what the banks used to give
  us
 trustworthy digital money transfer we can now get with a clever application of cryptography  
 and this means that we don 't have to rely on the banks anymore to secure our transactions we can do it ourselves 
 bitcoin is based on the very same idea that the yap used this collective global knowledge of transfers
  bitcoin i spend by transferring bitcoin  and i get paid when someone transfers bitcoin to me  
 imagine that we had this magic paper 
 so the way that this paper works is i can give you a sheet of it and if you write something on it it will magically appear on my piece as well 
  let 's say we just give everyone this paper
 and everyone writes down the transfers that they 're doing in the bitcoin system 
 all of these transfers get copied around to everyone else 's pieces of paper 
 and i can look at mine and i 'll have a list of all of the transfers that are happening in the entire bitcoin economy 
 this is actually what 's happening with the bitcoin blockchain which is a list of all of the transactions in bitcoin
  it 's not done through paper  it 's done through computer code running on thousands of networked computers around the world 
 all of these computers are collectively confirming who owns what bitcoin 
 so the bitcoin blockchain is core to how bitcoin works but where do bitcoins
  the code is designed to create new bitcoin according to a schedule 
 and the way that it works is that to get those bitcoin i have to solve a puzzle
 a random cryptographic puzzle  
 imagine that we had fifteen dice and we were throwing these dice over and over again 
 whenever the dice come up all sixes  we say that we win 
 this is very close to what these computers are all
  actually doing  they 're trying over and over again to land on the right number  and when they do  we say that they 've solved the puzzle 
 the computer that solves the puzzle
 publishes its solution to the rest of the network and collects its reward new bitcoins  and in the act of solving
  these computers are actually helping to secure the bitcoin blockchain and add to the list of transactions 
  there are actually people all over the world running this software and we call them bitcoin miners  
 anyone can become a bitcoin miner you can go download the software right now and run it in your computer and try to collect some
  i can 't say that i would recommend it because right now the puzzle is so hard and the network is so powerful that if i tried to mine bitcoin on my laptop i probably wouldn 't see any for about two million years  
 the miners  professional miners use this special hardware that 's designed to solve the puzzle really fast now  
 the bitcoin network and all of this special hardware there are estimates that the amount of energy it uses
  equivalent to that of a small country 
 so the first set of  cryptocurrencies are a little bit slow and a little bit cumbersome 
 but the next generation is going to be so much better and so much faster 
  the first step
 to a world with a global programmable money and in a world with programmable money i can pay anyone
  else securely
 without having to sign up or ask permission or do a conversion or worry about my money getting stuck  
 and i can send money around the world this is a really amazing thing
  because it was built upon an open architecture and just like the internet changed the way we communicate 
 programmable money is going to change the way we pay  allocate and decide on value  
 so what kind of world does programmable money create  imagine a world where i can rent out my healthcare data to a pharmaceutical company 
 they can run
 large scale data analysis and provide me with a cryptographic proof that shows they 're only using
 my data in a way that we agreed and they can pay me for what they find out 
 instead of signing up for streaming services and getting a cable bill what if my television analyzed my watching habits and recommended well priced content that fit within my budget that i would enjoy
  an internet without ads because instead of paying with our attention when we view content  we just pay 
 interestingly things like micro payments are actually going to change the way security works in our world because once we 're better able to allocate value people will use their money and their energies for more constructive things 
 if it cost a fraction of a cent to send an
  email would we still have spam we
 're not at this world yet  but it 's coming right now  it 's like we 're in a world that is seeing the first automobile the first 
 like the first car 
 is slow and hard to understand and hard to use digital money  like the horse and carriage works pretty well
  whole world economy is built on it 
 if you were the first person on your block to get a car with an internal combustion engine your neighbors would probably think you were crazy 
 why would you want this large clunky machine that breaks down all the time that lights on fire and is still slower than a horse 
 but we all know how that story turns out 
 we 're entering a new era
 of programmable money and it 's very exciting but it 's also a little bit scary 
 cryptocurrencies can be used for illegal transactions just like cash is used for crime in the world today 
 when all of our transactions are online what does that mean for surveillance who can see what we do 
 who 's advantaged in this new world and who isn 't
 i have to start to pay for things that i didn 't have to pay for before will we all become slaves to algorithms and utility functions 
 all new technology comes with trade offs 
 the internet brought us a lot of ways to waste time  but it also greatly increased productivity 
 mobile phones are annoying because they make me feel like i have to stay connected to work
  all the time  but they also help me stay connected to friends and family  
 the new sharing economy is going to eliminate some jobs  
 but it 's also going to create new flexible forms of employment 
 with programmable money we decouple the need for large  trusted institutions
 from the architecture of the network and this
 pushes innovation in money out to the edges where it belongs 
 programmable money democratizes money 
 and because of this things are going to change and unfold in ways that we can 't even predict  
 thank you
