  i want to talk about understanding and the nature of understanding and what
 the essence of understanding is because understanding is something we aim for everyone
 we want to understand things 
 my claim is that understanding has to do with the ability to change your perspective  if you don 't have that you don 't have understanding  
 so that is my claim  and i want to focus on mathematics 
 many of us think of mathematics as addition subtraction multiplication  division fractions percent  geometry algebra all that stuff 
  i want to talk about the essence of mathematics as well  and my claim is that mathematics has to do with patterns  
 behind me you see a beautiful pattern  and this pattern actually emerges just from drawing circles in a very particular way  
 so my day to day definition of mathematics that i use every day
 is the following  first of all  it 's about finding patterns
  i mean a connection a structure some regularity some rules that govern what we see 
 second of all i think it is about representing these patterns with a language 
 we make up language if we don 't have it and in mathematics this is essential 
 it 's also about making assumptions and playing around with these assumptions and just seeing what happens
  we 're going to do that very soon  and finally  it 's about doing cool stuff mathematics enables us to do so many things  
 so let 's have a look at these patterns  if you want to tie a tie knot there are patterns tie knots have names  
 and you can also do the mathematics of tie knots this is
  for the patterns of tie knots and a half windsor is all that 
 this is a mathematics book about tying shoelaces at the university level because there are patterns in shoelaces you can do it in so many different ways  
 we can analyze it  we can make up languages for it 
 and representations are all
  he invented a language for patterns in nature when we throw something up in the air it falls down why 
 we 're not sure but we can represent this with mathematics in a pattern  
 this is also a pattern this is also
 an invented language can you guess for what it is actually a notation system for dancing for tap dancing
  enables him as a choreographer to do cool stuff to do new things  because he has represented it
 i want you to think about how amazing representing something actually is 
 here it says the word mathematics 
 but actually they 're just dots right  so how in the world can these dots represent the word  well they do 
 they represent the word
 and these symbols also represent that word and this we can listen to it sounds like this 
 somehow these sounds represent the word and the concept how does this happen
 there 's something amazing going on about representing stuff  
 so
 i want to talk about
  that magic that happens when we actually represent something here you see just
 lines with different widths  they stand for numbers for a particular book  and i can actually recommend this book it 's a very nice book just
 trust me  
 ok  so let 's just do an experiment just to play around with some straight lines  this is a straight line let 's make another one  so every time we move we move
 one down and one across and we we draw a new straight line right  we do this over and over and over 
 and we look for patterns  so this pattern emerges  and it 's a rather nice pattern  it looks like a curve right  just from drawing simple straight lines 
 now i can change my perspective a little bit i can rotate it have a look at the curve what does it look like is it a part of a
  it 's actually not a part of a circle  so i have to continue my investigation and look for
 the true pattern  perhaps if i copy it and make some art
 well no perhaps i should extend the lines like this and look for the pattern there let 's make more lines we do this 
 and then let 's zoom out and change our perspective again 
 then we can actually see that what started out as just straight lines is actually a curve called a parabola this is
  represented by a simple equation and it 's a beautiful pattern  
 so this is the stuff that we do we find patterns  and we represent them and i think this is a nice day to day definition but today i want to go a little bit deeper and think about
 what the nature of of this is what makes it possible  there 's one thing that 's a little bit deeper and that has to do with the ability to change your perspective
  and i claim that when you change your perspective  and if you take another point of view  you learn something new about what you are
 watching or looking at or hearing  and i think this is a really important thing that we do all the time  so let 's just
 look at this simple equation
  this is a very nice pattern  and it 's true because five + five = two five etc  we 've seen this over and over and we represent it like this  but think about it this is an equation 
 it says that something is equal to something else  
 and that 's two different perspectives one perspective is it 's a sum  it 's something you plus together on the other hand it 's a multiplication  
 and those are two different perspectives 
 and i would go as far as to say that every equation
  is like this  every mathematical equation where you use that equality sign
 is actually a metaphor  
 it 's an analogy between two things you 're just viewing something and taking two different points of view  and you 're expressing that in a language 
 have a look at this equation  
 this is one of the most beautiful equations 
 it simply says
  this thing on the left hand side is minus one and the other one is 
 and that i think is one of the essential parts of mathematics you take different points of view  so let 's just play around  let 's take a number
  we know four thirds we know what four thirds is it 's one point three three three 
 but we have to have those three dots  otherwise it 's not exactly four thirds but this is only in base
  you know the number system we use ten digits if we change that around and only use two digits  that 's called the binary system  
 it 's written like this  so we 're now talking about the number the number is  four thirds
 we can write it like this  and we can change the base change the number of digits and we can write it differently  so these are all representations
 of the same number  we can even write it simply like one point three or one point six it all depends on how many digits you have or
 perhaps we just simplify and write it like this  i like this one because this says four divided by three and this number expresses a relation between two numbers you have four on the one hand and three on the other  
 and you can visualize this in many ways what i 'm doing now is viewing that number from different perspectives i 'm playing around i
 'm playing around with how we view something and i 'm doing it very deliberately  we can take a grid
  if it 's four across and three up this line equals five  always  it has to be like this  this is a beautiful pattern  
 four and three and five  
 and this rectangle which is four x three you 've seen a lot of times  this is your average computer screen eight hundred x six hundred or one thousand six hundred x one thousand two hundred is a television
  or a computer screen  
 so these are all nice representations but i want to go a little bit further and just play more with this number 
 here you see two circles  i 'm going to rotate them like this  observe the upper left one it goes a little bit faster right  
 you can see this it actually goes exactly four thirds as fast 
 that means that when it goes around four times the other one goes around three times  now let 's make two lines and draw this dot where the lines meet  we get this dot dancing around
  dot comes from that number  
 right  now we should trace it let 's trace it and see what happens  this is what mathematics is all about it 's about seeing what happens  
 and this emerges from four thirds i like to say that this is the image of
  this has been known for for a long time  but but this is four thirds let 's do another experiment  let 's now
  this is the perfect fourth if the first one is an
  i 'm doing now i 'm changing my perspective i 'm just viewing a number from another perspective  
 i can even do this with rhythms  right i can take a rhythm and play three beats at one time in
 a
 period of time  and i can play another sound
 four times in that same space sounds kind of boring but listen to them
  and i can keep doing this and play games with this number four thirds is a really great number i love
  and look at the volume of the sphere it 's actually four thirds of some particular cylinder so four thirds is in the sphere it 's the volume of the sphere  
 ok so why am i doing all this  well i want to talk about what it means to understand something
 and what we mean by understanding something that 's my aim here  and my claim is that you understand something if you have the ability to view it from different perspectives  let 's
 look at this letter
  r right  how do you know that well  as a matter of fact you 've seen a bunch of r 's  and you 've generalized
 and abstracted all of these and found a pattern  so you know that this is
 an r 
 so what i 'm aiming for here is saying something about how understanding and changing your perspective are linked  
 and i 'm a teacher and a lecturer
  and i can actually use this to teach something because when i give someone else another story a metaphor an analogy 
 if i tell a story from a different point of view  i enable understanding  i make understanding possible  because you have to generalize over everything you see and hear and if i give you another perspective  that will become easier
 let 's do a simple example again this is four and three this is four triangles  so this is also four thirds in a way  let 's just join them together  now we 're going to play a game we 're going to fold it up into a three dimensional structure i
 love this  this is a square pyramid  
 and let 's just take two of them and put them together so this is what is called an octahedron  it 's one of the five platonic
  now we can quite literally change our perspective because we can rotate it around all of the axes and view it from different perspectives  and i can change the axis 
 and then i can view it from another point of view but it 's the same thing but it looks a little different 
 i can do it even one more time every time i do this something else appears  so i 'm actually learning more about the object when i change my perspective  i can use this as a tool for creating understanding  
 i can take two of these
 and put them together like like this and see what happens  and
 it looks a little bit like the octahedron  have a look at it if i spin it around like this  what happens  well  if you take two of these join them together and spin it around 
 there 's your octahedron again a beautiful structure if you lay it out flat on the floor
  this is the octahedron  this is the graph structure of an octahedron
  and i can continue doing this
  you can draw three great circles around the octahedron 
 and you rotate around  so actually three great circles is related to the octahedron  
 and if i take a bicycle pump and just pump it up  
 you can see that this is also a little bit like the octahedron do you see what i 'm doing here  i am changing the perspective
 so let 's now take a step back and that that 's actually a metaphor  stepping back
 and have a look at what we 're doing i 'm playing around with metaphors i 'm playing around with perspectives and analogies i 'm telling one story in different ways  
 i 'm telling stories i 'm making a narrative i 'm making several narratives  and i
  i think this actually is the essence of understanding something
 i truly believe this  so this thing about changing your perspective it 's absolutely fundamental for humans 
 let 's play around with the earth let 's zoom into the ocean have a look at the ocean  we can do this with anything we can take the ocean
 and view it up close  we can
 look at the waves  we can go to the
  we can view the ocean from another perspective every time we do this we learn a little bit more about the ocean  
 if we go to the shore we can kind of smell it  right we can hear the sound of the waves we can feel salt on our tongues  
 so all of these are different perspectives and this is the best one we can go into the water  we can see the water from the inside  
 and you know what this is absolutely essential in mathematics and computer science if you 're able to
 view a structure from the inside  then you really learn something about it
  it that 's somehow the essence of something  so when we do this and we 've taken this journey
 into the ocean we use our imagination  and i think this is one level deeper  and it 's actually a requirement for
 changing your perspective
  we can do a little game you can imagine that you 're sitting there you can imagine that you 're up here  and that you 're sitting here you can view yourselves from the outside
  that 's really a strange thing you 're changing your perspective  you 're using your imagination  and you 're viewing yourself from the outside 
 that requires imagination mathematics and computer science are the most imaginative art forms ever  
 and this thing about changing perspectives should sound a little bit familiar
 because we do it every day  and then it 's called empathy when i view the world from your perspective  
 i have empathy with you if i really truly understand what the world looks like from your perspective  i am empathetic  
 that requires imagination  
 and that is how we obtain understanding 
 and this is all over mathematics and this is all over computer science and there 's a really deep
  connection between empathy
 and these sciences  so my conclusion is the following 
 understanding something really deeply has to do with the ability to change your perspective  
 so my advice to you is try to change your perspective  you can study
  it 's a wonderful way to train your brain 
 changing your perspective makes your mind more flexible it makes you open to new things and it makes you able to understand things and to use yet another metaphor  have a mind like water  that 's nice  thank you
