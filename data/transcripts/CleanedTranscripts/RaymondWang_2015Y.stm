  i get a show of hands how many of you in this room have been on a plane in this past year
 that 's pretty good well it turns out that you share that experience with more than
  three billion people every year  
 and when we put so many people in all these metal tubes that fly all over the world sometimes things like this can happen and you get a disease epidemic 
 i first actually got into this topic when i heard about the ebola outbreak last year  and it turns out that although ebola spreads through these more range limited large droplet routes there 's all these other sorts of diseases that can be spread in the airplane cabin 
 the worst part is 
 when we take a look at some of the numbers
 pretty scary so with h1n1 
 there was this guy that decided to go on the plane and in the matter of a single flight actually spread the disease to seventeen other people  
 and then there was this other guy with sars who managed to go on a three hour flight and spread the disease to twenty two other people that 's not exactly my idea of a great superpower 
 when we take a look at this what we also find is that it 's very difficult to
 pre screen for these diseases 
 so when someone actually goes on a plane they could be sick and they could actually be in this latency period in which they could actually have the disease but not exhibit any symptoms  
 and they could in turn spread the disease to many other people in the cabin how that actually works is that right now we 've got air coming in from the top of the cabin and from the
  the cabin as you see in blue  and then also that air goes out through these very efficient filters that eliminate ninety nine point nine seven percent of pathogens near the outlets
 what happens right now though is that we have this mixing airflow pattern  so if someone were to actually sneeze that air would get swirled around multiple times before it even has a chance to go out through the filter  
 so i thought clearly 
  i didn 't have the money to go out and buy a plane  so i decided to build a computer instead 
 it actually turns out that with computational fluid dynamics what we 're able to do is create these simulations that give us higher resolutions than actually physically going in and taking readings in the plane 
 and so how essentially this works is you would start out with these 2d drawings these are floating around in technical papers around the internet i take that and then i put it into
  3d modeling software really building that 3d model and then i divide that model that i just built into these tiny pieces essentially meshing it so that the computer can better understand it 
 and then i tell the computer where the air goes in and out of the cabin  throw in a bunch of physics and basically sit there and wait until the computer calculates the simulation
  with the conventional cabin is this you 'll notice the middle person sneezing 
 and we go splat it goes right into people 's faces  
 it 's pretty disgusting from the front you 'll notice those two passengers sitting next to the central passenger not exactly having a great time  
 and when we take a look at that from the side you 'll also notice those pathogens spreading across the length of the cabin the
 first thing i thought was this is no good
 i actually conducted more than thirty two different simulations and ultimately i came up with this solution right here 
 this is what i call a patent pending global inlet director with this we 're able to reduce pathogen transmission by about fifty five times and increase fresh air inhalation by about 
  one hundred and ninety percent so how this actually works is we would install this piece of composite material into these existing spots that are already in the plane
  so it 's very cost effective to install and we can do this directly overnight all we have to do is put a couple of screws in there and you 're good to go 
 and the results that we get are absolutely amazing instead of having those problematic swirling airflow patterns we can create these walls of air that come down in between
  the passengers to create personalized breathing zones so you 'll notice the middle passenger here is sneezing again but this time we 're able to effectively push that down
  to the filters for elimination  and same thing from the side you 'll notice we 're able to directly push those pathogens down 
 so if you take a look again now at the same scenario but with this innovation installed you 'll notice the middle passenger sneezes and this time we 're pushing that straight down
 into the outlet before it gets a chance to
 to infect any other people  so you 'll notice the two passengers sitting next to the middle
  guy are breathing virtually no pathogens at all take a look at that from the side as well  
 you see a very efficient system  and in short with this system  we win  when we take a look
 at what this means what we see is that this not only works if the middle passenger sneezes but also if the window seat passenger sneezes or if the aisle seat passenger sneezes  
 and so
 with this solution
  what does this mean for the world  well  when we take a look at
 this from the computer simulation into real life we can see with this 3d model that i built over here essentially using 3d printing 
 we can see those same airflow patterns coming down right to the passengers 
 in the past the sars epidemic
  actually cost the world about forty billion dollars and in the future a big disease outbreak could actually cost the world in excess of three trillion dollars  
 so before it used to be that you had to take an airplane out of service for one to two months
 spend tens of thousands of man hours and several million dollars to try to change something but now we 're able to install something essentially overnight and see results right 
  away  so it 's really now a matter of taking this through to certification flight testing and going through all
  these regulatory approvals processes but it just really goes to show that sometimes the best solutions are the simplest solutions 
 and two years ago  even this project would not have happened just because the technology then wouldn 't have supported it but now with
 advanced computing and how developed our internet is it 's really the golden era for innovation and so the question i ask all of you today is why wait  together we can build the future today
