  it was my first time eating nigerian
  through a lot of personal turmoil faced with enormous stress  i suffered an anxiety attack 
 on some days  i could do no work on other days  i just wanted to lay in my bed
 and cry my doctor asked if i 'd like to speak with a mental health professional
 about my stress and
  anxiety mental health  i clammed up and violently shook my head in protest  
 i felt a profound sense of a shame  i felt the weight
 of stigma  i have a loving supportive family and incredibly loyal friends
  i could not entertain the idea of speaking to anyone about my feeling of pain  i felt suffocated
 by the rigid architecture
 of our african masculinity people have real problems sangu get over yourself 
  i was a boarding school student
 fresh off the boat from ghana at the peddie school in new jersey  
 i had just gone through the brutal experience of losing seven loved ones in the same month 
 the school nurse concerned about what i 'd gone through god bless her soul
 she inquired about my
  i thought 
 does she not know i 'm an african man 
 like okonkwo in things fall apart we african men neither process nor express our emotions  
 we deal with our problems 
 we deal with our problems  i called my brother and laughed about
  growing up in west africa  when people used the term mental what came to mind was a madman
 with dirty dread locked hair  bumbling around half naked on the streets  
 we all know this man our parents warned us about him 
  if you even look at drugs you end up like him 
 come down with pneumonia and your mother will rush you to the nearest hospital for medical treatment  
 but dare to declare depression and your local pastor will be driving out demons
 and blaming witches in your village according to the world health organization mental health is about being able to
  cope with the normal stressors of life to work productively
 and fruitfully and to be able to make a contribution to your community mental health includes
 our emotional psychological
 and social
  yet most african governments invest less than one percent
 of their health care budget in mental health even worse  we have a severe shortage
 of psychiatrists in africa  nigeria for example is estimated to have two hundred
 in a country of almost two hundred million in all of
  africa  ninety percent of our people
 lack access to treatment as a result we suffer
 in solitude silenced by stigma  we as africans often respond to mental health
 with distance 
  what is the cause of mental illness thirty four percent of nigerian respondents
 cited drug misuse  nineteen percent said divine wrath
 and the will of god
  twelve percent 
 witchcraft and spiritual possession 
 but few cited other known causes of mental illness like genetics 
 socioeconomic status  war  
 conflict
 or the loss of a loved one the stigmatization against mental illness often results
  in the ostracizing and demonizing of sufferers  photojournalist robin hammond has documented some of these abuses in uganda 
 in somalia 
 and here in nigeria  
 for me the stigma is personal 
 in two thousand and
  nine i received a frantic call in the middle of the night my best friend in the world
 a brilliant  philosophical charming hip young man
 was diagnosed with schizophrenia  i witnessed some of the friends we 'd
  demeaning commentary about his condition words we would never say about someone with cancer or someone with malaria  
  when it comes to mental illness our ignorance eviscerates all empathy  i stood by his side
 as his community isolated him  but our love never wavered 
 tacitly i became passionate about mental health  
 inspired by his plight  i helped found the mental health special interest alumni group at my college and during my
  tenure as a resident tutor in graduate school i supported many undergraduates with their mental health challenges  i saw african students struggle
 and unable to speak to anyone even with this knowledge
 and with their stories in tow i in turn struggled and could not speak to anyone
 when i faced my own anxiety so deep is our fear
  fear of being the madman 
 all of us
 but we africans especially
 need to realize that our mental struggles do not detract from our virility 
 nor does our trauma taint our strength  
 we need to see mental health as important as physical health
  we need to stop suffering in silence  we must stop stigmatizing disease
 and traumatizing the afflicted 
 talk to your friends  talk to your loved ones talk to health professionals
  be vulnerable do so with the confidence
 that you are not alone speak up if you 're struggling 
 being honest about how we feel
 does not make us weak it makes us human 
 it is time to end the stigma associated with mental illness so the next time
 your hear mental do not just think of the madman think of me
