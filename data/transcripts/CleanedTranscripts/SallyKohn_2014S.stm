  white guys and some black women swapped twitter avatars or pictures online they didn 't change their content they kept tweeting the same as usual 
 but suddenly the white guys noticed they were getting called the n word all the time and they were getting the worst kind of online abuse
 whereas the black women all of a sudden noticed things got a lot more pleasant for them now if you 're my 
 your internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies
 and occasionally fairies riding puppies that 's a thing google it  but the rest of us know that the internet can be a really ugly
  i 'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates
 that i think are healthy for our democracy
 i 'm talking about nasty personal attacks  
 maybe it 's happened to you but it 's at least twice as likely to happen and be worse  if you 're a woman a person of color or gay  or more than one at the same time 
 in fact just as i was writing this talk i found a twitter account called 
 the bio says that i 'm a
 man hater and a bull dyke and the only thing i 've ever accomplished with my career is spreading my perverse sexuality which incidentally is only a third correct i mean lies 
 but seriously we all say we hate this crap the question is whether you 're willing to make a personal sacrifice
 to change it i don 't mean giving up the internet i mean changing the way you click
  clicking is a public act 
 it 's no longer the case that a few powerful elites control all the media and the rest of us are just passive receivers increasingly we 're all the media  
 i used to think oh  okay i get dressed up i put on a lot of makeup i go on television i talk about the news that is a public act of making
  and then i go home and i browse the web and i 'm reading twitter and that 's a private act of consuming media i mean of course it is i 'm in my pajamas  
 wrong everything we blog everything we tweet and everything we click
 is a public act of making media 
 we are the new editors we decide what gets attention based on what we give our attention to that 's how the media works now there 's all these hidden algorithms that decide
  what you see more of and what we all see more of based on what you click on and that in turn shapes our whole culture 
 over three out of five americans think we have a major incivility problem in our country right now  
 but i 'm going to guess that at least three out of five americans are clicking on the same
  in an increasingly noisy media landscape the incentive is to make more noise to be heard  and that tyranny of the loud
 encourages the tyranny of the nasty 
 it does not have to be that way it does not we can change the incentive
  for starters there are two things we can all do first 
 don 't just stand by the sidelines when you see someone getting hurt if someone is being abused online do something 
 be a hero this is your chance speak up speak out be a good person drown out the negative with the positive  
 and second  we 've got to stop clicking on the
  stop clicking on the stories about kim kardashian 's sideboob 
 i know you do it 
 you too apparently  
 i mean really same example if you don 't like politicians calling each other names stop clicking on the stories about what one guy in one party called the other guy in the other party 
 clicking on a train wreck just pours
 pours gasoline on it it makes it worse the fire spreads our whole culture gets burned  
 if what gets the most clicks wins  
 then we have to start shaping the world we want with our clicks  
 because clicking is a public act so click responsibly thank you
