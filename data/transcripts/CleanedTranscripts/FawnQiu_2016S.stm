  i design engineering projects for middle school and high school students  often using materials that are pretty unexpected 
 my inspiration comes from problems in my daily life for example one time i needed a costume to go to a comic convention
  but i didn 't want to spend too much money  so i made my own with a light up crown and skirt 
 another time i was devastated because my favorite mobile game flappy bird was being taken off the app store 
 laughter so i was faced with the dilemma to either never update my phone or never play flappy bird again
 laughter unhappy with both options i did the only thing that made sense to me 
 i made a physical version of flappy bird that could never be taken off the app store
  and they told me that it was just as infuriating as the original game 
 laughter so i uploaded a demo of this project online  and to my surprise
 it went viral
 it had over two million views in just a few days 
 and what 's more interesting are people 's comments 
 a lot of people wanted to make it their own or asked me how it was made so this kind of confirmed my idea that through a creative project we can teach people about engineering
 with the money made from the viral video  we were able to let students in our classroom all make their own
  game in a box  
 although it was pretty challenging they learned a lot of new concepts in engineering and programming  
 and they were all eager to learn so they could finish the game as well 
 so before flappy bird box  i had the idea of using creative engineering projects to teach
  when i was teaching at a middle school
 we asked our students to build a robot from a standard technology kit  and i noticed that a lot of them seemed bored 
 then a few of them started taking pieces of paper and decorating their robots and then more of them got into it and they became more interested in the project  
 so i started looking for more creative ways to introduce technology to students
 what i found was that most technology kits available in school look
  a little intimidating they 're all made of plastic parts that you can 't customize 
 on top of that they 're all very expensive costing hundreds of dollars per kit  so that 's certainly not very affordable for most classroom budgets 
 since i didn 't find anything i decided to make something on my own  i started with paper and fabric  after all we all played with those since we were kids
 and they are also pretty cheap and can be found anywhere around the house  
 and i prototyped a project where students can create a light up creature using fabric and googly eyes  
 they were all helping each other in classrooms and were laughing and discussing the project  and most importantly they were able to insert their own creativity into
  so because of the success of this project i continued to create more engineering projects to challenge my students  
 and i also started to take these workshops outside of school and into the community and something really interesting happened 
 i noticed a lot of people from very diverse backgrounds started coming to our workshops 
 and specifically  there were a lot more women and minorities
 than i expected  and that you wouldn 't usually see at a
  traditional engineering workshop 
 now take a look at this employee report at a major technology company in two thousand and sixteen 
 women make up only nineteen percent of the technology workforce  and underrepresented minorities make up only four percent 
 this statistic might look familiar if you walked into a high school robotics club or a college engineering class
  now  there 's a wide variety of problems that contribute to
 the lack of diversity in the technology force  perhaps one solution could be to introduce technology to students through creative projects 
 i 'm not saying that this could solve everything but it could introduce technology to people who originally wouldn 't be
  because of how it has been portrayed and taught in school 
 so how do we start to change the perception of technology 
 most students think that it 's boring or unwelcoming  so i have always designed projects following three principles first is having 
  a low floor  and that means this project is easy to get started 
  look at this tutorial
  the first project we asked students to learn is to make a circuit on paper 
 as you can see it doesn 't take very long to learn and it 's pretty easy even for beginners  
 and having a low floor also means that we 're removing the financial barrier that prevents people from completing a project  so with
  copper tape lightbulb and a battery people can complete this project for under a dollar  
 so second principle is having a high ceiling this means that
 there 's a lot of room to grow and students are constantly being challenged
 at first it might just be a light up creature but then you can add sensors and microcontrollers and start to program the creature to interact with its environment
  principle is customization this means that
 we can make this project relevant to anyone that 's the beauty of using everyday materials it 's very easy to customize using paper and fabric  
 so even if you don 't like  flappy bird you can still make your own game
  the object is to prevent him from getting caught by the lapd
