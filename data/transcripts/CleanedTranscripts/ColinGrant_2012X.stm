  is a photograph of a man whom for many years i plotted to kill this is my father
 permanent bags under his eyes as a 10 year old along with my siblings  i dreamt of
 scraping off the poison from fly killer paper into his coffee 
 grounded down glass and sprinkling it over his breakfast  
 loosening the carpet on the stairs so he would trip and break his neck
  but come the day he would always skip that loose step  he would always bow out of the house without so much as a swig of coffee or a bite to eat
 and so for many years i feared that my father would die before i had a chance to kill him 
 up until our mother asked him to leave and not come back
 bageye had been a terrifying ogre  
 he teetered permanently on the verge of rage rather like me as you see
 he worked nights at vauxhall motors in luton
 and demanded total silence throughout the house so that
 when we came home from school at three thirty in the afternoon we would huddle beside the tv and rather like
  would twiddle with the volume control knob on the tv so it was almost inaudible  and at times when we were like this 
  going on in the house that i imagined us to be like the german crew of a u boat creeping along the edge
  ready to drop death charges at the first sound of any disturbance  
 so that lesson was the lesson that do not draw attention to yourself either in the home or outside of the home maybe it 's a migrant lesson 
 we were to be below the radar  so there was no communication
  the sound
 that we most looked forward to you know when you 're a child and you want your father to come home and it 's all going to be happy
 and you 're waiting for that sound of the door opening well the sound that we looked forward to was the click of the door closing which meant he 'd gone
 and would not come back so for three decades
 laid eyes on my father nor he on me we never spoke to each other for three decades and then a couple of years ago i decided to turn the spotlight on him 
 you are being watched  actually you are you are being watched 
 that was his mantra to us his children time and time again he would say this to us and
  it was luton  where he worked at vauxhall motors and he was a jamaican and what he meant was you
  child of a jamaican immigrant are being watched
 to see which way you turn to see whether you conform to the host nation 's stereotype of you of being feckless 
 destined for a life of crime you are being watched  so confound their expectations of you to that end
  jamaican exhibited a kind of jamaican bella figura turn your best
 side to the world show your best face to the world  if you have seen some of the images of the
 caribbean people arriving in the ' 40s and ' 50s you might have noticed that a lot of the men wear
  there was no tradition of wearing trilbies in jamaica they invented that tradition for their arrival here  they wanted to project themselves in a way that they wanted to be perceived 
 so that the way they looked
 and the names that they gave themselves defined them so bageye is bald
 and has baggy eyes  tidy boots is very fussy about his footwear 
 anxious is always anxious clock has one arm longer than the other
 my all time favorite was the guy they called summerwear 
 when summerwear came to this country from jamaica in the early ' 60s he insisted on wearing light summer suits no matter the weather  
 and in the course of researching their lives i asked my mom whatever became of summerwear 
  taught us the importance of style maybe they exaggerated their style because
 they thought that they were not considered to be quite civilized and they transferred that generational attitude
 or anxiety onto us the next generation so much so that when i was growing up if ever on the television news or radio a report came up about a black person committing some crime
 a mugging
  murder a burglary
 we winced along with our parents 
 because they were letting the side down  you did not just represent yourself you represented the group and it was a
 terrifying thing to to come to terms with in a way that maybe you were going to be perceived in the
  so that was what needed to be challenged our father and many of his colleagues
 exhibited a kind of
 transmission but not receiving they were built to transmit but not receive  we were to keep quiet
  when our father did speak to us it was from the pulpit of his mind they clung to certainty in the belief that
 doubt would undermine them  but when i
 am working in my house and writing  after a day 's writing i rush downstairs
 and i 'm very excited to talk about marcus garvey or bob marley and words are tripping out of my mouth like butterflies and i 'm so excited that my children stop me and they say
  they cross over somehow they find their way to you they shape their lives according to the narrative of your life as
 i did with my father and my mother  perhaps  and maybe bageye did with his father and that was clearer to me in the course of
 looking at his life
  they say the native americans say do not criticize the man until you can walk in his moccasins 
 but in conjuring his life it was okay and very straightforward to portray
 a caribbean life in england in the 
  with
 bowls of plastic fruit  polystyrene ceiling tiles
  permanently sheathed in their transparent covers that they were delivered in 
 but what 's more difficult to navigate is the emotional landscape between the generations  and the old adage that
 with age comes wisdom is not true 
 with age comes the veneer of respectability and a veneer of uncomfortable truths  
 but what was true
 was that
 my parents my mother and my father went along with it did not trust the state to educate me  so listen to how i sound 
 they determined that they would send me to a private school
  but my father worked at vauxhall motors it 's quite
 difficult to fund a private school education and feed his army of children  i remember going on to the school for the entrance
  my father said to the priest it was a catholic school he wanted a better 
  for the boy  but also he my father  never even managed to pass worms never mind entrance exams 
 but in order to fund my education he was going to have to do some dodgy stuff so
 my father would fund my education by trading in illicit goods from the back of his car and that was made even more tricky because my
  father  that 's not his car by the way my father aspired to have a car like that but my father had a  beaten up mini  and
 he never being a jamaican coming to this country he never had a driving license he never had any insurance or road tax or mot 
 he thought i know how to drive why do i need the state 's validation
  but it became a little tricky when we were stopped by the police and we were stopped a lot by the police  
 and i was impressed by the way that my father dealt with the police  he would promote the policeman immediately so that p c bloggs became detective inspector bloggs
 in the course of the conversation and wave us on merrily  so my father was exhibiting what we in jamaica called playing fool to catch wise 
 but it lent
 also an idea that actually he was being
  diminished or belittled by the policeman
 as a 10 year old boy i saw that but also there was an ambivalence towards authority  so on the one hand there was a mocking of authority  
 but on the other hand there was a deference towards authority  
 and these caribbean people had an overbearing obedience towards authority  
 which is very striking very strange in a way because
 migrants are very
  courageous people they leave their homes my father and my mother left jamaica and they traveled four thousand miles
  and yet they were infantilized by travel they were timid  
 and somewhere along the line the natural order was reversed the children became the parents to the parent 
 the caribbean people came to this country with
  money and then go back  but the five years became ten the ten became fifteen and before you know it you 're changing the wallpaper  and at that point you know you 're here to stay  
 although there 's still the kind of
 temporariness that our parents felt about being here  but we children knew that the game was up 
 i think there was a feeling that they would not
  continue with the
 ideals of the life that they expected the reality was very much different 
 and also that was true of the reality of trying to educate me  having started the process my father did not continue  
 it was left to my mother to educate me and as george lamming would say  it was my mother who fathered me  
 even in his absence that old mantra
  remained you are being watched  but such ardent watchfulness can lead to anxiety so much so that years later when i was investigating why so many young black men were diagnosed with schizophrenia  six times more than they ought to be 
 i was not surprised to hear the psychiatrist say 
 black people are schooled in paranoia 
 and i wonder what bageye would make of that
  now i also had a  10 year old son  and turned my attention to bageye
 and i went in search of him he was back in luton he was now eighty two and i hadn 't seen him for 30 odd years 
 and when he opened the door i saw this tiny little man with lambent smiling eyes  and he was
  and i 'd never seen him smile i was very disconcerted by that but we sat down and he had a
 caribbean friend with him  talking some old time talk 
 and my father would look at me  and he looked at me as if i would miraculously disappear as as i had arisen  
 and he turned to his friend and he said this boy and me have a deep  deep connection  deep  deep connection
  but i never felt that connection if there was a pulse it was very weak or hardly at all  
 and i almost felt in the course of that reunion that i was auditioning to be my father 's son 
 when the book came out it had fair reviews in the national papers but the paper of choice in luton is not the guardian it
 's the luton news 
 and the luton news ran the headline about the book the book that may heal a
 32 year old rift and i understood that could also represent the rift between one generation and the next between
 people like me and my father 's generation 
 but there 's no tradition in caribbean life of memoirs or biographies it was a tradition that you didn 't chat about your business in public 
 but i
 welcomed that title  and i thought
  actually yes there is a possibility that this will open up conversations that we 'd never had before 
 this will close the generation gap  perhaps  
 this could be an instrument of repair  and i even began to feel that this book
 may be perceived by my father as an act of filial
  was stung by what he perceived to be
 the public airing of his shortcomings he was stung by my betrayal  
 and he went to the newspapers the next day and demanded a right of reply  and he got it with the headline bageye bites back 
 and it was a coruscating account of my betrayal  i was no son of his
 he recognized in his mind that his colors had been dragged through the mud  and he couldn 't allow that he had to restore his dignity  
 and he did so and initially although i was disappointed  
 i grew to admire that stance there was still fire bubbling through his veins even though he was eighty two years old 
 and if it meant that we would now return to thirty years of silence
  father would say if it 's so then it 's so 
 jamaicans will tell you that there 's no such thing as facts there are only versions 
 we all tell ourselves the versions of the story that we can best live with each generation builds up
 an edifice which they are reluctant or sometimes unable to disassemble  but in the writing
  my version of the story began to change  and
 it was detached from me  i lost
 my hatred of my father  i did no longer want him to die or to murder him  and
 i felt free much
 freer than i 'd ever felt before  
 and i wonder whether that  freedness could be transferred to him 
 in that initial reunion  
 i was struck by an idea that i had very few photographs
 of myself as a young child this is a photograph of me  nine months old in the original photograph
 'm being held up by my father  bageye 
 but when my parents separated my mother excised him from all aspects of our lives she took a pair of scissors and cut him out of every photograph
  and for years i told myself the truth of this photograph was that you are alone  you are unsupported
  but there 's another way of looking at this photograph this is a photograph
 that has the potential for a reunion 
 a potential to be reunited with my father and in my yearning to be held up by my father  i held him up to the light 
 in that first reunion  it was very awkward and tense moments and to lessen the tension
  decided to go for a walk  
 and as we walked  i was struck that i had reverted to being the child even though i was now towering above my father  
 i was almost a foot taller than my father  he was still the big man  
 and i tried to match his step  
 and i realized that he was walking as if he was still under observation  
 but i admired his walk  he walked
 like a man
 on the losing side of the f a cup final
 mounting the steps to collect his condolence medal there was dignity in defeat  thank you
