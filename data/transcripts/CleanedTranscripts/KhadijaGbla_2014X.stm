  today i 'm going to share my personal journey with female genital mutilation
 feel free to cry  laugh  cross your
  or do anything your body feels like doing i 'm not going to name the things your body does  
 i was born in sierra leone did anybody watch blood diamond 
 if you have any thoughts
 i don 't have any diamonds on me  by the way
  if you have heard of ebola well that 's in sierra leone as well  i don 't have ebola you 're all safe don 't rush to the door  be seated you 're fine i
  me why a man needs more than one wife men do you need more than one wife  i don 't think so  there you go he was looking for a heart attack  that 's what i say
 oh yeah he was when i was three war broke out in sierra leone in 
 i remember literally going to bed one night
  everything was good the next day i woke up bombs were dropping everywhere  and people were trying to kill me and my family  
 we escaped the war and ended up in gambia in west africa  ebola is there as well  stay away from it 
 while we were there as refugees 
 what was going to become of us 
 my mom applied for refugee status  she 's a wonderful smart woman that one and we were lucky australia said we will take you in
 good job aussies before
 we were meant to travel my mom came home one day and said we 're going on a little holiday a little trip 
 she put us in a car and we drove for hours and ended up in a bush in a remote area in gambia 
 in this bush we found two huts an old lady
 came towards us she was 
  very old she had a chat with my mom  and went back then she came back and walked
 away from us into a second hut  
 i 'm standing there thinking this is very confusing i don 't know what 's going on the next thing i knew my mom took me into this hut  
 she took my clothes off  and then she pinned me down on
  the floor 
 i struggled and tried to get her off me but i couldn 't 
 then the old lady came towards me with a rusty looking knife one of the sharp knives orange looking has never seen water or sunlight before 
 i thought she was going to slaughter me  but she didn 't 
 she slowly slid down my body
 and ended up where my vagina is
  she took hold of what i now know to be my clitoris 
 she took that rusty knife  and started cutting away inch
 by inch i screamed  i cried  and asked my mom to get off me
 so this pain will stop but all she did was say
  quiet this old lady sawed away
 at my flesh for what felt like forever and then when she was done she threw that piece of flesh
 across the floor as if it was the most disgusting thing she 's ever touched 
 they both got off me and left me there bleeding crying and confused as to
  what
 just
 happened  
 we never talked about this again very soon we found that we were coming to australia 
 and this is when you had the sydney olympics at the time  and people said we were going to the end of the world there was nowhere else to go after australia 
 yeah that comforted us a bit it
 took us three days to get here  we went to senegal  then france and
  singapore  we went to the bathroom to wash our hands  we spent fifteen minutes opening the tap like this 
 then somebody came in slid their hand under and water came out and we thought is this what we 're in for like seriously
  we got to adelaide 
  small place where literally they dumped us in adelaide that 's what i would say they dumped us there we were very grateful 
 we settled and we liked it we were like we 're home we 're here 
 then somebody took us to rundle mall adelaide has only one mall it 's this small place  
 and we saw a lot of asian people my mom said all of a sudden panicking you brought us to the wrong place  you must take us back to australia
  had to be explained to her that
 there were a lot of asians in australia and we were in the right place  so fine it 's all good 
 my mom then had this brilliant idea that i should go to a girls school because they were less racist i don 't know where she read that publication 
 never found evidence of it to this day  
 six hundred white kids  and i was the only black child
  person with a bit of a color on me  let me say that chocolate color  
 there were no asians no indigenous 
 all we had was some tan girls girls who felt the need to be under the sun it wasn 't the same as my chocolate though not the same 
 settling in australia was quite hard but it became harder when i started volunteering for an organization called women 's health statewide
 and i joined their female genital mutilation program without any awareness of what this program was actually about  
 or that it related to me in any way  
 i spent months educating nurses and doctors about what female genital mutilation was and where it was practiced  africa the middle east asia and now australia and london and america because 
 as we all know we live in a multicultural society
 and people who come from those backgrounds
 come with their culture  
 and sometimes sometimes  they have cultural practices that we may not agree with but they continue to practice them  
 one day  i was looking at the chart of the different types of female genital mutilation fgm i will just say fgm for short 
 type i is when they cut off the hood
 ii is when they cut off the whole clitoris and some of your labia majora  or your outer lips  
 and type iii is when they cut off the whole clitoris and then they sew you up so you only have a little hole to pee and have your period 
 my eyes went onto type ii 
 before all of this i pretty much had amnesia  i was in so much shock and traumatized by what had happened i didn 't remember any of it
 yes i was aware something bad happened to me  but i had no recollection of what had happened 
 i knew i had a scar down there  but i thought everybody had a scar down there this had happened to everybody else but
 when i looked at type ii 
 it all came back to me  i remembered what was done to me  i remembered being in that hut with that old lady and my mom holding me down
  words cannot express the pain
 i felt the confusion that i felt because now i realized that what was done to me was a terrible
 thing that in this society was called barbaric it was called mutilation  my mother had said it was called circumcision but here it was
  i went home and said to my mom you did something this is not the african thing to do pointing at your mother  but
  she 's used to me mouthing off  
 i 'm like those years ago  you circumcised me  you cut away something that belonged to me 
 she said yes i did 
 i did it for your own good  
 it was in your best interest
  if you were not circumcised you would get itchy down there women who are not circumcised get itchy all the time  then they sleep around with everybody 
 you are not going to sleep around with anybody
  empowerment was very strange 
 that was the end of our first conversation  i went back to school 
 these were the days when we had dolly and girlfriend magazines there was always the sealed section anybody remember those sealed sections  the naughty bits
  pleasure and relationships and of course sex
 but it always assumed that you had a clitoris  though and i thought 
 this doesn 't fit me this doesn 't talk about people like me i don 't have a clitoris  
 i watched tv and those women would moan like oh oh i was like these people and their damned clitoris
  what is a woman without a clitoris supposed to do with her life  that 's what i want to know i want to do that too oh oh and all of that 
 didn 't happen so i came home once again and said to my mom dolly and girlfriend said
 i deserve pleasure  that i should be having
  was dolly that said that and
 i thought to myself i had an inner joke in my head that said 
 i will marry a white man he won 't have that problem with me 
 so i said to my mom dolly and girlfriend said
  i deserve pleasure and do you know
 what you have taken away from me what you have denied me 
 you have invaded me in the most sacred way  i want pleasure  i want to get horny dammit
  she didn 't get it we came from two different worlds when she was growing up not having a clitoris was the norm  it was celebrated 
 i was an african australian
  so once i went through this strange phase of anger and pain and confusion 
 i remember booking an appointment with my therapist yes i 'm an african who has a therapist there you go  
 and i said to her 
 i was thirteen i was a child i was settling in a new country i was dealing with racism and discrimination  
 english is my third language  and then
  to her i feel like i 'm not a woman
 because of what was done to me  i feel incomplete  
 am i going to be asexual 
 because from what i knew about fgm the whole aim of it was to control the sexuality of women  it 's so that we don 't have any sexual desire
  asexual now will i just live the rest of my life not feeling like having sex not enjoying sex 
 she couldn 't answer my questions so they went unanswered 
 when i started having my period around the age of fourteen i realized i didn 't have normal periods because of fgm 
 my periods were heavy they were long and they were very
 painful  then they told me i had fibroids they 're like these little balls sitting there
 one was covering one of my ovaries and there came then the big news 
 we don 't think you can have children khadija and once again  i was an angry black
 woman  i went home and i said to my mom 
 your act  your action no matter what your may defense may be because she thought she did it out love
  did out of love is harming me and it 's hurting me  what do you have to say for that 
 she said i did what i had to do as a mother i 'm still waiting for an apology by the way  
 then i got married 
 and once again fgm is like the gift that keeps giving  you figure that out very soon
 sex was very painful  it hurt all the time and of course i
 i am the lucky girl
 it affects every area of your life and this happened to me because i was born a girl in the wrong place  
 that 's why it happened to me  
 i channel all that anger  all that pain into advocacy because i needed my pain to be worth something 
 so i 'm the director of an organization called no fgm australia  you heard me right why no fgm
  australia fgm is in australia 
 two days ago i had to call child protective services because somewhere in australia
  couple of months ago i met a lady who is married to a malaysian man 
 her husband came home one day and said he was going to take their daughters back to malaysia to cut off their clitoris and she said why 
 he said they were dirty 
 and she said well you married me he said oh this is my cultural belief 
  they then went into a whole discussion where she said to him over my dead body will you do that to my daughters 
 but imagine if this woman wasn 't aware of what fgm was if they never had that conversation her children would have been flown over
 to malaysia and they would have come back changed for the rest of their lives do you know the millions of dollars it would take us to deal with an issue like that [ three
  in australia are at risk of having fgm performed on them 
 this is an australian problem people it 's not an african problem it 's not a middle eastern problem  it 's not white it 's not black it has no color  it 's everybody 's problem 
 fgm is child abuse  
 it 's violence against women  
 it 's saying that women don 't have a right to sexual pleasure  it says we don 't have a right to our bodies  well i say no to that
  what i have to say to that 
 i am proud to say that
 i 'm doing my part in ending fgm 
 what are you going to do there may be a child in your classroom who is at risk of fgm  there may be a patient who comes to your
  hospital who is at risk of fgm but this is the reality 
 that even in our beloved australia the most wonderful place in the world children are being abused because of a culture 
 culture should not be a defense for child abuse  i want ever single one of you to see fgm as an issue for you 
 make it personal it could be your daughter your sister your cousin
  i can 't fight fgm alone i could try  but i can 't  
 so my appeal to you is please join me  sign my petition on  change org and type in khadija my name and it 'll come up and sign it 
 the aim of that is to get support for fgm victims in australia and to protect little girls growing up here to not have this evil done to them  because every child
 has a right to pleasure  every child has a right to their bodies being left intact and dammit ever child has a right to a clitoris
 so please join me
 in ending this act  my favorite quote is all it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good men and
  you going to let this evil of female genital
 mutilation to prevail in australia  i don 't think so so please join me in ensuring that it ends in my generation thank you
