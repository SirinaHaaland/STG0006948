  i 'm going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust  i think these are so commonplace they 've become clichs of our society  
  i think there are three one 's a claim  there has been a great decline in trust  very widely believed  the second is
 an aim  we should have more trust  and the third is
 a task  we should rebuild trust  
 i think that the claim  the aim and the task are all misconceived 
 so what i 'm going to try to tell you today is a different story
 about a claim
 an aim and a task which i think give one
 quite a lot better purchase on the matter first the claim  why do people think trust has declined  
 and if i really think about it on the basis of my own evidence  i don 't know the answer  i 'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown
  in others  i don 't have an overview 
 but of course  i can look at the opinion polls and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined 
 when you actually look at opinion polls across time there
 's not much evidence for that that 's to say the people who were mistrusted twenty years ago principally journalists and
  politicians are still mistrusted 
 and the people who were highly trusted twenty years ago are still rather highly trusted judges nurses  the rest of us are in between
 and by the way  the average person in the street is almost exactly midway  but is that good evidence what opinion polls
  what else can they record so they 're looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions  do you trust politicians do you trust teachers  
 now if somebody said to you do you trust greengrocers do you trust fishmongers do you trust elementary school teachers you would probably begin
  and that would be a perfectly sensible response and
 you might say  when you understood
 the answer to that well 
 i trust some of them but not others that 's a perfectly rational thing 
 in short in our real lives we seek to place trust in a differentiated way  we don 't make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type
  of official or office holder or
 type of person is going to be uniform  
 i might for example say that i certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher i know to teach the reception class to read 
 but in no way to drive the school minibus
  i might after all know that she
  keep a conversation going but not but perhaps not to keep a secret simple so if we 've got those
 evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated  why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust
  more abstractly  
 i think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust  
 secondly  what about the aim  the aim is to have more trust  well frankly i think that 's a stupid aim it
 's not what i would aim at i would aim
  aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy in fact i aim positively
 to try not to trust the untrustworthy
  and i think of those people who for example  placed their savings with the very aptly named
  who then made off with them  
 and i think of them and i think well  yes too much trust more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life  
 intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust is the proper aim  
 well once one says that one says yeah  okay that means that what matters in the first place is
  judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects and i think that judgment requires us to look at three things are they competent 
 are they honest are they reliable 
 and if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters and reliable and honest we 'll have a pretty good reason to trust them because they 'll be trustworthy 
 but if on the other hand they 're unreliable we might not
  i have friends who are competent and honest but i would not trust them to post a letter because they 're forgetful
  i have friends who are very confident they can do certain things
  but i realize that they overestimate their own competence and i 'm very glad to say i don 't think i have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest
 but that 's what we 're looking for trustworthiness before trust trust is the response trustworthiness is what we have to judge and of course it 's difficult 
 across the last few decades we 've tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on
 that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness
  a lot of these systems have the converse effect they don 't work as they 're supposed to i remember i was
 talking with a midwife who said well you see the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby 
 and all over our public life our institutional life we find that
  that the system of accountability that is meant to secure trustworthiness and
 and evidence of trustworthiness is actually doing the opposite it is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks  like midwives 
 from doing them by requiring them to tick the boxes as we say you can all give your own examples there
 so so much for the aim  
  i think is more trustworthiness and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people 
 and if we are trying to judge whether other people or 
  office holders or politicians are trustworthy it 's not easy  it is judgment and simple reaction attitudes don 't do
 rebuilding trust  i think also gets things backwards it suggests that you and i should rebuild trust  
 well  we can do that for ourselves we can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness we can do it two people together trying to improve trust 
 but trust in the end 
 is distinctive because it 's given by other people you can 't rebuild what
 other people give you you have to give them the basis for giving
 you their trust  
 so you have to i think be trustworthy and that of course is because you can 't fool all of the people all of the time  
 usually  
 but you also have to provide
 usable evidence that you are trustworthy how to do it well every
  day all over the place it 's being done by ordinary people by officials by institutions quite effectively  
 let me give you a simple commercial example  
 the shop where i buy my socks says i may take them back 
 and they don 't ask any questions they take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color i wanted that 's super  i trust them because they have made
  vulnerable to me 
 i think there 's a big lesson in that if you make yourself vulnerable to the other party  
 then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying  
 so in the end i think what we are aiming for is not
 very difficult to discern  it is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge
 when and how the other person is trustworthy  so
 the moral of all this is we need to think much less about trust  let alone about
 attitudes of trust detected or mis detected by opinion polls much more about being trustworthy and how you give people adequate  useful
 and simple evidence that
