  fantastic month for deception  and i 'm not even talking about the american presidential race 
 we have a high profile journalist caught for plagiarism 
 a young superstar writer whose book involves so many made up quotes that they 've pulled it from the
  shelves a new york times expos on fake book reviews  it 's been fantastic now  of course not all deception
 hits the news 
 much of the deception is everyday  in fact a lot of research shows that we all lie once or twice a day  as dave suggested  
 so it 's about six thirty now  suggests that most of us should have lied let 's take a look at winnipeg how many of you in the last twenty four hours think back
 have told a little fib
  a big one how many have told a little lie out there all right good these are all the liars make sure you pay attention to them 
 no that looked good it was about two thirds of you the other third
 didn 't lie or perhaps forgot or you 're lying to me about your lying which is very very devious this fits with
  it 's this pervasiveness combined with the centrality to what it means to be a human the fact that we can tell the truth or make something up that has fascinated people throughout history 
 here we have diogenes with his lantern does anybody know what he was looking for 
 a single honest man and he died without finding one back in greece  
 we have confucius in the east who was really concerned with sincerity not only that you walked the walk or talked the talk but that you believed in what you were doing 
 you believed in your principles  
 now my first professional encounter with deception is a little bit later than these guys a couple thousand years  
 i was a customs officer for canada back in the mid ' 90s yeah  i was defending canada 's borders you may think that 's a weapon right there
 a stamp i used a stamp to defend canada 's borders very canadian of me i learned a lot about deception while doing my duty here
 in customs one of which was that most of what i thought i knew about deception was wrong and i 'll tell you about some of that tonight but even since just 
 the way we communicate has been completely transformed we email we text we skype we facebook  it 's insane
 almost every aspect of human communication 's been changed and of course that 's had an impact on deception let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions we 've been tracking and documenting 
 they 're called the butler  
 the sock puppet
 and the chinese water army it sounds a little bit like a weird book  but actually they 're all new types of lies  let 's start with the butlers  here 's an example of one
  my way anybody ever written on my way then you 've also lied we
 're never on our way we 're thinking about going on our way  
 here 's another one sorry i didn 't respond to you earlier my battery was dead your battery wasn 't dead  you weren 't in a dead zone  you just didn 't want to respond to that person that time  here 's the last
  just bored you want to talk to somebody else  each of these is about a relationship and this is a twenty four seven
 connected world once you get my cell phone number you can literally be in touch with me twenty four hours a day  
 and so these lies are being used by people to create a buffer like the butler used to do between us and the connections to
  but they 're very special they use ambiguity that comes from using technology  you don 't know where i am or what i 'm doing or who i 'm with 
 and they 're aimed at protecting the relationships these aren 't just people being jerks 
 these are people that are saying look i don 't want to talk to you now or i didn 't want to talk to you then  but i still care about you our relationship is still important 
 now the sock puppet on the other hand is a totally different animal  the sock puppet isn 't about ambiguity per se
  it 's about identity  let me give you a very recent example as in like last week  here 's r j ellory best seller author in in britain
 here 's one of his bestselling books  here 's a reviewer online on amazon 
 my favorite by nicodemus jones is whatever else it might do it will touch your soul and of course  you might suspect
 that nicodemus jones is r j ellory
 he wrote very very positive reviews about himself surprise surprise
 sock puppet stuff isn 't actually that new walt whitman
 also did this back in the day before there was internet technology
 sock puppet becomes interesting when we get to scale  which is the domain of the chinese water army chinese water army refers to thousands of people in china
 that are paid small amounts of money to produce content it could be reviews it could be propaganda the government hires these people
  companies hire them all over the place in
 north america we call this astroturfing  and astroturfing is very common now there 's a lot of concerns about it we see this especially with product reviews book reviews  everything from hotels to whether
 that toaster is a good toaster or not now  looking at these three reviews
  the internet is really making us a deceptive species especially when you think about the astroturfing where we can see deception
 brought up to scale  
 but actually what i 've been finding is very different from that 
 now  let 's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms which i 'm sure none of you have been in i can assure you there 's deception there  
 and let 's put aside the nigerian prince who 's emailed you about getting the forty three million out of the country
  let 's forget about that guy too 
 let 's focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones those are the conversations that really matter 
 what does technology do to deception with those folks  
 here 's a couple of studies  one of the studies we do are called diary studies in which we
  record all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days  
 and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium 
 and the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media and
 it really throws people for a loop because we think well there 's no nonverbal cues so why don 't you lie more 
 the phone 
 in contrast the
  most lies again and again and again we see the phone is the device that people lie on the most and perhaps because of the butler lie ambiguities i was telling you about 
 this tends to be very different from what people expect  
 what about rsums we did a study in which we had people apply for a job and they could apply for a job either with a traditional paper  rsum or on linkedin  
 which is a social networking site like facebook but for professionals involves the same information as a rsum and what we found to many people 's surprise
  was that those linkedin rsums were more honest on the things that mattered to employers like your responsibilities or your skills at your previous job 
 how about facebook itself  
 you know we always think that hey there are these idealized versions people are just showing the best things that happened in their lives i 've thought that many times my friends no way they can be that cool and have good of a
  one study tested this by examining people 's personalities they had four good friends of a person
 judge their personality then they had strangers many strangers  judge the person 's personality just from facebook  and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical 
 highly correlated meaning that facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality 
  and they would tell you about that guy that had no hair when he came or the woman that didn 't look at all like her photo 
 well we were really interested in it and so what we did is we brought people online daters into the lab 
 and then we measured them  we got their height up against the wall  we put them on a scale got their weight ladies loved that
 and then we actually got their driver 's license to get their age  and what we found was very very interesting
 here 's an example of the men and the height  
 along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile  along the y axis the vertical axis is how tall they actually were 
 that diagonal line is the truth line if their dot 's on it they were telling exactly the truth now as you see most of the little dots are below the line 
 what it means is all the guys were lying about their height  in fact they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch
  we say in the lab as strong rounding up 
 you get to five ' eight and one tenth and boom five ' nine 
 but what 's really important here is look at all those dots they are clustering pretty close to the truth what we found was eighty percent of our participants did indeed lie on one of those dimensions  
 but they always lied by a little bit one of the reasons is pretty simple if you go to a date
  coffee date and you 're completely different than what you said  game over right so people lied frequently but they lied subtly not too much they were constrained  
 well  what explains all these studies what explains the fact
 that despite our intuitions mine included a lot of online communication
  really is strange how do we explain this well to do that one thing is we can look at the deception detection literature it
 's a very old literature by now  it 's coming up on fifty years  it 's been reviewed many times there 's been thousands of trials hundreds of studies  
 and there 's some really compelling findings the first is we 're really bad at detecting deception really
  percent accuracy on average when you have to tell if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not 
 that 's really bad why is it so bad well it has to do with pinocchio 's nose 
 if i were to ask you guys what do you rely on when you 're looking at somebody and you want to find out if they 're lying what cue do you pay attention to 
 most of you would say that one of the cues you look at is the eyes the eyes are the
  and you 're not alone around the world almost every culture one of the top cues is eyes 
 but the research over the last fifty years says there 's actually no reliable cue to deception  
 which blew me away and it 's one of the hard lessons that i learned when i was customs officer  the eyes do not tell us whether somebody 's lying or not some situations yes high stakes  maybe their pupils dilate their pitch goes up their
 body movements change a little bit but not all the time not for everybody it 's not reliable strange
  the other thing is that just because you can 't see me doesn 't mean i 'm going to lie 
 it 's common sense but one important finding is that we lie for a reason  we lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain or for somebody else 's gain 
 so there are some pathological liars but they make up a tiny portion of the
 of the population we lie for a reason just because people can 't see us doesn 't mean we 're going to necessarily lie but i think there 's actually something much more interesting and
  going on here the next big thing for me the next big idea 
 we can find by going way back in history to the origins of language  most linguists agree that
 we started speaking somewhere between fifty thousand and one hundred thousand years ago that 's a long time ago a lot of humans have lived since then we 've been talking i guess
  i don 't know what they talked about but they were doing a lot of talking and like i said there 's a lot of humans evolving speaking about one hundred billion people in fact  
 what 's important though is that writing only emerged about five thousand years ago 
 so what that means is that all the people before there was any writing 
 every word that they ever said every
  so we 've been evolving to talk in a way in which there is no record  in fact even the next big
 change to writing was only five hundred years ago now with the printing press which is very recent in our past  and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until world war ii
  even the people of the last two
 millennia  most of the words they ever said
 poof  disappeared  let 's turn to now  the networked age  how many of you
 have recorded something today  anybody do any writing today did anybody write a word 
 it looks like almost every single person here recorded something  in this
  we 've probably recorded more than almost all of human pre ancient history  
 that is crazy we 're entering this amazing period of flux in human evolution
 where we 've evolved to speak in a way in which our words disappear 
 but we 're in an environment where we 're recording everything 
 in fact i think in the very near future  it 's not just what we write that will be recorded everything we do will be recorded  
 what does that mean what 's the next big
  idea from that 
 well as a social scientist this is the most amazing thing i have ever even dreamed of 
 now  i can look at all those words that used to for millennia  disappear  i can look at lies that before were said and then gone  
 you remember those astroturfing reviews that we were talking about before  well  when they write a fake review they have to post it
  somewhere and it 's left behind for us so one thing that we did and i 'll give you an example of looking at the language is we paid people to write some fake reviews  one of these reviews is fake the person never was at the james hotel  
 the other review is real the person stayed there 
 now your task now is to decide
 which review
  give you a moment
 to read through them  but i want everybody to raise their hand at some point remember i study deception  i can tell if you don 't raise your hand 
 all right  how many of you believe that a is the fake all
 right very good about half and how many of you think
 that b is all right slightly more for b excellent  here 's the answer
 b is a fake well done second group  you dominated the first group you
 're actually a little bit unusual every time we demonstrate this it 's usually about a 50 50 split which fits with the research fifty four percent maybe people here in winnipeg are more suspicious and better at figuring it out 
 those cold hard
  i love it all right so why do i care about this well what i can do now with my colleagues in computer science
 is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception  let me highlight a couple of things here in the fake review  
 the first is that liars tend to think about narrative they make up a story who and what happened and that 's what happened here our fake
 fake reviewers talked about who they were with and what they were doing 
 they also used the first person singular i way more than the people that actually stayed there they were inserting themselves into
 the
 hotel review kind of trying to convince you they were there  
 in contrast the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there their bodies actually entered the physical space they talked a lot more about spatial information 
 they said how big the bathroom was or they said  you know  here 's how far shopping
  is from the hotel 
 now you guys did pretty well  most people perform at chance at this task 
 our computer algorithm is very accurate much more accurate than than humans can be and it 's not going to be accurate all the time this isn 't a deception detection machine to tell if your girlfriend 's lying to you on text messaging 
 we believe that every lie now every type of lie fake hotel reviews fake shoe reviews your
  girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging those are all different lies they 're going to have different patterns of language  
 but because everything 's recorded now we can look at all of those kinds of lies  
 now  as i said as a social scientist this is
 wonderful it 's transformational we 're going to be able to learn so much more about human thought and
  everything from love to attitudes 
 because everything is being recorded now but what does it mean for the average citizen what does it mean for us in our lives well 
 let 's forget deception for a bit one of the big
 ideas  i believe is that we 're leaving these huge traces behind my outbox for email is massive  and i never look at it 
 i write all the time  but i never look at my at my record at my trace
  we 're going to see a lot more of that where we can reflect on who we are by looking at what we wrote what we said what we did
  the networked age
