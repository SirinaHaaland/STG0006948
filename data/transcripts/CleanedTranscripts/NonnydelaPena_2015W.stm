  what if i could present you a story that you would remember with your entire body and not just with your mind 
 my whole life as a journalist i 've really been compelled to try to make stories that can make a difference and maybe inspire people to care  
 i 've worked in print  i 've worked in documentary i 've worked in broadcast
  but it really wasn 't until i got involved with virtual reality that i started seeing these really intense authentic reactions from people that really blew my mind  
 so
 the deal is that with vr virtual reality i can put you on scene
 in the middle of the story by putting on these goggles that track wherever you look you get this
  whole body sensation like you 're actually like there  
 so five years ago was about when i really began to push the envelope with using virtual reality and journalism together  
 and i wanted to do a piece about hunger  families in america are going hungry food banks are overwhelmed and they 're often running out of food 
 now i knew
 couldn 't make people feel hungry  but maybe i could figure out a way to get them to feel something physical so
 again this is five years ago so doing journalism and virtual reality together was considered a 
  idea and i had no funding  believe me i had a lot of colleagues laughing at me and i did though have a really great intern a woman
  and together we went out to food banks and started recording audio and photographs 
 until one day she came back to my office and she was bawling she was just crying  she had been on scene at a long line where the woman running the line was feeling extremely 
  overwhelmed and she was screaming there 's too many people there 's too many people 
 as soon as i heard that audio i knew that this would be the kind of evocative
 piece that could really describe what was going on at food banks 
 so here 's the real line you can see how long it was right  and again as i said we didn 't have very much funding so i had to reproduce it with
 virtual humans that were donated  and people begged and borrowed favors to help me create the models and make things as accurate as we
  could and then we tried to convey what happened that day with as much as accuracy as is possible
  so the man on the right for him  he 's walking around the body  for him he 's in the room with that body
  that guy is at his feet  
 and even though through his peripheral vision he can see that he 's in this lab space  he should be able to see that that he 's not actually on the street
  but he feels like he 's there with those people he 's very cautious not to step on this guy who isn 't really there right  
 so that piece ended up going to sundance in two thousand and twelve a kind of amazing thing and it was the first virtual
  hear the surprise in my voice right  
 and this kind of reaction ended up being the kind of reaction we saw over and over and over people down on the ground trying to comfort the seizure victim
  to whisper something into his ear or in some way help 
 even though they couldn 't and i had a lot of people come out of that piece saying oh my god i was so frustrated i couldn 't help the guy and take that back into their lives  
 so after this piece was made 
 the dean of the cinema school at usc the university of southern california  brought in the head of the world economic forum to try
  hunger and he took off the goggles and he commissioned a piece about syria on the spot  and i really wanted to do something about syrian refugee kids because
 children have been the worst affected by the syrian civil war 
 i sent a team to the border of iraq to record material at refugee camps
  basically an area i wouldn 't send a team now as that 's where isis is really operating  
 and then we also recreated a street scene
 in which a young girl is singing
 and a bomb goes off now
 when you 're in the middle of that scene and you hear those sounds 
 and you see the injured around you it 's an incredibly scary and real feeling  i 've had individuals who have been
 involved in real bombings tell me that
  it evokes the same kind of fear
  we were then invited to take the piece to the victoria and albert museum in london  
 and it wasn 't advertised  and we were put in this tapestry room 
 there was no press about it so anybody who happened to walk into the museum to visit it that day would see us with these crazy lights you know maybe they would want to see the old
  storytelling of the tapestries  they were confronted by our virtual reality cameras  but a lot of people tried it and over a five day run
 we ended up with fifty four pages of guest book comments  and we were told by the curators there that they 'd never seen such an outpouring 
 things like it 's so real absolutely believable or of course the one that i was excited about
  a real feeling as if you were in the middle of something that you normally see on the tv news 
 so it works right this stuff works  and it doesn 't really matter where you 're from or what age you are
 it 's really evocative now  don 't get me wrong i 'm not saying that when you 're in a piece you forget that you 're
 here  but it turns out we can feel like we 're in two
 places at once we can have what i call this duality of presence  and i think that 's what allows me to tap into these feelings
 of empathy  right  
 so
 that means of course that i have to be very cautious about creating these pieces i have to really follow best journalistic practices 
 and make sure that these powerful stories are built with integrity if we don 't capture the material ourselves we have
  to be extremely
 exacting about figuring out the provenance and where did this stuff come from and is it authentic 
 let me give you an example with this trayvon martin case this is a guy a kid who was seventeen years old and he he bought soda and a candy at a store and on his way home he was 
  tracked by a neighborhood watchman named george zimmerman who ended up shooting and killing him 
  that piece we got the architectural drawings of the entire complex  and we rebuilt the entire scene inside and out based on those drawings 
 all of the action is informed by the real nine hundred and eleven recorded calls to the police  
 and interestingly  we broke some news with this story the forensic house that did the audio reconstruction primeau productions they say that they would testify
 that george zimmerman when he got out of the car he cocked his gun before he went to give chase to martin
 so you can see that the basic tenets of journalism they don 't really change here right  we 're still following the same principles that we would always what is different 
 is the sense of being on scene whether you 're watching a guy collapse from hunger or feeling like you 're in the middle of a bomb scene 
 this is kind of what has driven me forward with these pieces and thinking about how to make
 them we 're trying to make this  obviously  beyond the headset more available we 're creating mobile pieces like the trayvon martin piece
 and these things have had impact  i 've had americans tell me that they 've donated  direct deductions from their bank account money to go to syrian children refugees and
  start a new form of doing journalism that i think is going to join all the other normal platforms in the future
