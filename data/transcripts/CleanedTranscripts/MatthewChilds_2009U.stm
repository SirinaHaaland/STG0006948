  it 's pretty simple there are nine sort of rules that i discovered after thirty five years of rock climbing 
 most of them are pretty basic  number one don 't let go
 very sure success method  but really truly often you think
  about letting go way before your body does  so hang in there  and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions  
 number two  hesitation is bad this is a friction climb up in tuolumne meadows in the yosemite high country
 friction climbing doesn 't have any sort of hard positive edges
  climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock the most friction you have is when you first put your hand or your
 foot on the rock  and then from that point on you 're basically falling
 falling so momentum is good  don 't stop 
 rule number three have a plan this is a climb called the naked edge in el dorado canyon outside of boulder  this climber is on the last pitch of it he 's actually right about where i fell
  one thousand feet of air below him  and all the hard pitches are actually below him
 often what happens is you 're planning so hard for like how do i get through the hardest part how do i get through the hardest part and then what happens you get to the last pitch it 
  's easy  and you 're completely flamed out  don 't do it you have to plan
  ahead to get to the top but you also can 't forget that each individual move you have to be able to complete this is a climb called the dike route on pywjack
  dome  up in the yosemite high country the interesting thing about this climb is it 's not that hard but if you 're the leader on it at the hardest move you 're looking at about one hundred foot fall onto some low angle slabs  so you 've got to
  you don 't want to stop in the middle like coleridge 's kubla kahn you 've got to keep going  
 rule number five know how to rest 
 it 's amazing the best climbers are the ones that in the most extreme situations can get their bodies into some position where they can rest 
 regroup  calm themselves focus  and keep going this
  is a climb in the needles again in california  fear really sucks because what it means is you 're not focusing on what you 're doing you 're focusing on the consequences of failing at what you 're doing
 because any given move should require all your
 concentration and thought processes to execute it effectively one of the things in climbing is 
 most people sort of take it straight on and they follow the most obvious solution this is
  the devils tower in wyoming which is a columnar basalt formation that most of you probably know from close encounters with this typically crack climbers would put their hands in and their toes in and just start climbing 
 the cracks are too small to get your toes into so the only way to climb is using your fingertips
  opposing pressure and forcing yourself up 
 rule number eight strength doesn 't always equal success in the thirty five years i 've been a climbing guide and taught on indoor walls and stuff like that the most important thing i 've learned was 
 guys will always try to do pull ups beginning guys it 's like they thrash they thrash they get fifteen feet up and they can do about fifteen pull ups
  they just flame out  women
 are much more in balance because they don 't have that idea that they 're going to be able to do one hundred pull ups they think about how to get the weight over their feet because it 
  's sort of natural they carry you all day long  so balance is really critical and keeping your weight on your feet  which is your strongest muscle
