  so about ten years ago i got a call from a woman in texas stacey baker  and she 'd seen some of my photographs in an art exhibition
 and was wondering if she could commission me to take a portrait of her parents  now at the time i hadn 't met stacey and
  thought this was some sort of wealthy oil tycoon and i 'd struck it rich  
 but it was only later that i found out she 'd actually taken out a loan to make this happen 
 i took the picture of her parents but i was actually more excited about photographing stacey the picture i made that day ended up becoming one of my
  the time i made this picture stacey was working as an attorney for the state of texas  not long after she left her job
 to study photography in maine and while she was there she ended up meeting the director of photography at the new york times magazine
 and was actually offered a job stacey baker 
 in the years since alec and i have done a number of magazine projects together  and we 've become friends a few months
  ago  i started talking to alec about a fascination of mine 
 i 've always been obsessed with how couples meet  
 i asked alec how he and his wife rachel met and he told me the story of a high school football game where she was sixteen and he was fifteen  
 and he asked her out he liked her purple hair she said yes  and that was it  
 i then asked alec if he
  be interested in doing a photography project exploring this question as
 and i was interested in the question but i was actually much more interested in stacey 's motivation for asking it
  particularly since i 'd never known stacey to have a boyfriend  so as part of this project  i thought it 'd be interesting if she tried to meet someone 
 so my idea was to have stacey here go speed dating
  in las vegas on valentine 's day 
 we ended up at what was advertised as the world 's largest speed dating event  i had nineteen dates
 and each date lasted three minutes  participants were given a list of ice breaker questions to get the ball rolling things like
 if you could be any kind of animal what would you be that sort of thing 
 my first date was colin  he 's from england  and he once married a woman he met after placing an ad for a capricorn 
 alec and i saw him at the end of the evening and he said he 'd kissed a woman in line at one of the concession
  matthew is attracted to women with muscular calves we talked about running he does triathlons i run
  liked his eyes and asked if i was attracted to him  but i wasn 't and i don 't think he was attracted to me either  
 austin and mike came together  
 mike asked me a hypothetical question  he said you 're in an elevator running late for a meeting 
 someone makes a dash for the elevator do you hold it open for them 
 and i said i would
  not 
 cliff said the first thing he notices about a woman is her teeth  
 and we complimented each other 's teeth
  because he 's an open mouth sleeper  he says he has to floss more to help prevent gum disease  and so i asked him how
  as someone who flosses twice a day  i wasn 't really sure that that was flossing more but i don 't think i said that out loud
 bill is an auditor  and we talked the entire three minutes about auditing 
 the first thing spencer notices about a woman is her complexion he feels a lot of women wear too
  much makeup  and that they should only wear enough to accentuate the features that they have i told him i didn 't wear any makeup at all and he seemed to think that that was a good thing  
 craig told me he didn 't think i was willing to be vulnerable
  he was also frustrated when i couldn 't remember my most embarrassing moment
  he thought i was lying but i wasn 't i didn 't think he liked me at all but at the end of the night he came back to me and he gave me a box of chocolates
  william was really difficult to talk to i think he was drunk 
 laughter actor chris mckenna was the mc of the event  he used to be on the young and the restless i didn 't actually go on a date with
  alec said he saw several women give their phone numbers to him  needless to say  i didn 't fall in love  
 i didn 't feel a particular connection with any of the men that i went on dates with and i didn 't feel like they felt
 a particular connection with me either as now  the most beautiful thing to me 
 as a photographer is the quality of vulnerability the physical exterior
  reveals a crack in which you can get a glimpse at a more fragile interior at this date a thon event i saw so many examples of that but as i
 watched stacey 's dates and talked to her about them  i realized how different photographic love is from
 real love  
  to work on this question and to figure out how someone goes from meeting on a date to having a life together  
 stacey and i went to sun city summerlin which is the largest retirement community
 in las vegas 
 our contact there was george who runs the community 's photography club he arranged for us to meet other couples in their makeshift photo studio
 sb after forty five years of marriage  anastasia 's husband died two years ago  so we asked if she had an old wedding picture 
 she met her husband when she was a 15 year old waitress at a small barbecue place in michigan 
 he was thirty she 'd lied about her age 
 he was the first person she 'd dated  
 dean had been named photographer of the year in las vegas two years in a row and this
  caught alec 's attention as did the fact that he met his wife judy at the same age when alec met rachel 
 dean admitted that he likes to look at beautiful women but he 's never questioned his decision to marry judy as 
 george met josephine at a parish dance he was eighteen she was fifteen like a lot of the couples
 george said said something that really stuck with me he said when you get that feeling you just go with it 
 bob and trudy met on a blind date when she was still in high school 
 they said they weren 't particularly attracted to each other when the first met 
 nevertheless they were married
  the story that stayed with me the most was that of george the photography club president  and his wife mary 
 this was george and mary 's second marriage  they met at a country western club in louisville kentucky called the sahara  
 he was there alone drinking and she was with friends  
 when they started dating he owed the irs nine thousand
 dollars in taxes  
 and she offered to help him get out of debt  so for the next year he turned his paychecks over to mary and she got him out of debt  
 george was actually an alcoholic when they married and mary knew it 
 at some point in their marriage he says he consumed fifty four beers in one day  
 another time when he was drunk he threatened to kill mary and her two kids  but they escaped
 and a swat team was was called to the house
  amazingly mary took him back and eventually things got better 
 george has been involved in alcoholics anonymous and hasn 't had a drink in thirty six years 
 at the end of the day after we left sun city i told alec that i didn 't actually think that the stories of how these couples met were all that interesting
  what was more interesting was how they managed to stay together as 
 they all had this beautiful quality of endurance  but that was true of the singles too 
 the world is hard and the singles were out there trying to connect with other people and the couples were holding onto each other after all these decades 
  my favorite pictures on this trip were of joe and roseanne  now by the time we met joe and roseanne we 'd gotten in the habit
 of asking couples if they had an old wedding photograph in their case  they simultaneously pulled out of their wallets
 the exact same photograph  
 what 's more beautiful i thought to myself this image of a young couple who has just fallen in love
 or the idea of these two
  people holding onto this image for decades  thank you
