  after having served four years in the united states marine corps and deployments to both iraq and afghanistan i
 found myself in port au prince leading a team of veterans and medical professionals in some of
  areas of that city  three days after the earthquake we
 were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go the places nobody else could go  and after three weeks  we realized something 
 military veterans are very very good at disaster response 
 and coming home my cofounder and i we looked at it and we said there are two problems 
 the first problem is there 's inadequate disaster response it 's slow it 's
  's not using the best technology and it 's not using the best people the second problem that we became aware of
 was a very inadequate veteran reintegration and this is a topic that is front page news right now as veterans are coming home from iraq and afghanistan  and they 're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life  
 and we sat here and we looked at these two problems and finally we came to a realization these aren 't problems these are actually solutions  and what do i mean by that well 
 we can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home
  recent surveys show that ninety two percent of veterans want to continue their service when they take off their uniform and we can use veterans
 to improve disaster response  
 now on the surface this makes a lot of sense and in two thousand and ten we responded to the tsunami in in chile  the floods in pakistan we sent training teams to the thai burma border  but it was earlier this year  
 when one of our original members
 caused us to shift focus in the
  organization this is clay hunt  clay was a marine with me we served together in iraq and afghanistan  clay was with us in port au prince he was also with us in chile  
 earlier this year in march  clay took his own life  this was a tragedy  but it really forced us
 to refocus what it is that we were doing you know  clay didn 't kill himself because of what happened in iraq and afghanistan clay killed himself
 because of what he lost when he came home  
 he lost purpose  he lost his community and perhaps most tragically  he lost his self worth 
 and so as we evaluated and as the dust settled from this tragedy  we realized that of those two problems
 in the initial iteration of our organization  we were a disaster response organization that was using veteran
  service we had a lot of success and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm  but after clay we shifted that focus 
 and suddenly now moving forward we see ourselves as a veteran service organization that 's using disaster response 
 because we think that we can give
 that purpose and that community
  back to the veteran and tornadoes in tuscaloosa and joplin and then later hurricane irene gave us an opportunity to look at that now i want you to imagine for a second
 an 18 year old boy who graduates from high school in kansas city missouri  he joins the army the army gives him a rifle  they send him to iraq  
 every day he leaves the wire with a mission 
 that mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left
  it 's to keep the men around him alive it 's to pacify the village that he works in  he 's got a purpose  but he comes home [ to ] kansas city missouri  
 maybe he goes to college maybe he 's got a job  but he doesn 't have that same sense of purpose  you give him a chainsaw you send him to joplin missouri after a tornado  he regains that 
 going back that same 18 year old boy graduates from high school in kansas city missouri joins the army the army gives him a rifle they send him to iraq  
 every day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him he leaves the wire he knows that those
  people have his back  he 's slept in the same sand they 've lived together they 've eaten together  they 've bled together  he goes home to kansas city missouri  
 he gets out of the military he takes his uniform off  he doesn 't have that community anymore 
 but you drop twenty five of those veterans in joplin missouri  they get that sense of community back  
 again you have an
  graduates high school in kansas city he joins the army the army gives him a rifle they send him to iraq  
 they pin a medal on his chest he goes home to a ticker tape parade  
 he takes the uniform off  he 's no longer sergeant jones in his community he 's now dave from kansas city he doesn 't have that same self worth 
 but you send him to joplin after a tornado and somebody once again is walking up to him and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service now
