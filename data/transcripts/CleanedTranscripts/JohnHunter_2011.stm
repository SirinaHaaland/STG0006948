  very fortunate to be here i feel so fortunate  
 i 've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me  
 i called my wife leslie and i said you know  there 's so many good people trying to do so much good it feels like i 've landed in a colony of angels
 it 's a true feeling but
 let me get to the talk i see the clock is running  
 i 'm a public school teacher  
 and i just want to share a story of my superintendent her name is pam moran in albemarle county virginia  the foothills of the blue ridge mountains  
 and she 's a very
  uses smart boards she blogs she tweets she does facebook she does all this sort of high tech stuff she 's a
 technology leader and instructional leader  but in her office there 's this old
 wooden
 table kitchen table
 peeling green paint it 's kind of rickety  and i said pam you 're such a modern cutting edge person  why is this old table in your office 
 and she told me she said you know i grew up
 in southwestern virginia in the coal
  mines and the farmlands of rural virginia  and this table was in my grandfather 's kitchen  
 and we 'd come in from playing he 'd come in from plowing and working and we 'd sit around that table every night 
 and as i grew up i heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom
 come out around this table i began to call it the wisdom
  and when he passed on i took this table with me and brought it to my office and it reminds me of him it reminds me of what goes on around an empty space
 sometimes 
 the project i 'm going to tell you about is called the world peace game 
 and essentially it is also an empty space and i 'd like to think of it as a 21st century
 wisdom table really it all started back in
  and
 i had been
 dropping in and out of college 
 and my parents were very patient  but i had been doing intermittent sojourns to india on a mystical quest  
 and i remember the last time i came back from india in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my
  and so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something so i got a degree and it turned out to be education 
 it was an experimental education program it could have been dentistry but the word experimental
  and so that 's what i had to go for  and i
 went in for a job interview in the richmond public schools in virginia the capital city  bought a three piece suit my concession to convention kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes at the time it was the ' 70s
 and i walked in and i sat down and had an interview and i guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor her name was anna aro said i had
  gifted education hadn 't really taken hold too much there weren 't really many materials or things to use  and i said what do i do and her answer
 shocked me it stunned me her answer set the template for the entire career i was to have after that 
 she said what do you
  want to do and that question cleared the space there was no program directive no manual to follow 
 no standards in gifted education in that way  
 and she cleared such a space that i endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students an empty space whereby they could
  and i
 was teaching many years later and
 a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker his name is chris farina 
 chris farina is here today at his own cost chris could you stand up and let them see you a young visionary filmmaker
 he proposed the film to me it 's a great title  he proposed the film to me and i said yeah 
 maybe it 'll be on local tv and we can say hi to our friends 
 but the film has really gone places now it 's still in debt but chris has managed through his own sacrifice to get this film out 
 so we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me more than a story about one teacher it 's a story that 's a testament
  to teaching and teachers and it 's a beautiful thing and the strange thing is when i watch the film
 i have the eerie sensation of seeing it i saw myself literally disappear what i saw was
 my teachers coming through me  i saw my geometry teacher in high school
  under his handlebar mustache  that 's the smile i use that 's his smile 
 i saw jan polo 's flashing eyes  and they weren 't flashing in anger they were flashing in love intense love for her students  
 and i have that kind of flash sometimes  and i saw miss ethel j banks
 who wore pearls and high heels
  and i 'm not even talking about you behind me because i 've got eyes in the back of my head you
 know that teacher i didn 't use that stare very often but i do have it in my repertoire  
 and miss banks was there as a great mentor for me and then i saw
 my own parents my first teachers my father very inventive  spatial thinker that 's my brother malcolm there on the right 
 and my mother who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in virginia  who was my inspiration  and
 really i feel as though when i see the film i
 i have a gesture she does like this
 i feel like i am a continuation of her gesture i am one of her teaching gestures 
 and the beautiful thing was i got to teach my daughter in elementary school madeline  
 and so that gesture of my mother 's continues through many generations  
 it 's an amazing feeling to have that that lineage  and so i 'm here standing on the shoulders of many people i 'm not here alone  there are many people on this stage right now
 and so
 this world peace game i 'd like to tell you about 
 it started out like this it 's just a four foot by five foot plywood board in in an inner city urban school one thousand nine 
 creating a lesson for students on africa we put all the problems of the world there and i thought let 's let them solve it i didn 't want to lecture or have just book reading  i wanted to have them
  immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies  so i thought well they like to play games i 'll make something
 i didn 't say interactive we didn 't have that term in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight but something interactive  and so we made the game  and it has since evolved to a
 there 's an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining there 's an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push 
  around and territorial air spaces and air forces a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining
  kids make up the names of the countries some are rich some are poor they have different assets commercial and military and each country has a cabinet  
 there 's a prime minister secretary of state minister of defense and a cfo or comptroller  i choose the prime minister based on my relationship with them i offer them the job they can turn it down 
 and then they choose their own cabinet  there 's a world bank  arms dealers and a united nations there 's also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather
  not all  and then there 's a 
 crisis document with fifty interlocking problems so that if one thing changes  everything else changes i throw them into this complex matrix and they trust me because we have a deep rich relationship together  
 and so with all these crises  we have let 's see ethnic and minority tensions  we have chemical
  nuclear spills  nuclear proliferation  there 's oil spills environmental disasters  water rights disputes breakaway republics  famine endangered species
  and global warming if al gore is here  i 'm going to send my fourth graders from agnor hurt and venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week
  several times too so i also have in the game a saboteur
 some child it 's basically a troublemaker
 and i have my troublemaker
 put to use because they on the surface are trying to save the world and their position in the game  but they 're also trying to undermine everything in the game  
 and they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies trying to cause
  to think more deeply  
 the saboteur is there and we also read from sun tzu 's the art of war fourth graders understand it nine years old and they handle that and use that to understand how to not follow
 at first they do the paths to power and destruction  the path to war
 they learn to overlook
  reactions and impulsive thinking to think in a 
 more consequential way  stewart brand is here and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a coevolution quarterly article
 on a peace force and in the game sometimes students actually form a peace force  i 'm just a
 clock watcher  i 'm just a clarifier i 'm just a facilitator the students run the game i have no chance to make any policy
  take care of the world see mr hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot  and he 's trying to tell us how to fix that problem john hunter 
 i offered them a actually i
 can 't tell them anything because i don 't know the answer and i admit the truth to them right up front i don 't know
  i don 't know they 've got to dig up the answer  and so i apologize to them as well i say i 'm so sorry  boys and girls  
 but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape
 and we hope you can fix it for us and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it it 's a sincere apology and they take it very seriously
 now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like
  start here 's what you see jh all right we 're going into negotiations as of now go jh 
 my question to you is who 's in charge of that classroom  
 it 's a serious question who is really in charge  i 've learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time there 's a trust
  an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that i simply don 't have to do what i thought i had to do as a beginning teacher control every conversation and response in the classroom  
 it 's impossible their collective wisdom is much greater than mine  and i admit it to them openly  
 so i 'll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things
  in this game we had a little girl and she was the defense minister of the poorest nation 
 and the defense minister she had the tank corps and air force and so forth  and she was next door to a very wealthy oil rich neighbor  
 without provocation suddenly she attacked against her prime minister 's orders 
 the next door neighbor 's oil fields she marched into the oil field reserves surrounded it  without firing a shot and secured it and held it and that neighbor was unable to conduct any military
  operations because their fuel supply was locked up we were all upset with her why are you doing this this is the world peace game what is wrong with you this
 was a little girl
 and at nine years old she held her pieces and said i know what i 'm doing 
 to her girlfriends she said that that 's a breach there and we learned in this you don 't really ever want to cross a nine year old girl with tanks
 they are the toughest opponents  
 and we were very upset i thought i was failing as a teacher why would she do this  but come to find out a few game days later and there are turns where we take
 negotiation from a team actually there 's a negotiation period with all teams  and each team takes a turn then we go back in
  so each turn around is one game day  so a few game days later it came to light
 that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world 
 had they had their fuel supplies they would have done it  she was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us
 and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game  now she used a small war to avert a larger
  war so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right 
 conditional good or not right 
 that 's the kind of thinking that we put them in the situations i could not have designed that in teaching it it came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom 
  beautiful thing happened we have a letter in the game if you 're a military commander and you wage troops the little plastic toys on the board and you lose them i put in a letter 
 you have to write a letter to their parents
 the fictional parents of your fictional troops explaining what happened and offering your condolences  
 so you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat
 and so we had this situation come up last summer actually
 at agnor hurt school in albemarle county
 and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said mr hunter 
 let 's ask there 's a parent over there there was a parent visiting that day just sitting in the back of the room let 's ask that mom to read the letter it 'll be more realer if she reads it 
 so we did we asked her and she gamely picked up the letter sure she started reading she read one sentence  she read two sentences  by the third
  sentence she was in tears  i was in tears  
 everybody understood that when we lose somebody  the winners are not gloating  we all lose  
 and it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding i 'll show you what my friend david says about this he 's been in many battles david we 've really had
  'm feeling really weird because i 'm living what sun tzu said
 one week one week he said those who go into battle and win
 will want to go back and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win and so i 've been winning battles so i 'm going
  i think it 's sort of weird to be living what sun tzu said jh 
 i get chills every time i see that 
 that 's the kind of engagement you want to have happen and i can 't design that i can 't plan that and i can 't even test that 
 but it 's self evident assessment  we know that 's an authentic assessment of learning
 we have a lot of data but i think sometimes we go beyond data with the real
  truth of what 's going on 
  just share a third story this is about my friend brennan we had played the game one
 session after school for many weeks about seven weeks  and we had essentially solved all fifty of the interlocking crises the way the game is won is all fifty problems have to be
  every country 's asset value has to be increased above its starting point some are poor some are wealthy there are billions the
 world bank president was a third grader one time he says how many zeros in a trillion  i 've got to calculate that right away but he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him 
 so
 the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer  
 there was no way they could win  and we were approaching four o 'clock our cut off time there was about a minute left
 and despair just settled
  over the room i thought i 'm failing as a teacher  i should have gotten it so they could have won 
 they shouldn 't be failing like this i 've failed them  
 and i was just feeling so sad and dejected and suddenly brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell the bell i ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets and he ran
  everybody ran to his chair there was screaming  there was yelling waving of their dossiers they get these dossiers full of secret documents  
 they were gesticulating they were running around i didn 't know what they were doing i 'd lost control of my classroom  
 principal walks in i 'm out of a job
 the parents were looking in the window and brennan runs back to his seat everybody runs back to their seat he rings the bell again he says we have and there 's twelve seconds left on
  we have all nations pooled all our funds together and we 've got six hundred billion dollars we 're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country and if they accept it it 'll raise their asset value and we can win the game will you accept it 
 and there are three seconds left on the clock  everybody looks at this prime minister of that country 
 and he says yes and the game is won  spontaneous compassion
 that could not be planned for that was unexpected and unpredictable
 every game we play is different some games are more about social issues some are more about economic issues  
 some games are more about warfare  but i don 't try to deny them that reality of being human 
 i allow them to go there and through their own experience learn in a bloodless way 
 how not to do
 what they consider to be the wrong thing and they find out what is right their own way their own selves
  and so in this game i 've learned so much from it  but i would say that if
 if only
 they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game
 and leverage something good for the world  they may save
