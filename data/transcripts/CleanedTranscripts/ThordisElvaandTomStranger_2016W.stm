  when i was eighteen years old i had the golden opportunity to go on an international exchange program  ironically i 'm an australian
  who prefers proper icy cold weather so i was both excited and tearful
 when i got on a plane to iceland after just having farewelled my parents and brothers goodbye  i was welcomed into the home of a beautiful icelandic family
 who took me hiking  and helped me get a grasp of the melodic icelandic language 
 i struggled a bit with the initial period of homesickness i snowboarded after school  and i slept a lot 
 two hours of chemistry class in a language that you don 't yet
  understand can be a pretty good sedative 
 laughter my teacher recommended i try out for the school play just to get me a bit more socially active it
 turns out i didn 't end up being part of the play  but through it i met thordis 
 we shared a lovely teenage romance and we 'd meet at lunchtimes to just hold hands and walk around old downtown reykjavk i met her welcoming family
 and she met my friends we 'd been in a budding relationship for a bit over a month when our school 's christmas ball was held thordis elva 
 i was sixteen and in love for the first time  
 going together to the christmas dance was a public confirmation of our relationship  and i felt like the luckiest girl in the world  
 no longer a child but a young woman
  my newfound maturity  i felt it was only natural to try drinking rum for the first time that night too 
 that was a bad idea
  i became very ill drifting in and out of consciousness in between spasms of convulsive vomiting 
 the security guards wanted to call me an ambulance  but tom acted as my knight in
  and told them he 'd take me home it was like a fairy tale  his strong arms around me  laying me in the safety of my bed  
 but the gratitude that i felt towards him soon turned to horror
 as he proceeded to take off my clothes
 and get on top of me  
 my head had cleared up but my body was still too weak to fight back and the pain was blinding  i thought i 'd be severed in two
 in order to stay sane i silently counted the seconds on my alarm clock  
 and ever since that night i 've known that there are seven thousand two hundred seconds in two hours 
 despite limping for days and crying for weeks this incident
 didn 't fit my ideas about rape like i 'd seen on tv 
 tom wasn 't an armed lunatic he was my boyfriend  and it didn 't happen in a seedy alleyway  it happened in my own bed  
 by the time i could identify what had happened to me as rape he had completed his exchange program and left for australia 
 so i told myself it was pointless to address what had happened 
  it had to have been my fault somehow  
 i was raised in a world where girls are taught that they get raped for a reason 
 their skirt was too short  their smile was too wide their breath smelled of alcohol  
 and i was guilty of all of those things so the shame had to be mine  
 it took me years to realize that only one thing could have stopped me from being raped that night  and it wasn 't
  skirt  it wasn 't my smile  it wasn 't my childish trust  
 the only thing that could 've stopped me from being raped that night is the man who raped me
 had he stopped himself ts i have vague memories of the next day  
 the after effects of drinking a certain hollowness that i tried
 but i didn 't show up at thordis 's door 
 it is important to now state that i didn 't see my deed for what it was 
 the word rape didn 't echo around my mind as it should 've and i wasn 't crucifying myself with memories of the night before it wasn
 't so much a conscious refusal it was more like any acknowledgment of reality was forbidden
  my definition of my actions completely refuted any recognition of the immense trauma i caused  thordis 
 to be honest  i repudiated the entire act
 in the days afterwards
 and when i was committing it 
 i disavowed the truth by convincing myself it was sex and not rape  and this is a lie
 spine bending guilt for 
 i broke up with thordis a couple of days later and then saw her a number of times during the remainder of my year in iceland  
 feeling a sharp stab of heavyheartedness each time 
 deep down i knew i 'd done something immeasurably wrong  
 but without planning it i sunk the memories deep  and then i tied a rock to them
  what followed is a nine year period that can best be titled as denial and running 
 when i got a chance to identify the real torment that i caused  i didn 't stand still long enough to do so whether it
 be via distraction  substance use thrill seeking or
 the scrupulous policing of my inner speak  i refused to be static and silent
 with this noise i also drew heavily upon other parts of my life to construct a picture of who i was  
 i was a surfer a social science student a friend to good people a loved brother and son  
 an outdoor recreation guide  and eventually a youth worker  
 i gripped tight to the simple notion that i wasn 't a bad person
 i didn 't think i had this in my bones i thought i was made up of something else 
 in my nurtured upbringing my loving extended family and role models 
 people close to me were warm and genuine in their respect shown towards women it
 took me a long time to stare down this dark corner of myself and to ask it questions
  nine years after the christmas dance i was twenty five years old and headed straight for a nervous breakdown 
 my self worth was buried under a soul crushing load of silence that isolated me from everyone that i cared about 
 and i was consumed with misplaced hatred and anger that i took out on myself 
 one day  i stormed out of the door in tears after a fight with a loved one
  and i wandered into a caf where i asked the waitress for a pen  
 i always had a notebook with me  claiming that it was to jot down ideas in moments of inspiration  but the truth
 was that i needed to be constantly fidgeting because in moments of stillness  i found myself counting seconds again 
 but that day i watched in wonder as the words streamed out of my pen
  forming the most pivotal letter i 've ever written addressed to tom 
 along with an account of the violence that he subjected me to the words i want to find forgiveness stared back at me  surprising nobody more than myself  
 but deep down i realized that this was my way out of my suffering because regardless of whether or not he deserved my forgiveness
 i deserved peace my era of shame was over 
 before sending the letter i prepared myself for all kinds of negative responses or what i found likeliest  no response whatsoever  
 the only outcome that i didn 't prepare myself for was the one that i then got
 a typed confession from tom
  of disarming regret as it turns out he too had been imprisoned by silence  and this marked the start of an
  correspondence that god knows was never easy but always honest  i relieved myself of the burdens that i 'd wrongfully shouldered
  and he in turn wholeheartedly owned up to what he 'd done 
 our written exchanges became a platform to dissect the consequences of that night  
 and they were everything from gut wrenching to healing beyond words  
 and yet it didn 't bring about closure for me  
 perhaps because the email format didn 't feel personal enough  perhaps because it 's easy to be brave when you 're hiding behind a computer screen on the other side of the planet  
 but we 'd begun a
  dialogue that i felt was necessary to explore to its fullest 
 so after eight years of writing and nearly sixteen years after that dire night  
 i mustered the courage to propose a wild idea 
 that we 'd meet up in person and face our past once and for all ts 
 iceland and australia are geographically like this
 in the middle of the two is south africa  we decided upon the city of cape town  and there we met for one week 
 the city itself proved to be a stunningly powerful environment to focus on reconciliation and forgiveness  
 nowhere else has healing and rapprochement been tested like it has in south africa 
 as a nation south africa sought to sit within
  the truth of its past  and to listen to the details of its history  
 knowing this only magnified the effect that cape town had on us 
 over the course of this week  we literally spoke our life stories to each other from start to finish  
 and this was about analyzing our own history  
 we followed a strict policy of being honest
 and this also came with a certain exposure an open chested vulnerability there were gutting confessions  and moments where we just
 absolutely couldn 't fathom the other person 's experience  
 the seismic effects of sexual violence were spoken aloud and felt face to face
  we found a soaring clarity  and even some
 totally unexpected but liberating laughter when it came down to it we did out best
 to listen to each other intently  and our individual realities were aired with an an unfiltered purity
 that couldn 't do any less than lighten the soul
 wanting to take revenge is a very human emotion
 instinctual even and all i wanted to do for years was to hurt tom back as deeply as he had hurt me  
 but had i not found a way out of the hatred and anger i 'm not sure i 'd be standing here today 
  to say that i didn 't have my doubts along the way 
 when the plane bounced on that landing strip in cape town  i remember thinking why did i not just get myself a therapist and a bottle of vodka like 
  a normal person would do 
 at times our search for understanding in cape town felt like an impossible quest 
 and all i wanted to do was to give up and go home to my loving husband vidir and our son
 but despite our difficulties this journey did result in a victorious feeling
 that light had triumphed over darkness that something constructive could be built out of the ruins  
 i read somewhere that you should try and be the person that you needed when you were younger  and back when i was a teenager
  i would have needed to know that the shame wasn 't mine that there 's hope after rape 
 that you can even find happiness like i share with my husband today  
 which is why i started writing feverishly upon my return from cape town 
 resulting in a book co authored by tom that we hope can be of use to people from both ends of the 
  scale if nothing else
  else  it 's a story that we would 've needed to hear when we were younger  
 given the nature of our story i know the words that inevitably accompany it
 victim  rapist and labels are a way to organize concepts but they can also be dehumanizing in their
  once someone 's been deemed a victim  it 's that much easier to file them away as someone damaged  
 dishonored less than  
 and likewise once someone has been branded a rapist it 's that much easier to call him a monster
 inhuman  but how will we understand what it is in human societies that produces violence
 if we refuse to recognize the humanity of those who commit it
 and how 
 and how can we empower survivors if we 're making them feel less than 
 how can we discuss solutions to one of the biggest threats to the lives of women and children around the world 
 if the very words we use are part of the
  what i 've now learnt my actions that night in 
 were a self centered taking i felt deserving of thordis 's body 
 i 've had primarily positive social influences and examples of equitable behavior around me  
 but on that occasion  i chose to draw upon the negative ones 
  ones that see women as having less intrinsic worth and of men having some unspoken and symbolic claim to their bodies  
 these influences i speak of are external to me though  
 and it was only me in that room making choices  nobody else 
 when you own something and really square up to your culpability  i do think a surprising thing can happen
 it 's what i call a paradox of ownership
 i thought i 'd buckle under the weight of responsibility  i thought my certificate of humanity would be burnt  
 instead  i was offered to really own what i did and found that it didn 't possess the entirety of who i am  
 put simply something you 've done
 doesn 't have to constitute the sum of who you are
  the noise in my head abated  the indulgent self pity was starved of oxygen  and it was replaced
 with the clean air of acceptance
 an acceptance that i did hurt this wonderful person standing next to me 
 an acceptance that i am part of a large and shockingly everyday grouping of men who have been sexually violent toward their partners
 't underestimate the power of words  saying to thordis that i raped her
 changed my accord with myself as well as with her  
 but most importantly  the blame transferred from thordis to me  far too often the responsibility
  is attributed to female survivors of sexual violence and not to the males who enact it  
 far too often  the denial and running
 leaves all parties at a great distance from the truth 
 there 's definitely a public conversation happening now 
 and like a lot of people  we 're heartened that there 's less retreating from this difficult but important discussion  
 i feel a real responsibility to
  add our voices to it te 
 what we did is not a formula that we 're prescribing for others  
 nobody has the right to tell anyone else how to handle their deepest pain
 or their greatest error  breaking your silence is never
  and depending on where you are in the world it can even be deadly to speak out about rape  
 i realize that even the most traumatic event of my life is still a testament to my privilege because i can talk about it without getting ostracized or even killed  
 but with that privilege of having a voice
 comes the responsibility of using it
  that 's the least i owe my fellow survivors
 who can 't 
 the story we 've just relayed is unique  and yet it is so common with sexual violence being a global pandemic  
 but it doesn 't have to be that way 
 one of the things that i found useful on my own healing journey is educating myself about sexual violence and as a result i 've been reading
  writing and speaking about this issue for over a decade now  going to conferences around the world 
 and in my experience  the attendees of such events are almost exclusively women  
 but it 's about time that we stop treating sexual violence as a women 's issue
  a majority of sexual violence
 against women and men is perpetrated by men  and yet their voices are sorely underrepresented in this discussion
 but all of us are needed
 here just imagine all the suffering we could alleviate if we
  dared to face this issue together
