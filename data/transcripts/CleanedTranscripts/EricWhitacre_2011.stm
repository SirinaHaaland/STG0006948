  i wanted to be a rock star  i dreamed of it and that 's all i dreamed of to be more accurate i wanted to be a pop star  this was in the late ' 80s and
 mostly i wanted to be the fifth member of depeche mode or duran
  they wouldn 't have me  i didn 't read music but i played synthesizers and drum machines  and i grew up in this little farming town in northern nevada  and i was certain that 's what my life would be and when i went to college at the university of nevada las vegas when i was eighteen 
 i was stunned to find that there was not
 a
 pop star one hundred and one or even a degree program for that interest  and the choir conductor there
 knew that i sang and invited me to come and join the choir  and i said
  i would love to do that it sounds great and i left the room and said no way 
 the choir people in my high school were pretty geeky  and there was no way i was going to have anything to do with those people 
 and about a week later a friend of mine came to me and said listen you 've got to join choir at the end of the semester we 're taking a trip to mexico all expenses paid and the soprano section is just full of
 hot girls and so i figured for mexico
  and babes i could do just about anything
  and i went to my first day in choir  and i sat down with the basses and sort of looked over my shoulder to see what they were doing they opened their scores the conductor gave the downbeat 
 and boom they launched into the kyrie from the requiem by mozart 
 the most transformative experience i 've ever had in that single moment hearing dissonance and harmony
 and people singing  people together the shared vision  and i felt for the first time in my life that i was part of something bigger than myself 
 and there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section as it turns out 
 i decided to write a piece for
 for choir a couple of years later as a gift
  to this conductor who had changed my life 
 i had learned to read music by then or slowly learning to read music and that piece was published  and then i wrote another piece and that got published and then i started conducting and i
 ended up doing my master 's degree at the juilliard school and i find myself now in the unlikely position of standing in front of all of you as a professional classical
  composer and conductor well a couple of years ago a friend of mine emailed me
 a link a youtube link and said you have got to see this and it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me singing the soprano line to a piece of mine called
  for you here 's
  was so innocent and so sweet and
 her voice was so pure  and i even loved seeing behind her i could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room such an intimate video  
 and i had this idea  if i could get fifty people to all do this same thing sing their parts soprano alto tenor and bass wherever they were in the world post their videos to
  for the last time in public ever 
 and i sent out this call to singers  and i made free the the download of the music to a piece that i had written in the year two thousand called lux aurumque which means light and gold 
 and lo and behold people started uploading their videos now i should say before that what i did is i posted a
  conductor track of myself conducting  
 and it 's in complete silence when i filmed it because i was only hearing the music in my head imagining the choir that would one day come to be 
 afterwards i played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to 
 and then as the videos started to come in
  there was even a little soprano solo in the piece and so i had auditions and a number of sopranos uploaded their parts i was told later and also by
 lots of singers who were involved in this that they sometimes recorded fifty or sixty
  takes until they got just the right take they uploaded it here 's our winner of the soprano solo  this is melody myers from tennessee
  and from the crowd
 emerged this young man scott haines and he said 
 listen this is the project i 've been looking for for my whole life i 'd like to be the person to edit this all together i said thank you scott i 'm so glad
  and scott aggregated all of the videos he scrubbed the audio  he made sure that everything lined up  and then we posted this video to youtube about a year and a half ago  this is lux aurumque sung by the virtual choir
  room
 the
  stop it there in the interest of time
  i had the same reaction you did i actually was moved to tears when i first saw it i just couldn 't believe the poetry of all of it
  these souls all on their own desert island sending electronic messages in bottles to each other  
 and the the video went viral we had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it and because of that then a lot of singers started saying all right what 's virtual choir two point zero 
 and so i decided for virtual choir two point zero that i would choose the same piece that britlin was singing sleep which is another work that i wrote in the year two thousand
 poetry by my dear friend charles anthony silvestri and again i posted a conductor video
  and we started accepting submissions this time we got some more mature members
  georgie from england she 's only nine isn 't that the sweetest thing you 've ever seen someone did all eight videos a bass even singing
  video where they all sang lollipop and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody and there were nine hundred people involved in that so i told the singers that 's our goal that 's the number for us to beat 
 and we just closed submissions
 january 10th and our final tally was two thousand and fifty one videos from fifty eight different countries
  as far north as alaska and as far south as new zealand  and we also put a page on facebook
 for the singers to to upload their testimonials what it was like for them their experience singing it and i 've
 just chosen a few of them here my sister and i used to sing in choirs together constantly now she 's an airman in the air force constantly traveling it 's so
  wonderful to sing together again 
 i love the idea that she 's singing with her sister aside from the beautiful music it 's great just to know i 'm part of a worldwide community of people i never met before but who are connected anyway 
 and my personal favorite when i told my husband that i was going to be a part of this he told me that i did not have the voice for it yeah 
 i 'm sure a lot of you have
  it hurt so much and i shed some tears  but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words it is a dream come true to be part of this choir 
 as i 've never been part of one 
 when i placed a marker on the google earth map i had to go with the nearest city  which is about four hundred miles away from where i live 
 as i am in the great alaskan bush  satellite is my connection to the world 
 so two things struck me deeply about this the first is that human beings will go to any lengths necessary to find and connect with
  with each other  it doesn 't matter the technology  and the second is that people seem to be experiencing
 an actual connection it wasn 't a virtual choir there are people now online that are friends they 've never met but i know myself too i feel this virtual esprit 
  de corps  if you will with all of them  i feel a closeness to this choir almost like a family
  close with then today is
 the the first look at sleep by virtual choir two point zero this will be a premiere today we
 're not finished with the video yet you can imagine with two thousand synchronized youtube videos the render time is just atrocious
  but we
 we do have the first three minutes and it 's a tremendous honor for me to be
  to you here first you 're the very first people to see this this is
