  over the last two decades india has become a global hub for software development and
 offshoring of back office services as we call it  and
 what we were interested in finding out was that
 because of this huge
 industry that has started over the last two decades in india  offshoring software development and back office services there 's been a flight of white collar jobs from the developed world to india  
 when this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to china  it has  you know led to considerable angst amongst
  in fact if you look at polls they show a declining
 trend for support for free trade in the west
  now the western elites however have said this fear is misplaced for example  if you have read i suspect many of you have done so read the book by thomas friedman called the world is flat 
 he said  basically in his book
  you know this fear for free trade is
 wrong because it assumes it 's based on a mistaken assumption that everything that can be invented has been invented  
 in fact he says it 's innovation that will keep the west ahead of the developing world with the
 more sophisticated innovative tasks being done in the developed world  and the less sophisticated shall we say drudge work being done in the developing world
  what we were trying to understand was is this true could india become
 a source or a global hub of innovation  just like it 's become a global hub for back office services and software development 
 and for the last four years my coauthor phanish puranam and i spent investigating this topic  
  you know as people would say  you know  in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting the western innovative model say where are the indian googles ipods and viagras  
 if the indians are so bloody smart 
 so initially when we started our research we went and met several executives and we asked them what do you think
  will india go from being a favored destination for software services and back office services to a
 destination for innovation they laughed  they dismissed us
  they said you know what indians don 't do innovation 
 the more polite ones said well you know indians make good software programmers and accountants but they can 't do the creative stuff 
 sometimes it took a more  took a veneer of sophistication  and people said you know it 's nothing to do with indians it 's really the rule based
  education system in india that is responsible for killing all creativity 
 they said instead if you want to see real creativity go to silicon valley  and look at companies like google  microsoft intel 
 so we started examining the r & d and innovation labs
 of silicon valley  
 well interestingly what you find there is usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab or the r & d center as they may call it and more often than not it 's an indian
 i immediately said well but you could not have been educated in india right you must have gotten your education here 
 it turned out in every single case they came out of the indian educational system  
 so we realized that maybe we had the wrong question  and the right question is really can indians based out of india
 do innovative work  so off we went to india we made  i think
  a dozen trips to bangalore mumbai gurgaon delhi  hyderabad you name it to examine what is the level of corporate innovation in these
 in these cities  and what we found was as we progressed in our research was 
 that we were asking really the wrong question  when you ask where are the indian googles  ipods and viagras 
 you are taking a particular perspective on innovation  which is innovation for end
  users  visible innovation  
 instead innovation  if you remember  
 some of you may have read the famous economist schumpeter he said innovation is novelty in how value is created and distributed 
 it could be new products and services  but it could also be new ways of producing products it could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries 
 once you take this there 's no reason to
  restrict innovation the beneficiaries of innovation  just to end users  
 when you take this broader conceptualization of innovation what we found was india is well represented in innovation  but the innovation that is being done in india is 
  of a form we did not anticipate  and what we did was we called it invisible innovation 
  the first type of invisible innovation out of india is what we call innovation for business customers which is led by the multinational corporations 
 which have in the last two decades  there have been seven hundred and fifty r  & d centers set up in india by multinational companies employing more than four hundred
  when you consider the fact
 that historically the r & d center of a multinational company was always in the headquarters or in the country of origin
 of that multinational company to have seven hundred and fifty r & d centers of multinational corporations in india
 is truly a remarkable figure  when we went and talked to the people in those innovation centers and asked them what are they working on they said we are working on global products
  not working on localizing global products for india  which is the usual role role of a local r & d they were working on truly global products and companies like microsoft 
  google  astrazeneca  general electric philips have already answered in the affirmative the question that from their bangalore and hyderabad
 but of course  as an end user you don 't see that because you only see the name of the company  not where it was developed 
 the other thing we were told then was yes but you know the kind of work that is coming out of the indian r & d center cannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out of the u s r & d centers 
 so my coauthor phanish puranam who happens
  to be one of the smartest people i know said
 he 's going to do a study what he did was he looked at those companies that had an r  & d center in usa and in india  
 and then he looked at a patent that was filed out of the u s and a similar patent filed out of the same company 's subsidiary in india  
 so he 's now comparing the patents of r & d centers in the u s with r & d centers in india of the same company
 to find out what is the quality of the patents filed out of the indian centers and how do they compare with the quality of the
  patents filed out of the u s centers  interestingly  what he finds is
  is what we call forward citations how many times does a future patent
 reference the older patent he finds something very interesting  what we find is
 that the data says that the number of forward citations of a patent filed out of
  to the number of forward citations of a patent filed by an indian subsidiary of the same company within that company  
 so within the company  there 's no difference in the forward citation rates of their indian subsidiaries versus their u s subsidiaries so that 's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of india the
 second kind of invisible
 innovation coming out of india is what we call outsourcing innovation to indian companies where many companies today
 are contracting indian companies to do a major part of their product development work
 for their global products which are going to be sold to the entire world 
 for example in the pharma industry a lot of the molecules are being developed but you see a major part of that work is being sent to india 
 for example
  they developed two of the mission critical systems for the new boeing seven hundred and eighty seven dreamliner one to avoid
 collisions in the sky  and another to allow landing in zero visibility  
 but of course when you climb onto the boeing seven hundred and eighty seven you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation out of india  
 the third kind of invisible innovation coming out of india is what we call process
  because of an injection of intelligence by indian firms
 process innovation is different from product innovation  it 's about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product but not a new product itself 
 only in india
 do millions of young people dream of working in a call center  
 what happens you know it 's a dead end job in the west  what high school dropouts do
 what happens when you put
 hundreds of thousands of smart  young ambitious kids on a call center job very quickly they get bored  
 and they start
 innovating  
 and they start telling the boss how to do this job better and out of this process innovation comes product innovations which are then marketed around the world for example
  call center company  used to be a traditional call center company  today they 're developing analytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before you pick up the phone  you can
 guess or predict
 what this phone call is about it
 's because of an injection of intelligence into a process which was considered dead for a long time in the west  and the last kind of innovation invisible innovation coming out
  innovation coming out of india is what we call management innovation it 's not a new product or a new process but a new way to organize work  
 and the most significant management innovation to come
 out of india  invented by the indian offshoring industry is what we call the global delivery model  what the global delivery model allows is  it allows you to take previously
  break them up into parts  send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists and then specify the means for reintegrating them 
 without that you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today 
 so what i 'm trying to say is what we are finding in our research is that if
 products for end users
 is the visible tip of the innovation iceberg  india is well represented in the invisible large  submerged portion
  of the innovation iceberg  now
 this has of course  some implications 
 and so we developed three implications of this research  the first is what we called sinking skill ladder  and now i 'm going to go back
 to where i started my conversation with you 
  which was about the flight of jobs  now of course when we first as a multinational company  decide to outsource jobs to india in the r & d  
 what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to india the least sophisticated jobs  just like tom friedman would predict  
 now what happens is when you outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to india
 for innovation and for r & d work at some stage in the very near future you are going to have to confront a problem
 which is where does the next step
 of the ladder people come from within your company  so you have two choices then either you bring the people from india into the developed world
 to take positions in the next step of the ladder immigration
 or you say there 's so many people in the bottom step of the ladder waiting to take the next position in india  why don 't we move the next step to india
 what we are trying to say is
 that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder  
 you it 's a self perpetuating act because of the sinking skill ladder  and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that
 you can 't be an investment banker without having been an analyst once you can 't be a professor without having been a student  
  you can 't be a consultant without having been a research associate  so if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs at some stage the next step of the ladder has to follow  
 the second thing we bring up is what we call the browning of the tmt the top management teams if the r  & d talent is going to be based out of india and china  and the largest growth 
  markets are going to be based out of india and china you have to confront the problem that your top management of the future is going to have to come out of india and china  
  's where the important market leadership is 
 right and the last thing we point out in this slide which is you know that to this story there 's one caveat 
 india has the youngest growing population in the world 
 this demographic dividend dividend is incredible  but paradoxically there 's also the mirage of mighty labor pools 
 indian institutes and educational system with a few exceptions are incapable of producing
  students in the quantity and quality needed to keep this innovation engine going  
 so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this but in the end it does not absolve the government of the responsibility for creating this educational structure
 so finally i want to conclude
 by showing you
  the profile of one company ibm 
 as many of you know ibm has always been considered for the last hundred years to be one of the most innovative companies in fact if you look at the number of patents filed over history i think they are in the top or the top two or three companies in the world of all patents filed in the usa as a private company  
 here is the profile of employees of
 ibm over the last decade  in two thousand and three they had three hundred
  thousand employees or three hundred and thirty thousand employees out of which one hundred and thirty five thousand were in america nine thousand were in india 
 in two thousand and nine they had four hundred thousand employees by which time the u s employees had moved to one hundred and five thousand whereas the indian employees had gone to one hundred thousand well
 in two thousand and ten they decided they 're not going to reveal this data anymore  so i had to make some estimates
 based on various sources here are my best guesses okay i 'm not saying this is the exact number it 's my best guess it gives you a sense of the trend there are four hundred and thirty three thousand people now at ibm 
 out of which ninety eight thousand are remaining in the u s and one hundred and fifty thousand are in india  
 so you tell me is ibm an american company  or an indian company
