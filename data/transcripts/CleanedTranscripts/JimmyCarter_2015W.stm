  i was trying to think about my career since i left the white house and the best
 example i have is a cartoon in the new yorker a couple of years ago this little boy is looking up at his father and he says daddy when i grow up i want to be a former president
  i have had a great blessing as a former president because i have had an access
 that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around
 this whole universe not only am i familiar with the fifty states in the united states but also my wife and i have visited more than one hundred and forty five countries
 in the world and the carter center has had  full time programs in eighty nations on earth
  lot of times when we go into a country we not only the meet the king or the president but we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas
 of africa  so our overall commitment at the carter center is to promote human rights  
 and knowing the world as i do i can tell you without any equivocation
 that the number one abuse of human rights on earth
  addressed quite often is the abuse of women and girls 
 there are a couple of reasons for this that i 'll mention to begin with  
 first of all is the misinterpretation of religious scriptures holy scriptures 
 in the bible  old testament new testament  quran and so forth and these have been misinterpreted by men
 who are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches and in the mosques  
 and they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated to a secondary position
 compared to men in the eyes of god 
 this is a very serious problem it 's ordinarily not addressed a number of years ago in the year two thousand i had been a baptist
  southern baptist for seventy years i tell you i still teach sunday school every sunday i 'll be teaching this sunday as well but
 the southern baptist convention in the year two thousand decided that women should play a secondary position a subservient position to men 
 so they issued an edict in effect  that prevents women from
  deacons in the church or chaplains in the military and if a woman teaches a classroom
 in a southern baptist seminary  they cannot teach if a boy is in the room
 because you can find verses in the bible there 's over thirty thousand verses in the bible that say that a woman shouldn 't teach a man and so forth  
 but the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position that is
  problem  because men can
 exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer for instance  wants to cheat women they can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of god  why should i treat them
 as equals myself why should i pay them equal pay for doing the same kind of work  the other very serious blight that causes
  this problem is the excessive resort to violence and that is increasing tremendously around the world
  in the united states of america for instance we have had an enormous increase in
 abuse of poor people mostly black people and and minorities by putting them in prison 
  when i was in office as governor of georgia  one out of every one thousand americans were in prison  nowadays seven point three
 people per one thousand are in prison that 's a sevenfold increase 
 and since i left the white house there 's been an eight hundred percent increase in the number of women
 who are black who are in prison  we also have [ one of the only countries ] on earth that still has the death
  that is a developed country and we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights
 in encouraging the death penalty  we 're in california now and i figured out the other day that
 california has spent four billion dollars in convicting thirteen people for the 
 if you add that up that 's three hundred and seven million dollars it costs california to send a person to be executed nebraska this week just passed a law
 abolishing the death penalty  because it costs so much 
 so the resort to to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people is another cause
 of the increase in abuse of women  let me just go down a very few abuses of women that that concern me most
  and i 'll be fairly brief because i have a limited amount of time as you know one is genital mutilation 
 genital mutilation is horrible and not known by american women  but
 in some countries many countries  when a child is born that 's a girl very soon in her life her genitals are completely
 cut away by
  remove the exterior parts of a woman 's genitalia 
 and sometimes  in more extreme cases but not very rare cases  they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate and then later when she gets married the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up so she can have sex 
 this is not a rare thing although it 's against the law in most countries in egypt for instance
 ninety one percent of all the females that live in egypt today
 have been sexually mutilated in that way in some countries it 's more than ninety eight percent of the women
 are cut that way before they reach maturity this is a horrible affliction
 on all women that live in those countries
  another very serious thing is honor killings  where a family with misinterpretation again of a holy scripture there 's nothing in the quran that mandates this
 will execute a girl in their family if she is raped
 or if she marries a man that her
 father does not approve or sometimes even if she wears inappropriate clothing  
 and this is done by members of her own family so the family becomes murderers
 when the girl
 brings so called disgrace to the family an analysis was done in egypt not so long ago by the united nations and it showed that seventy five percent of these murders of a girl
 are perpetrated by the father the uncle or the 
  brother but twenty five percent of the murders are conducted by women another problem that we have in the world that relates to women particularly is slavery  
 or human trafficking it
  called nowadays  there were about twelve point five million people sold from africa into slavery in the new world
 back in the 19th century and the 18th century there are thirty million people now living in slavery the united states
 department of state now has a mandate from congress to to
  a report every year and the state department reports that eight hundred thousand people are sold across international borders every year
 into slavery and that eighty percent of those sold
 are women into sexual slavery 
 in the united states right this moment sixty thousand people are living in human bondage or slavery  
 atlanta georgia where the carter center is located and where i teach at emory university
 they have between two hundred and three hundred women people
  sold into slavery every month 
 it 's the number one place in the nation because of that atlanta has the busiest airport in the world and they also have a lot of passengers that come from
 from the southern hemisphere if a brothel owner
 wants to buy a girl that has brown or black skin they can do it for
  girl brings several times more than that and the average brothel owner in atlanta and in the united states now can earn about $ thirty five thousand
 per slave the sex trade in atlanta georgia exceeds the total drug trade
 in atlanta georgia so this is another very serious problem  and the basic problem is prostitution because
  there 's not a whorehouse in america that 's not known by the local officials the local policemen or the chief of police or the mayor and so forth 
 and this leads to one of the worst problems and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery
 in all countries in the world sweden has got a good approach to it about fifteen to twenty years ago sweden decided to change the law and women are
  no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery  but the brothel owners and the pimps and the male customers
 are prosecuted and prostitution has gone down 
 in the united states we take just the opposite position for every male arrested for illegal
 sex trade twenty five women are arrested in the united states of america
  ireland i 've already said sweden france  and other countries are moving now towards this so called swedish model that 's another thing that can be done 
 we have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire our military
 and our great university system in the military  they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults
  much more than one percent are actually prosecuted  and the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization
 a ship like my submarine or a battalion in the army or a company in the marines
  has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not 
 and of course the last thing they want is for anybody to know that under their command sexual assaults are taking place so they do not do it that law needs to be changed 
 about one out of four girls who enter american universities will be sexually assaulted before she graduates  
 and this is now getting a lot of publicity partially because of my book but other things and so
 eighty nine universities in america are now condemned
 by the department of education under title ix because
 the officials of the universities are not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault the department of justice says that more than half of the rapes on a college campus take place by serial rapists
  but when they get on a university campus  they can rape with impunity  they 're not prosecuted  
 those are the kinds of things that go on in our in our society another thing that 's very serious about
 about the abuse of of women
 and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal
  a woman in the united states now gets twenty three percent less than a man when i became president  the difference was thirty nine percent so we 've made some progress  
 partially because i was president and so forth 
 but in the last fifteen years there 's been no progress made so it 's been just about
 twenty three or twenty four percent difference for the last fifteen years these are the kind of things that go on if you take the fortune five hundred companies
 twenty three of them have women ceos  
 out of five hundred and those ceos i need not tell you make less on an average
 than the other
  that 's what goes on in our country another problem with the united states is we are the most warlike nation on earth  
 we have been to war with about twenty five different countries
 since the second world war 
 sometimes we 've had soldiers on the ground fighting the other times we 've been flying overhead dropping bombs on people other times of course now
  since the second world war there was four years i won 't say which ones where we didn 't we didn
 't drop a bomb we didn 't launch a missile we didn 't fire a bullet 
 but anyway  those kinds of things  the
 resort to violence and the
 misinterpretation of the holy scriptures are what causes are the basic causes
  abuse of women and girls  there 's one more basic cause
 that i need not mention and that is that in general men don 't give a damn that 's
 true the average man that might say  i 'm against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts
  the privileged position that we occupy  and this is very similar to what i knew when i was a child  when separate but equal
 had existed racial discrimination legally had existed for
 one hundred years from 
  end of the war between the states the civil war all the way up to 
  when lyndon johnson got the bills passed for equal rights  but during that time  there were many white people that didn 't think that racial discrimination
  was okay  but they stayed quiet  because they enjoyed the privileges of
 better jobs
  unique access to jury duty  better schools  and everything else  and that 's the same thing that exists today because the average man
 really doesn 't care even though they say i 'm against
 discrimination against girls and
  women they enjoy a privileged position and it 's very difficult to get the
 majority of men who control the university system  
 the majority of men that control the military system  the majority of men that control the governments of the world  
 and the majority of men that control
 the great religions
  so what is the basic thing that we need to do today  i would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations
 like this one and where you come from 
 europe and so forth who have influence and who have freedom to speak and to act need to take the
 responsibility on yourselves
 to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination against girls and
 and women all over the world  the average woman in egypt doesn 't have much to say about her daughters getting
 genitally mutilated
 and so forth i didn 't even go down to detail about that but i hope that out of this conference  that every woman here will get your husbands to
