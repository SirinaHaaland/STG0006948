  you about a story about
 a small town kid i don 't know his name but i do know his story he lives in a small village in southern somalia  
 his village
  drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation 
 with nothing left for him there he leaves for the big city  
 in this case mogadishu the capital of somalia  when he arrives  there are no opportunities  no jobs  
 no way forward  
 he ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of mogadishu  
 maybe a year
  one day he 's approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch  then to dinner 
 to breakfast  he meets this dynamic group of people and they give him a break  he 's given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes  
 money to send back home to his family 
 he is introduced to this young woman  he eventually gets married  he starts this
 new life  he has a purpose in life
 one beautiful day in mogadishu  under an azure blue sky 
 a car bomb goes off 
 that small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber  
 and that dynamic group of people were al shabaab a terrorist organization linked to al
  how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up 
 he was waiting he was waiting for an opportunity  waiting to begin his future waiting for a way forward  
 and this was the first thing that came along this was the first thing that pulled him out
 of what we call waithood and his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world
 it is the story of the disenfranchised  unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in johannesburg  
 sparks riots in london who reaches out for something other than waithood 
 for young people the promise of the city the big city dream is that
  of jobs of wealth  but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities  often it 's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates 
 by two thousand and thirty three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of eighteen  
 if we do not include young people in the growth of our cities  if we do not provide them opportunities the story of waithood 
 the gateway to terrorism to violence to gangs will be the story of cities two point
 and in my city of birth mogadishu  
 seventy percent of young people suffer from unemployment  seventy percent don 't work 
 don 't go to school they pretty much do nothing  
 i went back to mogadishu last month  and i went to visit madina hospital the hospital i was born in i remember standing in front of that
  that bullet ridden hospital thinking 
 what if i had never left what if i had been forced into that same state of waithood would i have become
 a terrorist i 'm not really sure about the answer my reason for being in mogadishu that month was actually to host
 a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit i brought together about ninety young somali leaders
 we sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city one of the young men in the room was
 aden he went to university in mogadishu  
 graduated there were no jobs no opportunities  i remember him telling me because he was a college graduate  
  he was the perfect target for al shabaab and other terrorist organizations to be recruited they sought people like him out 
 but his story takes a different route in mogadishu  the biggest barrier to getting from point a to point b
 are the roads twenty three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around  
 aden saw an opportunity and
  seized it  he started a motorbike company he began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn 't normally afford them 
 he bought ten bikes with the help of family and friends  and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years 
 how is this story different  what makes his story different  i believe it is his ability to identify
 and seize a new opportunity 
 it 's entrepreneurship 
 and i believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood it empowers young people to
 be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking  and you can train young people to be
  i want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings
  mohamed mohamoud  a florist 
 he was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship  
 he 's actually the first florist mogadishu has seen in over twenty two years  
 and until recently until mohamed came along  if you wanted flowers at your wedding you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad
  asked someone when was the last time you saw fresh flowers for many who grew up under civil war the answer would be never 
 so mohamed saw an opportunity  he started a landscaping and design floral company  
 he created a farm right outside of mogadishu  and started growing tulips and lilies  which he said could survive the harsh mogadishu climate
  and he began
 delivering flowers to weddings creating gardens at homes and
 businesses around the city  and he 's now working on creating mogadishu 's first public park in  twenty two years  
 there 's no public park in mogadishu  
 he wants to create a space where families young people can come together and as he says  smell the proverbial roses 
 he doesn 't grow roses because they use too much water  by the way 
 so the first step is to inspire young people and in that room mohamed 's presence had a really profound impact on the the youth in that room  
 they had never really thought about starting up a business they 've thought about working for an ngo working for the government  
 but
 his story his
  innovation really had a strong impact on them  he forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity  he
 empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs  that they could be change makers  
 by the end of the day they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city  
 they came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems
  so
 inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step 
 but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality  they need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses  
 connect young people with the resources they need provide them the support they need to go from
  and you will create catalysts for urban growth 
 for me entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business it 's about creating a social impact 
 mohamed is not simply selling flowers i believe he is selling hope 
 his peace park and that 's what he calls it when it 's created will actually transform the way people see their city aden hired
 street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him he gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis
 of waithood these young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities  so
 my suggestion is turn youth into entrepreneurs  incubate and nurture their inherent innovation  
 and you will have more stories of flowers and peace parks than of car bombs and
