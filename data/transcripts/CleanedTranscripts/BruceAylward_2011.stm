  to share with you over the next eighteen minutes
 a pretty incredible idea actually it 's a really big idea but to get us started i want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two
  two seconds and try and think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world  
 now i bet in this audience you 're thinking of some really incredible technology some stuff that i i haven 't even heard of i 'm absolutely sure  but 
 i 'm also sure pretty sure that absolutely nobody is thinking of this  
  this is a polio vaccine  
 and it 's a great thing actually that nobody 's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted  this is a great technology we can take it completely for granted  
 but it wasn 't always that way 
 even here in california if we were to go back just a few years it was a very different story people were terrified of this
  were terrified of polio and it would cause public panic  and it was because of scenes like this 
 in this scene people are living in an iron lung these are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before  and then two days later  they can no longer 
  breathe  and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs  but also their breathing muscles and they were going to spend the rest of their lives
  in this iron lung to breathe for them this disease was terrifying there was no cure  and there was no vaccine 
 the disease was so terrifying that the president of the united states launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it 
 twenty years later  they succeeded
 and developed the polio vaccine it was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late
  stop this awful disease 
 and here in the united states it had an incredible impact as you can see the virus stopped  and it stopped very very fast  
 but
 this wasn 't the case everywhere in the world  
 and it happened so fast in the united states however that even just last month jon stewart said this
  that had been eradicated in the way that smallpox had been eradicated bruce aylward 
 oops 
 jon polio 's almost been eradicated  
 but the reality is that polio still exists today  we made this map for jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists this is the picture 
 there 's not very much left in the world  but the reason there 's not very much left is because there 's been an extraordinary public private partnership
  working
 behind the scenes almost unknown i 'm sure to most of you here today it 's been working for twenty years to try and eradicate this disease  and it 's got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic  
 but just last year  we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn 't good enough with a virus like polio  
 and this is the reason
  in two countries that hadn 't had this disease for more than probably a decade on opposite sides of the globe  there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks  
 hundreds of people were paralyzed  hundreds of people died children as well as adults  
 and in both cases we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses and we could tell these viruses were not from
  these countries  they had come from thousands of miles away  and in one case it originated on another continent 
 and not only that but when they came into these countries then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like russia where 
  for the first time in over a decade last year children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years
  years  
 now all of these outbreaks that i just showed you these are under control now and it looks like they 'll probably stop very very quickly  but the message was very clear 
 polio is still a devastating explosive disease it 's just happening in another part of
  our big idea is that the scientific miracle
 of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis so i want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership the polio partnership is trying to do we
 're not trying to control polio we 're not trying to get it down to just a few cases because this disease is like a root fire  it can explode again if you don 't snuff it out completely
  for is a permanent solution  we want a world in which every child just like you guys can take for granted a polio free world so we 're looking for a permanent solution  
 and this is where we get lucky  
 this is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary 
 this virus can only survive in people  it can 't live
  for a very long time in people it doesn 't survive in the environment hardly at all and we 've got pretty good vaccines as i 've just showed you  
 so we are trying to wipe out this virus completely 
 what the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere
  we don 't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this to eradicating diseases  it 's been tried six times in the last century  and it 's been successful exactly
 once  
 and this is because disease eradication it 's still the venture capital of public health 
 the risks are massive  but the pay off
  motivational it 's absolutely huge one congressman here in the united states thinks that the entire investment that the u s put into smallpox 
  eradication pays itself off every twenty six days in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs 
 so those are the kind of stakes that we 're after  but
 smallpox eradication was hard it was very very hard  and polio eradication in many ways is even tougher and there 's a few reasons for that 
 the first
 is that when we started trying to eradicate polio about twenty years ago
  more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with smallpox  and there were more than ten times as many people living in these countries  so it was a massive effort 
 the second challenge we had was in contrast to the smallpox vaccine which was very stable and a single dose protected you for life the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile  it 
  deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we 've had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly
  when it 's exposed to too much heat and we can tell that it 's not a good vaccine to use on a child it 's not potent it 's not going to protect them 
 even then  kids need many doses of the vaccine  
 but the third challenge we have and probably even bigger one the biggest challenge
 is that in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash  so you could get around
  the disease you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off with
 polio it 's almost completely different the vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease  so you can 't see the enemy most of the time 
 and as a result we 've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox we 've had to create one of the
  social movements in history  
 there 's over ten million people probably twenty million people largely volunteers who have been working over the last twenty years in what has now
 been called the largest
  operation in peacetime these people these twenty million people vaccinate over five hundred million children every single year
  times at the peak of our operation 
 now giving the polio vaccine is simple it 's just two drops like that but reaching five hundred million people is much much tougher  
 and these vaccinators these volunteers they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest densest urban slums in the world  they 've got to trek under sweltering suns to some of the most
  remote difficult to reach places in the world  
 and they also have to dodge bullets because we have got to operate during shaky cease fires and truces to try and vaccinate children even in areas affected by conflict 
 one reporter who was watching our program in somalia about five years ago a place which has eradicated
  not once but twice because they got reinfected he was sitting outside of the road watching one of these polio campaigns unfold and a few months later he wrote this is foreign aid at its most heroic 
 and these heroes  they come from every walk of life all sorts of backgrounds  but one of the most extraordinary is rotary international this is a group whose 
 army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over twenty years they 're right at the center of the whole thing
  thing  
 now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication more than fifteen years much longer than it should have but once it was built the results were striking 
 within a couple of years every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses with the exception of four countries that you see here  and in each of those it was only part of the
  country  and then by 
 one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide proof of concept  
 and then today 
  percent reduction greater than ninety nine percent reduction in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease when we started
  over twenty years ago  one thousand children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus last year it was one thousand 
 and at the same time the polio eradication program has been working to help with a lot of other areas  it 's been working to help control pandemic flu  sars 
  for example  it 's also tried to save children by doing other things giving vitamin a drops  giving measles
  shots giving
 bed nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns  
 but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us the international community to reach every single 
  child every single community the most vulnerable people in the world  with the most basic of health services  irrespective of geography poverty
  culture and even conflict  
 so things were looking very exciting  and then about five years ago  this virus this ancient virus started to fight back 
 the first problem we ran into was that in these last four countries the strongholds of this virus  we just couldn 't seem to get the virus rooted out  
 and then to make the matters even worse  the virus started to spread out of these four places especially
  india and northern nigeria into much of africa  asia and even into europe causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades  
 and then in one of the most important  tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world  we found
 that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have
  like this the vaccine just couldn 't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to 
 now at that time there was a great as you can imagine  frustration let 's call it frustration it started to grow very very quickly and all of a sudden some very important voices in the world of public health
  hang on we should abandon this idea of eradication let 's settle for control that 's good enough 
 now as seductive as the idea of control sounds  it 's a false premise  
 the brutal truth is if we don 't have the will or the skill or even the money that we need to reach children 
 the most vulnerable children in the world with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine  
 then pretty soon
  more than two hundred thousand children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year  there 's absolutely no question 
 these are children like umar 
 umar is seven years old and he 's from northern nigeria  he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters
 umar also has polio umar was paralyzed
  life his right leg was paralyzed in two thousand and four 
 this leg his right leg  now takes an awful beating because he has to half crawl because it 's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends keep up with his brothers and sisters than to get up on his crutches and walk 
 but umar is a fantastic
  he 's an incredible kid as
 you probably can 't see the detail here but this is his report card and you 'll see he 's got perfect scores he got one hundred percent in all the important things 
 like nursery rhymes for example there 
 but
 you know i 'd love to be able to tell you that umar is a typical kid with with polio these days but it 's not true
 umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances 
 the reality of polio today is something very different polio strikes the poorest
  communities in the world  
 it leaves their children paralyzed  
 and it drags their families deeper into poverty  because they 're desperately searching and they 're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have trying in vain to find a cure for their children 
 we think children deserve
  and so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago when people were saying we should call it off 
 the polio partnership decided to buckle down once again
 and try and find innovative new solutions new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again 
 in northern india we started mapping the cases using satellite
  imaging like this so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters so we could get to the millions of children on the koshi river basin where there are no other health services  
 in northern nigeria  the political leaders and the traditional muslim leaders they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and community confidence 
 and now they 've even started using these devices speaking of cool technology these little devices
  little gis trackers like this which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators  and then they can track them and at the end of the day they look and see did these guys get every single street 
 every single house this is the kind of commitment now we 're seeing to try and reach all of the children we 've been missing  
 these extraordinary things as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics  we went back to the vaccine it 's a 50 year old vaccine and we thought surely we can make a 
  better vaccine  so that when they finally get to these kids we can have a better bang for our buck  
  we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted just two years ago the last two types of polio in the world
 now june the ninth two thousand and nine we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine and it turned out to be a game changer 
 the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had and we immediately started using this well in a couple of months we had to get it out of production and it started rolling off the production lines and into the
  of children around the world and we didn 't start with the easy places the first place this vaccine was used was in southern afghanistan because it 's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this 
 now
 here at ted over the last couple of days i 've
 seen people
 challenging the audience again
  to believe in the impossible so this morning at about seven o 'clock i decided that we 'd try to drive chris and the production crew here berserk by
 downloading all of our data from india again so that you could see something that 's just unfolding today  which proves that the impossible is possible and only two years ago people were saying that this is
  is the perfect storm when it comes to polio over five hundred thousand children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio uttar pradesh and bihar
 five hundred thousand children every single month 
 sanitation is terrible and our old vaccine you remember  worked half as well as it should have and yet 
 the impossible is happening 
 today marks exactly six months and for the
  first time in history not a single child has been paralyzed in uttar pradesh or bihar 
 india 's not unique  in umar 's home
  percent reduction in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year  and in the last six months we 've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history 
 ladies and gentlemen with a combination of smart people smart technology and smart investments polio can now be eradicated anywhere 
 we have major
  you can imagine to finish this job  but as you 've also seen it 's doable  it has great secondary benefits  
 and polio eradication is a great buy  
 and as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus  it 's a stark reminder that we are failing as a society to reach children with the most basic of services  
 for that reason polio eradication it 's the ultimate in equity and it 's the ultimate in social justice  
 the huge social movement that 's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children it 's ready to reach them with bed nets with other things but
 capitalizing on their enthusiasm capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started twenty years
  finishing polio is a smart thing to do  and it 's the right thing to do 
 now we 're in tough times economically  but as david cameron of the united kingdom said
 about a month ago when he was talking about polio there 's never a wrong time to do the right thing 
 finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do  
 and we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last twenty years we have a new vaccine we
  have new resolve  and we have new tactics  
 we have the chance to write an entirely new polio free chapter in human history
  but if we blink now we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease
  here 's a great idea to spread 
 end polio now 
 help us tell the story  help us build the momentum so that very soon every child every parent everywhere
 can also take for granted a
  where do you think the toughest places are going to be where would you say we need to be the smartest ba the four places where where you saw that we 've never stopped
  northern nigeria northern india the southern corner of afghanistan and bordering areas of pakistan they 're going to be the the toughest but the interesting thing is of those three india 's looking real good 
 as you just saw in the data and afghanistan  afghanistan we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly it keeps getting reinfected so the tough ones  going to get the
  sense of of how much the campaign costs a year and is it easy
 to raise that money and what 's it going to be like the next couple of years ba 
 it 's interesting  we spend right now about seven hundred and fifty million to eight hundred million dollars a year that 's what it costs to reach five hundred million children it sounds like a lot of money 
  it is a lot of money  but when you 're reaching five hundred million children multiple times twenty thirty cents to reach a
  child that 's not very much money  
 but right now we don 't have enough of that we have a big gap in that money we 're cutting corners and every time we cut corners more places get infected that shouldn 't have and it just slows us down and that great buy costs us a little bit more bg 
 well hopefully we 'll get the word out and the
 governments will keep their generosity up so
 good luck we 're all in this with you  thank you
