  people often ask me about my influences
 or as i like to call them my sonic lineages 
 and i could easily tell you that i was shaped by the jazz and hip hop that i grew up with by the ethiopian heritage of my ancestors
  or by the 1980s pop on my childhood radio stations  
 but beyond genre there is another question  
 how do the sounds we hear every day influence the music that we make  
 i believe that everyday soundscape can be the most unexpected inspiration for songwriting and to look at this idea a little bit more
  i 'm going to talk today about three things nature language and silence
 or rather the impossibility of true silence  
 and through this i hope to give you a sense of a world already alive with musical expression 
 with each of us serving as active participants  
 whether we know it
 or not i 'm going to start today with nature but before we do that let 's quickly
  that is actually not the sound of an opera singer warming up
 that is the sound of a bird
 slowed down to a pace that the human ear mistakenly recognizes as its own 
 it was released as part of peter szke 's one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven hungarian recording the unknown music of birds where he records
 many birds and slows down their pitches
  hear the two of them together so your brain can juxtapose them
  perhaps the
 techniques of opera singing were inspired by birdsong 
 as humans we intuitively understand birds to be our musical teachers 
 in ethiopia birds are considered an integral part of the origin of music itself
 the story goes like this one thousand 
 five hundred years ago a young man was born in the empire of  aksum a major trading center of the ancient world 
 his name was yared 
 when yared was seven years old his father died and his mother sent him to go live with an uncle
  who was a priest of the ethiopian orthodox tradition one of the oldest churches in the world 
 now this tradition has an enormous amount of scholarship and learning and yared had to study and study and study and study and one day he was studying under a tree when three birds came to him 
 one by one these birds became his teachers they taught him music
 scales
  eventually recognized as saint yared used these scales to compose five volumes of chants and hymns for worship and celebration 
 and he used these scales to compose and to create an indigenous musical notation system 
 and these scales evolved into what is known as
  still evolving in ethiopia today now
 i love this story because it 's true at multiple levels saint  yared was a real historical figure 
 and the natural world can be our musical teacher 
 and we have so many examples of this the pygmies of the congo tune their instruments to the pitches of the birds in the forest around them 
 musician and natural soundscape expert bernie krause describes how
 a healthy environment has animals and insects taking up low medium and high frequency bands in exactly the same way as a symphony does  
 and countless works of music were inspired by bird and forest song 
 yes the natural world can be our cultural
 teacher  so let 's go now to the uniquely human world of language
  every language communicates with pitch to varying degrees  whether it 's mandarin chinese where a shift in melodic inflection gives the same phonetic syllable an entirely different meaning 
 to a language like english where a raised pitch at the end of a sentence implies a question 
 laughter as an ethiopian american woman i grew
  up around the language of amharic amharia it was my first language the language of my parents one of the main languages
 of ethiopia 
 and there are a million reasons to fall in love with this language its depth of poetics its double entendres its wax and gold its humor its
 proverbs that illuminate the wisdom and follies of life but there 's also this melodicism a musicality built right in
  i find this distilled most clearly in what i like to call emphatic language language that 's meant to highlight or underline or that springs from surprise 
 take for example the word 
 now if there are ethiopians in the audience they 're probably chuckling to themselves because the word means something like no or how could he or no he didn 't it kind of depends on the situation
  but when i was a kid this was my
  and i think it 's because it has a pitch it has a melody you can almost see the shape as it springs from someone 's mouth indey it dips and then raises again 
 and as a musician and composer when i hear that word  something like this is floating through my mind
  when i hear that phrase something like this starts rolling through my mind
  and in both of those cases what i did was i took the melody and the phrasing of those words and phrases and i turned them into musical parts to use in these short compositions  
 and i like to write bass lines so they both ended up kind of as bass lines now 
 this is based on the work of jason moran and others who work intimately with music and language
  but it 's also something i 've had in my head since i was a kid how musical my parents sounded when they were speaking to each other and to us 
 it was from them and from amharia that i learned that we are awash in musical expression
 with every word every sentence that we speak every word every sentence that we receive  perhaps you can hear it
 in the words i 'm speaking even now
  finally we go to the 1950s united states and the most seminal work of  20th century avant garde composition john cage 's four thirty three 
 written for any instrument or combination of instruments 
 the musician or musicians are invited to walk onto the stage with a stopwatch and open the score 
 which was actually purchased by the museum of modern art the score that is 
  score
 has not a single note written
 and there is not a single note played for four minutes and thirty three seconds and at once enraging and
 cage shows us that even when there are no strings being plucked
 by fingers or hands hammering piano keys still there is music  still there is music
  still there is music and what is this music  it was that sneeze
 in the back 
 it is the everyday soundscape that arises from the audience themselves  
 their coughs their sighs their rustles their whispers  their sneezes  the room the wood of the floors and the walls expanding and contracting creaking and groaning with the heat and the cold the pipes
  clanking and contributing 
 and controversial though it was and even controversial though it remains  
 cage 's point is that there is no such thing as true silence 
 even in the most silent environments we still hear and feel the sound of our own heartbeats 
 the world is alive with musical expression we are already immersed
 i had my own moment of let 's say remixing john cage a couple of months ago
 when i was standing in front of the stove cooking lentils and
 it was late one night and it was time to stir so i lifted the lid off the cooking pot and i placed it onto the kitchen counter next to me and it started to roll back and
  and it stopped me cold i thought what a weird  cool swing that cooking pan lid has so
 when the lentils were ready
  it to my backyard studio  and i made this
  to mine the soundscape for sonic textures to turn into music  
 he was saying that on its own the environment is musically generative that it is
 generous that it is fertile that we are already immersed 
 musician music researcher  surgeon and human hearing expert charles limb
 is a professor at johns
  hopkins university and he studies music and the brain and he has a theory
 that it is possible
 it is possible that the human auditory system
 actually evolved to hear music  because it is so much more complex than it needs to be for language alone  
 and if that 's true it means that we
 hard wired for music 
 that we can find it anywhere 
 that there is no such thing as a musical desert that we are permanently hanging out at the oasis and that is marvelous 
 we can add to the soundtrack but it 's already playing  
 and it doesn 't mean don 't study music  study music
  trace your sonic lineages and enjoy that exploration but there is a kind of sonic lineage to which we all belong  
 so the next time you are seeking percussion inspiration look no further than your tires as they roll over the unusual grooves of the freeway 
 or the top right burner of your stove and that strange way that it clicks as it is preparing to light 
 when seeking melodic
  look no further than dawn and dusk avian orchestras or to the natural lilt of emphatic language 
 we are the audience and we are the composers and we take from these pieces
 we are given we make we make we make we make  knowing that when it comes to nature or language
 or soundscape there is no end to the inspiration
 if
 we are listening thank you
