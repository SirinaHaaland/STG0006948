  ninety percent of my photographic process is in fact not photographic it involves a campaign of letter writing research and phone calls to access
  my subjects which can range from
 hamas leaders in gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in west virginia  and oddly  the most
 notable letter of rejection i ever received came from walt disney world a seemingly innocuous site  
 and it read i 'm just going to read a key sentence especially during these violent times  i personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests
  who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect
 and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to 
 photography threatens fantasy they didn 't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities myths and beliefs  
 and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth 
 but there are multiple truths attached to every image
 depending on the creator 's intention  the viewer and the context in which it is presented 
 over a five year period following september 11th when the american media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders 
 most notably weapons of mass destruction i chose to look inward at that which was integral to america 's foundation mythology and
  daily functioning 
 i wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen self imposed and real  and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge 
 it was a critical moment in american history and global history where one felt they they didn 't have access to accurate information  
 and i wanted to see the center with my own eyes
 but what i came away with is a photograph and it 's just another place from which to observe 
 and the understanding that there are no absolute all knowing insiders  and the outsider can never really reach the core 
 i 'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series  
 it 's titled an american index of the hidden and unfamiliar and it 's comprised of nearly
  images  in this context i 'll just show you a few  
 this is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility at hanford site in washington state where there are over one thousand nine hundred stainless steel capsules containing 
  nuclear waste submerged in water a human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly
  and i found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the united states of america which you can see here 
 and a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text so i create these two poles every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text 
 and what i 'm most interested in is the invisible space between a text
 and its accompanying image  and how the image is
  transformed by the text and the text by the image so at best the image is meant to float away into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy and then the text functions as this cruel anchor that kind of nails it to the ground  
 but in this context i 'm just going to read an abridged version of those texts 
 this is a cryopreservation unit  and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics
  pioneer robert ettinger who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health with advancements in science and technology all for the cost of thirty five thousand dollars for forever  
 this is a 21 year old palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty hymenoplasty is a surgical
 procedure which restores the virginal state allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations regarding virginity and marriage  
 so it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen  allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse to simulate the loss of virginity  
 this is a jury simulation deliberation room and you can see beyond that two way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror and they observe deliberations after mock
  trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that they 're hoping for 
 this process costs sixty thousand dollars  
 this is a u s customs and border protection room a contraband room at john  f kennedy international
  on that table you can see forty eight hours ' worth of seized goods from passengers entering in to the united states there is a pig 's head and african cane rats  
 and part of my photographic work is i 'm not just documenting what 's there i do take certain liberties and intervene  and in this i really wanted it to resemble an early still life painting so i spent some time with the
  this is the exhibited art on the walls of the cia in langley virginia  their original headquarters building  
 and the cia has had a long history with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts  and it 's speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter 
  soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro american thoughts and aesthetics
  and one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency and had thus come under question is abstract expressionism  
 this is the forensic anthropology research facility 
 and on a six acre plot there are approximately seventy five cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers
 who are interested in monitoring a rate of corpse decomposition  and in this particular
  photograph the body of a young boy has been used to reenact a crime scene  
 this is the only federally funded site
 where it is legal to cultivate cannabis for scientific research in the united states it 's a research crop marijuana grow room  
 and part of the work that i hope for is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy where you can 't find any
  discernible formula in how these things they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science to religion to security
 and you can 't completely understand how information is being distributed 
 these are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the atlantic
  connecting north america to europe they carry over sixty million simultaneous voice conversations  and in a lot of the government and technology sites
 there was just this very apparent vulnerability this one is almost humorous because it feels like i could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut  but
 stuff did feel like it could have been taken thirty or forty years ago like it was locked in the cold war era
  this is a braille edition of playboy magazine and
 this is a division of the library of congress produces a free national library service for the blind and visually impaired  and the publications they 
  choose to publish are based on reader popularity  and playboy is always in the top few 
 but you 'd be surprised they don 't do the photographs it 's just the text
  this is an avian quarantine facility where all imported birds coming into america are required to undergo a 30 day quarantine where they are tested for diseases including exotic newcastle disease and avian influenza 
 this film
 shows the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead  and the air armament center
  at eglin air force base in florida is responsible for the deployment and testing of all air delivered weaponry coming from the united states  
 and the film was shot on seventy two millimeter government issue film and that red dot is a marking on the government issue film 
 all living white tigers in north america are the result of selective inbreeding that would be
  be mother to son father to daughter sister to brother to allow for the genetic conditions that create a salable white tiger meaning white fur ice blue eyes a pink nose  
 and the majority of these white tigers are not born in a salable state and are killed at birth it 's a very violent process that is little known and the white tiger is obviously celebrated in
  forms of entertainment
  kenny was born he actually made it to adulthood  he has since passed away but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities 
 this on a lighter note is at
 george lucas ' personal archive  this is the death star  and it 's shown here in its true orientation in the context of star wars return
  of the jedi its mirror image is presented they flip the negative  
 and you can see the photoetched brass detailing  and the painted acrylic facade in the context of the film this is a deep space battle station of the galactic empire  capable of annihilating planets and civilizations  
 and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet
  this is at fort campbell in kentucky  it 's a military operations on urbanized terrain site essentially they 've simulated a city for urban combat 
 and this is one of the structures that exists in that city it 's called the world church of god  
 set up of mosques in afghanistan or iraq 
 and i worked with mehta vihar who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice and we put that wall around the world church of god and also 
  used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for
  and i put them into my photograph  
 this is live hiv virus at harvard medical school who is working with the u s government to develop sterilizing immunity  
 and alhurra is a 
  sponsored arabic language television network that distributes news and information to over twenty two countries in the arab world it runs twenty four hours a day commercial
  it 's illegal to broadcast alhurra within the united states  and in two thousand and four they developed a channel called alhurra iraq which specifically deals with events occurring in iraq and is broadcast to iraq  
 now i 'm going to move on to another project i did it 's titled the innocents and for the men in these photographs  photography had been used to create a fantasy
  contradicting its function as evidence of a truth in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie  
 i traveled across the united states photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit  violent crimes 
 i investigate photography 's ability to blur truth and fiction and its influence on memory  which can lead to severe even lethal consequences
  for the men in these photographs  the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification a victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement 's use of images
 but through exposure to composite sketches polaroids mug shots and line ups eyewitness testimony can change i 'll
 give you an example from a case 
 a woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker
 she saw some similarities in one of the photographs but couldn 't quite make a positive identification  
 days later  she is presented with another photo array of all new photographs  except that one photograph that she had some draw to from the earlier array is repeated 
 in the second array and a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory if there ever was an actual
  memory  
 photography offered the criminal justice system a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals  
 and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations of relying on photographic identifications  
 frederick daye who is photographed at his alibi location where thirteen witnesses placed him at the time of the crime he was convicted by an
 all white jury of rape  kidnapping and vehicle theft  and he served ten years of a life sentence  
 now dna exonerated frederick and it also implicated another man who was serving time in prison 
 but the victim refused to press charges because because she claimed that law enforcement had permanently altered her memory through the use of frederick 's
  charles fain was convicted of kidnapping rape and murder of a young girl walking to school  he served eighteen years of a death sentence  
 i photographed him at the scene of the crime at the snake river in idaho  
 and i photographed all of the wrongfully wrongfully convicted at sites that came to
 came to particular significance in the history of their wrongful conviction the scene of arrest the scene of misidentification the alibi location
  and here the scene of the crime it 's this place to which he 's never been but changed his life forever  so photographing there i was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between 
  truth and fiction in both his life and in photography 
 calvin washington was convicted of capital murder he served thirteen years of a life sentence in waco texas  larry mayes
  i photographed at the scene of arrest where he hid between two mattresses in gary indiana in this very room to hide from the police 
 he ended up serving eighteen and a half years of an eighty year sentence for rape and robbery the victim failed to identify larry in two live lineups and then made a positive identification days later from
  larry youngblood served eight years of a ten and half year sentence in arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing of a ten year old boy at a carnival
 he is photographed at his alibi location  
 ron williamson ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club and served eleven years of a death
  i photographed ron at a baseball field because he had been drafted to the oakland a 's to play professional baseball just before his conviction  
 and the state 's key witness in ron 's case was in the end the actual perpetrator 
 ronald jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28 year old woman i photographed him at the scene of arrest
  william gregory was convicted of rape and burglary  he served seven years of a seventy year sentence in kentucky  
 timothy durham who i photographed at his alibi location where eleven witnesses placed him at the time of the crime was convicted of three point five years of a three thousand two hundred and twenty year sentence 
 for several charges of rape and robbery he had been misidentified by an
  victim 
 troy webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in virginia  
 he was convicted of rape kidnapping and robbery and served seven years of a forty seven year sentence  
 troy 's picture was in a photo array that the victim tentatively had some draw toward  but said he looked too old the police went and found a photograph of troy webb from four years earlier
  which they entered into a photo array days later and he was positively identified
