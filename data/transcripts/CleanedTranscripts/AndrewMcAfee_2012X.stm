  as it turns out when tens of millions of people are unemployed or underemployed  there 's a fair amount of interest in what technology might be doing to the labor force  and as i look at the conversation it strikes me that it 's focused on exactly the right topic 
 and at the same time it 's missing the point entirely
  the topic that it 's focused on the question is whether or not all these digital technologies are affecting people 's ability to earn a living or to say it a little bit different way 
 are the droids taking our jobs and there 's some evidence that they are the great recession ended when american gdp resumed its kind of slow steady march upward and some other economic indicators also started to rebound
  got kind of healthy kind of quickly corporate profits are quite high in fact if you include bank profits they 're higher than they 've ever been 
 and business investment in gear in equipment and hardware and software is at an all time high so the businesses are getting out their checkbooks what they 're not really doing is hiring
  people in america who have work  and we see that it cratered during the great recession  and it hasn 't started to bounce back at all but the story is 
  not just a recession story  the decade that we 've just been through had relatively anemic job growth all throughout especially when we
  the only time we have on record where there were fewer people working at the end of the decade
 than at the beginning 
 this is not what you want to see 
 when you graph the number of potential employees versus the number of jobs in the country you see the gap gets bigger and bigger over time  
 and then during the great recession it opened up in a huge way 
 i did some quick calculations i took the last twenty years of gdp growth and the last
  twenty years of labor productivity growth and used those in a fairly straightforward way to try to project how many jobs the economy was going to need to keep growing and this is the line that i came up with 
 is that good or bad this is the government 's projection for the working age population going forward so if these predictions
  are accurate that gap is not going to close
  the problem is i don 't think these projections are accurate in particular  i think my projection is way too optimistic because when i did it i was assuming that the future was kind 
  of going to look like the past with labor productivity growth and that 's actually not what i believe because when i look around i think that we ain 't seen nothing yet when it comes to technology 's impact on the labor force 
  tools display skills and abilities that they never  ever had before  
 and that kind of eat deeply into what we human beings do for a living  let me give you a couple examples  throughout all of history if you wanted something translated from one language into another you had to involve a human being 
 now we have
  for free via many of our devices all the way down to smartphones and if any of us have used these we know that they 're not perfect  
 but they 're decent 
 throughout all of history if you wanted something written a report or an article you had to involve a person 
 not anymore this is an article that appeared in forbes online a while back about apple 's earnings it was written by an algorithm and
 it 's not decent
 it 's perfect 
 a lot of people look at this and they say ok but those are very specific narrow tasks and most knowledge workers are actually generalists  and what they do is sit on top of a very large 
  body of expertise and knowledge and they use that to react on the fly to kind of unpredictable demands and that 's very very
  one of the most impressive knowledge workers in recent memory is a guy named ken jennings  he won the quiz show jeopardy seventy four times in a row 
 took home three million dollars 
 that 's ken on the right getting beat 
 by watson the jeopardy playing supercomputer from ibm 
 so when we look at what technology can do to general knowledge workers i start to think there might not be something so special about this idea
  of a generalist particularly when we start doing things like hooking siri up to watson 
 and having technologies that can understand what we 're saying and repeat speech back to us now  siri is far from perfect and we can make fun of her flaws but we should also 
  keep in mind that if technologies like siri and watson improve along a moore 's law trajectory  
  times better or four times better they 'll be sixteen times better than they are right now  so i start to think a lot of knowledge work is going to be affected by this and digital technologies 
 are not just impacting knowledge work they 're starting to flex their muscles in the physical world as well  i had the chance a little while back to ride in the google autonomous car  which is as cool as it sounds
 i will vouch that it handled the stop and go traffic on us one hundred and one very smoothly there are about three and a half million people who drive trucks for a living in the united states i think 
  some of them are going to be affected by this technology and right now  humanoid robots are still incredibly primitive they can 't do very much  
  accelerate their trajectory so in short  yeah the droids are coming for our jobs 
 in the short term we can stimulate job growth by encouraging entrepreneurship and by investing in infrastructure because the robots today still aren 't very good at fixing bridges  but in the 
  i think within the lifetimes of most of the people in this room we 're going to transition into an economy
  that is very productive but that just doesn 't need a lot of human workers  and managing that transition is going to be the greatest challenge that our society faces 
 voltaire summarized why he said work saves us from three great evils  boredom  vice and need 
 but despite this challenge
 personally i 'm still a huge digital optimist and i am supremely confident that the digital
  technologies that we 're developing now are going to take us into a utopian future not a dystopian future and to explain why i want to pose a ridiculously broad question 
 i want to ask what have been the most important developments in human history now i want to share  some of the answers that i 've gotten in response to this question it 's a wonderful question to ask and start an endless debate about because some people are going to bring up systems of
  philosophy in both the west and the east that have changed how a lot of people think about the world and then other people will say no actually the big stories the big developments 
  are the founding of the world 's major religions  which have changed civilizations and have changed and influenced how countless people are living their lives 
  people 's lives are empires  so the great developments in human history are stories of conquest and of war 
 and then some cheery soul usually always pipes up and says hey don 't forget about plagues 
 there are some optimistic answers to this question so some people will bring up the age of
  exploration and the opening up of the world others will talk about intellectual achievements in disciplines like math that have helped us get a better handle on the world and other folk will talk about 
  periods when there was a deep flourishing of the arts and sciences  so this debate will go on and on it 's an endless debate and there 's no conclusive single answer to it but if you 're a geek like me you say well  what do the data say 
  population for example or some measure of social development or the state of advancement of a society and you start to plot the data  because by this approach  
 the big stories the big developments in human history are the ones that will bend these curves a lot 
 so when you do this and when you plot the data you pretty quickly come to some weird
  you conclude actually that none of these things have mattered very much 
 laughter they
 haven 't done a darn thing to the curves there has been
 one story one development in human history that bent the curve bent it just about ninety degrees and it is a technology story  
 the steam engine and the other associated technologies of the industrial revolution changed the world and influenced human
  history so much that in the words of the historian ian morris they made mockery out of all that had come before 
 and they did this by infinitely multiplying the power of our muscles overcoming the limitations of our muscles  now  what we 're in the middle of now is overcoming the limitations of our individual brains and infinitely multiplying our mental power 
 how can this not be as big a deal
  as overcoming the limitations of our muscles  so at the risk of repeating myself a little bit when i look at what 's going on with digital technology these days we are not anywhere 
  near through with this journey  and when i look at what is happening to our economies and our societies 
  let me give you a couple examples  economies don 't run on energy
 they don 't run on capital they don 't run on labor economies run on ideas  so the work of innovation  the work of coming up with new ideas is some of the most powerful most fundamental work that we can do in an economy and
 this is kind of how we used to do innovation we 'd find a bunch of fairly 
  we 'd take them out of elite institutions we 'd put them into other elite institutions and we 'd wait for the innovation now 
 as a white guy who spent his whole career at mit and harvard i 've got no problem with this 
 but some other people do and they 've kind of crashed the party and loosened up the dress code of innovation so here are the winners of a
  topcoder programming challenge and i assure you that nobody cares where these kids grew up 
 where they went to school or what they look like all anyone cares about is the quality of the work the quality of the ideas and over and over again we see this happening in the 
  world the work of innovation is becoming more open  more inclusive more transparent and more
  's going to continue no matter what mit and harvard think of it and i couldn 't be happier about that development 
 i hear once in a while ok i 'll grant you that but technology is still a tool for the rich world and what 's not happening these digital tools are not improving the lives of people at the bottom of the pyramid and i want to say to that very clearly  
  the bottom of the pyramid is benefiting hugely from technology the economist robert jensen did this wonderful study a while back where he watched in great detail what happened to the 
  fishing villages of kerala india when they got mobile phones for the very first time  and when you write for the quarterly journal of economics you have to use very dry and very circumspect language  but when i read his paper i kind of feel jensen is trying to scream
  this was a big deal 
 prices stabilized so people could plan their economic lives  waste was not reduced it was eliminated 
 and the lives of both the buyers and the sellers in these villages measurably improved now  what i don 't think is that jensen got extremely lucky and happened to land in the one set of villages where technology made things better  
 what happened instead is he very carefully documented what happens over and over again when technology
  comes for the first time to an environment and a community the lives of people the welfares of people improve dramatically  so as i look around at all the evidence and i think about the room that we 
  have ahead of us i become a huge digital optimist and i start to think that this wonderful statement from the physicist freeman dyson is actually not hyperbole this is an accurate assessment of what 's going on our technologies are great gifts and
  we right now have the great good fortune to be living at a time when digital technology is flourishing when it is broadening and deepening and becoming more profound all around the world 
 so yeah the droids are taking our jobs  but focusing on that fact misses the point entirely the point is that then we are freed up to do other things and what we 're going to do i am very confident what we 're going to do
  reduce poverty and drudgery and misery around the world i 'm very confident we 're going to learn to live more lightly on the planet  and
 i am extremely confident that what we 're going to do with our new digital tools is going to be so profound and so beneficial that it 's going to make a mockery out of everything that came 
  before  i 'm going to leave the last word to a guy who had a front row seat for digital progress our old friend ken jennings
