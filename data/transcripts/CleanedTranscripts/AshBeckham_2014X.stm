  this summer
 i was back in ohio for a family wedding and when i was there there was a meet and greet with anna and elsa from
  these two entrepreneurs
 had a business of running princess parties your kid is turning five they 'll come sing some songs sprinkle some fairy dust  it 's great 
 and they were not about to miss out on the opportunity that was the phenomenon and that was frozen 
 so they get hired by a local toy
  kids come in on a saturday morning buy some disney swag get their picture taken with the princesses  call it a day it 's like santa claus without the seasonal restrictions 
 and my 
  niece samantha was in the thick of it she could care less that these two women were signing posters and coloring books as snow queen and princess ana with one n to
  according to my niece and the 200 plus kids in the parking lot that day this was the anna and elsa from frozen 
 it is a blazing hot saturday morning in august in ohio we get there at ten o 'clock the scheduled start time and we are handed number fifty nine 
 by eleven o
  this was going to be a while 
 and there is no amount of free face painting or temporary tattoos that could prevent the meltdowns that were occurring outside of the store 
 so by twelve thirty we get called fifty six to sixty three please 
 and as we walk in it is a scene i can only describe you as saying it looked like norway threw up
 cardboard cut out snowflakes covering the floor  glitter on every flat surface and icicles
 all over the walls  
 and as we stood in line in an attempt to give my niece a better vantage point than the backside of the mother of number fifty eight i put her up on my shoulders and she was instantly riveted by the sight of the princesses  
 and as we moved forward her excitement only grew and as we finally
  got to the front of the line and number  fifty eight unfurled her poster to be signed by the princesses  i could literally feel the excitement running through her body 
 and let 's be honest at that point i was pretty excited too 
 i mean the scandinavian decadence was mesmerizing 
 so we get to the front of the line  and the haggard clerk turns to my niece and says hi honey you 're next
  to get down or you 're going to stay on your dad 's shoulders for the picture ' 
 laughter and i was for a lack of a better word frozen 
 it 's amazing that in an unexpected instant we are faced with the question who am i 
 am i an aunt or am i an advocate  millions of people have seen my video about how to have a hard conversation and there one was
  right in front of me  
 at the same time there 's nothing more important to me than the kids in my life so i found myself in a situation that we so often find ourselves in torn between two things two
 impossible choices would i be an advocate  would i take my niece off my shoulders and turn to the clerk and explain to her that i was in fact her
  not her father and that she should be more careful and not to jump to gender conclusions based on haircuts and shoulder rides 
 and while doing that 
 miss out on what was to this point the greatest moment of my niece 's life  
 or would i be an aunt would i brush off that comment take a million pictures and not be distracted for an instant
 from the pure joy of that moment and by doing that
  walk out with the shame that comes up for not standing up for myself especially in front of my niece who was i 
 which one was more important  which role was more worth it was i an aunt  
 or was i an advocate  and i had a split second to decide 
 we are taught
  right now that we are living in a world of constant and increasing polarity it 's so black and white so us and them so right and wrong 
 there is no middle there is no gray just polarity polarity is a state in which two ideas or opinions are completely opposite from each other
 opposition  which side are you on are
  it 's all or none you 're with us or against us that is polarity the problem with polarity
 and absolutes is that it
  eliminates the individuality of our human experience and that makes it
 contradictory to our human nature 
 but if we are pulled in these two directions but it 's not really where we exist polarity is not our actual reality where do we go from there what 's at the other end of that spectrum 
  think it 's
 an unattainable  harmonious utopia i think the opposite of polarity is duality duality is a state of having two parts but not 
 opposition 
 in simultaneous existence don 't think it 's possible here are the people i know 
 i know catholics who are pro choice and feminists who wear hijabs  and veterans who are
  and nra members who think i should be able to get married those are the people i know those are my friends and family that is the majority of our society that is you that is me 
 duality is the ability to hold both
 things but the question is can we own our duality can we have the courage to hold both
  both things i work at a restaurant in town i became really good friends with the busser i was a server and we had
 a great relationship we had a really great time together her
 spanish was great because she was from mexico 
 that line actually went the other way her english was limited  but significantly better than my spanish
 but we
 were united by our similarities not separated by our differences 
 and we were close even though we came from very different worlds she was from mexico  
 she left her family behind so she could come here and afford them a better life back home  she was a devout
 conservative catholic a believer in traditional family values  stereotypical roles of
  men and women  and i was  well me 
 but the things that bonded us
 were when she asked about my girlfriend  or she shared pictures that she had from her family back home those were the things that brought us together  
 so one day we were in the back scarfing down food as quickly as we could gathered around a small table
  during a very rare lull 
 and a new guy from the kitchen came over who happened to be her cousin and sat down with all the bravado and machismo that his 20 year old body could hold 
 and he said to her
  and his smug smile quickly dropped to one
 of maternal respect  grabbed his plate walked off went back to work she never made eye contact with me  
 she left did the same thing it was a 10 second conversation such a short
 interaction and on paper she had so much more in common with him
 family her community was her lifeline here but her moral compass
 trumped all of that 
 and a little bit later they were joking around in the kitchen in spanish that had nothing to do with me  and that is duality  
 she didn 't have to choose some p c stance on gayness over her
  to choose her family over our friendship it wasn 't jesus or ash 
  her individual morality was so strongly rooted that she had the courage to hold both things  
  it even when it 's not convenient that 's what it means to be an ally and if you 're going to be an ally you have to be an active ally  ask questions 
 act when you hear something inappropriate actually engage i had a family friend who for years used to call my girlfriend my lover
  but she was trying  and she asked she could have called her my friend  or my friend or my special friend 
 or even worse just not asked at all believe me
  we would rather have you ask i would rather have her say lover  than say nothing at all 
 people often say to me well  ash  i don 't care  i don 't see race or religion or sexuality it doesn 't matter to me  i don 't see it 
 but i think the opposite of homophobia and racism and xenophobia is not love it 's apathy 
 if you don 't see my gayness then you don 't see me
  if it doesn 't matter to you who i sleep with then you cannot imagine what it feels like when i walk down the street late at night holding her hand and approach a group of people and have to make the decision if i should hang on to it or if i should i drop it when all i want to do is squeeze it tighter  
 and the small victory i feel when i make it by and don 't have to let go
  the incredible cowardice and disappointment i feel when i drop it if you do not see that struggle
 that is unique to my human experience because i am gay  then you don 't see me  
 if you are going to be an ally  i need you to see me  as individuals as allies as humans we need to be able to hold both things  both the good
 and the bad the easy and the hard
  't learn how to hold two things just from the fluff you learn it from the grit  
 and what if duality is just the first step 
 what if through compassion and empathy and human interaction we are able to learn to hold two things  and if we can hold two things
 can hold four and if we can hold four we can hold eight and if we can hold eight we can hold hundreds 
 we are complex individuals swirls of contradiction you are all holding so many things right now 
 what can you do to hold just a few more 
 so back to toledo ohio i 'm at the front of the line niece on my shoulders the frazzled clerk calls me dad 
 have you ever been mistaken for the wrong gender
 not even that have you ever been called something you are not 
 here 's what it feels like for me  
 i am instantly an internal storm of contrasting emotions i break out into a sweat that is a combination of rage and humiliation 
 i feel like the entire store is staring at me and i simultaneously feel
  invisible i want to explode in a tirade of fury  and i want to crawl under a rock and top all of that off with the frustration that i 'm wearing an
 purple t shirt so this whole store can see my boobs to make sure this exact same thing doesn 't happen 
  despite my best efforts to be seen as the gender i am it still happens  and i hope with every ounce of my body that no one heard
 not my sister not my girlfriend and certainly not my niece i am accustomed to this familiar hurt  
 but i will do whatever i need to do to protect the people i love from it 
 but then i take my niece off my shoulders and she runs to elsa and anna the thing she 's been waiting
  so long for and all that stuff goes away 
 all that matters is the smile on her face  
 and as the thirty seconds we waited two and a half hours for comes to a close
 we gather up our things  and i lock eyes with the clerk again  and she gives me an apologetic smile and mouths
  and her humanity 
 her willingness to admit her mistake disarms me immediately then i give her a it 's okay it happens  but thanks 
 and i realize
 in that moment that i don 't have to be
 either an aunt or an advocate i can be both i can live in duality
 and i can hold two things  and if i can hold two things in that environment  i can hold so many more things 
 as my girlfriend and my niece hold hands and skip out the front of the door i turn to my sister and say 
 was it worth it and she said are you kidding me did you see the look on her face this was the greatest day of her life 
 it was worth the two and a half hours in the heat it was worth the
  coloring book that we already had a copy of it was even worth you getting called dad 
 and for the first time ever in my life  it actually was thank you boulder
