  i 'm a computer science professor  and my area of expertise is computer and information security 
 when i was in graduate school  i had the opportunity to overhear my grandmother
  describing to one of her fellow senior citizens
 what i did for a living  apparently  i was in charge of making sure that no one stole the computers from the university 
 and you know that 's a perfectly reasonable thing for her to think because i told her i was working in computer security  
 and it was interesting to get her perspective
  but that 's not the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard anyone say about my work the most ridiculous thing i ever
  heard is i was at a dinner party and a woman heard that i work in computer security  and she asked me if
 she said her computer had been infected by a virus  and she was very concerned that she might get sick from it that she could get this virus 
 and i 'm not a doctor  but i reassured her that it was very very unlikely that this would happen  but if she felt more comfortable she
  be free to use latex gloves when she was on the computer and there would be no harm whatsoever in that 
 i 'm going to get back to this notion of being able to get a virus from your computer in a serious way 
 what i 'm going to talk to you about today are some hacks some real world world cyberattacks that people in my community the academic research community have performed  which i don 't think most people know about
  think they 're very interesting and scary  
 and this talk is kind of a greatest hits of the academic security community 's hacks  none of the work is my work it 's all work that my colleagues have done and i actually asked them for their slides and incorporated them into this talk 
 so the first one i 'm going to talk about are implanted medical devices 
 now medical devices have come a long way technologically you can see
  was invented one thousand nine hundred and sixty the first internal pacemaker was implanted hopefully a little smaller than that one that you see there 
 and the technology has continued to move forward in two thousand and six we hit an important milestone from the perspective of
 of computer security  and why do i say that  because that 's when implanted devices inside of people started to have networking capabilities
  one thing that brings us close to home is we look at dick cheney 's device he had a device that pumped blood from an aorta to another part of the heart and as you can see at the bottom there 
  it was controlled by a computer controller and if you ever thought that software liability was very important get one of these inside of you 
 and this is a device that goes into a person to control their heart rhythm and these have saved many lives  
 well  in order to not have to open up the person every time you want to reprogram their device or do some diagnostics on it  they made the thing be able to communicate wirelessly  
 and what this research team did is they reverse engineered the wireless
  and they built the device you see pictured here with a little antenna that could talk the protocol to the device and thus control it  
 in order to make their experience real they were unable to find any volunteers  and so they went and they got some ground beef and some bacon and they wrapped it all up to about the size of a human being 's
 area where the device would go and they stuck the device inside it to perform their experiment somewhat realistically  they launched many many successful attacks one that
  'll highlight here is changing the patient 's name i don 't know why you would want to do that but i sure wouldn 't want that done to me  
 and they were able to change therapies including disabling the device and this is with a real commercial off the shelf device simply by performing reverse engineering and sending wireless signals to it 
 there was a piece on npr that some of
  could actually have their performance disrupted simply by holding a pair of headphones onto them 
 now wireless and the internet can improve health care greatly there 's several examples up on the screen of situations where doctors are looking to implant devices inside 
  of people and all of these devices now it 's standard that they communicate wirelessly  
  there 's a lot of danger in this okay
 let me shift gears and show you another target i 'm going to show you a few different targets like this and that 's my talk so we 'll look at automobiles 
 this is a car and it has a lot of components a lot of electronics in it today in fact  it 's got many many different computers inside of it  more pentiums than my lab did when i
  they 're connected by a wired network  
 there 's also a wireless network in the car  which can be reached from many different ways  
 so there 's bluetooth there 's the fm and xm radio  there 's actually wi fi there 's sensors in the wheels that wirelessly communicate the tire pressure to a controller on board 
 the modern car is a sophisticated 
  and what happens if somebody wanted to attack this well that 's what the researchers that i 'm going to talk about today did  
 they basically stuck an attacker on the wired network and on the wireless network  
 now they have two
 areas they can attack one is short range wireless where you can actually communicate with the device from nearby either through bluetooth or wi fi 
 and the other is long range where you can communicate with the car through the cellular network or through one of the radio stations 
 think about it when a car receives
  a radio signal  
 it 's processed by software that software has to receive and decode the radio signal and then figure out what to do with it  even if it 's just music that it needs to play on the radio  
 and that software that does that decoding if it has any bugs in it  could create a vulnerability for somebody to hack the car  
 the way that the researchers did this work is they read the software in
 computer chips that were in the car  and then they used sophisticated reverse engineering tools to figure out what that software did  and then they found vulnerabilities in that software  and then they built exploits to exploit those 
 they actually carried out their attack in real life they bought two cars and i guess they have better budgets than i do 
 the first threat model was to see what someone could do if an attacker actually got
  access to the internal network on the car  okay so think of that as someone gets to go to your car  they get to mess around with it  and then they leave and now what kind of trouble are you in 
 the other threat model is that they contact you in real time over one of the wireless networks like the cellular or something like that never having actually gotten physical access to
  this is what their setup looks like for the first model where you get to have access to the car  they put a laptop  and they connected to the diagnostic unit on the in car network 
 and they did all kinds of silly things like here 's a picture of the speedometer showing one hundred and forty miles an hour when the car 's in park
  once you have control of the car 's computers you can do anything now you might say okay that 's silly well what if you make the car always say it 's going twenty miles an hour slower than it 's actually going you might produce a lot of speeding tickets
  then they went out to an abandoned airstrip with two cars the target victim car and the chase car and they launched a bunch of other attacks 
 one of the things they were able to do from the chase car is apply the brakes on the other car  simply by hacking the computer they were able to disable the brakes 
 they also were able to install malware
 that wouldn 't kick in and wouldn 't trigger until the car was doing something like going over twenty
  miles an hour or something like that 
 the results are astonishing and when they gave this talk even though they gave this talk at a conference to a bunch of computer security researchers everybody was gasping  
 they were able to take over a bunch of critical computers inside the car  the brakes computer the lighting computer the engine  the dash the radio  
  and they were able to perform these on real commercial cars that they purchased using the radio network  
 they were able to compromise every single one of the pieces of software that controlled every single one of the wireless capabilities of the car  
 all of these were implemented successfully  how would you steal a car in this model well you compromise the car by
 a buffer overflow of vulnerability in the software something like that
  you use the gps in the car to locate it  you remotely unlock the doors through the computer that controls that start the engine  bypass anti theft and you 've got yourself a car  
 surveillance was really interesting  
 the authors of the study have a video where they show themselves taking over a car and then turning on the microphone in the car and listening in on the car while tracking it via gps on a map  
 and so that 's something that the drivers of the car would never know was happening am i
 scaring you yet
  got a few more of these interesting ones these are ones where i went to a conference and my mind was just blown and i said i have to share this with other people 
 this was fabian monrose 's lab at the university of north carolina  and what they did was something intuitive once you see it  but kind of surprising 
 they videotaped people on a bus and then they
  the video what you see here in number one is a
 reflection in somebody 's glasses of the smartphone that they 're typing in 
 they wrote software to stabilize even though they were on a bus and maybe someone 's holding their phone at an angle to stabilize the phone process it  and you may know on your smartphone 
 when you type a password the keys pop out a little bit  and they were able to use that to reconstruct what the person was typing and had a language model for detecting typing
 what was interesting is by videotaping on a bus they were able to produce exactly what people on their smartphones were typing  and then they had a surprising result which is that their software had not 
  only done it for their target but other people who accidentally happened to be in the picture they were able to produce what those people had been typing and that was kind of an accidental artifact of what their
  radios are used by law enforcement and all kinds of government agencies and people in combat to communicate and there 's an encryption option on these phones this is what the phone looks like 
 it 's not really a phone it 's more of a two way radio  
 motorola makes the most widely used one  and you can see that they 're used by secret service they 're used in combat it 's a very very common standard in the u s and elsewhere
 so one question the researchers asked themselves is could you block this thing right could you
 run a denial of service because these are first responders so would a terrorist organization want to black out the ability of police and fire to communicate at an emergency  
 they found that there 's this girltech device used for texting that happens to operate at the same exact frequency as the p25 and they built what they called my first jammer
 if you look closely at this device  it 's got a switch for encryption or cleartext let me advance the slide  
 and now i 'll go back you see the difference 
 this is plain text 
 this is encrypted there 's one little dot that shows up on the screen and one little tiny turn of the switch  and so the researchers asked themselves i wonder how many times very
  secure important sensitive conversations are happening on these two way radios where they forget to encrypt and they don 't notice that they didn 't encrypt 
 so they bought a scanner these are perfectly legal and they run at the frequency of the p25 and what they did is they hopped around frequencies and they wrote software to listen in if they found encrypted communication
  they stayed on that channel and they wrote down that 's a channel that these people communicate in these law enforcement agencies 
 and they went to twenty metropolitan areas and listened in on conversations that were happening at those frequencies  
 they found that in every metropolitan area  they would capture over twenty minutes a day of cleartext communication  
 and what kind of things were people talking about well they found the names and information about confidential
  they found information that was being recorded in wiretaps a bunch of crimes that were being discussed  sensitive information it was mostly law enforcement and criminal 
 they went and reported this to the law enforcement agencies after anonymizing it and the vulnerability here is simply the user interface wasn 't good enough if you 're talking about something really secure and sensitive it should be really clear to you that this conversation is encrypted
  that one 's pretty easy to fix the last one i thought was really really cool and i just had to show it to you it
 's probably not something that you 're going to lose sleep over like the cars or the defibrillators  but
 it 's stealing keystrokes  now we 've all looked at smartphones upside down every security expert wants to hack a smartphone and we tend to look at the usb port the gps for tracking the camera the microphone  
 but no one up till this point had looked at the accelerometer the accelerometer is the thing that determines the vertical
  orientation of the smartphone  
 and so they had a simple setup  they put a smartphone next to a keyboard  and they had people type  
 and then their goal was to use the vibrations that were created by typing
 to measure the change in the accelerometer reading
 to determine what the person had been typing  now when they tried this on an iphone 3gs this is a graph of the perturbations that were
  created by the typing and you can see that it 's very difficult to tell when somebody was typing or what they were typing  but the iphone four greatly improved the accelerometer  
 and so the same measurement produced this graph 
 now that gave you a lot of information while someone was typing and what they did then is used advanced artificial intelligence techniques called machine learning
 to have a training phase
  so they got most likely grad students to type in a whole lot of things and
 to learn to have the system use the machine learning tools that were available to learn what it is that the people were typing and to match that up with the measurements in the accelerometer  
 and then there 's the attack phase where you get somebody to type something in you don 't know what it was but you use your model that you created in the training phase to figure out what they were typing
 they had pretty good success this is an article from the usa today  they typed in the illinois supreme court has ruled that rahm emanuel is eligible to run for mayor of chicago 
 and ordered him to stay on the ballot now the system is interesting because it produced illinois supreme and then it wasn 't sure the model produced a bunch of
  and this is the beauty of of some of the a i techniques is that computers are good at some things humans are good at other things take the best of both and let the humans solve this one don 't waste computer cycles 
 a human 's not going to think it 's the supreme might it 's the supreme court  right and so together we 're able to reproduce typing simply by measuring the accelerometer  
  developers have a manifest where every device on there the microphone etc has to register if you 're going to use it so that hackers can 't take over it  but nobody controls the accelerometer  
 so what 's the point you can leave your iphone next to someone 's keyboard and just leave the room  and then later recover what they did even without using the microphone 
 if someone is able to put malware on your iphone they could then maybe get the typing that you
 do whenever you put your iphone next to your keyboard  
 there 's several other notable attacks that unfortunately i don 't have time to go into but the one that i wanted to point out was a group from the university of michigan which was able to take voting machines  the sequoia 
 avc edge dres that were going to be used in new jersey in the election that were left in a hallway  and put pac man on it so they ran the  pac man game 
 what does this all mean  well  i think that society tends to adopt technology really quickly i love the next coolest gadget
  but it 's very important and these researchers are showing that the developers of these things need to take security into account from the very beginning and need to realize that they may have a threat model  
  but the attackers may not be nice enough to limit themselves to that threat model  and so you need to think outside of the box
