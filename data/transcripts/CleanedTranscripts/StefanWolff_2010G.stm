  today i want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war 
 these are not normally the most cheerful of topics  nor do they generally generate the kind of good news
  that this conference is about 
 yet 
 not only is there at least some good news to be told about fewer such conflicts now than two decades ago  
 but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of
 what can be done
 to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars
 and the suffering that they inflict three things stand out leadership
  diplomacy
 and institutional design 
 what i will focus on in my talk is why they matter  
 how they matter  and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter
 in the right ways that is how all of us can contribute
 to developing and honing the skills of local and global leaders
 to make
  peace
 and to make it last  but let 's start at the beginning 
 civil wars have made news headlines for many decades now 
 and ethnic conflicts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat  
 for nearly two decades now the news has been bad
 and the images
  have been haunting 
 in georgia  after years of stalemate we saw a full scale resurgence of violence in august two thousand and eight 
 this quickly escalated into a five day war between russia and georgia  leaving georgia ever more divided  
 in kenya  contested presidential elections in two thousand and seven we just heard about them
 quickly led to
  high levels of inter ethnic violence
 and the killing and displacement of thousands of people in sri lanka a decades long civil war
 between the tamil minority and the sinhala majority led to a bloody climax in two thousand and nine  
 after perhaps as many as one hundred thousand people had been killed since
  the last few weeks  unprecedented levels of violence occurred
 between ethnic kyrgyz and ethnic uzbeks hundreds have been killed  
 and more than one hundred thousand displaced  including many ethnic uzbeks who fled to neighboring uzbekistan 
 in the middle east conflict between israelis and palestinians continues unabated
  and it becomes ever more difficult to see how just how
 a possible sustainable solution can be achieved  
 darfur may have slipped from the news headlines but the killing and displacement there continues as well 
 and the sheer human misery that it creates is very hard to fathom 
 and in iraq finally
  violence is on the rise again 
 and the country has yet to form a government four months after its last parliamentary elections 
 but hang on this talk is to be about the good news so are these now the images of the past well 
  that does represent some good news 
 over the past two decades since the end of the cold war there has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars since the high in the early 
 with about fifty such civil wars ongoing we now have thirty percent fewer such conflicts today the number of people
  killed in civil wars also
 is much lower today
 than it was a decade ago or two 
 but this trend is less unambiguous  the highest level of deaths on the battlefield was recorded between one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and two thousand and one  with about eighty thousand soldiers policemen and rebels killed every year  
 the lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in two thousand and
  three with just twenty thousand killed  
 despite the up and down since then  the overall trend and this is the important bit
 clearly points downward for the past two decades 
 the news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be from over twelve thousand civilians deliberately killed in civil wars in
 hundred and ninety seven and one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight a decade later this figure stands at four thousand this is a decrease by 
 this decline would be even more obvious if we factored in the genocide in rwanda in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four 
 but then eight hundred thousand civilians were slaughtered in a matter of just a few months this certainly is an accomplishment that must never be
  surpassed 
 what is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story 
 they exclude people that died as a consequence of civil war  from hunger or disease for example  
 and they also do not properly account for civilian suffering more generally 
 torture  rape
 and ethnic cleansing have become highly effective
  if often non lethal weapons in civil war 
 to put it differently 
 for the civilians that suffer the consequences of ethnic conflict and civil war  there is no good war
 and there is no bad peace  thus even though
  or tortured is one too many the fact that the number of civilian casualties
 is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago is good news 
 so we have fewer conflicts today in which fewer people get killed 
 and the big question of course is why 
  there is a military victory of one side  
 this is a solution of sorts  but rarely is it one that comes without human costs or humanitarian consequences 
 the defeat of the tamil tigers in sri lanka is perhaps the most recent example of this 
 but we have seen similar  so called military solutions
 in the balkans in the south caucasus and across most of africa at times they are complimented by
  negotiated settlements or at least cease fire agreements and peacekeepers are deployed  but hardly ever do they represent a resounding success
 bosnia and herzegovina perhaps more so than georgia  but for many parts of africa a colleague of mine once put it this way 
 on tuesday night was reached just in time for the genocide to
  start on wednesday morning 
 but let 's look at the good news again 
 if there 's no solution on the battlefield three factors can account for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war  
 or for sustainable peace afterwards 
 leadership  diplomacy
 and institutional
  take the example of northern ireland  despite centuries of animosity decades of violence
 and thousands of people killed  one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight saw the conclusion of an historic agreement its initial version
 was skillfully mediated by senator george mitchell  crucially for the long term success of the peace process in northern
  he imposed very clear conditions for the participation and negotiations  
 central among them a commitment to exclusively peaceful means  
 subsequent revisions of the agreement were facilitated by the british and irish governments  
 who never wavered in their determination to bring peace and stability to northern ireland  
 the core institutions that were put in place in
  in two thousand and six and two thousand and eight
 were highly innovative
 and allowed all conflict parties
 to see their core concerns and demands addressed the agreement combines a  power sharing arrangement in northern ireland
 with cross border institutions that link belfast and dublin and thus
  irish dimension of the conflict and significantly there 's also a clear focus on both
 the rights of individuals and the rights of communities  
 the provisions in the agreement may be complex  but so is the underlying conflict 
 perhaps most importantly local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise not always fast and not
  always enthusiastically  but rise in the end they did  who ever could have imagined ian paisley and martin mcguinness
 jointly governing northern ireland as first and deputy first minister  
 but then is northern ireland a unique example  or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries
  by no means  the ending of liberia  's long lasting civil war in two thousand and three
 illustrates the importance of leadership  diplomacy and institutional design
 as much as the successful prevention of a full scale civil war in macedonia in two thousand and one  or the successful ending
 of the conflict in aceh in indonesia in two thousand
  and five  
 in all three cases  local leaders were willing and able to make peace  the international community stood ready to help them negotiate and implement an agreement 
 and the institutions have lived up to the promise that they held on the day they were agreed  
  focusing on leadership diplomacy and institutional design also helps explain failures to achieve peace or to make it last  
 the hopes that were vested in the oslo accords did not lead to an end of the israeli palestinian conflict not all the issues that needed to be resolved were actually covered in the agreements  
 rather local leaders committed to revisiting them later on yet instead of grasping this opportunity local and international
  leaders soon disengaged and became distracted
 by the second intifada  the events of nine eleven
 and the wars in afghanistan and iraq  
 the comprehensive peace agreement for sudan signed in two thousand and five turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged  and its provisions may yet
  return to war between north and south changes and shortcomings in leadership more off than on international diplomacy
 and institutional failures account for this in almost equal measure  
 unresolved boundary issues squabbles over oil revenues  the ongoing conflict in darfur  escalating tribal violence in the south
 and generally weak state capacity across all of sudan complete
 a very depressing picture of the state of affairs in africa 's largest country 
 a final example kosovo  the failure to achieve a negotiated solution for kosovo
 and the violence tension and de facto partition that resulted from it
 have their reasons in many many different factors  central among them are three
  first the intransigence of local leaders to settle for nothing less than their maximum demands 
 second an international diplomatic effort
 that was hampered from the beginning
 by western support for kosovo 's independence 
 and third a lack of imagination when it came to designing institutions that could have
  addressed the concerns of serbs and albanians alike by the same token
 and here we have some good news again the very fact that there is a 
 international presence in kosovo and the balkans region more generally and the fact that local leaders on both
  have showed relative restraint explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since two thousand and eight  
 so even in situations where outcomes are less than optimal  
 local leaders
 and international leaders have a choice  and they can make a difference for the better a cold war
 is not as good as a cold peace  but a cold peace is still better
 than a hot war 
 good news is also about learning the right lesson so what then distinguishes the israeli palestinian conflict
 from that in northern ireland  or the civil war in sudan
 from that in liberia both successes and failures teach us several critically important things that we need to bear in mind
  if we want the good news to continue first leadership  
 in the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war are not natural but man made disasters 
 their prevention and settlement does not happen automatically either  
 leadership needs to be capable determined
 and visionary in its
  commitment to peace leaders need to connect to each other
 and to their followers  and they need to bring them along on what is an often arduous journey into a peaceful future  
 second  diplomacy 
 diplomacy needs to be well resourced  sustained
  and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers it needs to help them reach an equitable compromise  
 and it needs to ensure that a broad coalition
 of local regional and international supporters help them implement their agreement third institutional design 
 institutional design requires a keen focus on issues  innovative thinking
 and flexible
 and well funded implementation conflict parties need to move away from maximum demands
 and towards a compromise
 that recognizes each other 's needs  and they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to
  conflict parties also need to be prepared to return to the negotiation table
 if the agreement implementation stalls for me personally  the most critical lesson of all is this 
 local commitment to peace is
 but it is often not enough to prevent or end violence yet
  no amount of diplomacy or institutional design
 can make up for local failures
 and the consequences that they have 
 therefore we must invest in developing leaders leaders
 that have the skills vision and determination to make peace leaders in other words 
 that people will trust
 and that they will want to follow
  even if that means making hard choices 
 a final thought  
 ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers  
 frustrations and setbacks it often takes a generation to accomplish  but it also requires us today 's generation 
 to take responsibility
 and to learn the right
  lessons about leadership  diplomacy and institutional design so that the child soldiers of today
 can become the children of tomorrow  thank you
