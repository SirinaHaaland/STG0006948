  i 'm assuming everyone here has watched a ted talk online at one time or another right 
 so what i 'm going to do is play this this is the song from the ted talks online
  i 'm going to slow it down because things sound cooler when they 're slower
  i 'm going to do so in a way that tells a story tod machover something nobody 's ever heard before ks i have a crossfader julian treasure i call this the mixer
  computers and synthesizers to create works it 's a language that 's still
  turn on the radio pop into the discotheque you will know what this person is doing moving to the music
  when i was first asked to speak at ted i wasn 't quite sure what my angle was at first so yeah i immediately started watching tons of ted talks  which is
 pretty much absolutely the worst thing that you can do because you start to go into panic mode thinking i haven 't mounted a
  expedition to the north pole yet neither have i
 provided electricity to my village through sheer ingenuity in fact  i 've pretty much wasted most of my life djing in night clubs and producing pop records  
 but
 i still kept watching the videos because i 'm a masochist and eventually things like michael tilson thomas and tod machover  and seeing their
  visceral passion talking about music it definitely stirred something in me  and i 'm a sucker for anyone talking devotedly about the power of music and
 i started to write down on these little note cards every time i heard something that struck a chord in me pardon the pun or something that i thought i could use and pretty soon my studio looked like this 
 kind of like a john nash beautiful mind vibe the other good thing about
  watching ted talks  when you see a really good one  you kind of all of a sudden wish the speaker was your best friend don 't you like just for a day they seem like a nice person you 'd take a bike ride maybe share an ice cream you 'd certainly learn a lot
 and every now and then they 'd chide you when they got frustrated that you couldn 't really keep up with half of the technical things they 're banging on about all the time but then they 'd remember that you 're but a mere human of ordinary
  mortal intelligence that didn 't finish university and they 'd kind of forgive you and pet you like the dog 
 laughter man 
 yeah  back to the real world  probably sir ken robinson and i are not going to end up being best of friends he lives all the way in l a and i imagine is quite busy  but through the tools available to me technology and the innate way that i approach making music i can sort
  of bully our existences into a shared event which is sort of what you saw 
 i can hear something that i love in a piece of media and i can co opt it and insert myself in that narrative
 or alter it even 
 in a nutshell that 's what i was trying to do with these things but more importantly  that 's what the past thirty years of music has been that 's the major thread see thirty years ago you had the first
  digital samplers  and they changed everything overnight all of a sudden artists could sample from anything and everything that came before them 
 from a snare drum from the funky meters to a ron carter bassline the theme to the price is right albums like de la soul 's three feet high and rising and the beastie boys ' paul 's boutique 
 looted from decades of recorded music to create these
 sonic layered masterpieces that were basically the sgt peppers of their day
  and they weren 't sampling these records because they were too lazy to write their own music  they weren 't sampling these records to cash in on the familiarity of the original stuff to be honest it was all 
  about sampling really obscure things except for a few obvious exceptions like vanilla ice and doo doo doo da da doo doo that we know about 
  they instantly wanted to inject themselves into the narrative of that music they heard it they wanted to be a part of it and all of a sudden they found themselves in possession of the technology to do so 
 not much unlike the way the delta blues struck a chord with the stones and the beatles and clapton  and they felt the need to co opt that music for the tools of their day  you know in music we take
 something that we love and we build on it i 'd like to play a song for you
  i do hope that comes back soon
  predated the sampling era there were no samples in this record although i did look up on the internet last night  i mean several months ago that la di da di 
 means it 's an old cockney expression from the late  1800s in england so maybe a remix with mrs patmore from downton abbey coming soon or that 's for another day
  doug e fresh was the human beat box slick rick is the voice you hear on the record  and because of slick rick 's
  vocals it provides endless sound bites and samples for future pop records  that was 
 this is me in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four in case you were wondering how i was doing thank you for asking it 's throwback thursday already  i was involved in a heavy love affair with the music of duran duran as you can probably tell from my outfit
  in the middle  and
 the simplest way that i knew how to co opt myself into that experience of wanting to be in that song somehow was to just get a band together of fellow nine year olds and play wild boys at the school talent show so that 's what we did and
 long story short we were booed off the stage and if you ever have a chance to live your life escaping hearing the sound of an auditorium full of second and third graders booing i
  it 's not really fun  
 but it didn 't really matter because what i wanted somehow was to just be in the history of that song for a minute i didn 't care who liked it i just loved it and i thought i could put myself in there 
 over the next ten years la di da di continues to be sampled by countless records   ending up on massive hits like here comes the hotstepper and i wanna sex you up snoop doggy dogg covers this song on his debut album doggystyle 
  copyright lawyers are having a field day at this point and then you fast forward to one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven 
 and the notorious b i g or biggie reinterprets la di da di 
 on his number one hit called hypnotize which i will play a little bit of and i will play you a little bit of the slick rick to show you where they got it from
  biggie was killed
 weeks before that song made it to number one in one of the great tragedies of the hip hop era but he would have been thirteen years old and very much alive when la di da di first came out and as a young boy
  growing up in brooklyn  it 's hard not to think that that song probably held some fond memories for him  but the way he interpreted it as you hear is completely his own he flips it makes it
  about it it 's thoroughly modern biggie  i had to make that joke in this room because you would be the only people that i 'd ever have a chance of getting it and so 
 it 's a groaner 
 elsewhere in the pop and rap world we 're going a little bit sample crazy we 're getting away from the obscure samples that we were doing and all of a sudden everyone 's taking these massive ' 80s tunes like bowie let 's dance and all these disco records and just
  these records don 't really age that well you don 't hear them now because they borrowed from an era that was too steeped in its own connotation  you can 't just
 hijack nostalgia wholesale  it leaves the listener feeling sickly  you have to take an element of those things and then bring something fresh and new to it  
 which was something that i learned when i was working with the late amazing amy winehouse on her
  a lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album that myself and salaam remi the other producer achieved how we captured this long lost sound but without the very very 
  personality and firebrand that was amy winehouse and her lyrics about rehab
 and roger moore and even a mention of slick rick the whole thing would have run the risk of being
 very pastiche to be honest  imagine any other
 singer from that era over it singing the same old lyrics it runs a risk of being completely bland  i mean there was no doubt that amy and i and salaam 
  all had this love for this gospel soul and blues and jazz that was evident listening to the musical arrangements  
  la di da di completely for her generation and we 'll take a listen to the slick rick part and then see how she sort of flipped it
  miley cyrus who wasn 't even born yet when la di da di was made and neither were any of the co writers on the song 
 has found this song that somehow etched its way into the collective consciousness of pop music  and now with its timeless
  of the original has kind of translated to a whole new generation who will probably co opt it as their own  
 since the dawn of the sampling era  there 's been endless debate
 about the validity of music that contains samples you know the grammy committee says that if your song
 contains some kind of  pre written or pre existing music you 're ineligible for song of the year
 who are racist but only about
  constantly use
 the argument to that 's a real word that is a real word 
 they constantly use the argument to devalue rap and modern pop and
 these arguments completely miss the point because the dam has burst we live in the post sampling era we take the things that we love
 and we build on them that 's just how it goes  and when we really add something significant and original and we merge our musical journey with
  this then we have a chance to be a part of the evolution of that music that we love and be linked with it once it becomes something new again so
 i would like to
 do one more piece that i put together for you tonight  and it takes place with two pretty inspiring ted performances that i 've seen
  them is the piano player derek paravicini who happens to be a blind  autistic genius at the piano and emmanuel jal who is an ex child soldier from the south sudan 
 who is a spoken word poet and rapper  and once again i found a way to annoyingly me me me myself into the musical history of these songs 
  that ted sound again
