  why do we think that stories by men are deemed to be of universal importance and stories by women
 are thought to be merely about women
  my grandmother left school when she was twelve she had fourteen children 
 my mother left school when she was fifteen  she was a secretary  i graduated from university to become a theater director  
 and that progress is entirely to do with the fact that people i 'll never meet fought for women to have rights 
 get the vote  get education have progress  and i 'm determined to do
  i started a festival called wow women of the world seven years ago and it 's now in twenty countries across five continents and one of those countries is somaliland in africa  
 so i traveled there last year  and part of the joy i had in going there was going to these caves the
  these caves contain some of the oldest cave paintings in the world  
 these paintings are thought to be round about nine thousand to eleven thousand years old  
 art 
 what humanity has done ever since it evolved  
 it 's how we speak about ourselves  how we understand our identity how we look at our surroundings who we find out about each other because of the meaning of our lives
  lives that 's what art is for 
 so look at this little picture i think it 's a little girl  i thought it was a bit like me when i was a little girl
  and i thought well who painted this joyful  youthful figure  
 and i asked the curator of the caves i said tell me about the men and women who painted these 
 and he looked at me absolutely askance  and he said women didn 't paint these pictures
 and i said well it was eleven thousand years ago i said how do you know 
 and he said women don 't do these things men made these marks women don 't 
 now  i wasn 't really surprised  because that 's an attitude that i 've seen continuously all my
  life as a theater maker 
 we are told that divine knowledge comes down through the masculine  
 whether it be to the imam  the priest  the rabbi  the holy man
 similarly we 're told that creative genius resides in the masculine that it is
  the masculine that will be able to tell us about who we really are that the masculine will tell the universal story on behalf of all of us 
 whereas women artists will really just talk about women 's experiences women 's issues only really relevant to women and of passing interest to men
 and really only some men and it 's that conviction 
  that i think colors so much of whether we 're prepared to believe that women 's stories really matter  and unless we 're prepared to believe that women 's stories really matter 
 then women 's rights don 't really matter  and then change can 't really come
  i want to tell you about two examples of stories that are thought to be of universal
  i took my two children when they were little caroline was eight
 and robby was five to see e t 
 and it 's a fantastic story of this little alien who ends up in an american family with a mum two brothers and a sister  
 but he wants to go
  not only that but some really bad scientists want to do some experiments on him  and they 're looking for him  
 so the children have a plot they decide they 're going to take him back to his spaceship as soon as they can 
 and they plop him in a bicycle basket and off they ride  
 but unfortunately  the baddies have found out and they 're catching up and they 've got sirens and they 've got their guns they 've got the
  closing up on the children and the children are never going to make it and then all of a sudden magically  the bikes fly up in the air  
 over the clouds  over the moon  and they 're going to save e t 
 so i turn to see my children 's faces  and robby is enraptured  he 's there with them he 's saving e t he 's a happy boy  
  why can 't i come and then all of a sudden i realized they weren 't children they were boys
 all boys 
 and caroline who had invested so much in e t well she wasn 't invited to save him  and she felt humiliated and spurned
  so i wrote to steven spielberg
 and i said i don 't know if you understand the psychological importance of what 's happened and
 are you prepared to pay for the therapy bills twenty years later i haven 't had a word back from him  but i 'm still hopeful
  but i thought it was interesting because if you read reviews of what he intended with e t he says very specifically 
 i wanted the world to understand that we should love and embrace difference 
 but somehow he didn 't include the idea of girls ' difference in this thinking  
 he thought he was writing a story about all humanity caroline thought he was marginalizing half of humanity  
 he thought he was writing a story about human
  goodness she thought he was writing a lad 's heroic adventure  and this is common 
 men feel they have been given the mantle for universal communication 
 but of course how could they be they are writing from male experience through male 's eyes 
 we have to have a look at this ourselves we have to be
  prepared to go back through all our books and our films all our favorite things  and say actually this is written by a male artist not an artist 
 we have to see that so many of these stories are written through a male perspective  which is fine  
 but then females need to have fifty percent of the rights for the stage
  the film the novel the place of creativity 
 let me talk about hamlet to be or not to be that is the question  
 but it 's not my question my question is why was i taught as a young woman that this was the quintessential example
 of human dilemma and human experience it 's a marvelous story but actually  it 's about a young
  be able to make it as a powerful figure in a male world unless he takes revenge for his father 's murder  
 he talks a great deal to us about suicide being an option  
 but the reality is that the person who actually commits suicide ophelia  after she 's been humiliated and abused by him never gets a chance to talk to the audience about her feelings  
 finished with ophelia he turns on his mum because basically she has the audacity to fall in love with his uncle and enjoy sex 
 laughter it is a great story  
 but it is a story about male conflict male dilemma male struggle  
 but i was told this was the story of human beings  despite the fact that it only had two women in it 
 and unless i reeducate myself i am always going to think that women 's stories
  matter less than men 's 
 a woman could have written hamlet but she would have written it differently  and it wouldn 't have had global recognition 
 as the writer margaret atwood says when a man writes about doing the dishes  it 's realism 
 when a woman writes about doing it it 's an unfortunate genetic
  this is not just something that belongs to then i mean 
 when i was a young girl wanting desperately to be a theater director  this is what my male lecturer said to me 
 well there are three women directors in britain he said jude 
 there 's joan knight who 's a lesbian there 's joan littlewood who 's retired and there 's buzz goodbody who 's just killed herself  so which of those three would you like
  slur on gay women the fact is he wanted to humiliate me  
 he thought it was silly that i wanted to be a director  
 and i told my friend marin alsop the conductor and she said oh yes well  my music teacher said exactly the same he said ' women don 't conduct ' 
 but all these years later  we 've made our mark
  the current head of the paris conservatoire said recently it takes great physical strength to conduct a symphony 
 and women are too weak 
 laughter the artist george baselitz said well the fact is women can 't paint  well they can 't paint very well the writer v s naipaul said two years
  i can read two paragraphs and know immediately if it 's written by a woman and i just stop reading because it 's not worthy of me audience whoa 
 and it goes on 
 we have to find a way
 of stopping young girls and women feeling not only that their story doesn 't matter  but they 're not allowed to be the storyteller  
 because once you feel that you can 't stand in the central space
 and speak on behalf of
  the world  you will feel that you can offer your goods up to a small select group 
 you will tend to do smaller work on smaller stages your economic power will be less your reach of audiences will be less 
 and your credit will be less
 as an artist  and we do finally give artists these incredible prominent spaces
  the world because they are our storytellers 
 now  why should it matter to you if you 're not an artist  supposing you 're an accountant or an entrepreneur or a medic or a scientist should you care about women artists 
 absolutely you must  because as you can see from the cave paintings 
 all civilizations all of humanity
 have relied upon artists
  tell the human story  and if the human story is finally told by men take my word for it  it will be about men 
 so let 's make a change let 's make a change to all our institutions and not just in the west don 't forget this message
 of
  of women to hold creative genius is being told to girls and women in nigeria
 in china in russia in indonesia all over the world girls and women are being told that they can 't finally hold the idea of creative inspiration and
 i want to ask you do you believe that do you believe that women can be a creative genius
  support women artists  buy their work insist that their voices are heard find platforms on which their voices will be made 
 and remember this 
 that in a sense if we 're going to get past this moment of a world where we know that we are unequal 
 it 's artists who have to imagine a different world
  i 'm calling on all artists women and men to imagine a  gender equal world  
 let 's paint it  let 's draw it  let 's write about it let 's film it and if we could imagine it  then we would have the energy
 and the stamina to work towards it when i see this little
  eleven thousand years ago  i want to know
 that the little girl now can stand there and think she 's entitled to her dreams she 's entitled to her destiny
 and she 's entitled to speak on behalf of the whole world be recognized for it and applauded
