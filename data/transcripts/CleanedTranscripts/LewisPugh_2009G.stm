  today i want to talk to you about swimming across the north pole
 across the most northern place in the whole world and perhaps the best place to start is with my late father  he was a great storyteller
  he could tell a story about an event  and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment  
 and one of the stories he told me so often when i was a young boy
 was of the first british atomic bomb test he had been there and watched it go off  
 and he said that the explosion was so loud and the light was so intense that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes  and he said that he could actually see an
  fingers  because the light was so bright  and i know
 that watching that atomic bomb going off had a very very big impact on my late father  
 every holiday i had as a young boy was in a national park 
 what he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world and show me just how fragile the world is 
  told me about the great explorers he loved history  
 he would tell me about captain scott walking all the way to the south pole and sir edmund hillary climbing up mount everest  and so ever since i think i was just six years old i dreamed of going to the polar regions  
 i really really wanted to go to the arctic there was something about that place
  sometimes it takes a long time for a dream to come true  but seven years ago i went to the arctic
 for the first time  
 and it was so beautiful that i 've been back there ever since for the last seven years i love the place 
 but i have seen that place change beyond all description just in that short period of
  i have seen polar bears walking across very very thin ice in search of food  i have swum in front of glaciers which have retreated so much  
 and i have also every year seen less and less sea ice  
 and i wanted the world to know what was happening up there in the two years before my swim twenty three percent of the arctic sea ice cover just melted away  
 and i wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders
 to get them to understand what is happening so i decided to do this symbolic swim
 at the top of the world in a place which should be frozen over  but which now is rapidly unfreezing and the message was very clear 
 climate change is for real  and we need to do something about it and we need to do something about it right now  
 well  swimming across the north
  pole  it
 's not an ordinary thing to do  i mean just to put it in perspective twenty seven degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool 
 this morning the temperature of the english channel was eighteen degrees 
 the passengers who fell off the titanic fell into water of just five degrees centigrade
  fresh water freezes at zero  and the water at the north pole is minus one point seven it
 's fucking freezing 
 i 'm sorry but there is no other way to describe it 
 and so i had to assemble an incredible team around me to help me with this task
  i assembled this team of  twenty nine people from ten nations some people think that swimming is a very solo sport you just dive into the sea and off you go it couldn 't be further from the truth for me  
 and i then went and did a huge amount of training swimming in icy water backwards and forwards 
 but the most important thing was to train my mind to prepare myself for what was going to happen  
  visualize the swim  i had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end i had to taste the salt water in my mouth  i had to see my coach screaming for me come on lewis come on go go go don 't slow down 
 and so i literally swam across the north pole hundreds and hundreds of times
 in my mind  and then after a year of training  i felt ready  i felt confident that i could actually
 do this swim
 so myself and the five members of the team we hitched a ride on an icebreaker which was going to the north pole  
 and on day four we decided to just do a quick five minute test swim  
 i had never swum in water of minus one point seven degrees before because it 's just impossible to train in those types of conditions
  so we stopped the ship as you do we all got down onto the ice  and i then got into my swimming costume and i dived into the sea  
 i have never in my life felt anything like that moment 
 i could barely breathe i was gasping for air  i was hyperventilating so much  
 and within seconds my hands were numb  and it was the paradox is that you 're in freezing cold water but actually you 're on fire  
 i swam as hard as i could for five minutes i remember
  just trying to get out of the water i climbed out of the ice  and i remember taking the goggles off my face
 and looking down at my hands in sheer shock  because my fingers
 had swollen so much that they were like sausages  and they were swollen so much i couldn 't even close them 
 what had happened is that we are made partially of water and when water freezes it expands
  expands  and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers
 had frozen and expanded and they had burst  and i was in so much agony  
 i immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower and i remember standing underneath the hot shower and trying to defrost my fingers  
 and i thought 
 in two days ' time i was going to
  do this swim across the north pole  i was going to try and do a 
  swim  for one kilometer across the north pole  and this dream which i had had ever since i was a young boy with my father was just going out the window there is no possibility that this was going to happen  
 and i remember then getting out of the shower and realizing i couldn 't even feel my hands
  and for a swimmer you need to feel your hands
 because you need to be able to grab the water
 and pull it through with you 
 the next morning i woke up and i was in such a state of depression 
 and all i could think about was sir ranulph fiennes for those of you who don 't know him he 's the great british explorer a number of years ago he tried to ski all the way to the north pole
  he accidentally fell through the ice into the sea and
 after just three minutes in that water  he was able to get himself out and his hands were so badly frostbitten that he had to return to england  
 he went to a local hospital and there they said ran there is no possibility of us being able to save these fingers we are going to actually have to take them off
 and ran decided to go into his tool shed
 and take out a saw
 and do it himself  
 and all i could think of was if that happened to ran after three minutes  
 and i can 't feel my hands after five minutes what on earth is going to happen if i try twenty minutes at the very best i 'm going to end up losing some fingers
  and at worst  i didn 't even want to think about it 
 we carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the north pole  and my close friend david  he saw the way i was thinking and he came up to me and he said lewis  
 i 've known you since you were
 eighteen years old  i 've known you  and i know
  deep down right deep down here that you are going to make this swim  
 i so believe in you lewis  i 've seen the way you 've been training and i realize the reason why you 're going to do this this is such an important swim  
 we stand at a very very important moment in this history  
 and you 're going to make a symbolic swim here to try to shake the lapels of world leaders lewis have the courage to go in there because we are going to look after you
 every moment of it
  and i just i got so much confidence from him saying that because he knew me so well so we carried on sailing and we arrived at the north pole  and
 we stopped the ship and it was just as the scientists had predicted there were open patches of sea everywhere  
 and i went down into my cabin and i put on my swimming costume and then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor which measures my core body temperature and my
  heart rate  and then we walked out onto the ice  
 and i remember looking into the ice  
 and there were big chunks of white ice in there and the water was completely black 
 i had never seen black water before  and it is four thousand two hundred meters deep  
 and i said to myself lewis don 't look left don 't look right just scuttle forward and
 and go for it and so i now want to show you a short video of what happened there on the ice
  at this stage when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally  everything just looks so gray around here and looks so cold
 the
  're finally at the north pole this is months and months and months of dreaming to get here years of training and planning and preparation
  get in here and do my swim
  and
 the
 the
  end off by just saying this it took me four months again to feel my hands but was it worth it yes absolutely it was there are very
  very few people who don 't know now about what is happening in the arctic  and people ask me lewis what can we do about climate change and i say to them i think we need to do three 
  things the first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down into manageable chunks you saw during that video all those flags those flags 
  represented the countries from which my team came from and equally when it comes to climate change  every single country is going to have to make cuts
  britain america  japan south africa the congo all of us together we 're all on the same ship together 
 the second thing we need to do is we need to just look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time i remember just a few years 
  ago speaking about climate change  and people heckling me in the back and saying it doesn 't even exist  
  giving a series of speeches in some of the poorest townships in south africa to young children as young as ten years old four
 or five children sitting behind a desk  
 and even in those poorest conditions they all have a very very good grasp of climate change
  but the most important thing
