  one of the things i want to establish right from the start is that
 not all neurosurgeons wear cowboy boots i just wanted you to know that so i am indeed a neurosurgeon  and
 i follow a long tradition
  i 'm going to tell you about today is adjusting the dials in the circuits in the brain being able to go anywhere in the brain and turning areas of the brain up or down to help our patients  
 so as i said  neurosurgery comes from a long tradition it 's been around for about
 seven thousand years in mesoamerica  there used to be neurosurgery and there were these neurosurgeons that used to treat
  and they were trying to they knew that the brain was involved in neurological and psychiatric disease they didn
 't know exactly what they were doing not much has changed by the way
 they thought that if you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease it must be because you are possessed by an evil spirit 
 so if you are possessed by an evil spirit causing neurologic or psychiatric problems
  the way to treat this is of course to make a hole in your skull and let the evil spirit escape  
 so this was the thinking back then and
 these individuals made these holes  sometimes
 the patients were a little bit reluctant to go through this because you can tell that the holes are made partially and then i think there was some trepanation and then they left very quickly and it was only a partial
  they survived these procedures but this was common  there were some sites where one percent of all the skulls have these holes and so you can see that neurologic and psychiatric disease is quite common and it was also quite common
 about seven thousand years ago  now in the course of time we 've come to realize that
 different parts of the brain do different things so there are areas of the brain that are dedicated to controlling your movement or your vision or your memory or your appetite  and so on  and when things
  work well then the nervous system works well and everything functions but once in a while things don 't go so well and there 's trouble in these circuits and there are some rogue neurons 
  that are misfiring and causing trouble or sometimes they 're underactive and they 're not quite working as they should now the manifestation of this depends on where
  in the brain these neurons are so when these neurons are in the motor circuit you get dysfunction in the movement system and you get things like parkinson 's disease  
 when the malfunction is in a circuit that regulates your mood you get things like depression and when it is in a circuit that controls your memory and cognitive function then you get things like alzheimer 's disease  
 so what we 've been able to do is to pinpoint where these disturbances are in the
  and we 've been able to intervene within these circuits in the brain to either turn them up or turn them down so this is very much like choosing the correct station on the radio 
  dial once you choose the right station whether it be jazz or opera in our case whether it be movement or mood we can put the dial there and then we can use a second button to adjust the volume to turn it up or turn it down  so what i 'm going to tell you about is using
  up and down to see if we can help our patients  and this is accomplished using this kind of device  and this is called deep brain stimulation  so what we 're doing is placing these electrodes throughout the brain 
 again we are making holes in the skull about the size of a dime putting an electrode in and then this electrode is completely underneath the skin down to a pacemaker in the chest and with a remote control very much like a
  control we can adjust how much electricity we deliver to these areas of the brain we can turn it up or down on or off 
 now about a hundred thousand patients in the world have received deep brain stimulation  and i 'm going to show you some examples of using deep brain stimulation to treat disorders of movement  disorders of mood and disorders of cognition  
 so this looks something like this when it 's in the brain you see the electrode going
  through the skull into the brain and resting there and we can place this really anywhere in the brain i tell my friends that no neuron is safe from a neurosurgeon because we can really reach just about anywhere in the brain quite safely now 
 now the first example i 'm going to show you is a patient with parkinson 's disease and this lady has parkinson 's disease and she has these electrodes in her brain
  and i 'm going to show you what she 's like when the electrodes are turned off and she has her parkinson 's symptoms and then we 're going to turn it on  so this looks something like this the electrodes are
 turned off now and you can see that she has tremor
  and this works like that  instantly  and the difference between shaking in this way and not 
 the difference between shaking in this way and not is related to the misbehavior of twenty five thousand neurons in her subthalamic nucleus
  so we now know how to find these troublemakers and tell them gentlemen that 's enough we want you to stop doing that and we do that with electricity so we use electricity to dictate how they fire  and we try to block their misbehavior using electricity  
 so in this case we are suppressing the activity of abnormal neurons 
 we started using this technique in other problems and i 'm going to tell you about a fascinating problem that we encountered a case of dystonia  
  is a disorder affecting children it 's a genetic disorder and it involves a twisting motion and these children get progressively more and more twisting until they can 't breathe until they get sores  urinary infections and then they die  
 so back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven i was asked to see this young boy  perfectly normal he has this genetic form of dystonia  
 there are eight children in the family  five of them have dystonia  
 so here he is
  this boy is nine years old  perfectly normal until the age six  and then he started twisting his body  first the right foot then the
 left foot  then the right arm  then the left arm  
 then the trunk  and then by the time he arrived within the course of one or two years of the disease onset he could no longer walk he could no longer stand he was crippled  
 and indeed the natural progression as this gets worse is for them to become progressively twisted progressively disabled and many of these children
  do not survive
 so he is one of five kids the only way he could get around was crawling on his belly like this 
 he did not respond to any drugs we did not know what to do with this boy  we did not know what operation to do where to go in the brain 
 but on the basis of our results in parkinson 's disease we reasoned why don 't we try to suppress the same area in the brain that we
  suppressed in
 parkinson 's disease and let 's see what happens  so here he was we operated on him hoping that he would get better  we did not know 
 so here he is now back in israel where he lives three months after the procedure  and here he is
  on the basis of this result this is now a procedure that 's done throughout the world and there have been hundreds of children that have been helped with this kind of surgery  
 this boy is now in university
 and leads quite a normal life this has been one of the most satisfying cases that i have ever done in my entire career to restore movement and walking to this kind of
 we realized that perhaps we could use this technology not 
  only in circuits that control your movement but also circuits that control other things and the next thing that we took on was circuits that control your mood 
  electroconvulsive therapy  but there are millions of people  and there are still ten or twenty percent of patients with depression that do not respond and it is these patients that we want to help and let 's see if we can use this technique to help these patients with depression  
 so the first thing we did was we compared what 's different in the brain of someone with depression and someone who is normal  and what we did was pet scans
  look at the blood flow of the brain and what we noticed is that in patients with depression compared to normals 
 areas of the brain are shut down and those are the areas in blue  so here you really have the blues  and the areas in blue are areas that are involved in motivation in drive 
  and decision making and indeed if you 're severely depressed as these patients were those are impaired you lack motivation and drive 
  is the sadness center of the brain if i make any of you sad for example i make you remember the last time you saw your parent before they died or a friend before they died this area of the brain lights up it is the sadness center of the brain  
 and so patients with depression have hyperactivity the area of the brain for sadness is on red hot  the thermostat is set at one hundred degrees  
 and the other areas of the brain involved in
  are shut down  so we wondered can we place electrodes in this area of sadness and see if we can turn down the thermostat can we turn down the activity  and what will be the consequence of that  
 so we went ahead and implanted electrodes in patients with depression this is work done with my colleague helen mayberg from emory  and we placed electrodes in area twenty five and in the top scan you see before the operation area twenty five the sadness area is red hot  and the frontal lobes are shut down in
  and then after three months of continuous stimulation twenty four hours a day or six months of continuous stimulation  we have a complete reversal of this we 're able to drive down area twenty five 
 down to a more normal level  and we 're able to turn back online the frontal lobes of the brain  and indeed we 're seeing very striking results in these patients with severe depression  
 so now we are in clinical trials and are in phase iii clinical trials  and this may become a new procedure if it 's safe and we find that it 's effective to treat patients with severe depression
 i 've shown you that we can use deep brain stimulation to
 treat the motor system in cases of parkinson 's disease and dystonia  i 've shown you that we can use it to treat a mood circuit in cases of depression  
 can we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter 
 laughter anybody interested in that
  we can right so what we 've decided to do is we 're going to try to turbocharge the memory circuits in the brain we
 're going to place electrodes within the circuits that regulate your memory and cognitive function to see if we can turn up their activity  
 now we 're not going to do this in normal
  're going to do this in people that have cognitive deficits  and we 've chosen to treat patients with alzheimer 's disease who have cognitive and memory deficits as you know this is the main symptom of early onset alzheimer 's disease  
 so we 've placed electrodes within this circuit in an area of the brain called the fornix  which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory 
  circuit  and whether that can in turn help these patients with alzheimer 's disease
 it turns out that in alzheimer 's disease  there 's a huge deficit in glucose utilization in the brain  the brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose it uses twenty 
  percent of all your even though it only weighs two percent it uses ten times more glucose than it should based on its weight twenty percent of all the glucose in your body is used by the brain 
  alzheimer 's disease  then there are areas of the brain that stop using glucose they shut down they turn off 
 and indeed what we see is that these areas in red around the outside ribbon of the brain are progressively getting more and more blue until they shut down completely 
 this is analogous to having a power failure in an area of the brain a regional power failure so the lights are out in parts of the brain in patients with alzheimer 's disease
  and the question is are the lights out forever or can we turn the lights back on can we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again  
 so this is what we did we implanted electrodes in the fornix of patients with alzheimer 's disease we turned it on  and we looked at what happens to glucose use in the brain  
 and indeed at the top you 'll see before the surgery
  the areas in blue are the areas that use less glucose than normal predominantly the parietal and temporal lobes these areas of the brain are shut down the lights are out in these areas of the brain  
 we then put in the dbs electrodes and we wait for a month or a year and the areas in red represent the areas where we increase glucose utilization and indeed we are able to get these areas of the brain 
 that were not using glucose to use glucose once again  so the message here is that in alzheimer 's disease  the lights are out but there is someone home  and we 're able to turn the power back
  on to these areas of the brain  and as we do so we expect that their functions will return  
 so this is now in clinical trials  we are going to operate on fifty patients with early alzheimer 's disease to see whether this is safe and effective whether we can improve their neurologic function
  message i want to leave you with today is that  indeed  there are several circuits in the brain that are malfunctioning across various disease states 
 whether we 're talking about parkinson 's disease  depression schizophrenia alzheimer 's  we are now learning to understand what are the circuits what are the areas of the brain that are responsible for the clinical
 signs and the symptoms of those diseases we can now reach those circuits  we can introduce electrodes within those circuits  we can graduate the activity of those circuits we can turn them
 down if they are overactive if they 're causing trouble trouble that is felt throughout the brain or we can turn them up if they are underperforming  and in so doing  we think that we may be able to help the overall function of the brain  
 the implications of this of course
  is that we may be able to modify the symptoms of the disease but i haven 't told you but there 's also some evidence that we might be able to help the repair of damaged areas of the brain using electricity  and this is something for the future to see if indeed 
 we not only change the activity but also some of the reparative functions of the brain can be harvested  
 so i envision that we 're going to see a great expansion of indications of this technique we
 're going to see electrodes being placed for many disorders of the brain  one of the most exciting things about this is that indeed it involves
  work it involves the work of engineers of imaging scientists of basic scientists of neurologists psychiatrists neurosurgeons and certainly at the interface
 of these multiple disciplines that there 's the excitement  
 and i think that we will see that we will be able to chase more of these evil spirits out from the brain as time goes on  and the consequence of that of course will be that we will be able to help many more patients
