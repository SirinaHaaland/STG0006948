  you want to be when you
  mowgli from the jungle book 
 because they were all about being free the wind in your hair just to be free  
 and on my seventeenth birthday my parents knowing how much i loved speed  gave me one driving lesson for my seventeenth birthday  
 not that we could have afforded i drive
  but to give me the dream of driving  and on my seventeenth birthday  i accompanied my little sister
 in complete innocence as i always had all my life
 my visually impaired sister to go to see an eye specialist  because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters 
 and my little sister wanted to be a pilot god help her so i used to get my eyes tested just for fun
 and on my seventeenth birthday  after my fake eye exam  
 the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday  and he said so what are you going to do to celebrate 
 and i took that driving lesson and i said i 'm going to learn how to drive 
 and then there was a silence one of those awful silences
  when you know something 's wrong  and he turned to my mother  and he said you haven 't told her yet 
 on my seventeenth birthday  
 as janis ian would best say i learned the truth at seventeen 
 i am and have been since birth  legally blind
 and you know how on earth did i get to seventeen
 and not know that well if anybody says country music isn 't powerful let me tell you this i got there
 because my father 's passion for johnny cash and a song a boy named sue i 'm the eldest of three i was born in
  seventy one and very shortly after my birth my parents found out i had a condition called ocular albinism  
 and what the hell does that mean to you  so let me just tell you the great part of all of this i can 't see this clock and i can 't see the timing so holy god woohoo 
 laughter i might buy some more time  but more importantly let me tell you  i 'm going to come up really close here don
  beyond this hand is a world of vaseline every man in this room  even you steve is george clooney 
 and every woman  you are so beautiful  
 and when i want to look beautiful i step three feet away from the mirror and i don 't have to see these lines etched in my face from all the squinting i 've done all my life from all the dark lights  
  strange part is that at three and a half just before i was going to school my parents made a bizarre unusual and incredibly brave decision 
 no special needs schools 
 no labels no limitations 
 my ability and my potential and they decided to tell me
 that i could see
 so just like johnny cash 's sue 
 a boy given a girl 's name 
 i would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive when they were no longer there to protect me  
 or just take it all away  
 but more significantly
  they gave me the ability to believe totally to believe
 that i could and so when i heard that eye specialist tell me
 all the things a big fat no everybody imagines i was devastated  and don 't get me wrong because when i first heard it
 aside from the fact that i thought he was insane
 i got that thump in my chest just that huh 
 but very quickly i recovered  it was like that the first thing i thought about was my mom who was crying
 over beside me  
 and i swear to god i walked out of his office i will drive  i will drive  you 're mad i 'll drive i know i can drive 
 and with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since i was such a child he taught me how to sail knowing i could never see where i was going  i could never see the
  i couldn 't see the sails  and i couldn 't see the destination but he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face 
 and that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and i would drive and for the next eleven years i swore nobody would ever find out that i couldn 't see because i didn 't want 
 to be a failure  and i didn 't want to be weak and i believed i could do it so i rammed through life
  as only a casey can do  and i was an archeologist and then i broke things  and then i managed a restaurant and then i slipped on things  and then i was a masseuse and then i was a landscape gardener  and then i went to business school and you 
  know disabled people are hugely educated  and then i went in and i got a global consulting job with accenture and they didn 't even know  
  wonderfully my eyes decided enough 
 and temporarily  very unexpectedly they dropped  
 and i 'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world where you work hard play hard you gotta be the best you gotta be the best and two years in i really could see very little
  and i found myself in front of an hr manager
 in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine saying something i never imagined that i would say i  was twenty eight years old i had built a persona
 all around what i could and couldn 't do  and i simply said i 'm sorry  
 i can 't see  and i need help asking for help can be incredibly difficult
  you all know what it is you don 't need to have a disability to know that we all know how hard it is to to admit weakness and failure  and it 's frightening isn 't it 
 but all that belief had fueled me so long and can i tell you  operating in the sighted world when you can 't see it 's kind of difficult
 it really is can i tell you airports are a disaster oh 
 for the love of god  and please any designers out there ok designers please put up your hands
  can 't even see
 you  i always end up in the gents ' toilets and there 's nothing wrong with my sense of smell  but can i just tell you  the little sign for a gents ' toilet or a ladies ' toilet is determined by a triangle 
 have you ever tried to see that if you  have vaseline in front of your eyes it 's
 such a small thing right  and you know how exhausting it can be to try to be perfect
 when you 're not or to be somebody that you aren 't and so after admitting i couldn 't see to hr they sent me off to an eye specialist  
 and i had no idea that this man was going to change my life but before i got to him  i was so lost i had
 no idea who i was anymore  and that eye specialist he didn 't bother testing my eyes god no  it was therapy  and he asked me several questions of which many were
  so hard
 not to be yourself 
 and do you love what you do caroline 
 and you know when you go to a global consulting firm they put a chip in your head and you 're like i love accenture i love accenture i love my job i love accenture i love accenture i love accenture i love my job i love accenture 
 to leave would be failure  
 and he said do you love it i couldn 't even
  so choked up i just was so
 how do i tell him  and then he said to me what did you want to be when you were little 
 now listen  i wasn 't going to say to him well i wanted to race cars and motorbikes hardly appropriate at this moment in time he thought i was mad enough anyway 
 and as i left his office he called me back
 and he said i think it 's time i think it 's time to stop fighting and do something different 
  and that door closed and that silence just outside a doctor 's office that many of us know 
 and my chest ached  
 and i had no idea where i was going i had no idea but i did know the game was up 
 and i went home and because the pain in my chest ached so much i thought i 'll go out for a run really not a very sensible thing to do
 and i went on a run that i know so well i know this run so well by the back of my hand i always run it perfectly fine i count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have
  lot of meetings with and there was a rock that i always missed and i 'd never fallen on it never  
 and there i was crying away  and smash  bash on my rock broken fallen
 over
 on this rock in the middle of march in two thousand typical irish weather on a wednesday gray snot tears
  and i was broken  and i was angry  
 and i didn 't know what to do  and i sat there for quite some time going how am i going to get off this rock and go home  because who am i going to be what
 am i going to be 
 and i thought about my dad and i thought good god i 'm so not sue now 
 and i kept thinking over and over in my mind what had happened where did it go wrong why didn 't i understand  and you know the extraordinary part of it is i just simply had no
  answers  i had lost my belief look where my belief had brought me to and now i had lost it and now i really couldn 't see  i was crumpled  
 and then i remember thinking about that
 eye specialist asking me what do you want to be what do you want to be what did you want to be when you were little do you love what you do do something different what do you want to be do something different
  and it did happen this way  and then the minute it came  it blew up in my head and bashed in my heart
 something different well how about mowgli from ' the jungle book ' you don 't get more different than that 
  and i mean the moment 
 the moment that hit me i swear to god it was like
 hoo you know something to believe in and nobody can tell me no yes you can say i can 't be an archeologist but you can 't tell me no i can 't be mowgli because guess what nobody 's ever done it before so i 'm going to go do it and it doesn
 't matter whether i 'm a boy or a girl i 'm just going to scoot  and so i got off that rock and oh my god did i run home and i sprinted home and i didn 't fall and i
  and i ran up the stairs  and there was one of my favorite books of all time travels on my elephant by mark shand i don 't know if any of you know it and i grabbed this book off and i 'm sitting on the couch going 
 i know what i 'm going to do i know how to be mowgli  i 'm going to go across india on the back of an elephant  
 i 'm going to be an elephant handler 
 and i had no idea how i was going to be an elephant handler
  from global management consultant to elephant handler  i had no idea how i had no idea how you hire an elephant get an elephant i didn 't speak hindi i 'd never been to india hadn 't a clue  but i knew 
  i would because when you make a decision at the right time and the right place god that universe makes it happen for you  
 the most powerful thing of all it 's not that i didn 't achieve before then oh my god i did but you know i was believing in the wrong thing  because i wasn 't believing in me  really me all the bits of me
 all the bits of all of us do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we 're not  
 and you know what when you really believe in yourself and everything about you it 's extraordinary what happens  and you know what that trip that thousand kilometers it raised enough
 money for six thousand cataract eye operations six thousand people got to see because of that when i came home off that elephant do you know what the most amazing part was 
 i chucked in my job at accenture  i left and i became a social entrepreneur and i set up an organization with mark shand called elephant family which deals with asian elephant conservation and i set up kanchi  
 because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant because disability is like the elephant in the room
  and i wanted to make you see it in a positive way no charity no pity  but i wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting
 and possible
 it was extraordinary that 's what i wanted to do  and i never thought about noes anymore
  not seeing or any of that kind of nothing it just seemed that it was possible  
 and you know  the oddest part is when i was on my way traveling here to ted  i 'll be honest 
 i was petrified  and i speak but this is an amazing audience  
 and what am i doing here
  but as i was traveling here you 'll be very happy to know i did use my white symbol stick cane  
 because it 's really good to skip queues in the airport and i got my way here
 being happily proud that i couldn 't see  
 and the one thing is that a really good friend of mine he texted me on the way over knowing i was scared  even though i present confident i was scared he said
  you know what  cars and motorbikes and and elephants that 's not freedom 
 being absolutely true to yourself is freedom  and i never needed eyes to see never i simply needed vision and belief and if you truly believe and i mean believe from the bottom of your heart
 you can make change happen and we need to make it
  every single one of us woman man gay straight  disabled perfect normal whatever
 everyone of us must
 be the very best of ourselves  i no longer want anybody to be invisible we all have to be included  and stop with the labels  the limiting
  losing of labels  because we are not jam jars we are extraordinary different
