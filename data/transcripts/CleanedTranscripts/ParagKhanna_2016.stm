  i want you to reimagine how life is organized on earth 
 think of the planet like a human body that we inhabit  the skeleton
 is the transportation system of roads and railways  bridges and tunnels
 air and seaports that enable our mobility across the continents  the vascular system that powers the body
 are the oil and gas pipelines and electricity grids that distribute energy and the nervous system of communications
 is the internet cables  satellites cellular networks and data centers that allow us to share information this
 infrastructural matrix
 already consists of sixty four million kilometers of roads 
 four million kilometers of railways two million kilometers of pipelines
 and one million kilometers of internet cables  what about international
  we have less than five hundred thousand kilometers of borders  
 let 's build a better map of the world  and we can start by overcoming some ancient mythology 
 there 's a saying with which all students of history are familiar 
 geography is destiny sounds so grave doesn 't it it
 's such a fatalistic adage  it tells us that landlocked countries are condemned to be poor
  small countries cannot escape their larger neighbors that vast distances are insurmountable 
 but every journey i take around the world  i see an even greater force sweeping the planet 
 connectivity the global connectivity revolution  in all of its forms transportation energy and communications
 has enabled such a quantum
  leap in the mobility
 of people of goods of resources of knowledge such that we can no longer even think of geography as distinct from it 
 in fact  i view the two forces as fusing together into what i call 
  represents a quantum leap in the mobility of people resources and ideas
  but it is an evolution an evolution
 of the world from political geography  which is how we legally divide the world  
 to functional geography  which is how we actually use the world 
 from nations and borders to infrastructure and supply chains  
 our global system is evolving
 from the vertically integrated empires of the  19th century  
 through the horizontally interdependent nations of the 20th century into a global network civilization
 in the 21st century  connectivity not sovereignty has become the organizing
  we are becoming this global network civilization because we are literally building it 
 all of the world 's defense budgets and military spending taken together total just under two trillion dollars per year  
 meanwhile our global infrastructure spending is projected to rise to nine trillion dollars per year within the coming decade and well it should we have been
  living off an infrastructure stock meant for a world population of three billion 
 as our population has crossed seven billion to eight billion and eventually nine billion and more 
 as a rule of thumb  we should spend about one trillion dollars on the basic infrastructure needs of every billion people in the world
  not surprisingly asia is in the lead 
 in two thousand and fifteen  china announced the creation of the asian infrastructure investment bank  
 which together with a network of other organizations
 aims to construct a network of iron and silk roads stretching from shanghai to lisbon 
 and as all of this topographical engineering unfolds
  we will likely spend more on infrastructure in the next forty years we will build more infrastructure in the next forty years than we have in the past four thousand years  
 now let 's stop and think about it for a minute  spending so much more on building the foundations of global society
 rather than on the tools to destroy it can have profound
 profound consequences 
 connectivity is how we optimize the distribution of people and resources around the world  
 it is how mankind comes to be more than just the sum of its parts 
 i believe that is what is happening 
 connectivity has a twin megatrend in the 21st century  planetary urbanization 
 cities are the infrastructures that most define us by two thousand and thirty more than two thirds
  of the world 's population will live in cities and these are not mere little dots on the map  but they are vast archipelagos stretching hundreds of kilometers  
 here we are in vancouver  at the head of the cascadia corridor that stretches south across the us border to seattle  
 the technology powerhouse of silicon valley begins north of
 san francisco down to san jose and across the bay to oakland 
 the sprawl of los angeles now passes san diego across the mexican border to tijuana 
 san diego and tijuana now share an share an airport terminal where you can exit into either country 
 eventually a high speed rail network may connect the entire pacific spine  
 america 's northeastern megalopolis begins in boston through new york and philadelphia to
  it contains more than fifty million people and also has plans for a high speed rail network but asia is where we really see the megacities coming together 
 this continuous strip of light from tokyo through nagoya to osaka
 contains more than eighty million people and most of japan 's economy  it is the world 's largest megacity for now  
 but in china megacity clusters are coming together with populations reaching one hundred million people the bohai
  rim around beijing  the yangtze river delta around shanghai and the pearl river delta stretching from hong kong north to guangzhou  and in the middle the
  megacity cluster  whose geographic footprint is almost the same size as the country of austria 
 and any number of these megacity clusters has a gdp approaching two trillion dollars that 's almost the same as all
  of india today 
 so imagine if our global diplomatic institutions  such as the g20 
 were to base their membership on economic size rather than national representation 
 some chinese megacities may be in and have a seat at the table  while entire countries like argentina or indonesia would be out  
 moving to india  whose population will soon exceed
  that of china  it too has a number of megacity clusters such as the delhi capital region and mumbai 
 in the middle east  greater tehran is absorbing one third of iran 's population most of egypt 's eighty million people live in the corridor between cairo and alexandria  
 and in the gulf a necklace of city states is forming from bahrain and qatar through the united arab emirates to muscat in oman
 and then there 's lagos 
 africa 's largest city and nigeria 's commercial hub  
 it has plans for a rail network that will make it the anchor of a vast atlantic coastal corridor stretching across benin  togo and ghana to abidjan the capital of the ivory coast  
 but these countries are suburbs of lagos  
 in a megacity
  world countries can be suburbs of cities  
 by two thousand and thirty we will have as many as fifty such megacity clusters
 in the world  so which map tells you more our traditional map of two hundred discrete nations that hang on most of our walls or this map
 of the fifty megacity clusters  and yet even this is
  incomplete because you cannot understand any individual megacity without understanding its connections to the others 
 people move to cities to be connected and connectivity is why these cities thrive  
 any number of them such as sao paulo or istanbul or moscow has a gdp approaching or exceeding one third of one half of their entire national gdp
 but equally importantly you cannot calculate any of their individual value without understanding the role of the flows of people of finance of technology that enable them to thrive  
 take the gauteng province of south africa which contains johannesburg and the capital pretoria  
 it too represents just over a third of south africa 's gdp  
 but equally importantly
  it is home to the offices of almost every single multinational corporation that invests directly into south africa and indeed into the entire african continent 
 cities want to be part of global value chains  they want to be part of this global division of labor 
 that is how cities think 
 i 've never met a mayor who said to me i want my city to be cut off
  know that their cities belong as much to the global network civilization as to their home countries 
 now for many people urbanization causes great dismay  they think cities are wrecking the planet  
 but right now there are more than two hundred intercity learning networks thriving that is as many as the number of intergovernmental
  organizations that we have 
 and all of these intercity networks are devoted to one purpose mankind 's number one priority in the 21st century  
 sustainable urbanization 
 is it working 
 let 's take climate change we know that summit after summit in new york and paris is not going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  but what
  we can see is that transferring technology and knowledge and policies between cities is how we 've actually begun to reduce the carbon intensity of our economies 
 cities are learning from each other how to install zero emissions buildings how to deploy electric car sharing systems  
 in major chinese cities they 're imposing quotas on the number of cars on the streets  in many western cities young people don 't even want to
  anymore 
 cities have been part of the problem now they are part of the solution 
 inequality is the other great challenge to achieving sustainable urbanization  
 when i travel through megacities from end to end it takes hours and days
 i experience the tragedy of extreme disparity within the same geography  and yet
  global stock of financial assets has never been larger approaching three hundred trillion dollars that 's almost four times the actual gdp of the world  
 we have taken on such enormous debts since the financial crisis  but have we invested them in inclusive growth 
  only when we build sufficient affordable public housing when we invest in robust transportation networks to allow people to connect to each other both physically and digitally 
 that 's when our divided cities and societies will come to feel whole again 
 and that is why infrastructure has just been included in the united nations sustainable development goals because it enables all the
  others  our political and economic leaders are learning that connectivity is not charity  it 's opportunity  
 and that 's why our financial community needs to understand that connectivity is the most important asset class of the 21st century  
 now cities can make the world more sustainable they can make the world more equitable i also believe
 that connectivity between cities can make the world more peaceful 
 if we look at regions of the world with dense relations across borders  we see more trade more investment and more stability 
 we all know the story of europe after world war ii where industrial integration kicked off a process that gave rise to today 's peaceful european
  and you can see that russia  by the way is the least connected of major powers in the international system 
 and that goes a long way towards explaining the tensions today countries that have less stake in the system
 also have less to lose in disturbing it in north america the lines that matter most on the map are not the 
  us canada border or the us mexico
  but the dense network of roads and railways and pipelines and electricity grids and even water canals that are forming an integrated north american union 
 north america does not need more walls  
 it needs more connections 
 but the real promise of connectivity
  is in the postcolonial world all of those regions where borders have historically been the most arbitrary
 and where generations of leaders have had hostile relations with each other but now a new group of leaders has come into power and is burying the hatchet  
 let 's take southeast asia where high speed rail networks are planned to connect bangkok to singapore and trade corridors from vietnam to myanmar now this
  region of six hundred million people coordinates its agricultural resources and its industrial output  it is evolving
 into what i call a pax asiana a peace among southeast asian nations 
 a similar phenomenon is underway in east africa where a half dozen countries are investing in railways and multimodal corridors so that landlocked countries can get their goods to market 
 now these countries coordinate their utilities and their investment policies
  policies  they too are evolving into a pax africana 
 one region we know could especially use this kind of thinking is the middle east  
 as arab states tragically collapse what is left behind but the ancient cities such as cairo  beirut and baghdad  in
  the nearly four hundred million people of the arab world are almost entirely urbanized 
 as societies as cities  they are either water rich or water poor  energy rich or energy poor  
 and the only way to correct these mismatches
 is not through more wars and more borders  but through more connectivity of pipelines and water canals 
 sadly this is not yet the map of the middle east  but it should be
  connected
 pax arabia  
 internally integrated and productively connected to its neighbors europe asia and africa 
 now it may not seem like connectivity is what we want right now towards the world 's most turbulent region  
 but we know from history that more connectivity is the only way to bring about stability in the long run because we know that in region after region
 is the new reality cities and countries are learning to aggregate
 into more peaceful and prosperous wholes  
 but the real test is going to be asia 
 can connectivity overcome the patterns of rivalry among the great powers of the far east  
 after all this is where world war iii is supposed to break out  
 since the end of
  the cold war a quarter century ago at least six major wars have been predicted for this region but none have broken out  
 take china and taiwan 
 in the 1990s this was everyone 's leading world war iii scenario 
 but since that time the trade and investment volumes across the straits have become so intense that last november leaders from both sides held a historic summit
 to discuss eventual peaceful reunification and even the election of a nationalist party in taiwan that 's 
 earlier this year does not undermine this fundamental dynamic 
 china and japan have an even longer history of rivalry and have been deploying their air forces and navies to show their strength in
  but in recent years  japan has been making its largest foreign investments in china  japanese cars are selling in record numbers there 
 and guess where the largest number of foreigners residing in japan today comes from you guessed it china 
 china and india have fought a major war and have three outstanding border disputes  but today india is the second
  largest shareholder in the asian infrastructure investment bank  they 're building a trade corridor stretching from northeast india through myanmar and bangladesh to southern china 
 their trade volume has grown from twenty billion dollars a decade ago to eighty billion dollars today
 nuclear armed india and pakistan have fought three wars and continue to dispute kashmir  but they 're also negotiating a
  trade agreement
 and want to complete a pipeline stretching from iran through pakistan to india and let 's talk about iran 
 wasn 't it just two years ago that war with iran seemed inevitable 
 then why is every single major power rushing to do business there today  
 ladies and gentlemen i cannot guarantee that world war iii will not
  but we can definitely see why it hasn 't happened yet 
 even though asia is home to the world 's fastest growing militaries these same countries are also investing billions of dollars in each other 's infrastructure and supply chains  
 they are more interested in each other 's functional geography than in their political geography  
 and that is why their leaders think twice
  step back from the brink  and decide to focus on economic ties over territorial tensions 
 so often it seems like the world is falling apart  
 but building more connectivity is how we put humpty dumpty back together again  much better than before  
 and by wrapping the world in such seamless physical and digital connectivity 
 we evolve towards a world in which people can rise above their geographic
  constraints  
 we are the cells and vessels pulsing through these global connectivity networks 
 everyday  hundreds of millions of people go online and work with people they 've never met 
 more than one billion people cross borders every year  and that 's expected to rise to three billion in
  the global network civilization
