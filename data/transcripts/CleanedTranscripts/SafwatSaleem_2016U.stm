  i used to have this recurring dream where i 'd walk into a roomful of people  and i 'd try not to make eye contact with anyone 
 until someone notices me and i just panic
  and the person walks up to me and says hi my name is so and so and what is your name 
 and i 'm just quiet  unable to respond  
 after some awkward silence he goes have you forgotten your name and i 'm still quiet  
 and then slowly all the other people in the room begin to turn toward me
 and ask  almost
  the chant gets louder i want to respond but i don 't i
 'm a visual artist some of my work
 is humorous and some is a bit funny but in a sad way and
 one thing that i really enjoy doing is making these little animations where i get to do the voice over for all kinds of characters  i 've been a bear
 a few years ago i made this educational video about the history of video games  and for that one  i got to do the voice of space invader
  i look forward to the next one ss this was just the first
 of a two part video i was going to work on the second one next i hit refresh comment where is part two whereeeee i need it nowwwww p ss 
 people other than my mom were saying nice things about me
  please don 't use this narrator again u can barely understand him ss refresh comment couldn 't follow because of the indian
  two things number one i don 't have an indian accent i have a pakistani accent ok and number two i clearly have a pakistani accent 
 laughter but comments like that kept coming in so i figured i should just ignore them and start working on the second part of the video  
 i recorded my audio  but every time i sat down to edit  i just could not do it 
 every single time
  would take me back to my childhood when i had a much harder time speaking  i 've stuttered for as long as i can remember  
 i was the kid in class who would never raise his hand when he had a question or knew the answer every time the phone rang i would run to the bathroom so i would not have to answer it
 if it was for me my parents would say i 'm not around  
 i spent a lot of time in the bathroom
 and i hated introducing myself especially in groups 
 i 'd always stutter on my name and there was usually someone who 'd go have you forgotten your name and then everybody would laugh 
 that joke never got old 
 i spent my childhood feeling that if i spoke  it would become obvious
  that that there was something wrong with me that i was not normal so i mostly stayed quiet  
 and so you see eventually for me to even be able to use my voice in my work was a huge step for me 
 every time i record audio i fumble my way through saying each sentence many many times
  then i go back in and pick the ones where i think i suck the least ss 
 audio editing is like photoshop for your voice i can
 slow it down speed it up make it deeper add an echo  and if i stutter along the way  
 and if i stutter along the way  i just go back in and fix it it 's magic  
 ss using my highly edited voice in my work was a way for me to finally sound normal to myself  
 but after the
  comments on the video  it no longer made me feel normal  and so i stopped using my voice in my work
 since then i 've thought a lot about what it means to be normal  
 and i 've come to understand that normal has a lot to do with expectations  
 let me give you an example  i came across this story about the ancient greek writer homer
 now homer mentions very few colors in his writing 
 and even when he does he seems to get them quite a bit wrong 
 for example the sea is described as wine red people 's faces are sometimes green and sheep are purple but it 's
 not just homer if you look at all of the ancient literature ancient chinese icelandic greek indian and even the original hebrew bible
 they all mention very few colors 
 and the most popular theory for why that might be the case is that cultures begin to recognize a color only once they have the ability to make that color so basically if you can make a color only then can you see it 
 a color like red  which was fairly easy for many cultures to make they began to see that color fairly early on but a color like blue which was much
  harder to make many cultures didn 't begin to learn how to make that color until much later they didn
 't begin to see it until much later as well so until then even though a color might be all around them 
 they simply did not have the ability to see it it was invisible it was not a part of their normal 
 and that story has helped put my own experience into context so when i first read the comments on the video
  initial reaction was to take it all very personally but the people commenting did not know how self conscious i am about my voice
 they were mostly reacting to my accent that it is not normal
 for a narrator to have an accent  but what is normal anyway  we know that reviewers will find
  more spelling errors in your writing if they think you 're black
 we know that professors are less likely to help female or minority students  
 and we know that resumes with white sounding names get more callbacks than resumes with black sounding names 
 why is that 
 because of our expectations of what is normal  we think it is normal when a black student has spelling errors  we think it is normal
 when a female or minority student does not succeed
 and we think it is normal that a white employee is a better hire than a black employee  
 but studies also show that discrimination of this kind in most cases is simply favoritism and it results more from wanting to help people that you can relate to
 than the desire to harm people that you can 't relate to and not relating to people starts at a very early age let me give you an example
  one library that keeps track of characters in the children 's book collection
 every year found that in two thousand and fourteen only about eleven percent of the books had a character of color and just the year before that number was about eight percent  
 even though half of american children today come from a minority background half so
 there are two big issues here
  number one children are told that they can be anything they can do anything and yet most stories that children of color consume are about people who are not like them
 number two is that majority groups don 't get to realize the great extent to which they are similar to minorities
 our everyday experiences  our hopes our dreams our fears
 and our mutual love
  just like the color blue for ancient greeks minorities are not a part of what we consider normal  
 because normal is simply a construction of what we 've been exposed to and how visible it is around us 
 and this is where things get a bit difficult 
 i can accept the preexisting notion of normal that normal is good and anything outside of that very
  narrow definition of normal is bad or i can challenge that preexisting notion of normal
 with my work and with my voice
 and with my accent and by standing here onstage even though i 'm scared shitless and would rather be in the bathroom
  now slowly starting to use my voice in my work again
  and it feels good it does not mean i won 't have a breakdown the next time a couple dozen people say that i talk like i have peanut butter in my mouth ss 
 it just means i now have a much better understanding of what 's at stake  and how giving up is not an
 the ancient greeks didn 't just wake up one day and realize that the sky was blue  
 it took centuries even for humans to realize what we had been ignoring for so long 
 and so we must continuously challenge our notion of normal  because doing so is going to
  allow us as a society to finally see the sky for what it is
