  harsh up here i mean i 'm nervous enough
  but i am not as nervous as i was five weeks ago five weeks ago i had total hip replacement surgery 
 do you know that surgery electric saw  power drill totally disgusting
 unless you 're david bolinsky in which case it 's all truth and beauty  sure david if it 's not your hip it 's truth and beauty
  anyway i did have a really big epiphany around the situation so chris invited me to tell you
  first you need to know two things about me just two things i 'm canadian 
 and i 'm the youngest of seven kids now in canada we have that great healthcare system that means we get our new hips for free  
 and being the youngest of seven i have never
 been at the front of the line for anything ok so my hip had been hurting me for years i finally went to the doctor which was free  and she referred me
  to an orthopedic surgeon  also free finally got to see him after ten months of waiting almost a year that is what free gets you  
 i met the surgeon and he took some free x rays and i got a good look at them  and you know even i could tell my hip was bad and i actually work in marketing 
 so he said allison we 've
 got to get you on the table  i 'm going to replace your hip
  eighteen more months  i 'd already waited ten months  and i had to wait eighteen more months 
 you know it 's such a long wait that i actually started to even think about it in terms of teds  i wouldn 't have my new hip for this ted 
 i wouldn 't have my new hip for tedglobal in africa  i would not have my new hip for  ted2008 i would still be on my bad hip 
 that was so disappointing so i left his office
 and i was walking through the hospital and that 's when i had my epiphany  this youngest of seven
 had to get herself
 to the front of the line  oh yeah  can i tell you how un canadian that is we do
 not think that way  we don 't talk about it  it 's not even a consideration in fact when we 're traveling abroad it 's how we identify fellow canadians
  to butting any geezer off the list some 70 year old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing or gardening no no front of the
 line so by now i was walking the lobby and of course that hurt because of my hip and
 i kind of needed a sign  and i saw a sign 
 in the window of the hospital 's tiny gift shop
  they signed me up immediately  
 no reference checks none of the usual background stuff no  they were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was seventy five yeah 
 they needed some young blood so next thing you know i had my bright blue volunteer vest i had my photo id  and i was fully trained by my
  morning i was at the gift shop  while ringing in hospital staff 's tic tacs i 'd casually ask what do you do 
 then i 'd tell them well  i 'm getting my hip replaced in eighteen months it 's
 gonna be so great when the pain stops ow 
 all the staff got to know the plucky young volunteer
  my next surgeon 's appointment was coincidentally right after a shift at the gift shop so naturally i had my vest and my identification 
 i draped them casually over the chair in the doctor 's office 
 and you know when he walked in i could just tell that he saw them 
 moments later i had a surgery date just weeks away  and
