  we could start by just telling us about your country it
 's three dots there on the globe  those dots are pretty huge i think each one is about the size of california tell us about kiribati anote tong well 
  let me first begin by saying how deeply grateful i am for this opportunity to share my story
 with people who do care  i think i 've been sharing my story with
 a lot of people who don 't care too much  but
 kiribati is comprised of three groups of islands  the gilbert group on the the west we have the the phoenix islands in the middle and the
  is perhaps the only country
 that is actually in the four corners of the world because we are in the northern hemisphere in the southern hemisphere  and also in the east and the west of the international date line 
 these islands are
 entirely made up of coral atolls  and
 on average about two meters
  been asked by people you know  you 're suffering why don 't you move back they don 't understand they have no
 concept of what it is that 's involved 
 with the rising sea they say well you can move back and so this is what i tell them if we move back we will fall off on the other side of the ocean
 but these are the kinds of issues that
 people don 't understand ca so certainly this is
 just a picture of fragility there when was it that you yourself realized that
 there might be impending peril for your country at well the story of climate change has been one that has been going on for quite a number of decades and
 when i came into office
  three i began talking about climate change at the united nations general assembly but
 not with so much passion because then there was still this controversy among the scientists whether it was human induced whether it was
 real or it wasn 't but i think that that debate was
  made a categorical statement that it is real it 's human induced and it 's
 predicting some very very serious scenarios for
 countries like mine and so that 's when i got very serious in the past  i talked about it
 when the scenarios the predictions came in two thousand and seven it became a real issue for us ca now those predictions are i think that
 by two thousand one hundred sea levels are forecast to rise perhaps three feet there 's scenarios where it 's higher than that for sure  but what would you say to a skeptic who said what 's three feet you 're on average six feet above sea level what 's the problem
  's got to be understood that
 a marginal rise in sea level would mean a loss of a lot of land because much of the land is
 low and quite apart from that we are getting
 the swells at the moment  so it 's not about getting two feet  i think
 what many people do not understand is
 they think climate change is something that is happening in the future
 're at the very bottom end of the spectrum  it 's already with us we have communities who already have been dislocated
  they have had to move and every parliament session i 'm
 getting complaints from different communities asking for assistance to build seawalls 
 to see what we can do about the freshwater lens because it 's being destroyed  and so
 in my trips to the different
  islands  i 'm seeing evidence of communities which
 are now having to cope with the loss of food crops  the contamination of the water lenses and i see these
 communities perhaps leaving having to relocate within five to ten years ca and then
 i think the country suffered its
  i 'm sure many of you understand that
 when you 're on the equator  it 's supposed to be in the doldrums we 're not supposed to get the cyclones we create them and then we send them either north or south 
 but they aren 't supposed to come back  but for the first time at the beginning of this year the cyclone pam
  which destroyed vanuatu  and in the process the very edges of it actually touched
 our two southernmost islands and all of tuvalu tuvalu was underwater
 when hurricane pam struck  but
 for our two southernmost islands we had
 waves come over half the island  and so this has never happened before it 's a new experience 
  just come back from my own constituency  and i 've seen these beautiful trees which had been there for decades they 've been totally destroyed 
 so this is what 's happening but when we talk about the rising sea level
  we think it 's something that
 happens gradually  it comes with the winds it comes with the swells and so they can be magnified  but
  what we are beginning to witness is the
 the change in the weather pattern which is perhaps the more urgent challenge that we will face
 sooner than perhaps the rising sea level ca so the country is already seeing effects now as you look forward
 what are your options as a country as a nation at well 
 i 've been telling this story every year
  i think i visit a number of i 've been traveling the world to try and
 get people to understand we have a plan  we think we have a plan and on one occasion i think i spoke in geneva and
 there was a gentleman who was
 interviewing me on something like this  and i said we are looking at floating islands and he thought it was funny but somebody said no this is not funny  
 these
 people are looking for solutions and so
 i have been looking at floating islands
  the japanese
 are interested in building floating islands  but as a country  we have made a commitment that no matter what happens we will try as much as possible
 to stay
 and and continue to exist as a nation what that will take it 's going to be something quite significant
  either we live on floating islands  or we we have to build up the islands to continue to stay out of the water
 as the sea level rises and as the storms get more severe 
  but even that  it 's going to be very very difficult to get the kind of resourcing that we would need ca 
 and then the only recourse is some form of forced migration at well we are also looking at that because in the event
 that nothing comes forward from the international community we are preparing
  we don 't want to be caught like what 's happening in europe  ok we don 't want to mass migrate at some point in time  we want to be able to give the people the choice today  
 those who choose and want to do that to migrate we
 something to happen that
 that they are forced to migrate without having been prepared
  of course our culture is very different our society is very different and once we migrate into a different environment a different culture there 's a whole lot of adjustments that are required ca 
 well there 's forced migration in your country 's past and i think just this week just
 yesterday or the day before yesterday
  you visited these people what happened here  what 's the story here at yes and i 'm sorry i think somebody was asking why we were sneaking off to visit that place 
  good reason because
 we have a community of kiribati people living in that that part of the of the solomon islands  but these were people who were relocated from the phoenix islands in fact in the 
 there was serious drought and the people could not continue to live on the island  
 and so they were moved to to live here in the solomon islands  and so yesterday it was very interesting to meet with these people they didn 't know who i was
 heard of me some of them later recognized me but
 i think they were very happy  later they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me formally but
 i think what i saw yesterday was very interesting because here i see our people i spoke in our language and of course they
  beginning not to be able to speak kiribati properly 
 i saw them there was this lady with red teeth she was chewing betel nuts and it 's not something we we do in kiribati we don 't chew betel nuts 
 i met also a
 family who have married
 the local people here  and so this is what is happening
  as you go into another community  there are bound to be changes  there is bound to be
 a certain loss of identity  and this is what we will be looking for
 in the future if and when we do migrate ca it
 must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day
 because of these questions about identity the joy of seeing you and and perhaps an emphasized sense of
 what they had lost and it 's very inspiring to hear you say
  the end to try to preserve the nation in
 in a location at 
 this is our wish  nobody wants ever to leave their home
  and so it 's been a very difficult decision for me as a leader  you don 't
 make plans to to leave your island your home  and so i 've been asked on a number of occasions 
  doesn 't feel good at all  it 's an emotional thing  and i
 've tried to live with it  and i know that
 on occasions i 'm accused of
 not trying to solve the problem because i i can 't solve the problem  it 's something that 's got to be done collectively 
 climate change is a global phenomenon and
 as i 've often argued  unfortunately  the countries when we come to the united nations i was in
  with the pacific island forum countries
 where australia and new zealand are also members  and we had an argument  there was a bit of a story in the news
 because they were arguing that to cut
 emissions it would be something that they 're unable to do because
 it would affect the industries  and so here i was saying ok  i hear you i understand what
  saying but try also to understand what i 'm saying because
 if you do not cut your emissions then our survival is on the line  and so
 it 's a matter for you to weigh this these moral issues it 's about industry as opposed to the survival of
 a people ca you know i ask you yesterday what made you angry and you said i don 't
  i 'd refer you to my earlier statement at the united nations i was very angry very frustrated and then depressed  there was a
 sense of futility that we are fighting a fight that we have no hope of winning 
 i had to change my my approach i had to become more reasonable because
 i thought people would listen to somebody who was rational  but i remain radically
  rational  whatever that is ca 
 now 
 a core part of your nation 's identity is fishing  i think you said pretty much everyone is involved in fishing in some way at well we eat fish every day
 every day and i think
 there is no doubt that our rate of consumption of fish is perhaps the highest in the world  we don 't have a lot of livestock  so it 's fish that we depend on
  so you 're dependent on fish both at the local level and for the revenues that the country receives from the global fishing business
 for tuna and yet despite that a few years ago you took a very radical
 step can you tell us about that i think something happened right here in the phoenix islands at let me
 give some of the background of what fish means for us  we have one of the largest
  tuna fisheries remaining in the world  in the pacific i think we own something like sixty percent of
 the remaining tuna fisheries and
 it remains relatively healthy for some species but not all and kiribati is one of the three major
 resource owners  tuna resource owners  and
  at the moment we have been getting something like eighty eighty to ninety percent of our revenue from access fees  license fees ca of your national revenue at national revenue  which drives everything that we do
 in governments  hospitals schools and what have you but
 we decided to close this  and it was a very difficult decision i can assure you  politically locally it was not easy
  but i i was convinced that
 we had to do this in order to
 ensure that the fishery remains sustainable there had been some indications that some of the species in particular the
 the bigeye was under serious threat the yellowfin was also heavily fished skipjack remains healthy
  and so we had to do something like that and so that was the reason i did that  another reason why i did that was because
 i had been asking
 the international community that in order to deal with climate change in order to fight climate change
  there has got to be sacrifice  there has got to be commitment  so
 in asking
  i thought we ourselves need to make that sacrifice  and so we made the sacrifice  and forgoing
 commercial fishing in the phoenix islands protected area
 would mean a loss of revenue  we are still trying to assess what that loss would be because we actually closed it off
 at the beginning of this year  and so we will see by the end of this year
 what it means in terms of the lost revenue
 so there 's so many things playing into this on the one hand  it may prompt healthier fisheries 
  how much are you able to move the price up that you charge for the remaining areas
 the negotiations have been very difficult but we have managed to raise the cost of a vessel day for any vessel to come in
  fish for a day  we have raised the fee from it was $ six thousand and $ eight thousand  now to $
 ten thousand $ twelve thousand per vessel day  
 and so there 's been that significant increase but at the same time what 's important to to note is  
 whereas in the past
 these these fishing boats
 might be fishing in a day and maybe catch ten tons
 now they 're catching maybe one hundred tons because they 've become so efficient  and so we 've got to respond likewise we 've got to be very very careful because
 the the technology has so improved there was a time
 when the the brazilian fleet moved from the atlantic to the pacific they couldn 't they started experimenting if they could per se  
 but now they 've got ways of doing it and they 've become so efficient
 can you give us a sense of what it 's like in those negotiations because you 're up against companies that have
 hundreds of millions of dollars at stake  essentially 
 how do you hold the line  is there any advice you can give to other leaders who
 are dealing with the same companies about how to
  on licensing
 in order to get the rate of return because what we are getting from license fees is about ten percent of the landed value of the catch on the side of of the wharf 
 not in the retail shops  
  what we have been trying to do over the years is actually to increase our participation
 in the industry in the harvesting in the processing and eventually hopefully the marketing they 're not easy to to penetrate
  but we are working towards that and yes the answer would be to enhance in order to increase our rate of
  we have to become more involved  and so we 've started doing that and
 we have to restructure the industry we 've got to tell these people that the world has changed now we want to produce the fish ourselves ca 
 and meanwhile for your local fishermen  they
 are still able to fish  but what is business like for them is it getting harder are the waters depleted or is that being run on a sustainable basis
  fishery we do not participate in the commercial fishing activity except
 only to supply the domestic market  the tuna fishery is really entirely for the foreign market  mostly here in the us
  it 's very very rare to be able to catch yellowfin because they are being lifted out of the water by the hundreds of tons by these purse seiners ca so
 here 's a couple of beautiful
 girls from your country i mean as you think about their future what message would you have for them
  and what message would you have for the world at well i 've been telling the world that we really have to do something about what is happening to the climate
 because for us it 's about the future of these children i have twelve grandchildren at least  i think i have twelve my wife knows 
 and i think i have eight children  it 's about their future every day i see my grandchildren about the same age as these young
  and i get angry sometimes yes i do i wonder what is to become of them and so
 it 's about them
 that we should be telling everybody that it 's not about their own national interest because climate change 
 regrettably unfortunately is viewed by many countries as a national problem it 's not and this is the argument we got into recently with
  what about the rest why don 't you keep it if you could keep the rest of your emissions
 within your boundaries within your borders we 'd have no question you can go
  ahead as much as you like but unfortunately you 're sending it our way  and it 's affecting the future of our children  and so surely
 i think that is the heart of the problem of climate change today we will be meeting in paris at the end of this year  
 but until we can think of this as a global phenomenon  because we create it individually as nations but it affects everybody else  
 and yet we refuse to do
  and we deal with it
 as a national problem  which it is not it is a global issue  and it 's got to be
 dealt with collectively ca 
 people are incredibly bad at responding to graphs and numbers and we shut our minds to it  
 somehow 
 to people we 're slightly better at responding to that sometimes and it
 seems like it 's very possible that your nation despite actually because of the intense
 problems you face you may yet be the warning light to the world that shines most visibly most powerfully
  i just want to thank you i 'm sure on behalf of all of us for your extraordinary leadership and for being here
