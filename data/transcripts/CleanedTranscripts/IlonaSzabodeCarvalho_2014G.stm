  about twelve years ago  i gave up my career in banking
 to try to make the world a safer place this involved a journey into national and global advocacy
 and meeting some of the most extraordinary people in the world  in the process
  process  i became a civil society diplomat 
 civil society diplomats do three things  
 they voice the concerns of the people 
 are not pinned down by national interests  and influence change through citizen networks not only state ones  
 and if you want to
  we need more of them  
 but many people still ask can civil society really make a big difference 
 can citizens influence and shape national and global policy 
 i never thought i would ask myself these questions  but here i am
 to share some lessons about two powerful civil society movements that i 've been involved in they are in issues that i 'm passionate
  about gun control
 and drug policy  
 and these are issues that matter here  latin america is ground zero for both of them 
 for example brazil
 this beautiful country hosting tedglobal has the world
  we are the number one champion in homicidal violence 
 one in every ten people killed around the world is a brazilian 
 this translates into over 
  thousand people
 dying violently each year most of them are young black boys dying by guns 
 brazil is also
 one of the world 's largest consumers of drugs  and the war on drugs has been especially painful here  
 around fifty percent of the homicides in the streets in brazil
 are related to the war on drugs  the same is true for about twenty five percent of people in
  and it 's not just brazil that is affected by the twin problems of guns and drugs  virtually every country and city across central and south america is in trouble  
 latin america has nine percent of the world 's population but
  percent of its global violent deaths these are not problems we can run away from
  i certainly could not 
 so the first campaign i got involved with started here in two thousand and three to change brazil 's gun law and to create a program to buy back weapons  
 in just a few years we not only changed national legislation that made it much more difficult for civilians to buy a gun  
 but we collected and destroyed almost half a
  was one of the biggest buyback programs in history but we also
 we also suffered some setbacks  
 we lost a referendum to ban gun sales to civilians in two thousand and five  
 the second initiative was also home grown but is today a global movement to reform the international drug control regime 
 i am the executive coordinator of something called
  the global commission on drug policy  
 the commission is a high level group of global leaders brought together to identify more humane and effective approaches to the issue of drugs  
 since we started in two thousand and eight  the taboo on drugs is broken 
 across the americas from the us and mexico to colombia and uruguay change is in
 but rather than tell you the whole story about these two movements i just want to share with you four key insights  
 i call them lessons to change the world  
 there are certainly many more but these are the ones that stand out to me 
 so the first lesson is change and control the narrative  it may seem obvious  but a key
  ingredient to civil society diplomacy is first changing and then controlling the narrative 
 this is something that veteran politicians understand  but that civil society groups generally do not do very well 
 in the case of drug policy  our biggest success has been to change the discussion away from prosecuting a war on drugs to putting people 's health
  and safety first 
 in a cutting edge report we just launched in new york we also showed that the groups benefiting most from this $ three hundred and twenty billion
 market are criminal gangs and cartels  so in order to undermine the power and profit of these groups
  we need to change the conversation  we need to make illegal drugs
 legal  
 but before i get you too excited  
 i don 't mean drugs should be a free for all 
 what i 'm talking about and what the global commission advocates for is creating a highly regulated market  where different drugs would have different degrees of regulation 
  gun control we were successful in changing but not so much in controlling the narrative  and this brings me to my next lesson 
 never
 underestimate your opponents if you want to succeed in changing the world you need to know who you 're up against you need to learn their motivations and points of view  
 in the case of gun control  we really
  underestimated our opponents  
 after a very successful gun collection program  we were elated we had support from eighty percent of brazilians and thought that this could help us win the referendum to ban gun sales to civilians  
 but we were dead wrong  
 during a televised 20 day public debate  our opponent used our own arguments against us
  ended up losing the popular vote it was really terrible  the national rifle association
 yes the american nra came to brazil  
 they inundated our campaign with their propaganda that as you know links the right to own guns to ideas of freedom
  they simply threw everything at us  they used our national flag  our independence anthem  they invoked women 's rights and misused images of mandela tiananmen square  and even hitler  
 they won by playing with people 's fears  in fact guns were almost completely ignored in their campaign 
 their focus was on individual rights  but i ask you
  right is more important the right to life or the right to have a gun that takes life away we thought people would
 vote in defense of life  
 but in a country with a recent past of military dictatorship the
  message of our opponents resonated  and we were not prepared to respond 
 lesson learned we 've been more successful in the case of drug policy  
 if you asked most people ten years ago if an end to the war on drugs was possible  they would have laughed  after all  
 there are huge military police prisons and financial establishments
 benefiting from this war  
 but today the international drug control regime is starting to crumble  
 governments and civil societies are experimenting with new approaches the global commission on drug policy really knew its opposition  
 and rather than fighting them  our chair former brazilian president fernando henrique cardoso
 reached out to leaders from across the political spectrum from liberals to conservatives
  this high level group agreed to honestly discuss the merits and flaws of drug policies 
 it was this reasoned  informed and strategic discussion
 that revealed the sad truth about the war on drugs 
 the war on drugs has simply failed across every metric drugs are cheaper and more available than ever
  and consumption has risen globally  
 but even worse  it also generated massive negative unintended consequences  
 it is true that some people have made these arguments before  
 but we 've made a difference by anticipating the arguments of our opponents and by leveraging powerful voices that a few years ago would probably have
  resisted change 
 third lesson  use data to drive your argument 
 guns and drugs are emotive issues and as we 've painfully learned in the gun referendum campaign in brazil sometimes it 's impossible to cut through the emotions and get to the facts  
 but this doesn 't mean that we
  until quite recently  we simply didn 't know how many brazilians were killed by guns  amazingly  it was a local soap opera called
 women in love that kicked off brazil 's national gun control campaign 
 in one highly viewed episode a soap opera lead actress was killed by a stray bullet  
 brazilian grannies and housewives were outraged
  in a case of art imitating life this episode also included footage of a real gun control march that we had organized right here  outside in copacabana beach  
 the televised death and march had a huge impact on public opinion  
 within weeks our national congress approved the disarmament bill that had been languishing for years
  years  
 we were then able to mobilize data to show the successful outcomes of the change in the law and gun collection program 
 here is what i mean we could prove
 that in just one year  we saved more than five thousand lives
  drugs in order to undermine
 this fear and prejudice that surrounds the issue 
 we managed to gather and present data that shows that today 's drug policies cause much more harm than drug use per se  
 and people are starting to get it 
 my fourth insight is don 't be afraid to bring together odd bedfellows
 what we 've learned in brazil and this doesn 't only apply to my country is the importance of bringing diverse and eclectic folks together 
 if you want to change the world  it helps to have a good cross section of society on your side  
 in both the case of guns and drugs  we brought together a wonderful mix of people we mobilized the elite and got huge
  support from the media  we gathered the victims human rights champions cultural icons  
 we also assembled the professional classes doctors lawyers academia and more 
 what i 've learned over the last years is that you need coalitions of the willing
 and of the unwilling to make change
  and liberal politicians  they may not agree on everything  in fact  they disagree on almost everything 
 but the legitimacy of the campaign is based on their diverse points of view 
 over a decade ago  i had a comfortable future working for an investment bank  i was as far removed from
  the world of civil society diplomacy
 as you can imagine  
 but i took a  chance i changed course  
 and on the way  i helped to create social movements that i believe have made some parts of the world safer 
 each and every one of us has the power to change the world  no matter what the issue  and no matter
  how hard the fight civil society is central to the blueprint for change  thank you
