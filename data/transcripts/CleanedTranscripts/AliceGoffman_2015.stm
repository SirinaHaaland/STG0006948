  on the path that american children travel to adulthood two institutions oversee the journey  
 the first is the one we hear a lot about college  some of you may remember the excitement that you felt when you first set off for college  some of you
  may be in college right now and you 're feeling this excitement at this very moment 
 college has some shortcomings it 's expensive it leaves young people in debt  
 but all in all it 's a pretty good path young people emerge from college with pride and with great friends and with a lot of knowledge
  and perhaps most importantly  a better chance in the labor market than they had before they got there  
 today i want to talk about the second institution overseeing the journey from childhood to adulthood in the united states and that institution
 is prison 
 young people on this journey are meeting with probation officers instead
  to court dates instead of to class their junior year abroad is instead a trip to a state correctional facility  
 and they 're emerging from their 20s not with degrees in business and english  but with criminal records 
 this institution is also costing us a lot about forty thousand dollars a year to send a young person to prison in new jersey 
 but here taxpayers are footing the bill
  bill and what kids are getting is a cold prison cell and a permanent mark against them when they come home and apply for work 
 there are more and more kids on this journey to adulthood than ever before in the united states and that 's because in the past forty years our incarceration rate
  by seven hundred percent i have one slide for this talk here it is 
 here 's our incarceration rate about seven hundred and sixteen people per one hundred thousand in the population 
 here 's the oecd countries 
 what 's more it 's poor kids that we 're sending to prison too many drawn from
 african american and latino communities
 so that prison now stands firmly between the young people trying to make it
 and the fulfillment of the american dream  
 the problem 's actually a bit worse than this ' cause we 're not just sending poor kids to prison 
 we 're saddling poor kids with court fees with probation and parole
  're asking them to live in halfway houses and on house arrest 
 and we 're asking them to negotiate a police force that is entering poor communities of color not for the purposes of promoting public safety  but to make arrest counts 
 to line city coffers 
 this is the hidden underside to our historic experiment in punishment  young people worried that at any moment
  will be stopped searched and seized  not just in the streets but in their homes at school and at work  
 i got interested in this other path to adulthood when i was myself a college student attending the university of pennsylvania in the early 2000s 
  you 've got these two parallel journeys going on simultaneously the kids attending this elite  private university 
 and the kids from the adjacent neighborhood  some of whom are making it to college and many of whom are being shipped to prison 
 in my sophomore year i started tutoring a young woman
 who was in high school who lived about ten minutes away from the university  soon her cousin came home from a juvenile detention
  center he was fifteen  a freshman in high school i began to get to know him and his friends and family 
 and i asked him what he thought about me writing about his life for my senior thesis in college this senior thesis became a dissertation at princeton and now a book 
 by the end of my sophomore
  i moved into the neighborhood and i spent the next six years
 trying to understand what young people were facing
 as they came of age  
 the first week i spent in this neighborhood i saw two boys five and seven years old play this game of chase where the older boy ran after the other boy
  he played the cop when the cop caught up to the younger boy he pushed him down handcuffed him with imaginary handcuffs  took a quarter out of the other child 's
  seizing that he asked the child if he was carrying any drugs or if he had a warrant 
 many times i saw this game repeated  sometimes children would simply give up running and stick their bodies flat against the ground with their hands above their heads or flat up against a wall 
 children would yell at each other i 'm going to
  i 'm going to lock you up and you 're never coming home 
 once i saw a six year old child pull another child 's pants down and try to do a cavity search 
 in the first eighteen months that i lived in this neighborhood
 i wrote down every time i saw any contact between police and people that were my neighbors  
 so in the first eighteen months i watched the police stop pedestrians or people in cars  search people run people 's names
  people through the streets pull people in for questioning or make an arrest every single day  with five exceptions
 fifty two times i watched the police break down doors  chase people through houses or make an arrest of someone in their home  
 fourteen times in this first year and a half  i watched the police punch
  young men after they had caught them 
 bit by bit i got to know two brothers  chuck and tim chuck was eighteen when we met a senior in high school
 he was playing on the basketball team and making c 's and b 's 
 his younger brother tim was ten and tim loved chuck he followed him around a lot looked to chuck to be a mentor  they lived with their mom and grandfather in a
  row home with a front lawn and a back porch their mom was struggling with addiction all while the boys were growing up she never really was able to hold down a job for very long it was 
  their grandfather 's pension that supported the family not really enough to pay for food and clothes and school supplies for growing boys  the family was really struggling 
 that winter  a kid in the schoolyard called chuck 's mom a crack whore 
 chuck pushed the kid 's face into the snow
 and the school cops charged him with aggravated assault the other kid was fine the next day i think it was his pride that was injured more than anything  but
  since chuck was eighteen this agg assault case sent him to adult county jail on state road in northeast philadelphia where he sat unable to pay the bail he couldn 't afford it
 while the trial dates dragged on and on and on through almost his entire senior year 
 finally  near the end of this season  the judge on this assault case threw out most of the charges and chuck came home
 with only a few hundred dollars ' worth of court fees hanging over his head
  tim was pretty happy that day  the next fall chuck tried to re enroll as a senior  but the school secretary told him that he was then nineteen and too old to be readmitted 
 then the judge on his assault case issued him a warrant for his arrest because he couldn 't pay the two hundred and twenty five dollars in court fees that came due a few weeks after the case ended
  then he was a high school dropout living on the run 
 tim 's first arrest came later that year after he turned eleven  
 chuck had managed to get his warrant lifted and he was on a payment plan for the court fees and he was driving tim to school in his girlfriend 's car 
 so a cop pulls them over  runs the car and the car comes up as stolen in california  
 chuck had no idea where
  in the history of this car it had been stolen his girlfriend 's uncle bought it from a used car auction in northeast philly chuck and tim had never been outside of the tri state 
  let alone to california  but anyway the cops down at the precinct charged chuck with receiving stolen property and then a juvenile judge a few days later
 with this probation sentence hanging over his head  chuck sat his little little brother down and began teaching him how to run from the police they 
  would sit side by side on their back porch looking out into the shared alleyway and chuck would coach tim how to spot undercover cars  how to negotiate a late night police
  how and where to hide 
 i want you to imagine for a second what chuck and tim 's lives would be like if they were living in a neighborhood where kids were going to college  not prison 
 a neighborhood like the one i got to grow up in 
 okay you might say  but chuck and tim kids like them they 're committing crimes  don 't they deserve to be in prison  don 't they deserve to be living in fear of arrest
 my answer would be no they don 't and certainly not for the same things that other young people with more privilege are doing with impunity 
 if chuck had gone to my high school that schoolyard fight would have ended there as a schoolyard fight 
 it never would have become an aggravated assault case 
 not a single kid that i went to college with has a criminal record right now not a single
  one 
 but can you imagine how many might have if the police had stopped those kids and searched their pockets for drugs as they walked to class  or had raided their frat parties in the middle of the night  
 okay you might say  
 but doesn 't this high incarceration rate partly account for our really low crime rate crime is down that 's a good thing totally that is a good thing crime is down
 it dropped precipitously in the ' 90s and through the 2000s but according to a committee of academics convened by the national academy of sciences last year  the relationship 
  between our historically high incarceration rates and our low crime rate is pretty shaky 
 we tend to think about justice in a pretty narrow way good and bad innocent and guilty 
 injustice is about being wrongfully convicted so if you 're convicted of something you did do you should be punished for it 
 there are innocent and guilty people there are victims and there are perpetrators  
 maybe we could think a little bit more broadly than that 
 right now
  asking kids who live in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods who have the least amount of family resources who are attending the country 's worst schools who are facing the toughest time in the labor market who are living in neighborhoods where violence is an everyday problem 
 we 're asking these kids to walk the thinnest possible line
 to basically
  why are we not providing support to young kids facing these challenges  
 why are we offering only handcuffs  jail time and this fugitive existence 
 can we imagine something better 
 can we imagine a criminal justice system that prioritizes recovery  prevention civic inclusion  rather than
  a criminal justice system that acknowledges the legacy of exclusion that poor people of color in the u s have faced and that does not promote and perpetuate those exclusions 
 and finally  a criminal justice system that believes in black young people
  rather than treating black young people as the enemy to be rounded up 
 the good news is that we already are 
 a few years ago  michelle alexander wrote the new jim crow 
 which got americans
  to see incarceration as a civil rights issue of historic proportions in a way they had not seen it before 
 president obama and attorney general eric holder have come out very strongly on sentencing reform on the need to address racial disparity in incarceration we
 're seeing states throw out stop and frisk as the civil rights violation that it is we 're seeing cities and states decriminalize
 possession of marijuana 
 new york new jersey and california have been dropping their prison populations closing prisons while also seeing a big drop in crime texas has gotten into the game now also closing prisons investing in education 
 this curious coalition is building from the right and the left made up of former prisoners and fiscal conservatives of civil rights activists and
  of young people taking to the streets to protest police violence against unarmed black teenagers  
 and older wealthier people some of you are here in the audience pumping big money into 
 initiatives
 in a deeply divided congress the work of reforming our criminal justice system is just about the only thing that the right and the left are coming together on 
 i did not think i would see this political moment in my
  lifetime  i think many of the people who have been working tirelessly
 to write about the causes and consequences of our historically high incarceration rates
 did not think we would see this moment in our lifetime  
 the question for us now is how much can we make of it how much can we change  
 i want to end with a call to young people the young people attending college and the young people
  struggling to stay out of prison or to make it through prison and return home 
 it may seem like these paths to adulthood are worlds apart  
 but the young people participating in these two institutions conveying us to adulthood they have one thing in common  
 both can be leaders in the work of reforming our criminal justice system 
 young people have always been leaders
  in the fight for equal rights the fight for more people to be granted dignity and a fighting chance at freedom  
 the mission for the generation of young people coming of age in this a sea change moment  potentially 
 is to end mass incarceration
 and build a new criminal justice system  emphasis on the word justice thanks
