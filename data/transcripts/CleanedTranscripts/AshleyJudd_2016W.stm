 online misogyny
 is a global gender rights tragedy  and it is imperative that it ends
  are constrained in ways that are personally economically professionally and politically damaging  and when we curb abuse  
 we will expand freedom  
 i am a kentucky
 basketball fan so on a fine march day last year i was doing one of the things i do best i was cheering for my wildcats the daffodils were blooming but the referees were not blowing the whistle when i was telling them to 
 funny they 're very friendly to me before the opening tip but they really ignore me during the game 
 three of my players were bleeding  so i did the next best thing  i tweeted
  routine for me to be treated in the ways i 've already described to you it happens to me every single day on social media platforms such as twitter and facebook 
 since i joined twitter in two thousand and eleven misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step my spirituality 
 my faith being a hillbilly i can say that you can 't all of it is fair game
  i have responded to this with various strategies  i 've tried engaging people this one guy was sending me
 nasty stuff and there was a girl in his avatar i wrote him back and said 
 is that your daughter  i feel a lot of fear that you may think about and talk to women this way and he surprised me by saying you know what
  sometimes people want to be held accountable 
 this one guy was musing to i don 't know who that maybe i was the definition of a cunt  
 i was married to a scot for fourteen years so i said cunt means many different things in different countries 
 but i 'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick
  to rise above it i 've tried to get in the trenches but mostly i would scroll through these social media platforms with one eye partially closed 
 trying not to see it but you can 't make a cucumber out of a pickle 
 what is seen goes in it 's traumatic  and i was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn
  who worships at the altar of gloria 
 internalize the patriarchy 
 this is really critical patriarchy is not boys and men it is a system in which we all participate 
  including me 
 on that particular day for some reason that particular tweet after the basketball game triggered something called a cyber mob this vitriolic 
 global outpouring of the most heinous hate speech death threats  rape threats and don 't you know when i was sitting at home alone in my nightgown i got a phone call and it was my beloved former husband and he said on a voice mail
  happening to you is not ok and there was something about him taking a stand for me that night 
 that allowed me to take a stand for myself and i started to write i started to write about
 sharing the fact that i 'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse including three rapes and the hate speech i get in response to that these are just some of the
  comments posted to news outlets  being told
  my righteous ass 
 and i did that alone and i published it alone because my chief advisor said please don 't 
 the rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable i fear for you 
 but i trust girls and i trust women and i trust our allies it was published
  it went viral it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all all over the world and when it is intersectional it is worse 
  sexual orientation gender identity race ethnicity religion you name it it amplifies the violence endured by girls and women and for our younger girls it is worse  
 it 's clearly traumatizing our
  are so gravely affected because the threat of violence is experienced neurobiologically
 as violence the cortisol shoots up the limbic system gets fired we lose productivity at work  
 and let 's talk about work our ability to work is constrained 
 online searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them false allegations they have stds
 addresses indicating that they are available
 for sex
 with real examples of people showing up at this house for said sex our ability to go to school
 is impaired ninety six percent of all postings of sexual images
  our young people girls  our girls  our boys are two to three times more likely 
 to share images  and i want to say a word about revenge porn part of what came out of this tweet
 was my getting connected with allies and other activists who are fighting for a safe and free internet
  we started something called the speech project curbing abuse  expanding freedom and that website provides a critical forum 
 because there is no global legal
 thing
 to help us figure this out but we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions because it 's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we 're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior
  and i learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied  it is the nonconsensual sharing of an image
 used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us 
 our natural sexuality
 is i don 't know about yours pretty gorgeous and wonderful and my expressing
  i have all these resources that i 'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not 
 i was able to start the speech project with colleagues 
 i can often get a social media company 's attention i have a wonderful visit to facebook hq coming up  
 hasn 't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet
  i actually pay someone
 to scrub my social media feeds  
 attempting to spare my brain the daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech  and guess what i get hate speech for that oh you live in an 
  echo chamber well guess what  having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they can 't wait to cum on my face i have a right to set that boundary
 distinction between virtual and real is specious because 
 guess what that actually happened to me once when i was a child and so that tweet brought up that trauma  and i had to do work on that but you know what we do we take all of this
  and we disaggregate it  and we code it  and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it
 when i get porn when it 's about political affiliation when it 's about age when it 's about all of it  we 're going to win this fight 
 there are a lot of solutions thank goodness i 'm going to
  offer just a few and of course i challenge you to create and contribute your own 
 number one we have to start with digital media literacy and clearly it must have
 a gendered lens  kids schools caregivers parents it 's essential two 
 shall we talk about our friends in tech said with dignity and
  standard for gender equality is the minimum standard and guess what silicon valley if l 'oral in india in the philippines in brazil and in russia can do it 
  only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies including building platforms from the ground up will the conversations about priorities and solutions
  change and more love for my friends in tech profiteering off misogyny in video games must end 
 # gamergate was when you 're still making billions of dollars off games that maim and dump women for sport basta as the italians would say enough 
 our friends in law enforcement have much to do because we 've seen that online violence is an extension of
 in our country more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners
 than died on nine eleven and have died since in afghanistan and iraq combined and it 's not cool to say that but it is true  
 we care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there 
  fifteen
 eight hundred and twenty eight women used intimate partner violence services in this country that is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them 
 law enforcement must be empowered
 with up to date internet technology the devices and an understanding of these platforms how they work  the police wanted to be helpful when
  amanda hess called about the death threat she was getting on twitter  but they couldn 't really when they said what 's twitter 
 our legislators must write and pass astute legislation that reflects today 's technology and our notions of free and hate speech 
 in new york
  law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed even if it was anonymous they must have been committed by telephone 
 in mail by telegraph 
 laughter the language must be technologically neutral 
 so apparently  i 've got a pretty
  let 's talk about our friends white men 
 you have a role to play and a choice to make you can do something or you can do nothing 
 we 're cool in this room but when this goes out everyone will say oh my god she 's a reverse racist that quote was said by a white man
  he asked me to include it in my talk 
 we need to grow support lines and help groups  so victims can help each other
 when their lives and finances have been derailed  we must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening
 ninety two percent of young people twenty nine and under witness it
  percent of us have witnessed it  we must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding 
 and lastly  
 believe her  
 believe her this is
 fundamentally a problem of human interaction  and as i believe that human
  interaction is at the core of our healing trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred 
 edith wharton said the end is latent in the beginning so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech because i get lonely in this  but i know that we are allies  
 i recently learned
 about how gratitude and affirmations
 offset negative interactions it takes five of those to offset one negative interaction and gratitude in particular free available globally any time anywhere to anyone in any dialect
 it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate a watershed part of the brain that floods it
 with great good stuff  so i 'm going to say awesome stuff about myself i would like for you to reflect it back to me it might
  sound something like this i am a powerful and strong woman and you would say
  love you thank you so much for letting me
