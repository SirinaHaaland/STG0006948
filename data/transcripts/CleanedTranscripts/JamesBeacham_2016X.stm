  there is something
 about physics that has been
 really bothering me since i was a little kid  
 and it 's related to a question that scientists have been asking for almost one hundred years with no answer
  how do the smallest things in nature the particles of the quantum world match up with the largest things in nature planets and stars and galaxies held together by gravity 
 as a kid i would puzzle over questions just like this i would fiddle around with microscopes and electromagnets and i would read about the forces of the small and about quantum mechanics and i would marvel at how well that description
  matched up to our observation 
 then i would look at the stars and i would read about how well we understand gravity and i would think surely there must be some elegant way that these two systems match up 
 but there 's not 
 and the books would say yeah we understand a lot about these two realms separately  but when we try to link them mathematically  everything breaks
 and for one hundred years none of our ideas as to how to solve this basically physics disaster has ever been supported by evidence  
 and to little old me little curious skeptical james this was a supremely unsatisfying answer
  so i 'm still a skeptical little
  when i found myself smack in the middle of the physics world being flipped on its head 
 it all started when we at cern saw something intriguing in our data a hint
 of a new particle an inkling of a possibly extraordinary answer to this question 
 so i 'm still a skeptical little kid i think but i 'm also now a particle hunter  i am a physicist at cern 's large
  hadron collider the largest science experiment ever mounted it
 's a 27 kilometer tunnel on the border of france and switzerland buried one hundred meters underground  and in this tunnel we use superconducting magnets colder than outer space
 to accelerate protons to almost the speed of light and slam them into each other millions of times per second  collecting the debris of these
  collisions
 to search for new undiscovered fundamental particles 
 its design and construction took decades of work by thousands of physicists from around the globe  and in the summer
 of two thousand and fifteen we had been working tirelessly to switch on the lhc at the highest energy that humans have ever
  used in a collider experiment 
 now  
 higher energy is important because for particles there is an equivalence between energy and particle mass and mass is just a number put there by nature 
 to discover new particles we need to reach these bigger numbers  
 and to do that we have to build a bigger higher energy collider and the biggest highest energy collider in the world is the large hadron collider  
  and we collect this data
 very slowly over months and months 
 and then new particles might show up in our data as bumps slight deviations from what you expect little clusters of data points that make a smooth line not so smooth 
 for example this bump 
  led to the discovery of the higgs particle the higgs boson and to a nobel prize for the for the confirmation of its existence
 this jump up in energy
 in two thousand and fifteen
 represented the best chance that we as a species had ever had of discovering new particles new answers to these long standing questions because it was almost twice as much energy as we used when we discovered the higgs boson 
 many of my colleagues had been working their entire
 careers for this moment and frankly to little curious me this was the moment i 'd been waiting for my entire life  so two thousand and fifteen was go time  
 so june
  and fifteen the lhc is switched back on 
 my colleagues and i held our breath and bit our fingernails  and then finally we saw the first proton collisions at this highest energy ever applause champagne
  celebration this was a milestone
 for science and we had no idea what we would find in this brand new data  
 and then a few weeks later we found a bump 
 it wasn 't a very big bump  
 but it was big enough to make you raise your eyebrow but on a scale of one to ten for eyebrow raises if ten indicates that you 've discovered a new
  particle this eyebrow raise is about a four 
 laughter i spent
 hours  
 days  weeks in secret meetings  arguing with my colleagues over this little bump  poking and prodding it with our most ruthless experimental sticks to see if it would withstand scrutiny
  but even after months of working feverishly sleeping in our offices and not going home
  candy bars for dinner  coffee by the bucketful physicists are machines for turning coffee into diagrams
  this little bump would not go away  so
 after a few months we presented our little bump to the world with a very clear message this little bump
  interesting but it 's not definitive so let 's keep an eye on it as we take more data so we were trying to be extremely cool about it 
 and the world ran with it anyway  
 the news loved it
 people said it reminded them of the little bump that was shown on the way toward the higgs boson discovery better than that my theorist colleagues
 i love my theorist colleagues my theorist colleagues wrote five hundred papers about this little
  bump the world of particle physics had been flipped on its head  but
 what was it about this particular bump that caused thousands of physicists to collectively lose their cool 
 this little bump was unique this little bump indicated that we were seeing an unexpectedly large number of collisions whose debris
  debris consisted of only two photons two particles of light and that 's rare 
 particle collisions are not like automobile collisions they have different rules 
 when two particles collide at almost the speed of light the quantum world takes over and in the quantum world these two particles can briefly create a new particle
 that lives for a tiny fraction of a second before splitting into other particles that hit our detector imagine a car
  collision where the two cars vanish upon impact a bicycle appears in their place 
 laughter and then that bicycle explodes into two skateboards which hit our detector 
 hopefully not literally
  they 're very expensive  events where only two photons hit out detector are very rare  and because of the special quantum properties of photons
  small number of possible new particles these mythical bicycles that can give birth to only two photons  
 but one of these options is huge  and it has to do with that 
  question that bothered me as a tiny little kid about gravity  gravity may seem
  super strong to you  but it 's actually crazily weak compared to the other forces of nature  i can briefly beat gravity when i jump
  but i can 't pick a proton out of my hand 
 the strength of gravity compared to the other forces of nature it
 's ten to the minus thirty nine that 's a decimal with thirty nine zeros after it worse than that all of the other known forces of nature are perfectly described by this thing we call the standard model  which is our current best description
 of nature at its smallest scales  and quite frankly 
 one of the most successful achievements of humankind
 except for gravity  which is absent from the standard model it 's crazy
 it 's almost as though most of gravity has gone missing 
 we feel a little bit of it but where 's the rest of
  no one knows  but one theoretical explanation proposes a wild solution you and i
 even you in the back we we live in three dimensions of space i hope that 's 
  statement all of the known particles also live in three dimensions of space in fact a particle is just another name for
  a localized wobbling in space 
 more importantly  all the math that we use to describe all this stuff assumes that there are only three dimensions of space but math is math and we can play around with our math however 
  we want  and people have been playing around with extra dimensions of space for a very long time but it 's always been an abstract mathematical concept  
 what if the missing gravity is leaking
 into an extra spatial dimension that 's invisible to you and i 
 what if gravity is just as strong as the other forces if you were to view it in this extra spatial dimension and what you and i experience is a tiny slice of gravity make it seem very weak 
 if this were true
  would have to expand our standard model of particles to include an extra particle a hyperdimensional particle of gravity a special graviton that lives in extra spatial dimensions 
 i see the looks on your faces you should be asking me the question how in the world are we going to test this crazy science fiction idea  stuck as we are in three dimensions the way we always do by slamming together two protons
 that the collision reverberates into any extra spatial dimensions that might be there momentarily creating this hyperdimensional graviton that then snaps back into the three dimensions of the lhc
 and spits off two photons two particles of light 
 and this hypothetical extra dimensional graviton
  is one of the only possible hypothetical new particles that has the special quantum properties that could give birth to our little two photon
 bump  
 so the possibility of
 explaining the mysteries of gravity and of discovering extra dimensions of space
 perhaps now you get a sense as to why thousands of physics geeks collectively lost their cool over our little two photon bump a discovery of this type would
  rewrite the textbooks  but remember  the message from us experimentalists that actually were doing this work at the time was very clear we need more data 
 with more data  the little bump will either turn into a nice  crisp nobel prize 
 or the extra data will fill in the space around the bump and turn it into a nice smooth line  so we took more data
  with five times the data several months later our little bump turned into a smooth line
 the news reported on a huge disappointment on faded hopes and on particle physicists being sad given the tone of the coverage you 'd think that we had decided to shut down the lhc and go home 
 but that 's not what we did
 but why not i mean if i didn 't discover a particle and i didn 't
 if i didn 't discover a particle why am i here talking to you why didn 't i just hang my head in shame
 and go home
  and very much of what we do is cartography let me put it this way forget about the lhc for a second imagine you are a space explorer
 arriving at a distant planet searching for aliens what is your first task 
 to immediately orbit the planet land take a quick look around for any big obvious signs of life  and report back to home base 
 that 's the stage we 're at now 
 we took a first
  look at the lhc for any new big obvious to spot particles  and we can report that there are none 
 we saw a weird looking alien bump on a distant mountain but once we got closer we saw it was a rock 
 but then what do we do do we just give up and fly away absolutely not we would be terrible scientists if we did no we spend the next couple of decades
  mapping out the territory  sifting through the sand with a fine instrument peeking under every stone drilling under the surface new particles can either show up immediately as 
  big  obvious to spot bumps or they can only reveal themselves after years of data taking 
 we build a bigger machine 
 we search at higher energies  we search at higher energies  planning is already underway for a 
  tunnel that will collide particles at ten times the energy of the lhc  we don 't decide where nature places new particles we only decide to keep exploring  
  collider floating in space between the earth and the moon  we still find no new particles
  then perhaps we 're doing particle physics wrong 
 perhaps we need to rethink things maybe we need more
 resources technology expertise than what we
  we already use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques in parts of the lhc  but imagine designing a particle physics experiment using such sophisticated algorithms that it could teach itself to discover 
 but what if what if the ultimate question what if even artificial intelligence can 't help us answer our questions what if these open questions for centuries are destined to be unanswered
 for the foreseeable future what if the stuff that 's bothered me since i was a little kid is destined to be unanswered in my lifetime
 then that will be even more fascinating  
 we will be forced to think in completely new ways we
 'll have to go back to our assumptions and determine if there was a flaw somewhere and we 'll need to encourage more people to join us in studying science since we need
  i don 't have the answers and i 'm still searching for them but someone maybe she 's in school right now  maybe she 's not even born yet
 could eventually guide us to see physics in a completely new way and to point out that perhaps we 're just asking the wrong questions  
 which would not be the end of physics but a novel beginning
