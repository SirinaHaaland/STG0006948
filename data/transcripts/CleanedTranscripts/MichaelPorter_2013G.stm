  all aware that the world today is full of problems we 've been hearing them
 today and yesterday and and every day for decades  serious problems 
  pressing problems poor nutrition  access to water  climate change deforestation 
 lack of skills insecurity  not enough food not enough healthcare pollution there
 's problem after problem and i think what really separates this time from any time i can remember in in my brief time
 on earth is the awareness of these problems we 're all very aware why are we having so much
  trouble dealing with these problems that 's the question i 've been struggling with coming from my very different
 perspective  i 'm not a social problem guy  
 i 'm a guy that works with business  helps business make money  god forbid  
 so why are we having so
  with these social problems  and really is there any role for business and if so what is that role 
 i think that in order to address that question we have to step back and think about
 how we 've understood and pondered both the problems and the solutions to these great social challenges that we face
  now i think many have seen business
 as the problem or at least one of the problems in many of the social challenges we face you know
 think of the fast food industry the drug industry the banking industry you know this is a low point
 in the respect for business 
 business is not seen as the solution it 's seen as the problem now for most people  and rightly so in many cases there 's a
  lot of bad actors out there
 that have done the wrong thing that actually have made the problem worse so this perspective is perhaps justified 
 how have we tended to see the solutions to these social problems  
 these many issues that we face in society  
 well we 've tended to see the solutions in terms of ngos in terms of government in terms of philanthropy
 indeed the kind of unique organizational entity of this age is this tremendous rise
 of ngos and
 social organizations this is a unique new organizational form that we 've seen grown up enormous innovation  enormous energy  
 enormous talent now has been mobilized through this structure
 to try to deal with all of these
 challenges  and many of us here are deeply involved in that
  i 'm a business school professor but i 've actually founded
 i think now four nonprofits  whenever i got interested and became aware of a societal problem  that was what i did  
 form a nonprofit 
  that was the way we 've thought about how to deal with these issues even a business school professor
 has thought about it that way 
 but i think at this moment we 've been at this for quite a while we 've been aware of these problems for decades  we have decades of experience
  with our ngos and with our government entities and there 's an awkward reality the awkward reality is we 're not making fast enough progress  we 're not winning
 problems still seem very daunting and very intractable and any solutions we 're achieving are small solutions 
 we 're making incremental progress 
 what 's the fundamental problem we have in dealing with these social problems  if we cut all the
 complexity away we have the problem
  scale  we can 't scale  
 we can make progress we can show benefits we can show results we can make things better
  we 're helping  we 're doing better  we 're doing good  we can 't scale  
 we can 't make a large scale impact
  why is that because we don 't have the resources 
 and that 's really clear now  and that 's clearer now than it 's been for decades  there 's simply not enough money
 to deal with any of these problems at scale
 using the current model  there 's not enough tax revenue  there 's not
  enough philanthropic donations 
 to deal with these problems the way we 're dealing with them now we 've got to
 confront that reality  and the scarcity of resources
 for dealing with these problems is is only growing  certainly in the advanced world
 today with all the fiscal problems we face
  if it 's fundamentally a resource problem
  where are the resources in society  
 how are those resources really created the resources we 're going to need to deal with all these societal challenges  
 well there i think the answer is very clear they 're in business
 all wealth is actually created by business
  business creates wealth
 when it meets needs
 at a profit that 's how all wealth is created  it 's meeting needs at a profit
 that leads to taxes and that leads to incomes and that leads to charitable donations  that 's where all the resources come
  only business can actually create resources other institutions can utilize them to do important work  but only business can create them 
 and business creates them when it 's able to meet a need
 at a profit 
 the resources are overwhelmingly generated by business
  the question then is how do we
 tap into this how do we tap into this 
 business generates those resources when it makes a profit 
 that profit is that small difference between
 the price and the cost it takes to produce whatever solution business has created to whatever problem they 're trying to solve  but that
  profit
 is the magic  why because that profit
 allows whatever solution we 've created
 to be infinitely scalable 
 because if we can make a profit  we can do it for ten  one hundred a million  one hundred million
 a billion  the solution becomes  self sustaining 
 that 's what business does when it makes a profit 
 now what does this all have to do with social problems  well one line of thinking is
  let 's take this profit and redeploy it
 into social problems  
 business should give more business should be more responsible  and that 's been the path that we 've been on in business  
 but again this path that we 've been on is not getting us where we need to go 
 now  i started out as a strategy professor and i 'm still a strategy
  i 'm proud of that but i 've also  over the years worked more and more on social issues i 've worked on healthcare  the environment  
 economic development reducing poverty  and as i worked more and more in the social field  
 i started seeing something that had a profound impact on me
 and my whole life
  and the view in business has historically been that actually there 's a tradeoff between
 social performance and economic performance the conventional wisdom has been that business actually makes a profit
 by causing a social problem the classic example is pollution
  it makes more money than if it tried to reduce that pollution  reducing pollution is expensive therefore
 businesses don 't want to do it 
 it 's profitable to have an unsafe working environment it 's too expensive to have a safe working environment  therefore business makes more money if they don 't have a safe working environment that 's been the conventional wisdom 
 a lot of companies have fallen into
  that conventional wisdom they resisted environmental improvement they resisted workplace improvement
  that thinking
 has led to i think much of the behavior that we have come to criticize in business that i come to criticize in business  
 but the more deeply i got into all these social issues  one after another
  and actually the more i tried to address them myself personally in a few cases through nonprofits that i was involved with 
 the more i found actually that the reality is the opposite 
 business does not profit from causing social problems actually not in any fundamental sense 
 that 's a very simplistic view  the deeper we get into these issues
  the more we start to understand that actually business profits from solving from social problems that 's where the real profit comes let
 's take pollution  
 we 've learned today that actually reducing pollution and emissions is generating profit it saves
  business more productive and efficient it doesn 't waste resources 
 having a safer working environment actually and avoiding accidents 
 it makes the business more profitable because it it 's a sign of good processes  accidents are expensive
 and costly issue by issue by issue we start to learn that actually there 's no trade off between
 social progress and economic efficiency
 in any
  sense another issue is health i mean  what we 've found is actually health of employees is something that business should treasure because
 that health allows those employees to be more productive and come to work and not be absent  the deeper work the new work the new thinking
 on the interface between
  social problems is actually showing that there 's a fundamental deep
 synergy  particularly if you 're not thinking in the very short run in the very short run you can sometimes fool yourself into thinking
 that there 's fundamentally opposing goals but in the long run ultimately we 're learning
 in field after field that this is simply not true so how could we tap into the power of business
  to address the fundamental problems that we face  
 imagine if we could do that because if we could do it we could scale  
 we could tap into this enormous resource pool and this organizational capacity
  and guess what that 's happening now finally  
 partly because of
 people like you
 who have
  raised these issues now for year after year and decade after decade 
 we see organizations like dow chemical leading the revolution away from trans fat and saturated fat with innovative new products 
 this is an example of jain irrigation this is a company that 's brought drip irrigation technology to thousands and millions of farmers  reducing substantially the use of water  
 we see companies like the brazilian forestry company
  fibria that 's figured out how to avoid tearing down old growth forest and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield per hectare
 of pulp and making much more paper than you could make by cutting down those old trees  you see companies like cisco that are training so far four million people in i t skills
  be responsible but help expand the opportunity to disseminate i t technology and grow the whole business  there 's a fundamental opportunity
 for business today
 to impact and address these social problems  and this opportunity is the largest business opportunity
 we see in business 
 and the question is how can we get business thinking to adapt this issue of shared value
 this is what i call shared value addressing a social issue with a business model  
 that 's shared value 
 shared value is capitalism  but it 's a higher kind of capitalism it 's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be meeting important needs 
 not incrementally competing for
 trivial differences in
  and market share shared value is when we can create social value and economic value simultaneously  it 's finding those opportunities
 that will unleash the greatest possibility we have to actually address these social problems because we can scale  
 we can address shared value at multiple levels  
 it 's real it 's happening 
 but in order to get this solution
  working we have to now change how business sees itself 
 and this is thankfully underway 
 businesses got trapped into the conventional wisdom that they shouldn 't worry about social problems that this was sort of something on the side that somebody else was doing it  
 we 're now seeing companies embrace this
  but we also have to recognize business is not going to do this as effectively as if we have ngos and government working in partnership with
 business  the new ngos that are really moving the needle are the ones that have found these partnerships that have found these ways to collaborate the governments that are making the most progress
 are the governments that have found ways to enable shared value in business
 rather than see government as the only player that has to
  call the shots and government has many ways in which it could impact
 the willingness and the ability of companies to compete in this way  
 i think if we can get business seeing itself differently  and if we can get others seeing business differently  we can change the world 
 i know it  i 'm seeing it i 'm
  i 'm feeling it 
 young people i think my harvard business school students are getting it if we can break down this sort of
 divide this unease this tension this sense that we 're not
 fundamentally collaborating here in driving these social problems we can break this down and we finally i think can have
 solutions thank you
