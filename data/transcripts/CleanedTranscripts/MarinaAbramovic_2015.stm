  there is the gallery somewhere
 in the world 
 and there is a young girl  age twenty three standing in the middle of the space 
 in the front of her is a table on the table there
  pleasure and for pain 
 some of the objects are a glass of water a coat a shoe 
 a rose  but also the knife the razor blade  the hammer
 and the pistol with
  i 'm an object you can use everything on the table on me i 'm taking all responsibility
 even killing me and the time is six hours 
 the beginning of this performance was easy 
  the scissors and cut my clothes  and then they took the thorns of the rose and stuck them in my stomach 
 somebody took the razor blade and cut my neck and drank the blood 
 and i still have the scar 
 the women would tell the men what to do and the men didn 't rape me because
 it was just a normal opening and it was all public  and they were with their wives 
 they carried me around and put me on the table and put the knife between my legs  and somebody took the pistol and bullet and put it against my temple 
 and another person
  started walking
 towards the public  i was a mess  i was half naked i was full of blood and tears were running down my face 
 and everybody escaped they just ran away they could not confront myself with myself as a normal human being  
 and then
 what happened is
 i went to the hotel  it was at two in the morning  and
 i looked at myself in the mirror  and i had a piece of gray hair  
 alright please take off your blindfolds  
 welcome to the performance world
 first of all  let 's explain what the performance is 
 so many artists so many different explanations  but my explanation for performance is very simple 
 performance is a mental and physical construction
 that the performer makes in a specific time in a space in front of an audience
 and then energy dialogue happens the audience
 and the performer make the piece together  
 and the difference between performance and theater is huge in the theater the knife is not a knife
 and the blood is just ketchup in the performance the blood is the material  and the razor blade
  all about
 being there in the real time and you can 't rehearse performance  because you can 't do
 many of these types of things twice ever  
 which is very important the performance is you know  all human beings are always afraid of very simple things we 're afraid of suffering  we 're afraid of pain  we 're
  so what i 'm doing i 'm staging these kinds of fears in front of the audience i 'm using your energy  
 and with this energy i can go and push my body
 as far as i can  
 and then i liberate myself from these fears  and i 'm your mirror  if i can do this for myself you can do it for you 
 after belgrade where i was
  i 've been doing performances since the last forty years  
 and here i met ulay and he was the person i actually fell in love with and we made for twelve years  performances together  
 you know the knife and the pistols and the bullets  i exchange into love and trust  
 so to do this kind work you have to trust the person completely
 because this arrow is pointing to my heart so
 heart beating and adrenaline is rushing and so on is about trust is about total trust to another human being 
 our relationship was twelve years  and we worked on so many subjects both male and female energy and as every relationship comes to an end  
 ours went too we didn 't make phone calls like normal human beings do and say you know this is over
 we walked the great wall of china to say goodbye  i started at the yellow sea  and he started from the gobi desert  
 we walked each of us three months 
 two and a half thousand kilometers  
 it was the mountains  it was difficult  it was climbing it was ruins  it was 
 you know  going through the twelve chinese provinces this was before china was open in
  and we succeeded to meet in the middle
 to say goodbye  
 and then our relationship stopped  
 and now it completely changed how i see the public  
 and one very important piece i made in those days was balkan baroque and this was the time of the balkan
  and i wanted to create some very strong charismatic image something that could serve for any war at any time because the balkan wars are now finished but there 's always some war somewhere so here i am washing
 two and a half thousand dead  big bloody cow bones  you can 't wash the blood  you never can wash shame off the wars so i 'm washing this six hours six days and wars are coming
  becoming possible an unbearable smell  
 but then something stays in the memory  i want to show you the one who really changed my life  and this was the performance in moma  which i just recently made 
 this performance when i said to the curator 
 i 'm just going to sit at the chair and there will be an empty chair at the front and anybody from the public can come and sit as long as
  this chair will be empty nobody has time to sit in front of you 
 but i sit for three months  
 and i sit everyday eight hours the opening of the museum and ten hours on friday when the museum is open ten hours and i never move  and i removed the table and i 'm still sitting  
 and this changed everything this performance maybe ten or fifteen years ago nothing would have happened but the need of people to actually
 experience something different the public was not anymore the group relation was one to one  
 i was watching these people they would come and sit in front of me but they would have to wait for hours and hours and hours to get to this position  and finally they sit 
 and what happened  
 they are observed by the other
  they 're filmed by the camera  they 're observed by me and they have nowhere to escape except in themselves  
 and that makes a difference there was so much pain and loneliness there 's so much incredible things when you look in somebody else 's eyes  because in the gaze with that total stranger that you never even say one word
 everything happened  and i understood when i stood up from that chair after three months  i am not the same anymore  and i understood that
  have a very strong mission that i have to communicate this experience
 to everybody  and this is how for me was born the idea to have an institute
 of immaterial performing arts because thinking about immateriality performance is time based art it 's not like a painting you have the painting on the wall
  only have the memory
 or the story of somebody else telling you but you actually missed the whole thing so you have to be there and in my point if you talk about immaterial art  music is the highest 
 absolutely highest art of all because it 's the most immaterial  and then after this is performance and then everything else that 's my subjective way 
  rem koolhaas an idea and it 's very simple if you want to
 get experience you have to give me your time  
 you have to sign the contract before you enter the building that you will spend there a full six hours  you have to give me your word of honor it
 's something so old fashioned but if you don 't respect your own word of honor and you leave before that 's not my problem but it 's six hours the
  experience  and then after you finish you get a certificate of accomplishment so get home and frame it if you want 
 this is orientation hall the public comes in and the first thing you have to do is dress in lab coats it
 's this importance of stepping from being just a viewer into experimenter  and then you go to the
  the lockers and you put your watch your iphone your ipod your computer and everything digital electronic 
 and you are getting free time for yourself for the first time  because
 there is nothing wrong with technology
  our approach to technology is wrong we are losing the time we have for ourselves this is an institute to actually give you back this time  so what you do here  first you start slow
  you start slowing down you 're going back to simplicity 
 after slow walking  you 're going to learn how to drink water very simple  drinking water for maybe half an hour 
 after this you 're going to the magnet chamber  where you 're going to create some magnet streams on your body then after this you go to crystal chamber  after crystal chamber you go to
  standing and lying  and slow walking  
 and there is a sound chamber  and then after you 've seen all of this and prepared yourself mentally and physically then you are ready to see something with a long duration 
 like in in immaterial art it can be music it can be opera it can be a theater piece it can be film it can be video dance  you go to the long duration chairs because now you are comfortable
  long duration chairs you 're transported to the big place where you 're going to see the the work and if you fall asleep which is very possible because it 's been a long day you 're going to be transported to the parking lot and
 you know  sleeping is very important in sleeping you 're still receiving art  
 so in the parking lot you stay for a certain amount of time  and then after this you just
  go back you see more of the things you like to see or go home with your certificate  
 so this institute right now is virtual right now i am just making my institute in brazil then it 's going to be in australia  then it 's coming here to canada and everywhere  
 and this is to experience a kind of simple method how you go back to simplicity in your own life counting rice will be another thing
 you know  
 if you count rice you can make life too how to count rice for six hours  it 's incredibly important  you know you go through this whole range of being bored being 
 angry being completely frustrated not finishing the amount of rice you 're counting  and then this unbelievable amount of
  when satisfying work is finished or counting sand in the desert or having the
 situation that you have headphones that you don 't hear anything  and you 're just there together without sound with the people experiencing silence just the simple silence  we are always
 doing things we like in our life  and this is why you 're not changing
  do things in life it 's just nothing happens if you always do things the same way  
 but my method is to do things i 'm afraid of the things i fear  the things i don 't know to go to territory that nobody 's ever been  
 and then also to include the failure i think failure is important because if you go if you experiment  you can fail  
 if you don 't go into that area and you don 't fail you are actually repeating yourself over and over again
 and i think that human beings right now need a change and the only change to be made is a personal level change you have to make the change 
  on yourself because the only way to change consciousness and to change the world around us is to start with yourself it 's so easy to criticize how it 's different the things
  the governments are corrupted and there 's hunger in the world
 and there 's wars the killing  but what we do on the personal level what is our contribution to this whole thing 
 can you turn to your neighbor the one you don 't know  and look at them for two full minutes in their eyes right now
  i 'm asking two minutes of your time that 's so little breathe slowly don 't try to blink don 't be 
 be relaxed and just look a complete stranger in your eyes  in his eyes
  you for trusting me
