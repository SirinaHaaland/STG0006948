  i consider it my life 's mission to convey the urgency of climate change through my work  
 i 've traveled north to the arctic to the capture the unfolding story of polar melt and south to the equator to document the subsequent rising seas
  most recently i visited the icy coast of greenland and the  low lying islands of the maldives  connecting two seemingly disparate
 but equally endangered parts of our planet my drawings
 explore moments of transition turbulence
 and tranquility in the landscape allowing viewers to emotionally
  connect with a place you might never have the chance to visit i choose to convey the beauty
 as opposed to the devastation 
 if you can experience the sublimity of these landscapes perhaps you 'll be inspired to protect and preserve them 
 behavioral psychology tells us that we take action and make decisions based on our emotions above
 all else and studies have shown that art impacts our emotions more effectively than a scary news report  
 experts predict ice free arctic summers as early as two thousand and twenty 
 and sea levels are likely to rise between two and ten feet by
  i have dedicated my career to illuminating these projections
 with an accessible medium one that moves us in a way that statistics may not 
 my process begins with traveling to the places at the forefront of climate change on site i take thousands of photographs
 back in the studio i work from both my memory of the experience
 and the photographs to create very
  compositions sometimes over ten feet wide  
 i draw with soft pastel which is dry like charcoal but colors  
 i consider my work drawings but others call them painting  i cringe though  when i 'm referred to as a finger painter 
 but
 i don 't use any tools and i have always used my fingers and palms to manipulate the pigment on the paper
 drawing is a form of meditation for me 
 it quiets my mind  
 i don 't perceive what i 'm drawing as ice or water  instead 
 the image is stripped down to its most basic form of color and shape 
 once the piece is complete  i can finally experience the composition as a whole as an iceberg floating through glassy water
  or a wave cresting with foam 
 on average a piece this size takes me about 
 as you can see ten seconds applause
 really more like two hundred hours two hundred and fifty hours for something that size 
 but i 've been drawing ever since i could hold a crayon really my mom was an artist and growing up we
  always had art supplies all over the house 
 my mother 's love of photography propelled her to the most remote regions of the earth 
 and my family and i were fortunate enough to join and support her on these adventures  
 we rode camels in northern africa and mushed on dog sleds near the north pole 
 in august of two thousand and twelve  i led my first expedition
  taking a group of artists and scholars up the northwest coast of greenland  
 my mother was originally supposed to lead this trip 
 she and i were in the early stages of planning as we had intended to go together  when she fell victim to a brain tumor 
 the cancer quickly took over her body and mind  and she passed away six months later
  during the months of her illness though her dedication to the expedition never wavered and i made a promise to carry out her final journey 
 my mother 's
 passion for the arctic
 echoed through my experience in greenland and i felt the power
 and the fragility of the landscape the sheer size
  size of the icebergs is humbling the ice fields are alive with movement and sound in a way that i never expected  
 i expanded the scale of my compositions to
 give you that same sense of awe that i experienced  yet while the grandeur of the ice is
  is its vulnerability from our boat i could see the ice sweating under the unseasonably warm sun 
 we had a chance to visit many of the inuit communities in greenland that now face huge challenges 
 the locals spoke to me of vast areas of sea ice that are no longer freezing over as they once did and without ice their hunting and harvesting grounds are severely diminished  threatening their way of life
  and survival 
 the melting glaciers in greenland are one of the largest contributing factors to rising sea levels 
 which have already begun to drown some of our world 's lowest lying islands 
 one year after my trip to greenland i visited the maldives 
 the lowest and flattest country in the entire world while i was there  i collected images
  and inspiration for a new body of work drawings
 of waves lapping on the coast of a nation that could be entirely underwater within this century 
 devastating events happen every day on scales both global
  when i was in greenland  i scattered my mother 's ashes amidst the melting ice now she
 remains a part of the landscape she loved so much  even as it too passes and takes on new form  
 among the many gifts my mother gave me was the ability to focus on the positive rather than the negative
  my drawings celebrate the beauty
 of what we all stand to lose  
 i hope they can serve as records of sublime landscapes in flux  
 documenting the transition and inspiring our global community to take action for the future  
 thank you
