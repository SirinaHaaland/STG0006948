  thank you so much it 's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart  
 i 'm here to tell you a few tales of passion  there 's a jewish saying that
  i want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common humanity 
 all stories interest me and some haunt me until i end up writing them 
 certain themes keep coming up
 i 'm aware of the mystery around us so i write about coincidences premonitions emotions  dreams the power of nature  magic 
 in the last twenty years i have published a few books  but i have lived in anonymity until february of two thousand and six when i carried the olympic flag in the winter olympics in italy
 that made me a celebrity  now people recognize me in macy 's and my grandchildren think that i 'm cool 
 allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame 
 one of the organizers of the olympic ceremony of the opening ceremony  called me and said that i had been selected to be one of the
  i replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because i 'm as far as you can get from being an athlete
  actually i wasn 't even sure that i could go around the stadium without a walker 
 i was told that this was no laughing matter 
 this would be the first time that only women would carry the olympic flag five women representing five continents  and three olympic gold medal winners 
 my first question was naturally
 what was i going to wear a
 uniform  she said 
 and asked for my measurements my measurements  i had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak looking like the michelin man 
 by the middle of february i found myself in turin where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the eighty olympic teams was in the street 
  athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games  they all deserved to win but there 's the element of luck 
 a speck of snow an inch of ice  the force of the wind can determine the result of a race or a game  
 however what matters most more than training or luck is the heart 
 only a fearless and determined heart
 will get the gold medal it is all about passion  the streets of turin were covered with red posters
 announcing the slogan of the olympics passion lives here 
 isn 't it always true heart is what drives us and determines our
  that is what i need for my characters in my books a passionate heart 
 i need mavericks  dissidents  adventurers outsiders and rebels who ask questions bend the rules and take risks people like all of you in this room 
 nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters 
 they only make
  in the green room of the stadium  i met the other flag bearers three athletes  and the actresses susan sarandon and sophia loren 
 also two women with passionate hearts  wangari maathai the nobel prizewinner from kenya
 who has planted thirty million trees and by doing so she
  in some places in africa and of course the economic conditions in many villages  
 and somaly mam a cambodian activist who fights passionately against child prostitution 
 when she was fourteen years old her grandfather sold her to a brothel 
 she told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from aids  
 and of brothels
 where children are forced to receive five fifteen clients per day and if they rebel  they are tortured with electricity 
 in the green room i received my uniform  
 it was not the kind of outfit that i normally wear  but it was far from the michelin man suit that i had anticipated not bad really
  i looked like a refrigerator 
 but so did most of the flag bearers except sophia loren  the universal symbol of beauty and passion 
 sophia is over seventy and she looks great  
 she 's sexy  slim and tall with a deep tan now how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles i don 't know 
 when asked in a tv interview how could she look so good
  my back is always straight  and i don 't make old people 's noises so there you have some free advice
 from one of the most beautiful women on earth 
 no grunting no coughing no wheezing no talking to yourselves  no farting well she didn 't say that exactly
  at some point around midnight we were summoned to the wings of the stadium  and the loudspeakers announced the olympic flag and the music started by the way the same music that starts here the aida march 
 sophia loren was right in front of me
 she 's a foot taller than i am not counting the poofy hair she walked elegantly like a
  so that my head was actually under the damn flag 
 all the cameras were of course on sophia that was fortunate for me because in most press photos i appear too 
 although often between sophia 's legs
  place where most men would love to be 
 the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the olympic stadium 
 my husband is offended when i say this
 although i have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than four minutes
 of those four magnificent minutes because i don 't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells  i want to carry in my heart forever
 the key word of the olympics
 passion  so here 's a tale of passion  
 the year is one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight the place is a prison camp for tutsi refugees in congo by the way  eighty percent
  of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls 
 we can call this place in congo a death camp because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation  
 the protagonists of this story are a young woman rose mapendo and her children  
 she 's pregnant and a widow  soldiers have forced her to watch as
  her husband was tortured and killed 
 somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive and a few months later she gives birth to premature twins two tiny little boys  
 she cuts the umbilical cord with a stick and ties it with her own hair  
 she names the twins after the camp 's commanders to gain their favor and feeds them with black tea
  because her milk cannot sustain them 
 when the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go even when they hold a gun to her head  
 somehow  the family survives for sixteen months  and then 
 by extraordinary luck  and the passionate heart of a young american man  sasha chanoff
 who manages to put her in a u s rescue plane  rose mapendo and her nine children end up in phoenix  arizona where they 're now living and thriving 
 mapendo in swahili means great love  
 the protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like rose mapendo
  i don 't make them up 
 there 's no need for that i look around and i see them everywhere i have worked with women and for women all my life i know them well  
 i was born in ancient times at the end of the world in a patriarchal catholic and conservative family 
 no wonder that by age five i was a raging feminist although the term had not reached
 chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me 
 i would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom  and for questioning the patriarchy  but i was happy to pay it because for every blow that i received i was able to deliver two 
 once when my daughter paula was in her twenties  she said to me that feminism was dated that i should move
 we had a memorable fight  feminism is dated  
 yes for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today  but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world
 who are still forced into premature marriage prostitution forced labor
 they have children that they don 't want or they cannot feed they have no control over their
  bodies or their lives they have no education and no freedom  they are raped beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity 
 for most western young women of today being called a feminist is an insult 
 feminism has never been sexy  but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting and i have seldom suffered from lack of men
  feminism is not dead by no means it has evolved 
 if you don 't like the term change it for goddess ' sake call it aphrodite or venus or bimbo or whatever you want  
 the name doesn 't matter as long as we understand what it is about and we support it 
 so here 's another tale of passion  and this is a sad one  
 the place is a small women 's clinic in a village in bangladesh
  the year is two thousand and five jenny is a young american dental hygienist
 who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her three week vacation she 's prepared to clean teeth  
 but when she gets there she finds out that there are no doctors no dentists  and the clinic is just a hut full of flies
  a line of women who have waited several hours
 to be treated the first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars  
 jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth  
 she 's not licensed for that she has never done it she risks a lot and she 's terrified 
 she doesn 't even have the proper instruments  but fortunately she has brought some novocaine
  jenny has a brave and passionate heart  she murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation 
 at the end the relieved patient kisses her hands that day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth  
 the next morning when she comes again to the so called clinic her first patient is waiting for her with her husband the woman 's face looks
  like a watermelon it is so swollen that you can 't even see the eyes  the husband furious threatens to kill the american 
 jenny is horrified at what she has done 
 but then the translator explains that the patient 's condition has nothing to do with the operation  
  her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him 
 millions of women live like this today  they are the poorest of the poor  
 although women do two thirds of the world 's labor they own less than one percent of the world 's assets  
 they are paid less than men for the same work if they 're paid at all 
 and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence and they are
  constantly threatened by exploitation violence and abuse 
 it is a fact that giving women education work  the ability to control their own income  inherit and own property  benefits the society 
 if a woman is empowered her children and her family will be better off 
 if families prosper the village prospers and eventually so does the whole country  
 wangari maathai
  goes to a village in kenya she talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees 
 she gets the women to plant new trees and water them drop by drop 
 in a matter of five or six years they have a forest the soil is enriched and the village is saved 
 the poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down
 yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy 
 for every dollar given to a women 's program  twenty dollars are given to men 's programs 
 women are fifty one percent of humankind empowering them will change everything more than technology and
  i can promise you that
 women working together linked  informed and educated can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet  
 in any war today most of the casualties are civilians mainly women and children  they are collateral damage 
 men run the world and look at the mess we have what kind of world do we want this is a fundamental question that most
  of us are asking does it make sense to participate in the existing world order 
 we want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody not only for the privileged 
 in january i saw an exhibit of fernando botero 's paintings
  berkeley library 
 no museum or gallery in the united states  except for the new york gallery that carries botero 's work has dared to show the paintings because the theme is the abu ghraib prison  
 they are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power in the voluminous botero style i have
 not been able to get those images out of my mind
  or my heart what i fear most
 is power with impunity  i fear abuse of power and the power to abuse  
 in our species  the alpha males define reality and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules 
 the rules change all the time but they always benefit them 
 and in this case the trickle down effect which does not work in economics  works perfectly abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom
  women and children especially the poor are at the bottom even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse a woman or a child 
 i 'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender
