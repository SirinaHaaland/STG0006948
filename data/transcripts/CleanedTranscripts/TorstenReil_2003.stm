  i 'm going to talk about a technology that we 're developing at oxford now that we think is going to change the way
 that computer games and hollywood movies are being made that technology is simulating humans it 's simulated humans
  with a simulated body
 and a simulated nervous system to control that body  now before i talk more about that technology let 's have a quick look at what
 human characters look like at the moment in computer games
 this is a clip from a game called grand theft auto three we already saw that briefly yesterday  and what you can see is
 it is actually a very good game it 's one of the most successful games of
  time but what you 'll see is that all the animations in this game
 are very repetitive they pretty much look the same i 've made him run into a wall here over and over again  
 and you can see he looks always the same  the reason for that is
 that these characters are actually not real characters they are a
 graphical visualization of a character to produce these animations an animator at a studio has
  to anticipate
 what 's going to happen
 in the actual game  and then has to animate that particular sequence so he or she sits down  
 animates it and tries to anticipate what 's going to happen  and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times
 in the computer game  now  the result of that is that you can 't have real interactivity all you have is animations that are played back at
 more or less
 the appropriate times  it also means that games
 aren 't really going to be as surprising as they could be because you only get out of it at least in terms of the character what you actually put into it there 's no real emergence there  and thirdly as i said  most of the animations
 are very repetitive because of that now  the only way to get around
  that is to actually simulate the human body and to simulate
 that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body and maybe if i could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is
 because
 it 's very very trivial  if i push chris a bit like this for example he 'll react to it if i push him from a different angle he
 'll react to it differently and that 's because he has a physical body and because he has
  the motor skills to control that body it 's a very trivial thing it 's not something you get in computer games at the moment at all thank you very much chris anderson that 's it torsten reil that 's it yes so 
 that 's what we 're trying to simulate
 not chris specifically i should say but
 humans in general
 now  we started working on this a while ago at oxford university and we tried to start very simply what we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk
 that stick figure is physically stimulated you can see it here on the screen so
  it 's subject to gravity has joints etc  if you just run the simulation it will just collapse like this
  the tricky bit is now to put an ai controller in it that actually makes it work and for that we use the neural network which we based on
 that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine
 that controls walking in humans it 's called the central pattern generator  so we simulated that as well  and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk
 for that we used artificial evolution
 genetic algorithms we heard about those already yesterday and i suppose that most of you are familiar with that already but just briefly the concept is is that you create
 a large number of different individuals neural networks in this case all of which are random at the beginning  you hook these up in this case to the virtual muscles
  creature here and hope that it does something interesting at the beginning they 're all going to be
 very boring most of them won 't move at all but some of them might make a tiny step those are then selected by the algorithm reproduced with mutation and
 recombinations to introduce sex as well  and you repeat that process over and over again until you have something that walks in this case in a straight line like this so that was the idea behind this when we started this i set up the simulation
 one evening it took about three to
  hours to run the simulation i got up the next morning went to the computer
 and looked at the results and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line like i 've just demonstrated  
 and this is what i got instead 
 back to the drawing board for us  
 we did get it to work eventually
  after tweaking a bit here and there  and this is an example of a successful evolutionary run so what you 'll see in a moment is
 a very simple biped that 's learning how to walk using artificial evolution at the beginning it can 't walk at all  
 but it will get better and better over time  
 so this is the one that can 't walk at all
 now after five generations of applying evolutionary process the genetic algorithm
 is getting a tiny bit better 
  take a few steps more
 still not quite there  
 but now after generation twenty it actually walks in a straight line without falling over
  that was the real breakthrough for us  
 it was academically quite a challenging project and once we had reached that stage we were quite confident that we could
 try and do other things as well with with this approach actually simulating the body and simulating that part of the nervous
  system that controls it 
 now  at this stage it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worlds   what you see here is the character standing there and there 's an obstacle that we put in its way  
 and what you see is it 's going to fall over the obstacle now  the interesting bit is if i move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right which is what i 'm doing now here  
 it will fall over it
 in
  different way  
 and again if you move the obstacle a tiny bit it 'll again fall differently 
 now what you see by the way at the top there are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles okay that 's the video thanks
 now this might look kind of trivial but it 's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds
 now at this stage  we decided to start a company and move this further because obviously this was just a very simple blocky biped  what we really wanted was a full human body so we started the company 
 we hired a team of physicists software engineers and biologists to work on this and the first thing we had to work on was to create
  it 's got to be relatively fast so you can run it on a normal machine but it 's got to be accurate enough so it looks good enough basically  so we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing
 and tried to make it as realistic as possible  what you see here on the screen right now  is a very simple visualization of that body
 i should add that it 's very simple to add things like hair clothes etc but what we 've done here is use a very simple simple visualization so you can concentrate on the movement
  now what i 'm going to do right now in a moment is just push this character a tiny bit and we 'll see what happens 
 nothing really interesting basically  it falls over but it falls over like a rag doll basically  the reason for that is is that there 's no intelligence in it  
 it becomes
  interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it so this character now has
 motor skills in the upper body
 nothing in the legs yet  in this particular one  
 but what it will do i 'm going to push it again  it will realize autonomously that it 's being pushed it 's going to stick out its hands it 's going to turn around into the fall and try and catch the fall  
 so that 's what you see here  now  it gets really interesting
  if you then add the ai for the lower part of the body as well so here we 've got the same character i 'm going to push it a bit harder
 now  harder than i just pushed chris  but what you 'll see is
 it 's going to receive a push now from from the left 
 what you see is it takes steps backwards  it tries to counter balance it tries to look at the place where it thinks it 's going to land
  again  and then finally hits the floor  now this becomes really exciting
 when you
 push that character in different directions again just as i 've done
 that 's something that you cannot do right now at the moment you only have empty computer graphics in in games 
  what this is now is a real simulation that 's what i want to show you now  so here 's the same character with the same behavior i 've just shown you but now i 'm just going to push it from different directions first starting with a push from the right
 this is all slow motion by the way so we can see what 's going on now  the angle will have changed a tiny bit so
 you can see that the reaction is different again a push now this time from
  and you see it falls differently  and now from the left
 and it falls differently
  that was really exciting for us to see that that was the first time we 've seen that this is the first time the public sees this as well because we have been in stealth mode i haven 't shown this to anybody yet
  now  just a fun thing what happens if you put that character this is now a wooden version of it but it 's got the same ai in it
  if you put that character
 on a slippery surface like ice  we just did that for a laugh just to see what happens 
 and this is what happens it
 's nothing we had to do about this we just took this character that i just talked about put it on a slippery surface and this is what you get out of it and that 's
 a really fascinating thing about this approach
  now when we went to film studios and games developers and showed them that technology
 got a very good response  and what they said was the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen
  because stunts are obviously very dangerous they 're very expensive and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do obviously because you can 't really
 allow the the stuntman to be seriously hurt so they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman and that 's what we 've been working on for the past few months  and that 's our first
 product that we 're going to release in a couple of weeks
 so here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked  that 's what people want that 's what we 're giving them 
 you can see it 's always reacting this is not a dead body this is a body
 who basically in this particular case feels the force and tries to protect its head
  kind of sorry for that thing and we 've seen it so many times now that we don 't really care any more 
 there are much worse videos than this by the way which i have taken out but 
 now here 's another one what people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion  a strong force applied to the character and have the character react to it
  in midair so that you don 't have a character that looks limp  but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away that looks kind of alive in midair as well  so this character is going to be hit by a force it 's going to realize it 's in the air and it 's going to try and
 stick out its arm in the direction where it 's landing that
 's one angle here 's another angle  we now think that the realism we 're achieving with this is good enough
  used in films and let 's just have a look at a slightly different visualization  this is something i just got last night from an animation studio in london who are using our software and
 experimenting with it right now  so this is exactly the same behavior that you saw but in a slightly
 better rendered version  so if you look at the character carefully you see there are lots of body movements going on none of which you have to animate like in the old
  to actually animate them  this is all happening automatically in the simulation this is a slightly different angle  
 and again a slow motion version of this  
 this is incredibly quick this is happening in real time you can run this simulation in real time in front of your eyes change it if you want to  and you get the animation straight out of it  at the moment doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days
  this is another behavior they requested i 'm not quite sure why but we 've done it anyway it 's a very simple
  behavior that shows you the power of this approach in this case the character 's hands are fixed to a particular point in space  and all we 've told the character to do is to struggle  
 and it looks organic it looks realistic you feel kind of sorry for the guy it 's even worse and that is another video i just got last night if you render that a bit more realistically
  'm showing this to you just to show you how organic it actually can feel how realistic it can look and this is all a physical simulation of the body  using ai to drive virtual muscles in that body  
 now  
 one thing which we did for a laugh was to create a slightly more complex stunt scene and one of the most famous stunts is the one where james bond
 jumps off a dam in switzerland and then is
  just about see it here in
 this case they were using a real stunt man it was a very dangerous stunt it was just voted i think in the sunday times as one of the most impressive stunts 
 now we 've just tried and looked at our character and asked ourselves can we do that ourselves as well can we use the physical simulation of the character use artificial
  put that artificial intelligence into the character drive virtual muscles simulate the way he jumps off the dam  and then skydive afterwards and have him caught by a bungee
 afterwards  we did that it took about altogether just two hours pretty much to create the simulation 
 and that 's what it looks like here
  this could do with a bit more work it 's still very early stages and we pretty much just did this for a laugh just to see what we 'd get out of it but what we found
 over the past few months is that this this approach  that we 're pretty much standard upon is is incredibly powerful we are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of
 out of the simulations there 's very often very surprising behavior that you didn 't predict before  there 's so many things we
  going to be virtual stuntmen  several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen and they 're going to hit the screen
 quite soon actually for some major productions  the second thing is
 video games with this technology video games will look different and they will feel very different for the first time you 'll have actors that really feel very interactive that have real bodies that really react
  i think that 's going to be incredibly exciting  probably starting with sports games which are going to become much more interactive
  but i particularly am really excited about using this technology in in online worlds  like there for example that tom melcher has shown us  
 the degree of interactivity you 're going to get is totally different i think from what you 're getting right now 
 a third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation 
 we 've been approached by several simulation companies but one project we 're particularly excited about which we 're starting next month is to use
  our technology and in particular the walking technology
 to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy 
 to predict the outcome of operations on these children as you probably know  it 's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is if you try and correct the gait
 the classic quote is i think it 's unpredictable at best is what people think right now is the outcome  now what we want to do with our software is allow
  our surgeons to have a tool
  we 're going to simulate the gait of a particular child and the surgeon can then work on that simulation and try out different ways to improve that gait before he actually commits to to an actual surgery  
 that 's one project we 're particularly excited about 
 and that 's going to start next month
  this is only just the beginning we can only do several behaviors right now the ai isn 't good enough to simulate a full human body
 the body yes but not all the motor skills that we have and i think we 're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing right now we don 't have that but i 'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage
  we do have one unintentional dancer actually the last thing i 'm going to show you this was an ai contour that was produced and evolved
  i should say to produce balance basically so you kick the guy and the guy 's supposed to counter balance that 's what we thought was going to come out of this  but this is what emerged out of it in the end
  that 's just the simulation creating this itself basically
 not quite john travolta yet but we 're working on that as well so thanks very much for
