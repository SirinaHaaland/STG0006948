  curator of architecture and design i happen to be at the museum of modern art  but what 
  we 're going to talk about today is really design 
 really good designers are like sponges they really are curious and absorb every kind of information that comes their way  and transform
  it so that it can be used by people like us  and so that gives me an opportunity because every design show that i curate
 kind of looks at a different world and it 's great because it seems like every time i change jobs  and what i 'm going to do today is i 'm going to give you a preview of the next exhibition that i 'm working on which is called design and the elastic mind 
 the world that i decided to focus on this particular time is
  world of science and the world of technology technology always comes into play when design is involved  but science does a little less but designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them  
 and this is what this exhibition looks at if you think about your life
  you go every day through many different scales many different changes of rhythm and pace you work over different time zones you talk to very different people you multitask 
  we all know it and we do it kind of automatically some of the minds in this audience are super elastic  others are a little slower others have a few stretch marks  but nonetheless this is
  other people are not as elastic i can 't get my father in italy to work on the internet he doesn 't want to put high speed internet at home 
 and that 's because there 's some little bit of fear little bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms 
 so designers work on this particular malaise that we have these kinds of
 discomforts that we have and try to make life easier for us
 elasticity of mind is something that
  we really need  we really
 cherish and we really work on and this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic and also of designers that really work on this elasticity as an opportunity  
 and one last thing is that it 's not only designers but it 's also scientists and before i launch into the
 display of some of the slides and into the preview
  i would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientists and design 
 you can say that the relationship between science and design goes back centuries you can of course talk about leonardo da vinci and many other renaissance men and women and there 's a gigantic history behind it  
 but according to a really great science historian you might know peter galison he teaches at harvard
 what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics have brought to designers is this renewed
  interest this real
 passion for design 
 so basically the idea of being able to build things bottom up atom by atom has made them all into tinkerers and all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers just like designers are seeking scientists it 's a brand new
 love affair that we 're trying to cultivate at moma together with adam bly who is the founder of seed magazine
  that 's now a multimedia company you might know it we founded about a year ago
 a monthly salon for designers and scientists and it 's quite beautiful and keith has come and also jonathan has come and many others 
 and it was great because at the beginning was this apology fest you know  scientists would tell designers you know i don 't know what style is i 'm not really
  and designers would like oh i don 't know how to do an equation i don 't understand what you 're saying  
 and then all of a sudden they really started talking each others ' language and now we 're already at the point that they collaborate
  paul steinhardt a physicist from new york and aranda lasch  architects collaborated in an installation in london at the serpentine
  and it 's really interesting to see how this happens the exhibition will talk about the work of both designers and scientists and show how
  they 're presenting the possibilities of the future to us
 i 'm showing to you different sections of the show right now just to give you a taste of it nanophysics and nanotechnology for instance have really opened the designer 's mind in this case i 'm showing more the designers ' work because they
 're the ones that have really been stimulated a lot of the objects in the show are concepts not objects that exist already  but what you 're looking at here
 is the work of some scientists from ucla this kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins not only by color but literally by alphabet letters so they construct 
  it and they can construct all kinds of forms at the nanoscale this is the work of design students from the royal college of arts in london that have been working together with their tutor tony dunne
  and with a bunch of scientists around great britain on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future new sensing elements on the body you can grow hairs on your nails 
 and therefore grab some of the particles from another person they seem very very obsessed with finding out more about the ideal mate so they 're working on enhancing everything touch smell everything they can in order to find the perfect mate very
  is a typeface designer from israel who has designed he calls them typosperma he 's thinking of course it 's all a concept of injecting typefaces 
 into spermatozoa  i don 't know how to say it in english spermatazoi
 in order to make them become to almost have a song or a whole poem written with every ejaculation
  in this case too you have a mixture of scientists and designers
  this here is part of the same lab at the royal college of arts the rca is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint one of the assignments for a year was to work with in vitro
  meat you know that already you can grow meat in vitro in australia they did it this research company called symbiotica  but the problem is that it 's a
  and so the assignment to the students was how should the steak of tomorrow be when you don 't have to kill cows and it can have any shape what should it be like so this particular student 
 james king went around the beautiful english countryside picked the best best cow that he could see and then put her in the mri machine 
  food maker but you know in the future it could be made better which reproduces the best mri scan of the best cow he could find
 instead this element here is much more
 banal something that you know can be done already is to grow bone tissue so that you can make a wedding ring out of the bone tissue of your loved one literally so
  been working they were the first ones to do this in vitro meat and now they 've also done an in vitro coat a leather coat it 's miniscule  
 but it 's a real coat it 's shaped like one so we 'll be able to really not have any excuse to be wearing everything leather in the future one of the most important
 topics of the show you know as anything in our life today we can look at it from many many different viewpoints and at different levels
  one of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale  we change scale very often we change resolution of screens and we 're not really fazed by it we do it very 
  comfortably  so you go even in the exhibition from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale to the manipulation of really great amounts of data the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world
  design you see here the work of ben fry  this is human 
  vs chimps the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps it was a beautiful visualization that he did for seed magazine and here 's the whole code of pac man visualized with all the 
 also made into a beautiful choreography  and then also graphs by scientists this beautiful diagraph of protein homology scientists
  are starting to also consider aesthetics we were discussing with keith shrubb * this morning
 the fact that many scientists tend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations  otherwise they 're afraid of being considered dumb blondes  so they pick the worst 
  background from any kind of powerpoint presentation the worst typeface it 's only recently that this kind of marriage between design and science is producing some of the first
  if we can say so scientific presentations another aspect of contemporary design that i think 
 promising and will really be the future of design is the idea of collective design you know the whole
 xo laptop from one laptop per child is based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking so the more the merrier  the more computers the stronger the signal and
 children
 work on the interface so that it 's all based on doing things together tasks together so the idea of collective design is something that will become even bigger in the future and this is chosen as an example 
 related to the idea of collective design and to the new balance between the individual and the 
  collectivity is the idea of existence maximum that 's a term that i coined a few
  years ago while i was thinking of how pressed we are together and at the same time how these small objects like the walkman first and then the ipod  create bubbles of space around us that enable us to have
 a metaphysical space that is much bigger than our physical space you can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated and have your own room in your ipod  and this is the work of several designers
 that really
 enhance the idea of solitude and expansion by means of various techniques this is a spa telephone the idea is that it 's become so difficult to have a private conversation 
  anywhere that you go to the spa you have a massage you have a facial maybe a rub  and then you have this beautiful pool with this perfect temperature and you can have this isolation tank phone conversation with whomever you 've been wanting to talk with for a long time and
 same thing here social
 tele presence it 's actually already used by the military a little bit  but it 's the idea of being able to be somewhere else with your senses while you 're removed from it physically and this is called blind 
  date it 's a [ unclear ] so if you 're too shy to be really at the date you can stay at a distance with your flowers
  technology and design are i think bound to change the world 
 you 've heard about it before many times rapid manufacturing is a computer file sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine it used to be called rapid prototyping rapid 
  modeling it started out in the ' 80s but at the beginning it was machines carving out of a foam block a model that was very very fragile and
  not have any real use slowly but surely  
 the materials became better better resins techniques became better not only carving but also stereolithography and laser solidifying all kinds of resins 
 whether in powder or in liquid form and the vats became bigger to the point that now we can have actual chairs made by rapid manufacturing 
  but you know what one day it will take seven hours  and then the dream is that you 'll be able to from home  customize your chair you know companies and designers will be designing the matrix 
  or the margins that respect both solidity and brand and design identity  and then you can send it to the kinko 's store at the corner and go get your chair
  the implications of this are enormous not only regarding the participation of the final buyer
 in the design process but also no tracking no warehousing no wasted materials also i can imagine many design manufacturers will have to retool their own business plans 
  and maybe invest in this kinko 's store  but it really is a big change and here i 'm showing a picture that was in wired magazine you know the artifacts of the future section that i love so much that shows you can have your desktop 3d printer and print your own basketball
 but here instead are examples you can already 3d print textiles which is very interesting this is just a really nice touch it 's called slow prototyping it 's a designer that put ten thousand bees
 at work and they built this vase they had a particular shape that they had to stay in mapping and tagging as the capacity of computers
 becomes really really big and the capacity of our mind not that
  much bigger  we find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do in order to then retrace our path also we do it in order to share with other people  
  again this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today so various ways to map and tag are also
  the senses designers and scientists all work on trying to expand our senses capabilities so that we can achieve more  and also animal senses in a way 
 this particular object that many people love so much is actually based on kind of a scientific experiment the fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense  and 
  so much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer bees can be trained by pavlovian reflex
 to detect one type of cancer and also pregnancy  and so this student at the rca designed this beautiful blown glass object where the bees move from one chamber 
  to the other if they detect that particular smell that signifies in this case pregnancy  another shape is made for cancer design for debate is a very interesting
  don 't design objects products things that we 're going to actually use  but rather they design scenarios that are object based they 're still very useful they help companies and other designers think better about the future 
 and usually they are accompanied by videos  
 this is quite beautiful it 's dunne and raby all the robots those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of we always think that robots will take care of
  us and instead they designed these robots that are very very needy you need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes for about five minutes before it does something another one gets really really nervous if you get 
  in to the room and starts shaking so you have to calm it down  so it 's really a way to make us think more about what robots mean to us  
  the idea is that when you lose your loved one or you go through a bad breakup what you miss the most are those annoying things
 that you used to hate when you were with the other person so he designed all these series of accessories  this one
 is something that takes away the sheets from you at night 
 then there 's another one that breathes on your neck there 's another one that throws plates and breaks them so it 's just
 this idea of what we really miss in life elio caccavale he
  took the idea of those dolls that explain leukemia  
 he 's working on dolls that explain xenotransplantation and also the spider gene into the goat from a few years ago he 's working for the exhibition 
  on a whole series of of dolls that explain to children where babies come from today  because it 's not anymore mom
  the flowers and the bees and then there 's the baby no it can be two moms three dads in vitro there 's the the whole idea of how babies can be made today that has changed so it 's a series of dolls that he 's working on right now 
 one of the most beautiful things is that designers really work on on life even though they take technology into account 
 and many designers have been working recently on the idea of death
  and mourning and what we can do about it today with new technologies or how we should behave about it with new technologies  
 these three objects over there are hard drives with a bluetooth connection but they 're in reality very very beautiful sculpted artifacts
 that contain the whole desktop and computer memory of somebody who passed away so instead of having only the pictures you will be able to put this object next to the computer and all of a sudden
 have you know  gertrude 's whole life and
  all of her files and her address book come alive
