  i became the world chess champion after beating anatoly karpov earlier that
  i played what is called simultaneous exhibition against
 of the world 's best chess playing machines in hamburg germany  i won all the games and
 then it was not considered much of a surprise that i could beat thirty two computers at the same time 
 to me that was the golden age 
 machines were weak and my hair was strong
 just twelve years later  i was fighting for my life
 against just one computer
 in a match
 called by the cover of newsweek the brain 's last stand no pressure 
 from mythology to science fiction human versus machine
 has been often portrayed as a matter of life and death 
 john henry called the steel driving man in the 19th century african american folk legend was pitted in a race against
 hammer bashing a tunnel through mountain rock john henry 's legend
  is a part of a long historical narrative pitting humanity
 versus technology  
 and this competitive rhetoric is standard now we are in a race against the machines 
 in a fight or even in a war  
 jobs are being killed off people are being replaced as if they had vanished from the earth it 's enough to think
  there are very few instances of an arena where
 the human
 body and mind can compete on equal terms with a computer or a robot actually i wish there were a few more  
 instead  it
 was my
 blessing and my curse to literally become the proverbial man in the man versus machine competition that everybody is still talking about 
 in the most famous
  competition since john henry  i played two matches against the ibm supercomputer
  nobody remembers that i won the first match 
 in philadelphia before losing the rematch the following year in new york 
 but i guess that 's fair 
 there is no
 day in history
  special calendar entry for all the people who failed to climb mt everest before sir edmund hillary and tenzing norgay made it to the top 
 i was still the world champion
 when chess computers finally came of age  i was mt everest and deep blue reached the summit 
  hats off to them  
 as always machine 's triumph was a human triumph  something we tend to forget when humans are surpassed by our own creations 
 deep blue was victorious but was it intelligent
 no no it wasn 't at least not in the way alan turing and other founders of computer science had hoped 
 it turned out that chess could be crunched by brute force  once
 hardware got fast enough and
  deep blue was intelligent  
 but even at the incredible speed two hundred million positions per second 
 deep blue 's method
 provided
  into the mysteries of human intelligence  
 soon 
 machines will be taxi drivers and doctors and professors  but will they be intelligent 
 i would rather leave these definitions to the philosophers and to the
  really matters is how we humans feel about living and working with these machines when
 i first met deep blue
 in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six in february  i had been the world champion for more than ten years  
 and i had played one hundred
  world championship games and hundreds of games against other top players in other competitions i knew what to
 expect from my opponents
 and what to expect from myself  i was used to measure their
 moves and to gauge their emotional state by watching their body language
  and then i sat across the chessboard from deep blue  
 i immediately sensed something new  something unsettling 
 you might experience a similar feeling
 the first time you ride in a driverless car or the first time your new computer manager issues an order at work
  but when i sat at that first game i
 couldn 't be sure what
 is this thing capable of 
 technology can advance in leaps  and ibm had invested heavily  i lost that game  
 and i couldn 't help
  might it be invincible was my beloved game of chess over 
 these were human doubts human fears and the only thing i knew for sure was
 that my opponent deep blue had no such worries at all 
 i fought back
 after this devastating blow to win the first match  but the writing was on the wall
 i eventually lost to the machine but i didn 't suffer the fate of john henry who won
 but died with his hammer in his hand 
 it turned out that the world of chess still wanted to have a human chess champion 
 and even today when
  a free chess app on the
 latest mobile phone is stronger than deep blue  people are still playing chess even
 more than ever before 
 doomsayers predicted that nobody would touch the game that could be conquered by the machine and they were wrong  proven wrong  
 but doomsaying has always been
 a popular pastime when it comes to technology
 i learned from my own experience
 is that we must face our fears if we want to get
 the most out of our technology  and we must conquer those fears if we want to get the best
 out of our
  of inspiration from my battles against deep blue as the old russian saying goes if you can 't beat them join them  
 then i thought 
 what if i could play with a computer together with a computer at my side  combining our strengths 
 human intuition plus machine 's calculation human strategy
  tactics  human experience machine 's memory could it be the perfect game ever played my idea came to life
 in 
  the name of advanced chess when i played  this human plus machine competition against
 another elite player  but in this first experiment  we both failed
 to
 combine human and machine skills effectively 
 advanced chess found its home on the internet  
 and in two thousand and five  a so called freestyle chess tournament
 produced a revelation a
 team of grandmasters and top machines participated  but the winners were not grandmasters
 not a supercomputer  
 the winners were a pair of amateur american chess players operating three ordinary pcs at the same time 
 their skill of coaching their machines effectively counteracted counteracted
 the superior chess knowledge of their grandmaster opponents and much greater
  computational power of others  
 and i reached this formulation 
 a weak human player plus a machine plus a better process is superior
 to a very powerful machine alone  but more remarkably is superior to a strong human player
 plus machine and
 an inferior
  process 
 this convinced me that we would need
 better interfaces to help us coach our machines towards more useful intelligence  
 human plus machine isn 't the future it 's the present  everybody that 's used
 online translation to get the gist
 of a news article from a foreign newspaper  knowing its far from perfect 
 then we use our human experience to make sense out of that and then the machine learns from our corrections 
 this model is spreading and investing in medical diagnosis security analysis 
 the machine crunches
  eighty percent of the way ninety percent  making it
 easier for analysis and decision making of the human party but
 you are not going to
 send your kids to school in a self driving car with ninety percent accuracy  even with
  so we need a leap forward to add a few more
 crucial decimal places  
 twenty years after
 my match with deep blue  second match this sensational the brain 's last stand 
 headline has become commonplace as
  machines move
 in every sector  seemingly every day  
 but unlike in the past when machines replaced
 farm animals  manual labor now they are coming after people with college degrees and political influence and
 as someone who fought machines and lost i am here to tell you this is excellent
  excellent news 
 eventually every profession will have to feel these pressures
 or else it will mean humanity has ceased to make
 progress we don 't get to choose
 when and where technological progress stops
  we cannot slow down in fact  we have to speed up 
 our technology excels at removing
 difficulties and uncertainties from our lives  
 and so we must seek out
  ever more difficult ever more uncertain challenges 
 machines have
 calculations  we have understanding machines have instructions 
  should not worry
 about what our machines can do today  instead  we should worry about what they still cannot do today  because we
 will need the help
  intelligent machines to turn our
 grandest dreams into reality  and if we fail  if we fail  it 's not because our machines
 are too intelligent or not intelligent enough if we fail it 's because we grew complacent
 and limited our ambitions our humanity is not defined by any skill 
 like swinging a hammer or
  even playing chess there 's one thing only a human can do that 's dream  so let us dream big
