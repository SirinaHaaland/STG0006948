  my father told me a story about an 18th century watchmaker and what this guy had done he used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches and
  of his customers came into his workshop and asked him to clean the watch that he 'd bought and the guy took it apart  and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels  
 and as he did so his customer noticed that on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving 
 were words 
 and he said to the guy why have you put
 stuff on the back that no one will ever see and the watchmaker turned around
  god can see it 
 now i 'm not in the least bit religious neither was my father but at that point i noticed something happening here  
 i felt something in this plexus of
 blood vessels and nerves and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere i guess but
 i felt something and it was a physiological response  and from that point on from my
  i began to think of things in a different way and as i took on my career as a designer  i began to ask myself the simple question do we actually think beauty 
 or do we feel it  now you probably know the answer to this already you probably think well i don 't know which one you think it is  but i think it 's about feeling beauty  
 and
 so i then moved on into my design career and
  to find some exciting things one of the most
 early work was done in automotive design some very exciting work was done there 
 and during a lot of this work we found something or i found something that really fascinated me 
 and maybe you can remember it do you remember when lights used to just go on and off click click when you closed the door in a car and then somebody i think it was bmw introduced a light that went out
 slowly 
  i remember it clearly do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that 
 i remember sitting there thinking  this is fantastic in fact i 've never found anybody that doesn 't like the light that goes out slowly  
 i thought well what the hell 's that about so i started to ask myself questions about it  and the first was i 'd ask other people do you like it
 of how this actually works  and so i did some experiments  and i suddenly realized that there was something that did exactly that
 light to dark in six seconds
 exactly that do you know what it is anyone 
 you see using this bit the thinky bit  the slow bit of the brain using that and this isn 't a think it 's a feel and would you do me a favor for the next fourteen minutes or whatever it is
  you feel stuff i don 't need you to think so much as i want you to feel it i felt
 a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation  and that thing that i found
 was the cinema or the theater it 's actually just happened here light to dark
  that 's fantastic i 'm looking forward to it i get a sense of anticipation 
 now i 'm not a neuroscientist i don 't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex  but it might be because the people i speak to in the northern hemisphere that used to go in the cinema get this and some of the people i speak to that have never seen a movie or been to
  don 't get it in the same way  everybody likes it  but some like it more than others  
 so this leads me to think of this in a different way we 're not feeling it we 're thinking beauty is in the limbic system if that 's not an outmoded idea 
 these are the bits the pleasure centers  and maybe what i 'm seeing and sensing and feeling is bypassing my thinking  the wiring from your sensory apparatus to those
 bits is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit the cortex they arrive first 
 so how do we make that actually work and how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know or what we 're going to learn about something 
 this is one of the most beautiful things i know 
 it 's a plastic bag and when i looked at it first i thought  no there 's no beauty in that then i found out 
 post exposure  that this plastic bag if i put it into a filthy puddle or a stream filled with
  coliforms and all sorts of disgusting stuff 
 that that filthy water will migrate through the  wall of the bag by osmosis and end up inside it as pure  potable
 drinking water and all of a sudden this plastic bag was extremely beautiful to me  
 now i 'm going to ask you again to switch on the emotional bit would you mind taking the brain out and i just want you to feel something
  look at that  what are you feeling about it 
 is it beautiful is it exciting i 'm watching your faces very carefully there
 's some rather bored looking gentlemen and some slightly engaged looking ladies
 who are picking up something off that maybe there 's an innocence to it now i 'm going to tell you what it is are you ready  this is the last act on this earth
 of a little girl called heidi
  five years old 
 before she died of cancer to the spine  it 's the last thing she did the last physical act look at that picture  
 look at the innocence look at the beauty in it is it beautiful now stop  stop how do you feel where are you feeling this i 'm feeling it
  i feel it here  and i 'm watching your faces because your faces are telling me something the lady over there is actually crying by the way  but
 what are you doing  
 i watch what people do  i watch faces i watch reactions  
 because i have to know how people react to things  and one of the most common faces on something
 faced with beauty something stupefyingly delicious is what i call the omg and by the way
 's no pleasure in that face it 's not a this is wonderful the eyebrows are doing this the eyes are defocused and the mouth
 is hanging open that 's not the expression of joy there
 's something else in that there 's something weird happening so pleasure seems to be tempered by a whole series of different things coming in poignancy is a word i love as a designer  it means something triggering a big emotional
  response  often quite a sad emotional response but it 's part
 of what we do it isn 't just about nice  and this is the dilemma  this is the paradox of beauty sensorily we 're taking in all sorts of things mixtures of things that are good bad exciting frightening
 to come up with that sensorial
 exposure that sensation of what 's going on pathos appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl 's drawing
 and also triumph  this sense of transcendence this 
 i never knew that ah this is something new and that 's packed in there as well  and as we assemble these tools  from a design point of view i get terribly excited about it 
 because these are things as we 've already said they 're arriving at the brain it would seem before cognition before we can manipulate them
 electrochemical party tricks now
 what i 'm also interested in is is it possible to separate intrinsic and extrinsic beauty by that i mean
 intrinsically beautiful things just something that 's exquisitely beautiful that 's universally beautiful 
 very hard to find maybe you 've got some examples of it  very hard to find something that to everybody is a very beautiful thing without a certain amount of information packed in there before 
 so a lot of it tends to be extrinsic
  it 's mediated by information before the comprehension or the information 's added on at the back like that little girl 's drawing that i showed you 
 now when talking about beauty
 you can 't get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces and what have you and one of the most tedious
 saying that beauty was about symmetry well it obviously isn 't this is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people and then to add them into a list of most beautiful 
  to least beautiful and then exposing a full face  and they found that it was almost exact
  pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this  and tried to understand what the individual elements were but feeling it as i go now i can feel a sensation of delight and beauty if i look at that eye i
 'm not getting it off the eyebrow  and the earhole isn 't doing it to me at all so i don
 't know how much this is helping me  but it 's helping to guide me to the places where the signals are coming off
  how i can start to assemble things that will very quickly bypass this this thinking part and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements 
 anais nin and the talmud have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are but as we are 
 so i 'm going to shamelessly expose something to you which is beautiful to me
  i can 't express to you how exquisite this object is but i also know why it 's exquisite to me  
 because it 's a palimpsest of things it
 's masses and masses of layers this is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension it 's something much bigger layer after layer of
  if i just go through some of them now i know about laminar flow when it comes to air piercing objects and that does it consummately well you can see it can so that 's getting me excited  and i feel that here
 this bit  the big secret of automotive design reflection management it 's not about the shapes it 's how the shapes reflect light 
 now that thing light flickers across it as you move  so it becomes a kinetic object even though it 's standing still
  managed by how brilliantly that 's done on the reflection  
 this little relief on the footplate by the way to a rider means there 's something going on underneath it in this case a drive chain running at three hundred miles and hour probably taking the power from the engine i 'm getting 
  terribly excited as my mind and my eyes flick across these things  titanium lacquer
  can 't tell you how wonderful this is 
 that 's how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel i 'm really getting into this now and of course a racing bike doesn 't have a prop stand but this one  because it 's a road bike it all goes away and it folds into this little gap  
 so it disappears  and then i can 't tell you how hard it is to do that radiator which is curved why would you do that  because i know we need to bring the wheel
  the aerodynamics so it 's more expensive but it 's wonderful  and to cap it all brand royalty
 agusta count agusta  from the great histories of this stuff  the bit that you can 't see is the genius that created this  massimo tamburini 
 they call him the plumber in italy 
 as well as maestro because he actually is engineer and craftsman and sculptor at the same time there 's so little compromise on this you can 't see it
  likes of me and people that are like me have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty
 we have to deal with it so i have to work with a supply chain and i 've got to work with the technologies and i 've got to work with everything else all the time and so compromises start to fit into it  and so look at her i 've had
 to make a bit of a compromise there i 've had to move that part across but only a millimeter  no one 's noticed have they yet did you see what i did
  i moved three things by a millimeter  pretty  yes beautiful maybe lesser  but then 
  the consumer says that doesn 't really matter  so that 's okay isn 't it  another millimeter  
 no one 's going to notice those split lines and changes  it 's that easy to lose beauty because beauty 's incredibly difficult
 to do and only a few people can do it and a focus group
 cannot do it  
 and a team rarely can do it  it takes a central cortex if you like to be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time  
 this is a beautiful water bottle some of you know of it done by ross lovegrove the designer  
 this is pretty close to intrinsic beauty this one as long as you know what water is like then you can experience this it 's lovely because it is an embodiment of
  something refreshing and delicious  i might like it more than you like it  because i know how bloody hard it is to do it  it 's stupefyingly difficult
 to make something that refracts light like that 
 that comes out of the tool correctly that goes down the line without falling over underneath this like the story of the swan is a million things very difficult
  to do so all hail to that  it 's a fantastic
 example a simple object  and the one i showed you before was of course a massively complex one  and they 're working
 in beauty in slightly different ways because of it  
 you all i guess like me enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance and part of the joy of it is you know the difficulty you also may be taking into account the fact that it 's incredibly painful anybody seen a ballet dancer 's toes when they come out of the points  
 while she 's doing these graceful arabesques
 plies and what have you something horrible 's going on down here  
 the comprehension of it leads us to a greater and heightened sense of the beauty of what 's actually going on 
 now i 'm using microseconds wrongly here so please ignore me  
 but what i have to do now feeling again what i 've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes of these triggers into something early on in the process that you pick it up not through your thinking
  but through your feeling so we 're going to have a little experiment right are you ready i 'm going to show you something for a very very brief moment are you ready 
 okay did you think that was a bicycle when i showed it to you at the first flash  it 's not tell
 me something did you think it was quick when you first saw it yes you did did you think it was modern yes you did that
  shot into you before that and because your brain starter motor began there now it 's got to deal with it  
 and the great thing is this motorcycle has been styled this way specifically to engender a sense that it 's green technology and it 's good for you and it 's light and it 's all part of the future 
 so is that wrong  well in this case it isn 't because it 's a very very
  of technology but you 're a slave of that first flash we are slaves to the first few fractions
  of a second and that 's where much of my work has to win or lose on a shelf
 in a shop 
 it wins or loses at that point you may see fifty one hundred two hundred things on a shelf as you walk down it  
 but i have to work within that domain to ensure that it gets you there
 first and finally the layer that i love of knowledge some of you i 'm sure will be familiar with this  what 's
  about this and the way i love to come back to it is this is taking something that you hate
 or bores you folding clothes and if you can actually do this who can actually do this anybody try to do this yeah it
 's fantastic isn 't it  look at that do you want to see it again no time it says i have two minutes left so we can 't do this 
  that 's how underpaid younger aged people have to fold your t shirt you didn 't maybe know it but how do you feel about it  
 it feels fantastic when you do it you look forward to doing it and when you tell somebody else about it like you probably have
 you look really smart the knowledge bubble that sits around the outside 
 the stuff that costs nothing because that knowledge is free
 bundle that together and where do we come out  form follows function  only sometimes
  only sometimes  
 form is function 
 form is function it informs it tells us it supplies us answers before we 've even thought about it and so i 've stopped using words like form and
 i 've stopped using words like function as a designer what i try to pursue now
 is the emotional functionality of things because if i can get that
  i can make them wonderful and i can make them repeatedly wonderful and you know what those products and services are because you own some of them they
 're the things that you 'd snatch if the house was on fire  forming the emotional bond
 between this thing and you
 is an electrochemical party trick that happens before you even think about it thank you
