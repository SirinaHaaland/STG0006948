  there 's something about caves
 a shadowy opening in a limestone cliff that draws you in 
 as you pass through the portal between light and dark you enter a subterranean world
 a place of perpetual gloom
 of earthy smells of hushed silence 
 long ago in europe  ancient people also entered these underground worlds 
 as witness to their passage they left behind mysterious engravings and paintings like this panel of humans triangles and zigzags
 from ojo guarea in spain you now walk the same path as these early artists
 and in this surreal  otherworldly place 
 it 's almost possible to imagine that you hear the muffled footfall of skin boots on soft earth 
 or that you see the flickering of a torch around the next bend  
 when i 'm in a cave i often find myself wondering
 what drove these people to go so deep to brave dangerous and narrow passageways to leave their mark
 in this video clip that was shot half a kilometer or about a third of a mile underground in the cave of cudon in spain 
 we found a series of red paintings on a ceiling in a previously unexplored section of the cave as we crawled forward 
 with the ceiling getting ever lower we finally got to a point where the ceiling was so low that my husband and project photographer dylan could no longer achieve focus on the
  ceiling with his dslr camera 
 so while he filmed me 
 i kept following the trail of red paint with a single light and a  point and shoot camera that we kept for that type of occasion 
 half a kilometer underground  seriously  what was somebody doing down there with a torch or a stone lamp
  you know this is the kind of question that i 'm trying to answer with my research i study some of the oldest art in the world 
 it was created by these early artists in europe between ten thousand and forty thousand years ago  
 and the thing is is that i 'm not just studying it because it 's beautiful though some of it certainly is  but what i 'm
  interested in
 is the development of the modern mind of the evolution of creativity of imagination of abstract thought 
 about what it means to be human 
 while all species communicate in one way or another only we humans have really taken it to another level 
 our desire and ability to share and collaborate has been a huge part of our success story 
 our modern world is based on a global network of information exchange
  made possible in large part by our ability to communicate
 in particular  using graphic or written forms of communication  
 the thing is though that we 've been building on the mental achievements of those that came before us for so long
 that it 's easy to forget that certain abilities haven 't already existed it 's one of the things i find most fascinating about studying our deep history
 those people didn 't have the shoulders of any giants to stand on they were the original shoulders  
 and while a surprising number of important inventions come out of that distant time 
 what i want to talk to you about today is the invention of graphic communication 
 there are three main types of communication  spoken gestural so things like sign language
 and graphic communication
 spoken and gestural are by their very nature ephemeral  it requires close contact for a message to be sent and received  
 and after the moment of transmission it 's gone forever 
 graphic communication on the other hand  decouples that relationship and with its invention it became possible for the first time
 for a message to be transmitted and preserved beyond a single moment in place
  and time europe is one of the first places that we start to see graphic marks regularly appearing in caves rock shelters
 and even a few surviving open air sites  
 but this is not the europe we know today 
 this was a world dominated by towering ice sheets three to four kilometers high with sweeping grass plains and frozen tundra 
 this was the ice age
  over the last century more than three hundred and fifty ice age rock art sites have been found across the continent 
 decorated with animals abstract shapes and even the occasional human like these engraved figures from grotta dell 'addaura in sicily  
 they provide us with a rare glimpse into the creative world and imagination of these early
  since their discovery it 's been the animals that have received the majority of the study
 like this black horse from cullalvera in spain  or this unusual purple bison from la  pasiega 
 but for me it was the abstract shapes what we call geometric signs that drew me to study the art 
 the funny this is that at most sites the geometric signs far outnumber the animal and human images
  but when i started on this back in two thousand and seven 
 there wasn 't even a definitive list of how many shapes there were 
 nor was there a strong sense of whether the same ones appeared across space or time  
 before i could even get started on my questions 
 my first step was to compile a database of all known geometric signs from all of the rock art sites the problem was that while they were
 well documented at some sites  usually the ones with the very nice animals there was also a large number of them
 where it was very vague there wasn 't a lot of description or detail some of them hadn 't been visited in half a century or more 
 these were the ones that i targeted for my field work 
 over the course of two years my faithful husband dylan
  in france spain portugal and sicily  
 and it was totally worth it we found new  undocumented geometric signs at seventy five percent of the sites we visited 
 this is the level of accuracy i knew i was going to need if i wanted to start answering those larger questions
  time span and the entire continent of europe that is a very small number 
 now if these were random doodles or decorations we would expect to see a lot more variation  
 but instead what we find are the same signs repeating across both space and time 
 some signs start out
  strong before losing popularity and vanishing while other signs are later inventions 
 but sixty five percent of those signs stayed in use during that entire time period
 things like lines rectangles triangles ovals and circles like we see here from the end of the ice age at a 10 000 year old site high in the pyrenees
  and while certain signs span thousands of kilometers 
 other signs had much more restricted distribution patterns 
 with some being limited to a single territory like we see here with these divided rectangles that are only found in northern spain  
 and which some researchers have speculated could be some sort of family or clan signs 
 on a side note there is surprising degree of similarity in the earliest rock art found
  all the way from france and spain to indonesia and australia with many of the same signs appearing in such far flung places
 especially in that thirty thousand to 40 000 year range it 's starting to seem increasingly likely
 that this invention actually traces back to a common point of origin in africa  but that i 'm afraid is a subject for a future talk so back to the matter at hand  
 there could be no doubt
  in france we might not know what they meant  but the people of the time certainly did  
 the repetition of the same signs for so long and at so many sites
 tells us that the artists were making intentional choices  if we 're talking about
  than we could very well be looking at one of the oldest systems of graphic communication in the world 
 i 'm not talking about writing yet 
 there 's just not enough characters at this point to have represented all of the words in the spoken language something which is a requirement for a full writing system  
 nor do we see the signs repeating regularly enough to suggest that they were some sort of alphabet  
 but what we do have are some intriguing
 like this panel from la pasiega in spain  known as the inscription 
 with its symmetrical markings on the left possible stylized representations of hands in the middle and what looks a bit like a bracket on the right  
 the oldest systems of graphic communication in the world
 sumerian cuneiform egyptian hieroglyphs the earliest chinese script all emerged between four thousand and five thousand years ago
 with each coming into existence from an earlier protosystem made up of counting marks and pictographic representations where the meaning and the image were the same 
 so a picture of a bird would really have represented that animal it
 's only later that we start to see these pictographs become more stylized until they almost become unrecognizable
 and that we also start to see more symbols being invented to represent all those
  other missing words in language things like pronouns adverbs adjectives 
 so knowing all this it seems highly unlikely that the geometric signs from ice age europe were truly abstract written characters  
 instead what 's much more likely
 is that these early artists were also making counting marks maybe like this row of lines from
  representations of things from the world around them 
 could some of the signs be weaponry or housing or what about celestial objects like star constellations 
 or maybe even rivers mountains trees landscape features  possibly like this black penniform surrounded by strange  bell shaped signs from the site
  but could this actually be a depiction of a plant or a tree 
 some researchers have begun to ask these questions about certain signs at specific sites  
 but i believe the time has come to revisit this category as a whole 
 the irony in all of this of course is that having just carefully classified all of the signs into a single category i have a feeling that my next step will involve breaking it back apart
 as different types of imagery are identified and separated off 
 now don 't get me wrong the later creation of fully developed writing was an impressive feat in its own right  
 but it 's important to remember that those early writing systems didn 't come out of a vacuum and that even five thousand years ago people were already building on something much older
  with its origins stretching back tens of thousands of years
 to the geometric signs of ice age europe and far beyond 
 to that point deep in our collective history  when someone first came up with the idea of making a graphic mark  
 and forever changed the nature of how we communicate
