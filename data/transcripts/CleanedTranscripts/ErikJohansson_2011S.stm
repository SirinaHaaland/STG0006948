  i 'm here to to share my photography  or
 is it photography  because of course this is a photograph that you can 't take with your camera  
 yet my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of fifteen
  it mixed with my earlier passion for drawing  but it was a bit different because
 using the camera the process was in the planning instead and
 when you take a photograph with a with a camera  the process ends when you press the trigger  
 so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place
  i felt like anyone could do that  so i wanted to create something different something where the process starts when you press the trigger  
 photos like this 
 construction going on along a busy road  
 but it has an unexpected twist  and despite that it retains a level of realism  
 or photos like these
 both dark and colorful
  but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism when i say realism  i mean  photo realism because of course  
 it 's not something you can capture really  but
 i always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick 
 so it 's more about capturing
  idea than about capturing a moment really
  but what 's the trick that makes it look realistic  is it something about the details or the colors 
 is it something about the light  
 what creates the illusion  
 sometimes the
 perspective is the illusion  but in the end it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two dimensional surface 
 it 's not really what is realistic it 's what we think looks realistic really  
 so i think the basics are quite simple 
 i just see it as a puzzle of reality
 where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate
  and let me show you a simple example 
 here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects something we all can relate to living in a  three dimensional world  
 but combined in a certain way  
 they can create something that still looks three dimensional 
 like it could exist  
 but at the same time we know it can 't so we trick our brains because our brain simply doesn 't accept the fact that it doesn 't really make sense
  and
 i see the same process with combining photographs it 's just really about combining different realities  so
 the things that make a photograph look realistic  i think it 's the things that we don 't even think about the things
 all around us in our daily lives  but when combining photographs  this is really important to consider
  otherwise it just looks wrong somehow  so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result 
 as you can see these images aren 't really special  but
 combined they can create something like this
  so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective
  photos combined should have the same type of light  
 and these two images both fulfill these two requirements shot at the same height and in the same type of light  
 the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end
 by making it seamless make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed
  matching color contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images adding photographic defects like
 depth of field desaturated colors and noise 
 we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers
  one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what 's manipulated 
 but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations 
 i personally think that it 's easier to actually create a place than to find a place because then
  need to compromise with the ideas in your head  but it does require a lot of planning  
 and getting this idea during winter i knew that i had several months to plan it to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically  
 so for example the fish was captured on a fishing trip  
 the shores are from a different location the underwater part was captured in a stone pit  and
 yeah i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swedish
 so to achieve a realistic result i think it comes down to planning it always starts with a sketch an idea 
 then it 's about combining the different photographs  and here
 every piece is very well planned  and if you do a good job capturing the photos the result can be quite beautiful
 and also quite realistic
  so all the tools are out there and the only thing that limits us
 is our imagination
