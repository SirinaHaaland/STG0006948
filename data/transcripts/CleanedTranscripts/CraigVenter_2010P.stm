  we 're here today to announce the first synthetic cell a cell made by
 starting with the digital code in the computer  building the chromosome
 from four bottles of chemicals  assembling that chromosome
  in yeast  transplanting it into a recipient bacterial cell and transforming that cell into a new bacterial species
 so
 this is the first self replicating species that we 've had on the planet
 whose parent is a computer  it also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its
  genetic code
 but we 'll talk more about the watermarks in a minute this is a project that had its inception fifteen years ago
 when our team then we called the institute tigr
 was involved in sequencing the first two genomes in history we did haemophilus influenzae and then
 the smallest genome of a self replicating organism that of mycoplasma genitalium
 and as soon as we had these two sequences
 we thought if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self replicating species could there be even a smaller genome could we understand
 the basis of cellular life at the genetic level  
 it 's been a 15 year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions 
 because it 's very difficult
  to eliminate multiple genes from a cell you can only do them one at a time  
 we decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route 
 even though nobody had been there before to see if we could synthesize a bacterial chromosome so we could actually vary the gene content
 to understand the essential genes for
  to get here but before we did the first experiments  we actually asked
 art caplan 's team at the university of pennsylvania
 to undertake a review of what the risks the challenges the ethics around creating new
 species in the laboratory were because it hadn 't been done before they spent about two years
 reviewing that independently and published their
  results in science in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine ham and i took two years off as a side project to sequence the human genome but as soon as that was done
 we got back
 to the task at hand 
 in two thousand and two we started a new institute
  the institute for biological energy alternatives where we set out two goals one to understand
 the impact of our technology on the
  environment  and how to understand the environment better and two to start down this process
 of making synthetic life to understand basic life 
 in two thousand and three we published our first success  so ham smith and clyde hutchison
 developed some new methods
  at a small level our first task was a 
  a virus that attacks only e coli  so that was the
 the phage phi x one hundred and seventy four which was chosen for historical reasons it was the first
 dna phage  dna virus dna genome that was actually sequenced  so once we realized that we
  could make
  pair viral sized pieces we thought we at least have the means then to try and make serially lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assemble them together
 to make this mega base chromosome so substantially larger than we even thought we would go
  there were several steps to this there were two sides we had to solve the chemistry for making large dna molecules  
 and we had to solve the biological side of how if we had this new chemical entity how would we boot it up activate it
 in a recipient cell  we had two teams working in parallel one team on the chemistry and the other
  on trying to
 be able to transplant entire chromosomes
 to get new cells
  when we started this out we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem which is why we chose the smallest genome  
 and some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome to a much larger one  and we can walk through the reasons for that but basically
 the the small cell took
 on the order of one to two months to get results
  from whereas the larger faster growing cell takes only two days  so there 's only so many cycles we could go through
 in a year at six weeks per cycle  and you should know that basically ninety nine probably ninety nine percent plus of our experiments failed  
 so this was a debugging
  scenario from the beginning because there was no recipe
 of how to get there so one of the most important publications we had was in two thousand and seven carole lartigue
 led the effort
 to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another  i think philosophically that was one of the most important papers that we 've ever
 done because it showed how dynamic life was and we knew once that worked that we actually had a chance
  chance
 if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those 
 we didn 't know that it was going to take us several years more to get there in two thousand and eight we reported the complete synthesis
 of the mycoplasma genitalium genome a little over five hundred thousand letters of genetic code
  but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome we think in part because of its its slow growth
 and in part  cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms
 to keep these events from happening 
 it turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into had a nuclease an enzyme that chews up dna on its surface  and was happy to eat the synthetic dna that we gave it
  and never got transplantations
 but at the time  that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made 
 and so both sides were progressing  but part of the synthesis
 had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished using yeast putting the fragments in yeast and yeast would assemble these for us it 's an amazing
 step forward  but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast
  addition to doing the transplant we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it
 a recipient cell  so
 our team developed new techniques for actually growing cloning entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast so we took
  the same mycoides genome
 that carole had initially transplanted and we grew that in yeast as an artificial chromosome  
 and we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them 
 when we did these experiments though we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it wouldn 't transplant and boot up a cell 
 that little issue took the team two years to
  it turns out the dna in the bacterial cell was actually methylated and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme 
 from digesting the dna  so what we found is if we took the chromosome out of yeast and methylated it we could then transplant it 
 further advances came when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes from the
  recipient capricolum cell and once we had done that now we can take naked dna out of yeast and transplant it so
 last fall when we published the results of that work in science  
 we all became overconfident and were sure we were only a few weeks away
 from being able to now boot up a chromosome out of yeast because of the problems with
 mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth about a year and a half ago
  we decided to synthesize the much larger chromosome the mycoides chromosome  
 knowing that we had the biology worked out on that for transplantation
 and dan led the team for the synthesis of this over one million base pair chromosome
 but it turned out it wasn 't going to be as simple in the end and it set us back three months because we had one
  one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence  so the team developed new debugging software where we could test each synthetic fragment
 to see if it would grow in a background of
 wild type dna  and we found that ten out of the eleven 100 000 base pair pieces we
  narrowed it down to one fragment we sequenced it
 and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene 
 so accuracy is essential 
 there 's parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error 
 and then there 's parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of dna as we did with the
  watermarks
 and it can tolerate all kinds of errors  so it took about three months to find that error and repair it and then
 early one morning at six a m we got a text
 from dan saying that now the first blue colonies existed  so it 's been a long route to get here  fifteen years
 from the beginning we felt
 one of the tenets of this field was to
 make absolutely certain we could distinguish synthetic dna from natural dna 
 early on when you 're working in a new area of science you have to think about all the pitfalls
 and things that could lead you
 to believe that you had done something when you hadn 't and even worse leading others to believe it
  so we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule contamination of the native chromosome  
 leading us to believe that we actually had
 created a synthetic cell when it would have been just a contaminant  so early on we developed the notion
 of putting in watermarks in the dna to absolutely make
 clear that the dna was synthetic and the first chromosome we built in two thousand and eight the 
  pair one
 we simply assigned
 the names of the authors of the chromosome
 into the genetic code  but it was using just amino acid
 single letter translations  which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet
 so the team actually developed a new code
  within the code within the code
  so it 's a new code for interpreting and writing messages in dna 
 now mathematicians have been hiding and writing messages in the genetic code for a long time  
 but it 's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists
 because if you write long messages with
  the code that the mathematicians developed it would more than likely lead to new proteins being synthesized
 with unknown functions  
 so the code that mike montague and the team developed actually puts frequent stop codons so it 's a different alphabet
 but allows us to use the entire
 english alphabet with punctuation
  four major watermarks all over one thousand base pairs of genetic code the first one actually contains within it this code for interpreting
 the rest of the genetic code  so in the remaining
 remaining information in the watermarks contain the names of i think it 's forty six different
 authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage
 and we also built in a website
 address so that if somebody decodes the code within the code within the code they can send an email to that address so
 it 's clearly distinguishable from any other species 
 having forty six names in it
  own web address
 and we added three quotations  because
 with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound than than just signing the work so
 we won 't give the the rest of the code but we will give the three quotations the first is to live to err to fall to triumph
 and to recreate
  it 's a james joyce quote  
 the second quotation is see things not as they are  but as they might be 
 it 's a quote from the american prometheus book on robert oppenheimer  
 and the last one is a richard feynman quote what i cannot build i cannot understand
  science  we tried to deal with both the philosophical and the technical side 
 the last thing i want to say before turning it over to questions is that the extensive work
 that we 've done asking for ethical review  pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side
 this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community in the policy community
 and at the highest levels of the federal government
 even with
 this announcement as we did in two thousand and three that work was funded by the department of energy  so the work was reviewed
 at the level of the white house  trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it and they came down on the side of
  which is the right approach
 we 've
 briefed the white house  we 've briefed members of congress  we 've tried to take and push the policy issues
 in parallel with the scientific advances
  so with that  i would like to open it first to the floor for questions  yes in the back
  can we explain how significant this is i 'm not sure we 're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is it 's significant to us 
 perhaps it 's a giant philosophical change in how we view life  
 we actually view it as a baby step in terms of it 's taken us fifteen years to be able to do the experiment we wanted to do fifteen years ago
 on understanding life at its basic level
 but we we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools
 and we 're already starting in numerous avenues
 to use this tool  we have at the institute ongoing funding now from nih
 in a program with novartis to try and use these new synthetic dna tools to perhaps make the
 flu vaccine that you might get next year because instead of taking weeks to months to make these 
 dan 's team can now make these in less than twenty four hours 
 so when you see how long it took to get an h1n1 vaccine out we think we can shorten that process
 quite substantially
  in the vaccine area synthetic genomics and the the institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines
 to diseases that haven 't been possible to date  things where the viruses rapidly evolve  such with rhinovirus wouldn
 't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds 
 or more importantly hiv where the virus evolves so quickly
 the vaccines that are made today can 't
 keep up with those
  evolutionary changes
 also at synthetic genomics  we 've been working on major environmental issues i think
 this latest oil spill in the gulf is a is a reminder we can 't see see co2 we depend on scientific measurements for it
 and we see the beginning results of having too much of it
 but we can see pre co2 now floating on the waters and
  contaminating the beaches in the gulf we need some alternatives
 for oil  we have a program with exxon mobile to try and develop new strains of algae
 that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries
 to make normal gasoline and diesel fuel out of co2 those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we 're taking
