  grandson sleeps just down the hall from me and he wakes up a lot of mornings and he says you know this could be the best day ever 
 and other times in the middle of the night he calls
 calls out in a tremulous voice nana will you ever get sick and die 
 i think this pretty much says it for me and most of the people i know that we 're a mixed grill of happy anticipation and dread  
 so i sat down a few days before my 61st birthday  
 and i decided to compile a list of everything i know for sure  
  so little truth in the popular culture and it 's good to be sure of a few things for instance i am no longer 
 although this is the age i feel and the age i like to think of myself as being 
 my friend paul used to say in his late 70s that he felt like a young man with something really wrong with him 
 our true person is outside of time and space
  looking at the paperwork i can in fact see that i was born in 
 my inside self is outside of time and space it doesn 't have an age i 'm every age i 've ever been and so are you  although i can 't help 
  mentioning as an aside that it might have been helpful if i hadn 't followed the skin care
  which involved getting as much sun as possible while slathered in baby oil
 and basking in the glow of a tinfoil reflector shield 
 it was so liberating though to face the truth that i was no longer in the last throes of middle age that i decided to write down every single true thing i know 
 people feel really doomed and overwhelmed these days and they keep asking me what 's true
  so i hope that my list of things i 'm almost positive about
 might offer some basic operating instructions to anyone who is feeling really overwhelmed or beleaguered  
 number one 
 the first and truest thing is that all truth is a paradox life is both a precious unfathomably beautiful gift and it 's impossible
  here on the incarnational side of things  it 's been a very bad match for those of us who were born extremely sensitive  
 it 's so hard and weird that we sometimes wonder if we 're being punked
  it 's filled simultaneously with heartbreaking sweetness and beauty  desperate
  floods and babies and acne and mozart all swirled together i don 't think it 's an ideal system 
 laughter number two almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes
  outside of you that will help in any kind of lasting way  unless you 're waiting for an organ
  you can 't buy achieve or date serenity and peace of mind this is the most horrible truth and i so resent it
 but it 's an inside job  and we can 't arrange peace
 peace or lasting improvement for the people we love most in the world they have to find their own ways their own answers  you can 't run alongside your grown 
  children with sunscreen and chapstick on their hero 's journey you have to release
  our help is usually not very helpful our help is often toxic and help is the sunny side of control  
 stop helping so much 
 don 't get your help and goodness all over everybody 
 this brings us to number four  
  everyone is screwed up broken clingy and scared  even the people who seem to have it most together  they are much more like you than you would believe  so try not to compare your insides to other people 's outsides
  it will only make you worse than you already are 
 also you can 't save fix or rescue any of them or get anyone sober 
 what helped me get clean and sober thirty years ago was the
  catastrophe of my behavior and thinking  
 so i asked some sober friends for help and i turned to a higher power one acronym for god is the gift of desperation
 or as a sober friend put it by the end i was deteriorating faster than i could lower my standards
  so god might mean in this case me running out of any more good ideas 
 while fixing and saving and trying to rescue is futile  radical 
 is quantum  and it radiates out from you into the atmosphere like a little fresh air
  it 's a huge gift to the world 
 when people respond by saying well isn 't she full of herself just smile obliquely like mona lisa and make both of you a nice cup of tea
 being full of affection for one 's goofy 
 cranky  annoying self is home  it 's where world peace begins
  percent cacao is not actually a food 
 laughter its best use is as a bait in snake traps
 or to balance the legs of wobbly chairs  it was never meant to be considered an edible
  every writer you know writes really terrible first drafts  but they keep their butt in the chair that 's the secret of life that 's probably the main difference between you and them  they just do it  they do it by 
  with themselves they do it as a
  they tell stories that come through them one day at a time little by little 
 when my older brother was in fourth grade he had a term paper on birds due the next day and he he hadn 't started 
 so my dad sat down with him with an audubon book paper  pencils and brads for those of you
 who have gotten a little
  he said to my brother just take it bird by bird buddy 
 just read about pelicans and then write about pelicans in your own voice  and then
 find out about chickadees and tell us about them in your own voice  and then geese 
 so the two most important things about writing are bird by bird and really
  you don 't know where to start remember that every single thing that happened to you is yours and you get to tell it 
 if people wanted you to write more warmly about them  they should 've behaved better 
 you 're going to feel like hell if you wake up someday and you never wrote the stuff that is tugging on the
  sleeves of your heart your stories memories visions and songs your truth your version of things in your own voice  that 's really all you have to offer us 
 and that 's also why you were born  
 seven publication and temporary creative successes are something you have to recover from they
  kill as many people as not they will hurt damage and change you in ways you cannot imagine 
 the most degraded and evil people i 've ever known are male writers who 've had huge best sellers
  and yet returning to number one that all truth is paradox it 's also a miracle to get your work published to get your stories read and heard just try
  to bust yourself gently of the fantasy that publication will heal you that it will fill the 
  holes inside of you it can 't 
 it won 't 
 but writing can so can singing in a choir or a bluegrass band
  so can painting community murals or birding or fostering old dogs that no one else will
  number eight  families  
 families are hard hard hard 
 no matter how cherished and astonishing they may also be again see number one 
 at family gatherings where you suddenly feel homicidal or suicidal 
 remember that in all cases  it 's a miracle that any of us
  specifically were conceived and born
  earth is forgiveness school it begins with forgiving yourself and then you might as well start at the dinner table 
 that way you can do this work in comfortable pants 
 when william blake said that we are here to learn to endure the beams of love he knew that your family would be an
  intimate part of this even as you want to run screaming for your cute little life  
 but i promise you are up to it  you can do it cinderella you can do it
  and you will be amazed  
 nine food try to do a little
  or water wings the mystery of grace is that god loves henry kissinger and vladimir putin and me
 exactly as much as he or she loves your new grandchild  go figure 
 the movement of grace is what changes us heals us and heals our world 
 to summon grace say help and then buckle up grace finds you exactly where you are but it doesn 't leave you where it found you 
 and grace won 't look like casper the friendly
  ghost regrettably  
 but the phone will ring or the mail will come and then against all odds you 'll get your sense of humor about yourself back 
 laughter really is carbonated holiness
 it helps us breathe again and again and gives us back to ourselves and this gives us faith in life and each other 
 and remember grace
 always bats last  
 eleven 
 god just means goodness it 's really not all that scary  it means the divine or a loving animating intelligence or as we learned from the great
  happiest person on earth is the one who learns from nature the lessons of worship  
 so go outside a lot and look up 
 my pastor said you can trap bees on the bottom of mason jars without lids because they don 't look up  so they just walk around bitterly bumping into the glass walls  
  secret of life 
 and finally death 
 number twelve  
 wow and yikes  
 it 's so hard to bear when the few people you cannot live without die  
 you 'll never get over these losses  and no matter what the culture says you 're not supposed to 
 we christians like to think of death as a major
  but in any case the person will live again fully in your heart if you don 't seal it off 
 like leonard cohen said there are cracks in everything and that 's how the light gets in and that 's how we feel our people again fully alive
 also the people will make you laugh out loud at the most inconvenient
  and that 's the great good news  but their absence will also be a lifelong nightmare of homesickness for you 
 grief and friends time and tears will heal you to some extent 
 tears will bathe and baptize and hydrate and moisturize you and the ground on which you walk do
 you know the first thing that god says to moses 
 he says take off your shoes because this is holy ground all evidence to the contrary
  it 's hard to believe but it 's the truest thing i know  when you 're a little bit older like my tiny personal self
  you realize that death is as sacred as birth  
 and don 't worry get on with your life 
 almost every single death is easy and gentle with the very best people surrounding you for as long as you need you
 won 't be alone
  they 'll help you cross over to whatever awaits us 
 as ram dass said when all is said and done we 're really just all walking each other home 
 i think that 's it  but if i think of anything else i 'll let you know  
  i was very surprised to be asked to come because it is
 not my realm technology or design or entertainment i mean my realm is sort of faith and writing and
 kind of lurching along together  and i was surprised but they said i i could give a talk
  yours and you get to tell
