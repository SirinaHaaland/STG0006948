  as technology progresses
 and as
 it advances many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent make us smarter and more connected to the world and what i 'd like to argue is that that 's not necessarily the case
  case as progress is simply a word for change and with change you gain something but you also lose something and to really illustrate this point what i 'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with
 a very simple a very common an everyday question and that question is this
 what time is it what time is it if you glance at your iphone it 's so simple to tell the time
 but i 'd like to ask you how would you tell the time if you didn 't have an iphone how would you tell the time say six hundred years ago how would you do it
 well the way you would do it is by using a device that 's called an astrolabe
 so an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today 's world but at the time in the thirteenth century it was the gadget of the day
  was the world 's first popular computer and it was a device that in fact is a model of the sky
 so the different parts of the astrolabe in this particular type the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars the plate corresponds to a a coordinate system and the mater has some scales and puts it all together
 if you were an educated child you would know how to not only use the astrolabe you would know
  to make an astrolabe and we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe the first technical manual in the english language was written by geoffrey chaucer yes that geoffrey chaucer in thirteen ninety one to his little lewis his eleven year old son
 and in this
 book little lewis would would know the big idea and the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic
  projection and basically the the concept is how do you
 represent the three dimensional image of the night sky that surrounds us onto a flat portable two dimensional surface
 the idea is actually relatively simple imagine that that earth is at the center of the universe and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole onto a flat surface where it is then
  recorded so the north star corresponds to the center of the device the ecliptic which is the path of the sun moon and planets correspond to an offset circle
 the bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete and the altitude corresponds to the plate system now the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection 
 the real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly
 there is the position of the sun moon and planets on the movable rete and then their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate
 okay so how would you use this
 this device
 well let me first back up for a moment
 this is an astrolabe
  pretty impressive isn 't it and so this astrolabe is on loan from us from the oxford school of museum of history and
 you can see the different components this is the mater the scales on the back
 this is the rete okay do you see that that 's the movable part of the of the sky and in the back you can see
 a spiderweb pattern and that spiderweb pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky
 this is a rule device and on the back are some other devices measuring tools and scales to be able to make some calculations okay
 you know i 've always wanted one of these for my thesis i actually built one of these out of paper and this one this is
  a replica from a fifteenth century device and it 's worth probably about three macbook pros but a real one would cost about as much as my house
 and the house next to it and actually every house on the block on both sides of the street maybe a school thrown in and some you know a church they are just incredibly expensive
 but but let me show you how to work this device
 so let 's go to step one
 first thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky if you 're telling time at night so tonight if it 's clear you
  to see the summer triangle and there is a bright star called deneb so let 's select deneb second is you measure the altitude of deneb so step two
 i hold the device up and then i sight
 its altitude there so i can see it clearly now and then i measure its altitude so it 's about twenty six
  see it from over there step three is identify the star on the front of the device deneb is there i can tell
 step four is i then move the rete move the sky so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back okay
 so when that happens
 everything lines up i have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky okay so it is in a sense holding
 a model of the universe in my hands and then finally i take a rule
 and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here right so that 's how the device is used
 so i know you 're thinking
 that 's a lot of work isn 't it isn 't it a ton of work to be able to to tell the time as you glance at your ipod to just check out the time but there is a difference
  between the two because with your ipod you can tell
 or your iphone you can tell exactly what the
 time is with precision the way little lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky he would know where things would fit in the sky he would not only know
 what time it was he would also know where the sun would rise and how it would move across the sky he would know
 what time the sun would rise and what time it would set
 and he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens so in computer graphics and computer
 user interface design there is a term called affordances
 so affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it and what the astrolabe does is it allows
  it affords us to connect to the night sky to look up into the night sky and be much more
 to see the visible and the invisible together so that 's just one use
 incredible
 there is probably three hundred and fifty four hundred uses in fact there is a text and that has over a thousand uses of this first computer on the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation 
 you can survey with it the city of baghdad was surveyed with it it can be used for calculating mathematical
  equations of all different types and it would take a full university course to illustrate it
 astrolabes have an incredible history they are over two thousand years old the concept of stereographic projection originated in three hundred and thirty b c and the astrolabes 
  come in many different sizes and shapes and forms there is portable ones there is large display ones and i think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful works of art there is a
  quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable
 astrolabes like every technology do evolve over time so the earliest retes for example were very simple and and primitive and advancing retes became cultural emblems this 
  is one from oxford and i find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical or
  random sky how cool is that this is just amazing so would little lewis have an astrolabe
 probably not one made of brass he would have one made out of wood or paper and and the vast majority of this first computer was a portable
 device that you could keep in the back back of your pocket
 so what does the astrolabe inspire well i think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were
 our forebears were years and years ago it 's an incredible device
 every technology advances every technology is transformed and moved by by others and and what we gain with a new technology of course is precision and accuracy but what we lose i think is accurate a felt sense of the sky a
  of context
 knowing the sky knowing your relationship with the sky is
 the center
 of the real answer to knowing what time it is
 so it 's i think astrolabes are just remarkable devices and so what can you learn from these these devices
 well primarily that
 there is a subtle knowledge that we can connect with the world and
 astrolabes return us to this subtle sense of how things all fit together
 and also how we connect to the world thanks very much
