  i 've been spending a lot of time traveling around the world these days talking to groups of students and professionals 
 and everywhere i 'm finding that i hear similar themes on the one hand people say the time for change
  they want to be part of it they talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning  
 but on the other hand i hear people talking about fear 
 a sense of risk aversion they say i really want to follow a life of purpose but i don 't know where to start  
 i don 't want to disappoint my family or friends 
 i work in global poverty  and they say i want to work in global poverty but what will it mean about my
  will i be marginalized will i not make enough money will i never get married or have children 
 and as a woman who didn 't get married until i was a lot older and i 'm glad i waited
 i look at these young people and i say your job is not to be perfect your job is only to be human and nothing important happens in life
  these conversations really reflect what 's happening at the national and international level our leaders
 and ourselves want everything but we don 't talk about the costs we don 't talk about the sacrifice one of my favorite quotes from literature
 was written by tillie olsen the great american writer from the south in a short story called oh yes she talks about a
  who has a daughter
 who befriends a little african american girl  and she looks at her child with a sense of pride  but she also wonders what price will she pay 
 better immersion than to live untouched 
 but the real question is what is the cost of not daring what is the cost of not trying 
 i 've been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives
  of immersion one woman i knew who was a fellow at a program that i ran at the rockefeller foundation
 was named ingrid washinawatok she was a leader of the menominee tribe a native american peoples  and when we would gather as fellows she would
 push us to think about how the elders in native american culture
  and she said they would literally visualize the faces of children for seven generations into the future  looking at them from the earth  
 and they would look at them holding them as stewards for that future 
 ingrid understood that we are connected to each other not only as human beings but to every living thing on the planet 
 and tragically in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine when she was in colombia working with the
  culture and language she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the farc  and whenever we would gather
 the fellows after that we would leave a chair empty for her spirit 
 and more than a decade later when i talk to ngo fellows whether in trenton new jersey or
 the office of the white house and we talk about ingrid they all say that
  're trying to integrate her wisdom and her spirit
 and really build on the unfulfilled work of her life 's mission  and when we think about legacy 
 i can think of no more powerful one  despite how short her life was  
 and i 've been touched
 by cambodian women beautiful women women who held the tradition of the classical dance in cambodia  and i met them in the early
  under the pol pot regime the khmer rouge killed over a million people 
 and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals the artists the dancers 
 and at the end of the war there were only thirty of these classical dancers still living 
 and the women who i was so privileged to meet when there were three survivors told these stories about lying in their cots in the refugee camps
 they said they would try so hard to remember the fragments
 of the dance hoping that others were alive and doing the same  and one woman stood there with this perfect carriage her hands at her side  
 and she talked about the reunion of the thirty
 after the war and how extraordinary it was and these big tears fell down her face but she never lifted her hands to move them and the women
  decided that they would train not the next generation of girls because they had grown too old already  but the next generation 
 and i sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands
 beautiful rhythms as these little fairy pixies
 were dancing around them wearing these beautiful silk colors and i thought after all this atrocity this is how human beings really pray
  because they 're focused on
 honoring what is most beautiful about our past
 and building it into the promise of our future  
 and what these women understood is sometimes the most important things that we do and that we spend our time on are those things that we cannot measure  
 i also have been touched by the dark side of power and
  leadership and i have learned that power particularly in its absolute form is an equal opportunity provider in one thousand 
 nine hundred and eighty six i moved to rwanda and i worked with a very small group of rwandan women to start that country 's first microfinance bank and one of the women was
 agnes there on your extreme left she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in rwanda and her legacy should have been
 to be one of the mothers
 of rwanda  we built this institution based on social justice gender equity this idea of empowering women  
 but agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end and though she had been part of building
 a liberal party a
 political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance 
 about three months before the genocide she switched parties and joined the extremist party  hutu power 
 and she became the minister of justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women 
 she was convicted
 of category one crimes of genocide  and i would visit her in the prisons
  i would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us  
 but that maybe it 's not monsters so much but the broken parts of ourselves  sadnesses  secret shame 
 and that ultimately it 's easy for demagogues to prey on those parts those fragments if you will 
 and to make us look at other beings human beings as lesser than ourselves
  and in the extreme to do terrible things  and there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations
 than young men i 've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male  
 and so in a gathering where we 're focused on women  while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field
  and we find ways to honor them we have to remember
 that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible
 in those very societies where our men and our boys
 feel disempowered  unable to provide  and that when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future
 is no job no education
  no possibility  well then it 's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from
 a uniform and a gun  
 sometimes very small investments can release enormous infinite potential that exists in all of us 
 one of the acumen fund fellows at my organization  suraj sudhakar has what we call moral imagination
 the ability to put yourself in another person 's shoes and
  lead from that perspective  
 and he 's been working with this young group of men who come from the largest slum in the world kibera and they 're incredible guys 
 and together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums  
 and they 're reading many ted authors and liking it and then they created a business plan competition
  they decided that they would do tedx 's and i have learned so much from chris and kevin and alex
 and herbert and all of these young men 
 alex in some ways said it best he said we used to feel like nobodies  but now we feel like somebodies and i think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link 
 what we really yearn for as human beings is to be visible to each other and the reason these young guys told me that they 're doing these tedx 's
 is because
 they were sick and tired of the only workshops coming to the slums being those workshops focused
 on hiv 
 or at best microfinance and they wanted to celebrate what 's beautiful about kibera and mathare the photojournalists and the creatives the graffiti artists the teachers and the entrepreneurs
  and they 're doing it  and my hat 's off to you in kibera 
 my own work focuses on making philanthropy more effective and capitalism more inclusive 
 at acumen fund we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not
 as passive recipients of charity  but as  full bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions  we leave our money for ten
  to fifteen years and when we get it back we invest in other innovations that focus on change i know it works 
 we 've invested more than fifty million dollars in fifty companies  and those companies have brought another two hundred million dollars into these forgotten markets 
 this year alone  they 've delivered forty million services like maternal health care
  and housing emergency services solar energy so that people can have more dignity in solving their problems 
 patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions easy categories  
 because we don 't see profit as a blunt instrument  but we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet
 before profit  and ultimately we want to be part of a movement that is about measuring impact measuring what is
  most important to us  and my dream is we 'll have a world one day
 where we don 't just honor those who take money and make more money from it  but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it
 into changing the world in the most positive ways  and it 's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change 
 last may i had this extraordinary
 24 hour period where i saw two visions of the world living 
 one based on violence
 and the other on transcendence  i happened to be in lahore pakistan on the day that two mosques were attacked by suicide bombers 
 and the reason these mosques were attacked is because the people praying inside were from a particular sect of islam
 who fundamentalists don 't believe are fully muslim and not only did
  those suicide bombers take a hundred lives  but they did more because they created more hatred more rage more fear and certainly despair  
 but less than twenty four hours i was thirteen miles away from those mosques visiting one of our acumen investees an incredible man
 who dares to live a life of immersion  born and raised in baltimore he studied real
  estate worked in commercial real estate  and after nine eleven decided he was going to pakistan to make a difference 
 for two years he hardly made any money a tiny stipend but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named tasneem saddiqui  
 and he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land
 using patient
  but he continued to pay a price he stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes
 it took almost two years just to register the land  but i saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person 's action 
 today two thousand people live in three hundred houses in this beautiful community  and there 's schools and clinics and shops 
 but there 's only one mosque  and so i asked jawad how do you guys navigate this is a really diverse community
 who gets to use the mosque on fridays 
 he said long story it was hard it was a difficult road  
 but ultimately the leaders of the community came together realizing we only have each other  
 and we decided that we would elect the three most respected imams 
 and those imams would take turns they would rotate who would say friday prayer  but the whole community 
 all the different sects including shi
  shi 'a and sunni would sit together and pray we need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds  
 we face huge issues as a world the financial crisis global warming
 and this growing sense of fear and otherness  
 and every day we have a choice we can take the easier road the more cynical
  road  which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was 
 a fear of each other  distancing and blame or we can take the much more difficult path
 of transformation  transcendence  compassion and love but also accountability and justice 
 i had the great honor of working with the child psychologist
  dr robert coles 
 who stood up for change during the civil rights movement in the united states  and he tells this incredible story about working with a little six year old girl named ruby bridges the first child to desegregate schools in the south in this case new orleans  
 and he said that every day this six year old dressed in her beautiful dress would walk with real grace through a phalanx
  people screaming angrily calling her a monster threatening to poison her
 distorted faces and every day he would watch her and it looked like she was talking to the people 
 and he would say ruby what are you saying and she 'd say i 'm not talking and finally he said ruby i see that you 're talking  what are you saying and she said
  and she said i 'm praying ' father forgive them for they know not what they are doing ' 
 at age six 
 this child was living a life of immersion  and her family paid a price for it  but she became part of history and opened up this idea that all of us should have access
 to education 
 my final story is about a young beautiful man named josephat byaruhanga
  who was another acumen fund fellow who hails from uganda a farming community  and we placed him in a company in western kenya just two hundred miles away  
 and he said to me at the end of his year jacqueline it was so humbling  
 because i thought as a farmer and as an african i would understand how to transcend culture 
 but especially when i was talking to the african women  i sometimes made these mistakes
  it was so hard for me to learn how to listen 
 and he said so i conclude that in many ways leadership is like a panicle of rice  
 because at the height of the season at the height of its powers it 's beautiful it 's green it nourishes the world it reaches to the heavens 
 and he said but right before the harvest it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from
  where it came we need leaders we ourselves need to lead from a place
 that has the audacity to believe we can ourselves extend the fundamental assumption that all men are created equal to every man woman and child on this planet 
 and we need to have the humility
 to recognize that we cannot do it alone
  robert kennedy once said that few of us have the greatness to bend history itself  
 but each of us can work to change a small portion of events 
 and it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written 
 our lives are so short and our time on this planet is so precious and all we
  have is each other 
 so may each of you live lives of immersion 
 they won 't necessarily be easy lives  but in the end  it is all that will sustain us  thank you
