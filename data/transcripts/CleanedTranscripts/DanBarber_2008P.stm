  i went to spain a few months ago and
 i had
 the best foie gras of my life the best culinary experience of my life  because what i saw  i 'm convinced
 the future of cooking  ridiculous right foie gras and the future of cooking  there 's not a food today that 's more maligned
 than foie gras right i mean it 's crucified  it was outlawed in chicago for a while it 's pending here in california and just recently
 in new york it 's like if you 're a chef and you put it on your menu  you risk being attacked really it happened here in san francisco
  to a famous chef i 'm not saying that there 's not a rationale
 for being opposed to foie gras  the reasons usually just
 boil down to the gavage which is the force feeding basically you take a goose or a duck and you
 you force feed a ton of grain down its throat more grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime
  liver
 expands by eight times  suffice to say it 's like it 's not the prettiest picture of of sustainable farming  the problem for
 us chefs
 is that it 's so freakin ' delicious 
 laughter i mean  i love the stuff it is
  it 's unctuous  it makes everything else you put it with taste incredible can we
 produce a menu
 that 's delicious without foie gras  yes sure 
 you can also bike the tour de france without steroids right 
 not a lot of people are doing it and for good reason
  a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy eduardo sousa eduardo is doing what he calls natural
 foie gras  natural foie gras what 's natural about foie gras  to take advantage of when
 when the temperature drops in the fall geese and ducks
 gorge on food to prepare
  for the
 for the harsh realities of winter and the rest of the year they 're free to free to roam around eduardo 's
 land and eat what they want so no gavage no force feeding no factory like conditions no cruelty  and it 's shockingly not a new idea his
  they 've been doing it quietly ever since that is
 until last year 
 when eduardo won the coup de coeur  
 the coveted french gastronomic prize  
 it 's like the olympics of of food products  he placed first for his foie gras
  problem as he said to me that really pissed the french off he
 said it sort of gleefully  
 it was all over the papers i read about it it was in le monde spanish chef accused and the french accused him spanish chef accused
  they accused him of paying off the judges  they implicated actually the spanish government amazingly huh 
 amazing a huge scandal for a few weeks  couldn 't find a shred of evidence 
 now look at the guy he doesn 't look like a guy who 's paying off french judges for his foie gras  
 so that died down and very soon afterward new controversy
 he shouldn 't win because it 's not foie gras  it 's not foie gras because it 's not gavage
 no force feeding  so by definition  he 's lying and should be disqualified
  as funny as it sounds  articulating it now and reading about it actually if
 we had talked about it before this controversy i would have said that 's kind of true you know foie gras by definition force feeding it 's gavage and that 's what
 you get when you
 when you want foie gras that is until i went to
  eduardo 's farm in extremadura fifty miles north of of seville  right on the portugal border i saw first hand a system
 that is incredibly complex and then at the same time like
 everything beautiful in nature is utterly simple 
 and he said to me
  my life 's work
 is to give the geese what they want  he repeated that about fifty times in the two days i was with him
  i 'm just here to give the geese what they want actually when i showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone
 taking pictures of them like his children in the grass  amazing  he 's really just in love with he 's at one with he he 's the goose
  and when i was speaking to him 
 you know i thought like i 'm speaking to you now right  but
 sort of in the middle of my questions my excited questions because the more i got to know him and his system the more exciting this
 this whole idea became  he kept going like this to me
  excited jew from new york right i 'm talking a little too too aggressively whatever  so you know i
 slowed down and finally by the end of the day i was like ed uar do you know like this but he was still going like this 
 i figured it out i was speaking too loudly  
 so i hushed my voice  i kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a
  translator
 in kind of a half whisper 
 and he stopped doing this and amazingly the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when i was around get
 the hell away from this kid when i lowered my voice they all came right up to us 
 right up to us like right up to here right along the fence line and fence line was amazing in itself the fence
 like this conception of fence that we have
 it 's totally backward with him the
  electricity on this fiberglass fence is only on the outside  
 he rewired rewired it he invented it  i 've never seen it  have you you fence in animals you
 electrify the inside he doesn 't 
 he electrifies only the outside  why because he said to me that he felt like the geese and he proved this actually 
 not just a conceit he
  he proved this the geese felt manipulated
 when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks  
 even though they were imprisoned in this garden of eden with figs and everything else he felt like they felt manipulated so he got rid of the electricity he got rid of current on the inside
 and kept it on the outside  so it would protect them against coyotes and
  what happened they ate and he showed me on a chart how they ate about twenty percent more
 feed
 to feed their livers the landscape is incredible i mean his farm is incredible it really is the garden of eden there 's figs and everything else there for the taking
 and the irony of ironies is because extremadura the area what does extremadura mean  extra hard land 
 right extra difficult extra hard but over four generations he and his family have literally transformed
  this extra hard land into a a tasting menu
 upgrades the life for these for these geese and they are allowed to take whatever they want another irony the double irony is that on the figs and the olives
 eduardo can make more money selling those than he can on the foie gras  he doesn 't care  
  's about fifty percent they 're very fair 
 the other fifty percent he takes and he sells and he makes money on them part of the income for his farm a big part of his income for his farm  but he never controls it  
 they get what they want  they leave the rest for me and i sell it 
 his biggest obstacle really was the marketplace which demands these days
 bright yellow foie gras that 's how i 've been trained you want to look and see what what good foie gras is it 's got to be bright yellow
  yellow it 's the indication that it 's the
 best foie gras  well because he doesn 't force feed because he doesn 't gavage tons of corn 
 his livers were pretty grey  or they were  but he found this wild plant called the lupin bush
  lupin bush it 's all around extremadura  
 he let it go to seed  he took the seeds he planted it on his thirty acres all around  
 and the geese love the lupin bush not for the bush  but for the seeds and when they eat the seeds  their foie gras turns yellow
  radioactive yellow bright yellow 
 of the highest quality foie gras yellow i 've ever seen 
 laughter so i 'm listening to all this you know and i 'm like
  is this guy for real is he making some of this up 
 is he like you know because he seemed to have an answer for everything and it was always nature it was never him and i was like 
 you know i always get a little like  
 weirded out by by people who who deflect everything away from themselves because really they want you to look at themselves right but he deflected everything away from his ingenuity into working with his landscape
  i am i 'm on the fence about this guy but increasingly  eating up his every word  and we 're sitting there  and
 i hear [ clapping ] from a distance so i look over and he grabs my arm and the translator 's and ducks us under a bush
  really loud right over us and like airport traffic control  as they start to go past us they 're called back
 and they 're called back and back and back and then they circle around and his geese are calling up now to the wild geese [ clapping ] and the wild geese are calling
  i look at eduardo who 's near tears looking at this and i say you 're telling me
 that your geese are calling to the wild geese to say come for a visit and he says
  the dna of a goose
 is to fly south
 in the winter right 
 i said that i said isn 't that what they 're put on this earth for to fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm he said no no no their dna
 is to find the conditions that are conducive to life to happiness  they find it here  they don 't need anything more
  stop they mate with his domesticated geese and his flock continues 
 think about that for a minute it 's brilliant right  imagine
 i don 't know  imagine a hog farm in like north carolina and a wild pig comes
 upon a
 factory farm and
  how did it taste i finally got to taste it before i left
 he took me to his neighborhood restaurant and
 he served me some of his foie gras  confit de foie gras  it was incredible  and the problem with saying that of course is that
 you know at this point it risks hyperbole hyperbole really easily  and i 'd like to make a
 i don 't have one really
 i was drinking this guy 's kool aid so much he could have served me goose feathers and i would have been like this guy 's a genius
 you know  i 'm really in love with him at this point 
 but it truly was the best foie gras of my life  so much so that i don 't think i had ever really had foie gras until that moment i 'd had something that was called foie gras  
 but this was transformative really
  i say to you i might not stick to this but i don 't think i 'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again
 because of that
 taste experience
 with eduardo 
 it was sweet it was unctuous it had all the qualities of of foie gras  but its fat had a lot of integrity
 and a lot of honesty and you could taste herbs you could taste spices  and i kept i said
 i swear to god i tasted star anise i was sure of it and i 'm not like some super taster you know but 
 i can taste things there 's one hundred percent star anise in there and he says no and i ended up like going down the spices and finally it was like ok salt and pepper  
 thinking he 's salted and peppered his his liver but no  he takes the liver
 when he harvests the foie gras  he sticks them in this jar
  and he confits it no salt no pepper  no oil  no spices 
 what we went back out for the final tour of the farm and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity he
 doesn 't need salt and pepper and he doesn 't need spices because he 's got this potpourri
 of herbs and flavors
 that his geese
  love to gorge on i turned to him at the end of the meal and it 's a question i asked several times and he
 hadn 't kind of answered me directly but i said now look you 're in spain some of the greatest chefs in the world are ferran adria the
 preeminent chef of the world today not that far from you how come you don 't give him this how come no one 's really heard of you
 and it may be because of the wine or it may be because of my excitement he answered me directly and he said because chefs don 't deserve my foie gras 
 and he was right he was right  chefs take foie gras and they make it their own  they create
 a dish where all the vectors point at us 
 with eduardo
 it 's about the expression of nature and as he said  i think
 fittingly  it 's a gift from god with god saying you 've done good work simple  
 i flew home i 'm on the flight with my little black book and i took you know  pages and pages of notes about it  i really was moved 
 and in the corner of one of these one of my
  notes 
 is this this note that says  when asked what do you think of conventional foie gras what do you think of foie gras that ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine percent of the world
 eats  he said i think it 's an insult to history and i wrote insult to history  i 'm on the plane and i 'm just tearing
  hell does that mean  insult to history  so i did some research when i got back 
 and here 's what i found the history of foie gras  
 jews invented foie gras  true story  true story  by accident  
 they were looking for an alternative to schmaltz  
 gotten sick of the chicken fat they were looking for an alternative and they saw in the fall that there was this natural beautiful sweet delicious fat
 and they slaughtered them  used the fat throughout the winter for cooking  the pharaoh got wind of this this is true  right off the internet the pharaoh got 
 i swear to god the
 pharaoh got wind of this and
 wanted to taste it he tasted it and fell in love with it he started demanding it and he didn 't want it just in the fall he wanted it all year round
  and he demanded that the jews supply enough for everyone  and the jews fearing for their life had to come up with an ingenious idea or at least
 try and satisfy the pharaoh 's wishes of course  and they invented what gavage  they invented gavage
 in a great moment of fear for their lives and they provided the pharaoh with gavage liver and
  the good stuff they kept for themselves  supposedly anyway i believe that one 
 that 's the history of foie gras and if you think about it  
 it 's the history of industrial agriculture it 's the history of what we eat today  most of what we eat today
 all of it our food system that 's
 also an insult to history  it 's an insult to the basic laws of nature
 and of biology  
 whether we 're talking about beef cattle
 or we 're talking about chickens  or we 're talking about broccoli
 or brussels sprouts or
 in the case of this morning 's new york times  catfish
 which
 wholesale are going out of business whatever it is it 's a mindset that
 that is reminiscent of general motors it 's rooted in extraction take more sell more waste more  
  and for the future it won 't serve us  
 jonas salk has a great quote he said if all the insects disappeared life on earth as we know it would disappear within fifty years  
 if human beings disappeared life on earth as we know it would flourish
