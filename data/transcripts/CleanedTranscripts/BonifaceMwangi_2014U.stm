  people back home call me a heckler a troublemaker an irritant a rebel an activist the voice of the people  
 but that wasn
  meaning the soft harmless boy  like every other human being i avoided trouble in my childhood they taught me silence don 't argue do as you 're told 
 in sunday school they taught me don 't confront  don 't argue even if you 're right  turn the other cheek 
 this was reinforced by the political climate
  kenya is a country where you are guilty until proven rich 
 kenya 's poor are five times more likely to be shot dead by the police who are meant to protect them than by criminals 
 this was reinforced by the political climate of the day we had a president moi who was a
  he ruled the country with an iron fist and anyone who dared question his authority was arrested  tortured  jailed or even killed  
 that meant that people were taught to be smart cowards stay
 out of trouble being a coward was not an insult being a coward was a compliment  we used to be told that a coward goes home to his mother what
 that meant that if you stayed out of trouble you 're going to stay alive i used to question this advice and eight years ago we had an election in kenya
  results were violently disputed what followed that
 election was terrible violence rape  and the killing of over one thousand people my work
 was to document the violence as a photographer i took thousands of images 
 and after two months the two politicians came together had a cup of tea  
 signed a peace
  and the country moved on i
 was a very disturbed man because i saw the violence firsthand 
 i saw the killings  i saw the displacement  i met women who had been raped  and it disturbed me 
 but the country never spoke about it  we pretended  we all became smart cowards  we decided to stay out of trouble and not talk about
  my job i said i could not stand it anymore
 after quitting my job i decided to organize my friends to speak about the violence in the country to speak about the state of the nation 
 and june one two thousand and nine was the day that we were meant to go to the stadium
 and try and get the president 's attention it 's a national holiday it 's broadcast across the country and
 i showed up at the stadium my friends did not show
  i was scared  but i knew very well that that particular day i had to make a decision was i able to live as a coward like everyone else or was i going to make a stand  
 and when the president stood up to speak  i found myself on my feet
 shouting
 at the president  telling him to remember the post election violence victims to stop the corruption  and suddenly out of nowhere
 the police pounced on me like hungry lions they held my mouth
 and dragged me out of the stadium  where they thoroughly beat me up and locked me up in jail  i spent that night
 in a cold
 cement floor in the jail  and that got me
  what was making me feel this way my friends and family thought i was crazy because of what i did  and the images that i took
 were disturbing my life the images that i took were just a number to many kenyans most kenyans did not see the violence it was a story to them 
 and so i decided to actually start a street exhibition to show the images of the violence across the country
 and get people talking about
  we traveled the country
 and showed the images and this was a journey that has started me to the activist path where i decided to become
 silent no more to talk about those things  we traveled  and our general site from our street exhibit became
 for political graffiti about the situation in the country talking about corruption  bad leadership  we have even done
  we have delivered live pigs to kenya 's parliament
 as a symbol of our politicians ' greed it
 has been done in uganda and other countries and what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media and amplified across the country  across the continent where
 i used to stand up alone seven years ago now i belong to a community of many people who stand up with me 
 i am no longer alone when i stand up to speak about these things  
 i belong to a group of young people
 who are
  passionate about the country who want to bring about change  and they 're no longer afraid and they 're no longer smart cowards  
 so that was my story 
 that day in the stadium  
 i stood up as a smart coward by that one action  i said goodbye to the twenty four years living as a coward
  days in your life the day you 're born  and the day you discover why that day standing up in that stadium
 shouting at the president  i discovered why i was truly born that i would no longer be silent in the face of injustice 
 do you know why
 you were
  you 've created a studio a place where young people can go and harness the power of digital media to
  do some of this action 
 what 's happening now with pawa boniface mwangi so we have this community of filmmakers graffiti artists  musicians and when there 's an issue in the country  we come together  we brainstorm and take up on that issue  so 
 our most powerful tool is art  because we live in a very busy world where people are
  spite of being arrested beaten up 
 threatened the moment i discovered my voice that i could actually stand up for what i really believed in i 'm no longer afraid  i used to be called softy  but i 'm no longer softy  because
 i discovered who i really am as in that 's what i want to do and there 's such beauty
 in doing that there 's nothing as powerful as that  knowing that i 'm meant to do this because you don 't get scared you just continue living your life
