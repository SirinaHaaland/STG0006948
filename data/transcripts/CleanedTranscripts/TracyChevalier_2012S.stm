  i 'm going to tell you about an affliction i suffer from and i have a funny feeling that quite a few of you suffer from it as well 
 when i 'm walking around an art gallery  rooms and rooms full of paintings after about fifteen or twenty minutes 
  i 'm not thinking about the paintings i 'm not connecting to them  instead i 'm thinking about that cup of coffee i desperately need to wake me up 
 i 'm suffering from gallery fatigue how many of you out there suffer from yes ha ha ha ha now 
 sometimes you might last longer than twenty minutes or
  but i think we all suffer from it and do you have the
 accompanying guilt for me i look at the paintings on the wall and i think somebody has decided to put them there thinks they 're good enough
 to be on that wall but i don 't always see it in fact most of the time i don 't see it  and
 i leave feeling actually unhappy  i feel guilty and and unhappy with myself rather than thinking there 's something wrong with the painting i think there 's something wrong with me  and that 's not a good experience
  leave a gallery like that 
 the thing is i think we should give ourselves a break if you think about going into a restaurant 
 when you look at the menu are you expected to order every single thing on the menu no you select  
 if you go into a department store to buy a shirt 
 are you going to
 try on every single shirt and want every single shirt of course not you can be selective
 it 's expected 
 how come then it 's not so expected to be selective when we go to an art gallery  why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
 well i 'm trying to take a different approach and there 's two things i do when i go into a gallery first of all i go quite fast and i
  look at everything  and i
 pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other i don 't even know why they make me slow down but something pulls me like a magnet
 and then i ignore all the others  and i just go to that painting so it 's the first thing i do is i do my own curation i choose a painting  it might just be one painting in fifty 
 and then the second thing i do is i stand in front of that painting  and i tell myself a story about it  why a story  well i think that we are
  wired  our dna tells us to tell stories we tell stories all the time about everything and i think we do it
 because the world is kind of a crazy  chaotic place and sometimes stories we 're trying to make sense of the world a little bit trying to bring some order to it  
 why not apply that
 to our looking at paintings  so i now have this sort of restaurant
  menu
 visiting of art galleries 
 there are three paintings i 'm going to show you now that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks and want to tell stories about them 
 the first one needs little introduction girl with a pearl earring by johannes vermeer
  dutch painter 
 this is the most glorious painting 
 i first saw it when i was nineteen and i immediately went out and got a poster of it and in fact i still have that poster thirty years later it 's hanging in my house  
 it 's accompanied me everywhere i 've gone i never tire of looking at her 
 what made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with was just the gorgeous colors he uses and the light falling on her face  
 but i think what 's kept me still coming back year after year
 is another thing and that is
 the look on her face the conflicted look on her face  i can 't tell if she 's happy or sad  and i change my mind all the time 
 so that keeps me coming back 
 one day sixteen years after i had this poster on my wall  i lay in bed and looked at her  
 and i suddenly thought  i wonder what
  did to her
 to make her look like that 
 and it was the first time i 'd ever thought that the expression on her face is actually reflecting how she feels about him  
 always before i 'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl 
 now i began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship  
 and i thought well what is that relationship  so i went to find out i did some research and discovered
 we have no idea who she is in fact we don 't know who any of the models in any of vermeer 's paintings are and we know very little about vermeer himself  
 which made me go yippee 
 i can do whatever i want i can come up with whatever story i want to 
 so here 's how i came up with the story 
  got to get her into the house  how does vermeer know her well there 've been suggestions that she is his 12 year old daughter
  the daughter at the time was twelve when he painted the painting  
 and i thought no it 's a very intimate look but it 's not a look a daughter gives her father for one thing in dutch painting of the time if a woman 's mouth was open it was indicating sexual availability 
  it would have been inappropriate for vermeer to paint his daughter like that so it 's not his daughter but it 's somebody
  close to him physically close to him  well who else would be in the house 
 a servant a lovely servant  so she 's in the house how do we get her into the studio 
 we don 't know very much about vermeer but the little bits that we do know one thing we know is that he married a catholic woman they lived with her mother in a house where he had his own room where he his studio  
 he also had eleven
  children  it would have been a chaotic noisy household and if you 've seen vermeer 's paintings before you know that they 're incredibly calm
 and quiet how does a painter paint such calm quiet paintings with eleven kids around well he compartmentalizes his life he gets to his studio and he says nobody 
  comes in here not the wife not the kids  okay the maid can come in and clean
 she 's in the studio  he 's got her in the studio  they 're together and he decides to paint her 
 he has her wear very plain clothes now all of the women or most of the women in vermeer 's other paintings wore velvet  silk 
 fur very sumptuous materials this is very plain the only thing that isn 't plain
 is her pearl earring
 if she 's a servant there is no way she could afford a pair of pearl earrings  so those are not her pearl earrings  whose are they 
 we happen to know there 's a list of catharina the wife 's clothes amongst them a yellow
 coat with white fur a yellow and black bodice  and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings different women in the
  paintings vermeer 's paintings  
 so clearly her clothes were lent to various different women it 's not such a leap of faith to take that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife  
 so we 've got all the elements for our story  she 's in the studio with him for a long time these paintings took a long time to make they would have
  time alone all that time she 's wearing his wife 's pearl earring she 's gorgeous she obviously loves him she 's conflicted 
 and does the wife know maybe not and if she doesn 't 
 well
 that 's the story 
 laughter the next painting i 'm going to talk about is called boy building a house of cards by chardin he 's an
  french painter best known for his still lifes but he did occasionally paint people  
 and in fact he painted four versions of this painting  different boys building houses of cards all concentrated  
 i like this version the best because some of the boys are older and some are younger and to me this one like goldilocks 's porridge is just right
  he 's not quite a child
  and he 's not quite a man  he 's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience  and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting  
 and i looked at his face  it 's like a vermeer painting a bit the light comes in from the left his face is bathed in this glowing light it 's right in the center of the painting and you look at it  and i found that when i was looking at it i was standing there going 
  please look at me and he didn 't look at me  he was still looking at his cards and that 's one of the seductive elements of this painting is he 's so focused on what he 's doing that he doesn 't look at us  
 and that is to me  the sign of a masterpiece of a painting when there 's a lack of resolution  he 's never going to look at me  so i was thinking of a story where if i 'm in this position who could
  there looking at him not the painter i don 't want to think about the painter i 'm
  looking for the answer looking for the story to fill in that gap and we may make a story  
 and it satisfies us momentarily  but not not really and we come back again and again 
 the last painting i 'm going to talk about
 is called anonymous by anonymous
  this is a tudor portrait bought by the national portrait gallery  they thought it was a man named sir thomas overbury  
 and then they discovered that it wasn 't him and they have no idea who it is 
 now in the national portrait gallery if you don 't know the biography of the painting  it 's kind of useless to you they can 't hang it on the wall because they don 't know who he is so unfortunately  this orphan 
 spends most of his time in storage along with quite a number of other orphans some of them some beautiful paintings 
 made me stop in my tracks
 for three reasons one is the disconnection between his mouth that 's smiling and his eyes that are wistful  
 he 's not happy and why isn 't he happy 
 the second thing that really attracted me
 were his bright red cheeks  he is blushing he 's
 blushing for his portrait being made this must be a guy who blushes all the time what is he thinking about that 's making him blush  the third thing
 that made me stop in my tracks is his absolutely gorgeous doublet  
 silk gray those beautiful buttons  and you know what it makes me think of is it 's sort of snug and puffy it 's like a duvet spread over a bed 
 i kept thinking of beds and red cheeks and of course i kept thinking of sex when i looked at him  
  what he 's thinking about  and i thought  if i 'm going to make a story what 's the last thing i 'm going to put in there well what would a tudor gentleman be preoccupied with and i thought well henry viii okay 
 he 'd be preoccupied with his inheritance with his heir who is going to inherit
 his name and his fortune you put all those
  and you 've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back now here 's the story  
 it 's short 
 rosy 
 i am still wearing the white brocade doublet caroline gave me  
 it has a plain high collar detachable sleeves and intricate buttons of twisted silk thread set close together so that the fit
  is snug the doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed perhaps that was the intention 
 i first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor 
 i knew even before i stood up to speak that my cheeks were inflamed 
 i have always flushed easily from physical exertion from wine from high emotion as a boy
 i was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys  
 but not by george only george could call me rosy  
 i would not allow anyone else he managed to make the word tender 
 when i made the announcement george did not turn rosy but went pale as my
  he should not have been surprised  it has been a common assumption that i would one day marry his cousin  
 but it is difficult to hear the words aloud i know i could barely utter them 
 afterwards  i found george on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden 
 despite drinking steadily all afternoon  he was still pale 
 we stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces 
 what do you think of my doublet
 he glanced at me that collar looks to be strangling you 
 we will still see each other i insisted we can still hunt and play cards and attend court nothing need change 
 george did not speak 
 i am twenty three years old it is time for me to marry and produce an heir  it is expected of me
  another glass of claret and turned to me congratulations on your upcoming nuptials james  i 'm sure you 'll be
 content together he never used my nickname again  
 thank you
