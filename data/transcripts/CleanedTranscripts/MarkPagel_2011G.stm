  each of you possesses the most powerful  dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised  
 it 's a piece of neural audio technology for rewiring other people 's minds
  i 'm talking about your language of course 
 because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into someone else 's mind and they can attempt to do the same to you without either of you having to perform surgery  
 instead when you speak you 're actually using a form of telemetry
 not so different from the remote control device for your television 
 it 's just that whereas that device relies on pulses of infrared light your language relies on pulses discrete pulses
  of sound  and just as you use the remote control device to alter the internal settings of your television to suit your mood 
 you use your language to alter the settings inside someone else 's brain
 to suit your interests 
 languages are genes talking getting things that they want  and just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discovers that merely by uttering a sound
  objects to move across a room as if by magic  and maybe even into its mouth  
 now language 's subversive power has been recognized throughout the ages in censorship in books you can 't read  phrases you can 't use and words you can 't say  
 in fact the tower of babel story in the bible is a fable and warning about the power of language  according to that story early humans
  developed the conceit that by using their language to work together they could build a tower that would take them all the way to heaven  
 now god angered at this attempt to usurp his power destroyed the tower 
 and then to ensure that it would never be rebuilt he scattered the people by giving them different languages confused them by giving them different languages  
 and this leads to the wonderful irony
  that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating 
 even today we know that there are words we cannot use phrases we cannot say because if we do so we might be accosted  jailed or even killed  
 and all of this from a puff of air emanating from our mouths  now all this fuss about a single one of our traits tells us there 's something worth
  explaining  and that is how and why did this remarkable trait evolve and why did it evolve only in our species  
 now it 's a little bit of a surprise that to get an answer to that question we have to go to tool use in the chimpanzees  
 now these chimpanzees are using tools and we take that as a sign of
  but if they really were intelligent why would they use a stick to extract termites from the ground rather than a shovel  
 and if they really were intelligent 
 why would they crack open nuts with a rock why wouldn 't they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nuts that somebody else had already cracked open for them 
 why not i mean that 's what we do  
 now the reason the chimpanzees don 't do that is that they lack what psychologists and anthropologists call social learning they seem to lack the
  ability to learn from others by copying or imitating or simply watching 
 as a result they can 't improve on others ' ideas or learn from others ' mistakes benefit from others ' wisdom 
 and so they just do the same thing over and over and over again 
 in fact  we could go away for a million years and come back and these chimpanzees would be doing the
  thing with the same sticks for the termites and the same
 rocks to crack open the nuts 
 now this may sound arrogant or even full of hubris how do we know this because this is exactly what our ancestors  the homo erectus did 
 these upright apes evolved on the african savanna about two million years ago  
 and they made these splendid hand axes that fit wonderfully into your hands  
 but if we look at the
  fossil record we see that they made the same hand axe over and over and over again for one million years you can follow it through the fossil record  
 now if we make some guesses about how long homo erectus lived what their generation time was that 's about forty thousand generations of parents to offspring and other individuals watching in which that hand axe didn 't change 
 it 's not even clear that our very close genetic relatives
  the neanderthals had social learning sure enough their tools were more complicated than those of homo erectus  
 but they too showed very little change over the three hundred thousand years or so that those species the neanderthals lived in eurasia  
 okay so what this tells us is that contrary
  the surprise really is that all of the other animals really cannot do that at least not very much and even this picture has the suspicious taint of being rigged about it something from a barnum & bailey
 circus  
 but by comparison  
 we can learn we can learn by watching other people and copying or imitating what they can do 
 we can then
 choose from among a range of options the best one 
 we can benefit from others ' ideas we can build on their wisdom and as a result our ideas do accumulate and our technology progresses  
 and this
 cumulative cultural adaptation
  anthropologists call this accumulation of ideas is responsible for everything around you in your bustling and teeming everyday lives i mean the world has changed out of all proportion 
  to what we would recognize even one thousand or two thousand years ago  and all of this because of cumulative cultural adaptation the chairs you 're sitting in the lights in this auditorium  my microphone 
 the ipads and ipods that you carry around with you all are a result of cumulative cultural adaptation  
  commentators  cumulative cultural adaptation or social learning is job done  end of story  
 our species can make stuff 
 therefore we prospered in a way that no other species has in fact  we can even make the stuff of life as i just said all the stuff around us 
 but in fact  it turns out that some time around two hundred thousand years ago when our species first arose
  and acquired social learning 
 that this was really the beginning of our story not the end of our story  because our acquisition of social learning would create a social and evolutionary dilemma  
 the resolution of which it 's fair to say would determine not only the future course of our psychology  but the future
 course of the entire world and most importantly for this it 'll tell us why we have language 
 and the reason that dilemma arose is it turns out that social learning is visual theft 
 if i can learn by watching you i can steal your best ideas and i can benefit from your efforts without having to put in the time and energy that you did into developing them 
 if i can watch which lure you use to catch a fish or i can watch how you flake your hand axe to
  make it better 
 or if i follow you secretly to your mushroom patch i can benefit from your knowledge and wisdom and skills  and maybe even catch that fish before you do 
 social learning really is visual theft  and in any species that acquired it it would behoove you
 to hide your best
  lest somebody steal them from you  
 and so some time around two hundred thousand years ago  our species confronted this crisis  
 and we really had only two options for dealing with the conflicts that visual theft would bring 
 one of those options was that we could have retreated into small family groups because then the benefits of our ideas and knowledge would flow just to our relatives
  had we chosen this option sometime around two hundred thousand years ago  
 we would probably still be living like the neanderthals were when we first entered europe forty thousand years ago  
 and this is because in small groups there are fewer ideas there are fewer innovations  and small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck 
 so if we 'd chosen that path our evolutionary path would have led into the forest and been a short one indeed
 the other option we could choose was to develop the systems of communication that would allow us to share ideas and to cooperate amongst others  
 choosing this option would mean that a vastly greater fund of accumulated knowledge and wisdom would become available to any one individual than would ever arise from within an individual family or an individual person on their own
  well  we chose the second option 
 and language is the result language evolved to solve the crisis of visual theft 
 language is a piece of social technology for enhancing the benefits of cooperation
 for reaching agreements for striking deals and for
  and you can see that in a developing society that was beginning to acquire language not having language would be a like a bird without wings 
 just as wings open up this sphere of air for birds to exploit language opened up the sphere of cooperation for humans to exploit  
 and we take this utterly for granted because we 're a species that is so at home with
  but you have to realize that even the simplest acts of exchange that we engage in
 are utterly dependent upon language 
 and to see why consider two scenarios from early in our evolution  let 's imagine that that you are really good at making arrowheads  but you 're hopeless at making the the wooden shafts with the flight feathers attached 
 two other people you know are very good at making the wooden
  but they 're hopeless at making the arrowheads  so what you do is
 one of those people has has not really acquired language yet and let 's pretend the other one is good at language skills  so what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads and you walk up to the one that can 't speak 
  very well  and you put the arrowheads down in front of him hoping that he 'll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads for finished arrows  
  a scuffle ensues and you get stabbed with one of your own arrowheads  
 okay now replay this scene now and you 're approaching the one who has language you put down your arrowheads and say i 'd like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows i 'll split you fifty fifty the other one says fine looks good to me we 'll do that 
 now the job is done  
 once we have language  we can put our ideas together and cooperate
 to have a prosperity that we couldn 't have before we acquired it 
 and this is why our species has prospered around the world while the rest of the animals
 sit behind bars in zoos  languishing  that 's why we build space shuttles and cathedrals
 while the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground to extract
  if this view of language and its value in solving the crisis of visual theft is true any species that acquires it should show an explosion 
  of creativity and prosperity  and this is exactly what the archeological record shows 
  quickly walked out of africa and spread around the entire world  occupying nearly every habitat on earth  
 now whereas other species are confined to places that their genes adapt them to 
 with social learning and language we could transform the environment to suit our needs  and so we
 prospered in a way that no other animal has 
 language really is the most potent trait that has ever evolved 
 it is the most valuable trait we have for converting new lands and resources into more people and their genes that natural selection has ever devised 
 language really is the voice of our genes  
 now having evolved language though we did something peculiar  even bizarre
  as we spread out around the world  we developed thousands of different languages  currently there are about seven or eight thousand different languages spoken on earth  
 now you might say well this is just natural as we diverge our languages are naturally going to diverge  but the real puzzle and irony is that the greatest density of different languages on earth
  is found where people are most tightly packed together 
 if we go to the island of papua new guinea we can find about eight hundred to one thousand distinct human languages different
 human languages spoken on that island alone 
 there are places on that island where you can encounter a new language every two or three miles  
 now incredible as this sounds i once met a papuan man and i asked him if this could possibly be true  and he said to me oh no they 're far closer together than
  that 
 and it 's true there are places on that island where you can encounter a new language in under a mile  and this is also true of some remote oceanic islands  
 and so it seems that we use our language not just to cooperate but to draw rings around our cooperative groups and to establish identities 
 and perhaps to protect
 our knowledge and wisdom and skills from eavesdropping from outside
 and we know this because when we study different language groups and associate them with their cultures we see that different languages slow the flow of ideas between groups 
 they slow the flow of technologies and they even slow the flow of genes  
 now i can 't speak for you but it seems to be the case that we don 't have sex with people we can 't talk to
  now
 we have to counter that though against the evidence we 've heard that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances with the neanderthals and the denisovans 
 okay this tendency we have this seemingly natural tendency we have towards isolation towards keeping to
  head first into our modern world this remarkable image is not a map of the world in fact it 's a map of
 facebook friendship links and when you plot those friendship links by their latitude and longitude it literally draws a map of the world  
 our modern world is communicating with itself and with each other
 more than it has at any time
  and that communication that connectivity around the world that globalization
 now raises a burden because these different languages impose a barrier as we 've just seen to the transfer of goods and ideas and technologies and wisdom and they impose a barrier to cooperation 
 and nowhere do we see that more clearly than in the european
  the european union is now spending over one billion euros annually translating among their twenty three official languages that 's something on the order of one point four five billion u s dollars on translation costs alone  
 now think of the absurdity of this situation if
  member states sat around table speaking their twenty three languages some very simple mathematics will tell you that you need an army of two hundred and fifty three translators to anticipate all the pairwise possibilities  
 the european union employs a permanent staff of about two thousand five hundred translators  
 and in two thousand and seven alone and i 'm sure there are more recent figures something on the order of one point three million pages were translated into english alone
  alone 
 and so if language really is the solution to the crisis of visual theft  if language really is the conduit of our cooperation 
 the technology that our species derived
 to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas in our modern world we
 confront a question  and that question is whether in this
  globalized world we can really afford to have all these different languages to
 put it this way  nature knows no other circumstance in which functionally equivalent traits coexist one of them always drives the other extinct  
 and we see this in the inexorable march towards standardization there are lots and
 measuring things weighing them and measuring their length but the metric system is winning there are lots and lots of ways of measuring time but a really bizarre 
  base sixty system known as hours and minutes and seconds is nearly universal around the world  
 our modern world now is confronting us with a dilemma and it 's the dilemma that this chinese man faces who 's language is spoken by 
 more people in the world than any other single language and yet he is sitting at his blackboard 
  and what this does is it raises the possibility to us that in a world in which we want to promote cooperation and exchange and in a world that might be dependent more than ever before on cooperation to maintain and enhance our levels of prosperity  
 his actions suggest to us it might be inevitable that we have to confront
 the idea
  which seems to be associated with language  was also shared in the same form in neanderthals as us do we
 have any idea how we could have defeated neanderthals if if they also had language
 is a very good question so many of you will be familiar with the idea that there 's this gene called foxp2 that seems to be implicated
 in some ways in the fine motor control that 's associated with language
 the reason why i don 't believe that tells us that the neanderthals had language is here 's a simple analogy
  ferraris are cars that have engines  my car has an engine  but it 's not a ferrari
  now the simple answer then is that genes alone don 't all by themselves determine the outcome of very complicated things like language what we know about this foxp2 and neanderthals 
  is that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths who knows but that doesn 't tell us they necessarily had language mr
