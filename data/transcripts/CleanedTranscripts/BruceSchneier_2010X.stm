  security is two different things  it 's a feeling and it 's a reality and they 're different you could feel secure
 even if you 're not  and you can be secure even if you don 't feel it
 really we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word
 and what i want to do in this talk is to split them apart
 figuring out when they diverge and how they converge 
 and language is actually a problem here  there aren 't a lot of good words for the concepts we 're going to talk about  
 so
 if you look at security from economic terms 
  every time you get some security  you 're always trading off something whether this is a personal decision whether you 're going to install a burglar alarm in your home
 or a national decision where you 're going to invade a foreign country you 're going to trade off something money or time convenience capabilities  
 maybe fundamental liberties  
 and the question to ask when you look at a security anything is not
 whether this makes us safer but whether it 's worth the
  in the past several years the world is safer because saddam hussein is not in power that might be true  but it 's not terribly relevant the question is was it worth it 
 and you can make your own decision and then you 'll decide whether the invasion was worth it that 's how you think about security  in terms of the trade off 
 now  there 's often no right or wrong here 
 some of us have a burglar alarm system at home and some of us don 't
  'll depend on where we live whether we live alone or have a family how much cool stuff we have how much we 're willing to accept the risk of of theft 
 in politics also  there are different opinions 
 a lot of times these  trade offs are about more than just security and i think that 's really important 
 now  people have a natural intuition about these
  every day  last night in my hotel room when i decided to double lock the door or you in your car when you drove here
 when we go eat lunch and decide the food 's not poison and we 'll eat it
  we make these  trade offs again and again 
 multiple times a day we often won 't even notice them they 're just part of being alive we all do it  every species does it
 imagine a rabbit in a field eating
  grass and the rabbit sees a fox that rabbit will make a security trade off should i stay or should i flee 
 and if you think about it the rabbits that are good at making that trade off will tend to live and reproduce  and the rabbits that are bad at it
 will get eaten or starve  so you 'd think that
  as a successful species on the planet you me everybody
 would be really good at making these trade offs yet it seems again and again that we 're hopelessly bad at it
 and i think that 's a fundamentally interesting question i 'll give you the short answer 
 the answer is we respond to the feeling of security and not the reality  
 now  most of the time that works
 most of the time feeling and reality
  are the same certainly that 's true
 for most of human prehistory
 we 've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense
 one way to think of it is that we 're highly optimized for risk decisions that are endemic to living in
 small family groups in the east african highlands in one hundred thousand bc two thousand and ten new york not so much now there are
 several biases in risk perception a lot of good experiments in this  and you can see
 certain biases that come up again and again i 'll give you four we tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks and downplay common risks
 so flying versus driving
  the unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar
  one example would be people fear kidnapping by strangers 
 when the data supports that kidnapping by relatives is much more common this is for children 
 third personified risks
 are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks so bin laden is scarier because he has a
  in situations they do control and overestimate them in situations they don 't control  
 so once you take up skydiving or smoking you downplay the risks 
 if a risk is thrust upon you terrorism is a good example
 you 'll overplay it  because you don 't feel like it 's in your control there are a bunch of other
  these cognitive biases that affect our risk decisions 
 there 's the availability heuristic  
 which basically means we estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind  
 so you can imagine how that works if you hear a lot about tiger attacks there must be a lot of tigers around you don 't hear about lion attacks there aren 't a lot of lions around 
 this works until you invent newspapers
 because what newspapers do is
 repeat again and again rare risks 
 i tell people if it 's in the news don 't worry about it  because by definition news is something that almost never happens 
 laughter when something is so common it 's no longer news car crashes domestic violence those are the risks you worry about we
 're also a species of storytellers  we respond to stories more than data
  and there 's some basic innumeracy going on i mean 
 the joke one two three many is kind of right  
 we 're really good at small numbers one mango two mangoes three mangoes ten thousand mangoes one hundred thousand mangoes it 's still more mangoes you can eat before they rot  
 so one half one quarter one fifth we 're good at that one in a million one in a billion they 're both almost never 
 so we have trouble with the
  that aren 't very common  and what these cognitive biases do is they act as filters between us and reality
 and the result is that feeling and reality get out of whack they get different
 now  you either have a feeling you feel more secure than you are there 's a false sense of security  or the other
  a false sense of insecurity  
 i write a lot about security theater which are products that make people feel secure but don 't actually do anything there 's
 no real word for stuff that makes us secure but doesn 't make us feel secure  maybe it 's what the cia is supposed to do for us 
 so back to economics  if economics if the market drives security
  based on the feeling of security  then the smart thing for companies to do for the economic incentives is to make people feel secure 
 and there are two ways to do this one you can make people actually secure and hope they notice  
 or two you can make people just feel secure and hope they don 't notice
  a couple of things understanding of the security of the risks the threats the countermeasures how they work but if you know stuff you 're more likely
 to have your feelings match reality  
 enough real world examples helps  we all know the crime rate in our neighborhood because we live there  and we get a feeling about it
 that basically matches reality
 security theater is exposed when it 's obvious that it 's not working properly 
 ok  so what makes people not notice  well  a poor understanding
 if you don 't understand the risks you don 't understand the costs you 're likely to get the trade off wrong and your feeling doesn 't match
  for example terrorism almost never happens  it 's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter terrorist measures
 this is why you keep sacrificing virgins and why your unicorn defenses are working just great
 there aren 't enough examples of failures
 also feelings that cloud the issues
  issues the cognitive biases i talked about earlier fears folk beliefs basically an inadequate model of reality  
 so let me complicate things i have feeling and reality  i want to add a third element i want to add model 
 feeling and model are in our head reality is the outside world it doesn 't change it 's real
  feeling is based on our intuition model is based on reason 
 that 's basically the difference in a primitive and simple world there 's really no reason for a model
 because feeling is close to reality  you don 't need a model  but in a modern and complex world  you need models
  to understand a lot of the risks we face 
 there 's no feeling about germs  you need a model to understand them this model
 is an intelligent representation of reality it 's of course limited by
 science by technology  
 we couldn 't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them  
 it 's limited by our cognitive biases
 it has the ability to override our feelings where do we get these models we get them from others  we get them from
 religion from culture  teachers elders a
 couple years ago i was in south africa on safari  the tracker i was with grew up in kruger national park he had some very complex models of how
  and it depended on if you were attacked by a lion leopard rhino or elephant and when you had to run away when you couldn 't run away when you had to climb a tree  when you could never climb a tree  i would have died in a day
  but he was born there and he
 understood how to survive
 i was born in new york city i could have taken him to new york and he would have died in a day 
 laughter because we had different models based on our different experiences
  models can come from the media from our elected officials think of of models of terrorism child kidnapping
 airline safety car safety  models can come from industry the two i 'm following are surveillance cameras  id
  quite a lot of our computer security models come from there a lot of models come from science
 health models are a great example think of cancer  bird flu swine flu sars
  all of our feelings of security about those diseases
 come from models given to us really by science filtered through the media  
 so models can change models are not static as we become more comfortable in our environments
 our model can move closer to our feelings  
 so an example might be if you go back one hundred years ago  when electricity was first becoming common  
 there were a lot of fears about it there were people who were afraid to push doorbells because there was electricity in there and that was dangerous 
  we 're very facile around electricity we change light bulbs without even thinking about it
 our model of of security around electricity
 is something we were we were born into  it hasn 't changed as we were growing up and we 're good at it or think of the
 risks
 on the internet across generations how your parents approach internet
  versus how you do versus how our our kids will models eventually fade into the background 
 intuitive is just another word for familiar  
 so as your model is close to reality  and it converges with feelings  you often don 't even know it 's there
 a nice example of this came from last year and swine swine flu  
 when swine flu first appeared the initial news caused a lot of overreaction
  now it had a name  which made it scarier than the regular flu even though it was more deadly  
 and people thought doctors should be able to deal with it 
 so there was that feeling of lack of control and those two things made the risk more than it was
 as the novelty wore off and the months went by there was some amount of
  people got used to it  
 there was no new data but there was less fear 
 by autumn people thought the doctors should have solved this already  
 and there 's kind of a bifurcation people had to choose between
 fear
 and
 and acceptance
 actually fear and indifference and they kind of chose suspicion and when the vaccine appeared last winter  there were a lot of people
  a surprising number who refused to get it and it
 's a nice example of how people 's feelings of security change how their model changes  sort of wildly 
 with no new information with no new input 
 this kind of thing happens a lot
  i have a very relativistic view of security i think it depends on the observer and most security decisions have
 a variety of people involved and stakeholders with specific
  trade offs will try to influence the decision  and i call that their agenda
 and you see agenda this is marketing this is politics
  trying to convince you to have one model versus another trying to convince you to ignore a model and and
 trust your feelings  marginalizing people with models you don 't like this is not uncommon an
 example a great example is the risk of smoking 
 in the history of the past fifty years the smoking risk shows how a model changes and it also shows how an industry fights
 against a model it doesn 't like
 compare that to the secondhand smoke debate
 probably about twenty years behind 
 think about seat belts  when i was a kid no one wore a seat belt  nowadays no kid will let you drive if you 're not wearing a seat belt
 compare that to the airbag debate probably about thirty years behind all examples of models
  changing 
 what we learn is that changing models is hard 
 models are hard to dislodge if they equal your feelings  you don 't even know you have a model 
 and there 's another cognitive bias i 'll call confirmation bias  where we tend to accept data
 that
 confirms our beliefs and reject data that contradicts our beliefs
  so evidence against our model 
 we 're likely to ignore even if it 's compelling it has to get very compelling before we 'll pay attention 
 new models that extend long periods of time are hard global warming is a great example we 're terrible at models that span eighty years
 we can do to the next
  just not good at 
 so it 's a very hard model to accept  
 we can have both models in our head simultaneously
 that kind of problem where we 're holding both beliefs
 together the cognitive dissonance eventually the new model will replace the old model  strong feelings can create a model
 created a security model
 in a lot of people 's heads also personal experiences with crime can do it  personal health scare a health scare in the news you
 'll see these called flashbulb events by psychiatrists
 they can create a model instantaneously because they 're very emotive  so in the technological world  we don 't have experience
  to judge models and we rely on others we rely on proxies and this works as long as it 's the correct others  we rely on
 government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals
 are safe  i flew here yesterday i didn 't check the airplane
 i relied on some other group to determine whether my plane was safe to fly  we 're here
  none of us fear the roof is going to collapse on us not because we checked  but because we 're pretty sure the building codes here are good
 it 's a model we just accept
 pretty much by faith  and that 's ok  
  what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models 
 have it reflected in their feelings to allow them to make security 
 trade offs when these go out of whack  you have two options one you can fix people 's feelings  directly appeal to feelings  
 it 's manipulation  but it can work  
 the second more honest way
 is to actually fix the model  change happens slowly
  slowly  the smoking debate took forty years and that was an easy one 
 some of this stuff is hard
 really though information seems like our best hope
 and i lied remember i said  feeling model reality  reality doesn 't change it actually does we live in a technological world reality changes all the time  
  might have for the first time in our species feeling chases model model chases reality reality 's moving they might never catch up
  we don 't know
  but in the long term both feeling and reality are important  and i want to close with two quick stories to illustrate this
  poisonings in the united states  it 's a horrific story someone took a bottle of tylenol 
 put poison in it  closed it up put it back on the shelf  someone else bought it and died this terrified people 
 there were a couple of copycat attacks  there wasn 't any real risk but people were scared  and this is how
 the tamper proof drug industry was invented
  that came from this it 's complete security theater
 as a homework assignment think of ten ways to get around it i 'll give you one a syringe
  but it made people feel better it made their feeling of security more match the reality  
 last story a few years ago a friend of mine gave birth i visit her in the hospital it turns out 
 when a baby 's born now they put an rfid bracelet on the baby a corresponding one on the mother  so if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward
  goes off  i said well that 's kind of neat  
 i wonder how rampant baby snatching is out of hospitals i go home i look it up it basically never happens 
 but if you think about it if you are a hospital  and you need to take a baby away from its mother out of the room to run some tests  
 you better have some good security theater or she 's going to rip your arm off
 laughter so it 's important for us those of us who design security who look at security policy
 or even look at public policy in ways that affect security 
 it 's not just reality  it 's feeling and reality  what 's important
 is that they be about the same it 's important that if our feelings match reality  we make better security
