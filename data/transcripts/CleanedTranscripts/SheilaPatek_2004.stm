  learn how to play the lobster we have some here  and that 's not a joke we really do so come up afterwards and i 'll show you how to play a lobster so actually i started
 working on what 's called the mantis shrimp a few years
  because they make sound this is a recording i made of a mantis shrimp
 that 's found off the coast of california  
 and while that 's an absolutely fascinating sound
  it actually turns out to be a very difficult project 
 and while i was struggling
  to figure out how and why mantis shrimp or stomatopods make sound i started to think about their appendages  and mantis shrimp are called mantis shrimp after the praying mantises which also have a fast feeding appendage  
 and i started to think well maybe it will
 be interesting  while listening to their sounds to figure out how these animals
 generate very fast feeding strikes and so today i 'll talk about
 the extreme stomatopod strike work that i 've done in collaboration with wyatt korff and roy caldwell so mantis shrimp come in two varieties
  there are spearers and smashers and this is a spearing mantis shrimp or stomatopod  and he lives in the sand  and he catches things that go by overhead 
 so a quick strike like that 
 and if we slow it down a bit this is the mantis shrimp the same species
 recorded at one thousand frames a second  played back at fifteen frames per second  and you can see it 's just a really spectacular
  of the limbs  exploding upward to actually just catch a dead piece of shrimp that i
 had offered it now the other type of mantis shrimp
 is the smasher stomatopod  and these guys open up snails for a living and so this guy
 gets the snail all set up and gives it a good
  play it one more time he wiggles it in place tugs it with his nose and
 smash and a few smashes later
  the snail is broken open and he 's got a good dinner  so the smasher raptorial appendage
 can stab with a point at the end or it can smash with the heel  and today i 'll talk about the smashing type of strike  and so the first question that came to mind was well how fast does this limb move because it 's moving pretty darn fast
 on that video  
 and i immediately came upon a problem every single high speed video system in the biology department at berkeley wasn 't fast enough to catch this movement we simply couldn 't capture it on video  
 and so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time and then a bbc crew came cruising through the biology department looking for a story
 to do about new technologies in biology and so we struck
  up a deal  i said well if you guys rent the high speed video system that could capture these movements you guys can film us
 collecting the data and believe it or not they went for it so we got this incredible video system  it 's very new technology it just came out about a year ago
 that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light and low light is a critical issue with filming animals because if it 's too high
  fry them so
 this is a mantis shrimp  there are the eyes up here  and there 's that raptorial appendage and there 's the heel and that thing 's going to swing around and smash the snail  and the snail 's wired to a stick 
  so he 's a little bit easier to set up the shot and yeah 
 i hope there aren 't any
  this was filmed at five thousand frames per second  
 and i 'm playing it back at fifteen  and so this is slowed down three hundred and thirty three times  and as you 'll notice it 's still pretty gosh darn fast
 slowed down three hundred and thirty three times it 's an incredibly powerful movement  the whole limb extends out the body flexes backwards just a
  and so what we did is we took a look at these videos and we measured how fast the limb was moving to get back to that original question and we were in for our first surprise  
 so what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ranging from ten meters per second all the way up to twenty three meters per second and for those of you who prefer miles per hour that 's over 
 forty five miles per hour in water  and this is really darn fast in fact it 's so fast we were able to add a new point
  extreme animal movement spectrum  and mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system  so our first surprise 
 so that was really cool and very unexpected so you might be wondering well how do they do it 
 and actually this work was done in the 1960s by a famous
 biologist named malcolm burrows  
 and what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use what 's called a catch mechanism or click mechanism and what this basically consists of is a large muscle that
  takes a good long time to contract and a latch that prevents anything from moving so the muscle contracts  and nothing happens and once the muscle 's contracted completely everything 's stored up the latch flies upward and
 and a very short time for the limb to fly out
 and so i thought that this was sort of the end of the story  this was how mantis  shrimps make these very fast strikes  but then i took a trip to
 the national museum of natural history  and if any of you ever have a chance  backstage of the national museum of natural history is one of the world 's best collections of preserved mantis
  this is serious business for me so this
 what i saw on every single mantis shrimp limb whether it 's a spearer or a smasher is a beautiful saddle shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb 
 and you can see it right here it just looks like a saddle you 'd put on a horse it 's a very beautiful structure  and it 's surrounded by membranous areas and
 those membranous areas suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible
  structure  and this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while and then we did a
 series of calculations and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring there needs to be some kind of 
 mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe and the speed that we observe  and the output of the system
  so we thought ok  this must be
 a spring the saddle could very well be a spring and we went back to those high speed videos again  and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending  
 and i 'll just do that one more time  
 and then if you take a look at the video it 's a little bit hard to see it 's outlined in yellow the saddle is outlined in yellow you can actually see it extending
 over the course of the strike and actually hyperextending  so we 've had very solid evidence showing that that
 actually compresses and extends  and does in fact function as a spring the saddle shaped structure is also known as a hyperbolic paraboloid surface or an anticlastic surface and this is very well known to engineers and architects  
 because it 's a very strong surface in compression
  it has curves in two directions one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces over the surface
 of of this type of shape  so it 's very well known to to engineers not as well known to biologists it 's also known to quite a few
 people who make jewelry because it requires very little material
 to build this type of surface and it 's very strong so if you 're going to build a thin gold structure it 's very nice to have it in a shape that 's
  also known to architects 
 one of the most famous architects is eduardo catalano who popularized this structure  and what 's shown here is a saddle shaped roof that he built that 's eighty seven and a half feet spanwise  
 it 's two and a half inches thick and supported at two points  
 and one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it 's he found it fascinating that you could build
 such a strong structure that 's made of so few materials and can be supported
  by so few points and all of these are the same principles that apply to the saddle shaped spring in stomatopods in biological systems it 's important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it 
 so very interesting parallels between the biological and the engineering worlds and interestingly this turns out the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first described biological hyperbolic paraboloid
  spring that 's a bit long but it is sort of interesting  so the next and final question was well how much force does a mantis shrimp produce if they 're able to break open snails  
 and so i wired up what 's called a load cell  a load cell measures forces and this is actually a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it and when this crystal is squeezed
 the electrical properties change and it which in proportion to the forces that go in so these animals
  are wonderfully aggressive and are really hungry all the time  and so all i had to do was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell  and they 'd smash away at it  
 and so this is 
 this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell 
 and we were able to get some force measurements out and again we were in
  no animal could produce more than one hundred pounds at this size of an animal  and what do you know they immediately overloaded the load cell  so these are actually some old data where i had to find the smallest animals in the lab  and we were able to measure forces of well over one hundred pounds generated by an animal about this big  
 and actually just last week i got a 300 pound load cell up and running  and i 've clocked these animals generating well
  two hundred pounds of force and again i think this will be a world record i have to do a little bit more
 background reading but i think this will be the largest amount of force produced by an animal of a given
 per body mass so really incredible forces and again that brings us back to the importance of that spring in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system
  but that was not the end of the story now  things i 'm making this
  very easy this is actually a lot of work and i got all these force measurements and then i went and looked at the force output of the system and this is just very simple time is on the 
 the force is on the y axis and you can see two peaks  and that was what really got me puzzled 
 the first peak obviously is the limb hitting the load cell  but there 's a really large second peak half a millisecond later
  you 'd expect a second peak for other reasons but not half a half a millisecond later 
 again going back to those high speed videos there 's a pretty good hint of what might be going on 
 here 's that same orientation that we saw earlier  there 's that raptorial appendage there 's the heel and it 's going to swing around and hit the load cell and what i 'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye
  on the surface of the load cell as the limb comes
 flying through  and i hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light audience wow sheila patek 
 and so if we just take that one frame what you can actually see there at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble  
 and what that is is cavitation 
 and cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon
 which occurs when you have areas of water moving at extremely different speeds
 when this happens  it can cause areas of very low pressure  which results in the water literally vaporizing  
 and when that vapor bubble collapses it emits sound light and heat and it 's a very destructive process  and so here it is in the
 stomatopod and again this is a situation where engineers are very
 familiar with this phenomenon because it destroys boat propellers people have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn 't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it just like these pictures show 
 so
 this is a potent
 force in fluid systems 
 and just to sort of take it one step further i 'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail this is taken at twenty thousand frames per second  and i have to
  give full credit to the bbc cameraman tim green for setting this shot up because i could never have done this in a million years
 one of the benefits of of working with professional cameramen 
 you can see it coming in and an incredible flash of light and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail 
 so really just an amazing image  slowed down
 extremely to extremely slow speeds
  and again we can see it in slightly different form there 
 with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces in fact you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb  
 so to solve this quandary of the two force peaks what i think was going on is that first impact is actually the limb hitting the load cell  and the second impact is actually the collapse of the cavitation bubble  and these animals may very well be making use of not
  only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring but the extremes
 of the fluid dynamics and they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail 
 so really fascinating double whammy so to speak
  from these animals so one question i often get after this talk so i figured i 'd answer it now
 is well what happens to the animal
  it 's breaking snails the poor limb must be disintegrating and indeed it does that 's the smashing part of the heel on both these images and it gets worn away in fact i 've seen them wear wear away their heel all the way to the flesh  but one of the convenient things about being an arthropod
 is that you have to molt  and every three months or so these animals molt  and they build a new limb and it 's no
  very convenient solution to that particular problem
  so i 'd like to end on sort of a wacky note laughter
 maybe this is all wacky to to folks like you i don 't know 
 so the saddles that saddle shaped spring has actually been well known to
 biologists for a long time not as a spring but as a visual signal  and there 's actually a spectacular
 colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods  
 and this is quite interesting to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on
 what 's really in all species their spring  and i think one explanation for this could be going back to
  so these animals go into a molting period where they 're unable to strike their bodies become very soft  and they 're literally unable to strike or they will 
 this is for real
 and what they do is up until that time period when they can 't strike they become really obnoxious and awful and they strike everything in sight it doesn 't matter 
  who or what and the second they get into that time point when they can 't strike any more 
  their legs around and it 's one of the classic
 examples in animal behavior of bluffing it 's a  well established fact of these animals that they actually bluff they can 't actually strike but they pretend to and so i
 'm very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their
 ability to strike or their strike force and something about the time period in the molting cycle so sort of an interesting
  strange fact to find a visual visual structure right in the middle of their spring  
 so to conclude
  i mostly want mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators wyatt korff and roy caldwell who worked closely with me on this 
 and also the miller institute for basic research in science which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time and for that i 'm very grateful thank you very much
