  i was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the p o box at the end of the day 
 and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email in facebook in texting or cell phones in general  
 and so while other kids were
  their parents i was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone which was a little frustrating when grandma was in the hospital but
 i was just looking for some sort of scribble some unkempt cursive from my mother  
 and so when i moved to new york city after college and got completely sucker punched in the face by depression i did the only thing i could think of at the time 
 i wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me
 for strangers and tucked them all throughout
  the city dozens and dozens of them i left them everywhere in cafes
 and in libraries at the u n everywhere  
 i blogged about those letters and the days when they were necessary  and i posed a kind of crazy promise to the internet that if you asked me for a hand written letter i would write you one  
 no questions asked 
  my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak a single mother in sacramento a girl being bullied in rural kansas all asking me
 a 22 year old girl who barely even knew her own coffee order to write them a love letter and give them a reason to wait by the mailbox 
 well today i fuel
 a global organization that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media like never before to write and mail strangers
  letters when they need them most but most of all fueled by crates of mail like this one my trusty mail crate
  filled with the scriptings of ordinary people strangers writing letters to other strangers not because they 're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee 
 but because they have found one another by way of letter writing 
  the thing that always gets me about these letters
 is that most of them have been written
 by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper they
 could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters they 're the ones from my generation the ones of us that have grown up into a world
 where everything is paperless  and where some of our best conversations have happened upon a screen 
 we have learned to diary our pain onto facebook and we speak swiftly in one hundred and forty characters or less
 but what if it 's not about efficiency this time  i was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate which is a conversation
  one
  one
  one
