  we are here today because [ the ] united nations have defined goals for the progress of countries  they 're called millennium development goals 
  and the reason i really like these goals is that there are eight of them 
  specifying eight different goals the united nations has said that there are so many things needed
 to change in a country in order to get the good life for people look here you have to end poverty education  gender child and maternal health control infections  
 protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade
  there 's a second reason i like these development goals  and that is because each and every one is measured take child mortality  
 the aim here is to reduce child mortality 
  ninety to two thousand and fifteen that 's a four percent reduction per year
  and this with measuring that 's what makes the difference between
 political talking like this and really going for the important thing a better life for people  and
 what i 'm so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in asia in the middle east in latin america and east 
  europe that [ are ] reducing with this rate and even mighty brazil is going down with five percent per year and turkey with seven percent per year  so there 's good
  news but then i hear people saying there is no progress in africa
  and there 's not even statistics on africa to know what is happening i 'll prove them wrong on both points  
 come with me to the wonderful world of statistics i bring you to the webpage
 where you can take deaths in children below five years of age for all countries it 's done by
  take kenya as an example here you see the data don 't panic don 't panic now i 'll help you through this it looks nasty like in in college when you didn 't like statistics 
 but first thing when you see dots like this you have to ask yourself  from where do the data come 
  there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of the child and it 's sent to the statistical office
  countries like kenya still don 't have that level of organization it exists but it 's not complete because so many deaths
 occur in the home
 with the family and it 's not registered  what we rely on is not an incomplete system we have interviews
  we have surveys and this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and ask her about [ her ] birth history  how many children did you have 
 are they alive if they died at what age and what year 
 and then this is done in a representative sample of thousands of women in the country
 and put together in what used to be called a demographic health survey report  but these surveys are costly  so they can only be done
 five year intervals  but they have good quality  so this is a limitation  and all these colored lines here
 are results each color is one survey  but that 's too complicated for today  so i 'll simplify it for you  and i give you one average point for each survey  this was
 when the experts in the u n have got these surveys in place in their database then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line and the trend line looks like this see here it
 's the best fit they can get of this point but watch out they continue the line beyond the last point
 out into
  and they estimated that in two thousand and eight kenya had per child mortality of one hundred and twenty eight 
 and i was sad  because we could see this this
 reversal in kenya with an increased child mortality in the 90s it was so tragic  
 but in june i got a mail in my inbox from demographic health surveys and it showed good news from kenya  i was so happy this was the estimate of the new survey
  then it just took another three months for [ the ] u n to get it into their server  and on friday we got the new trend line it was down here isn 't it nice
 isn 't it nice yeah 
 i was actually on friday sitting in front of my computer  and i saw the the death rate fall from one hundred and twenty eight to eighty four just that morning  so we
  but now 
 when you have this trend line how do we measure progress i 'm going into some details here because [ the ] u n do it like this they start [ in ] one thousand nine hundred and ninety they measure to two thousand and nine they say zero point nine percent no progress 
 that 's unfair 
 as a professor i think i have the right to propose something differently  i would say  at least do this ten years is enough to follow the trend  it
  and you can see what 's happening now they have two point four percent 
 had i been in the ministry of health in kenya i may have joined these two points  
 so what i 'm telling you is that we know the child mortality  we have a decent trend it
 's coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring mdgs  
 and the reason here for africa is especially important because ' 90s was a bad decade not only
  but across africa the hiv epidemic peaked there was resistance for the old malaria drugs until we got the new drugs we got later the mosquito netting  and there was  socio economic problems which are now being solved at a much better scale  so look at the average here
 this is the average for all of sub saharan africa and [ the ] u n says it 's a reduction with one point eight percent now this sounds a little theoretical
  but it 's not so theoretical  you know these economists  they love money they want more and more of it they want it to grow  so they calculate the percent annual growth rate of [ the ] economy we 
 in public health  we hate child death so we want less and less and less of child deaths  so we we calculate the percent reduction per year but it 's sort of the same percentage if your economy grows with four percent 
  you ought to reduce child mortality four percent if it 's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want
  is this fair now to measure this over nineteen years an economist would never do that 
 i have just divided it into two periods  in the 90s only one point two percent  only one point two percent whereas now 
 second gear it 's like africa had first gear now they go into second gear  
 but even this is not a fair representation of africa because it 's an average
  of reduction in africa  and look here when i take you into my bubble graphs  still here child death
 per one thousand on that axis here we have [ the ] year  
 and i 'm now giving you a wider picture than the mdg i start fifty years ago when africa celebrated independence in most countries  i give you congo which
  ghana lower and kenya even lower  
 and what has happened over the years since then here we go you can see with independence literacy improved  and vaccinations started smallpox was eradicated hygiene 
  was improved and things got better  but then in the ' 80s watch out here congo got into civil war  and they leveled off here 
  but then kenya and ghana go down together still a standstill in congo  that 's where we are today  
 you can see it doesn 't make sense to make an average of this zero improvement
 and this very fast improvement 
 time has come to stop thinking about 
  africa as one place  their countries are so
  and they merit to be recognized in the same way as we don 't talk about europe as one place  i can tell you that the economy in greece and sweden are very different
 everyone knows that  and they are judged each country on how they are doing  so
 let me show the wider picture my country sweden one thousand eight hundred we were up there 
 what a strange personality disorder we must have counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate
  strange it 's sort of embarrassing  but we had that habit in sweden you know that we counted all the child deaths even if we didn 't do anything about it  
 and then you see these were famine years these were bad years and people got fed up with sweden my ancestors moved to the united states  and eventually soon they started to get better and better here and here we got better education and we got health service
 and child mortality came down  we never had a war sweden was
  in peace all this time but look the rate of lowering in sweden was not fast 
 sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early 
 we had primary school actually started in one thousand eight hundred and forty two 
 and then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later  
 you have to realize that the investments
  we do in progress are 
  not about just five years it 's long term investments
 and sweden never reached [ the ] millennium development goal rate three point one percent when i calculated so we are off track
 that 's what sweden is 
 but you don 't talk about it so much  we want others to be better than we were and indeed others have been better let me show you thailand see what a success story thailand from the
  went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels as sweden  and i 'll give you another story egypt 
 the most hidden glorious success in public health 
 egypt was up here in one thousand nine hundred and sixty  higher than congo  the nile delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease  and malaria and a lot of problems and then they got the aswan dam they got electricity in their homes
  increased
 education and they got primary health care and down they went you know  and they got safer water they eradicated malaria and isn 't it a success story  
 millennium development goal rates for child mortality is fully possible  
 and the good thing is that ghana today is going with the same rate as egypt did at its fastest  kenya is now
 speeding up here we have a problem
 we have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill 
 now  let me now bring you to a wider picture 
 a wider picture of child mortality i 'm going to show you the relationship between child mortality on this axis here this axis here is child mortality and here i have the family size 
 the relationship between child mortality and family size
  children per woman six seven eight children per woman this is once again one thousand nine hundred and sixty fifty years ago each bubble is a country the color you can see a continent the dark blue here is sub saharan africa
  and the size of the bubble is the population  and
 these are the so called developing countries  they had high  or very high child mortality and family size
  eight and the ones over there  they were so called western countries  they had low child mortality and small families 
 what has happened 
 what i want you [ to do ] now is to see with your own eyes the relation between fall in child mortality and decrease in family size  
  to see that for yourself  this is what happened now i start the world here we come down
 with the eradication of smallpox better education health service  it got down there china comes into the western box here 
 and here brazil is in the western box  india is approaching the first african countries coming into the western box and we get a lot a new neighbors welcome to a decent life come on we want everyone down there this is the vision we have
  the first african countries here are coming in there we are today
 there is no such thing as a western world and developing world this is the report from [ the ] u n which came out on friday  
 it 's very good levels and trends in child mortality except this page 
 this page is very bad  it 's a categorization of countries 
 it labels developing countries
  i can read from the list here developing countries  republic of korea south korea huh 
 they get samsung  how can they be [ a ] developing country they have here singapore  
 they have the lowest child mortality in the world singapore they bypassed sweden five years ago  and they are labeled a developing country  
 they have here qatar it 's the richest country in the world with al jazeera  how the heck could they be
 the rest here is good the rest is good 
 we have to have a modern concept which fits to the data and we have to realize that we are all going to into this down to here 
 what is the importance now with the relations here look
 even if we look in africa these are the african countries  you can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and
  decreasing family size  even within africa  it 's very clear that this is what happens 
 and a very important piece of research came out on friday from the institute of health metrics and evaluation in seattle showing that almost fifty percent of the fall in child mortality can be attributed to female education 
 that is when we get girls in school we 'll get an impact fifteen to twenty years later
  is a secular trend which is very strong that 's why we must have that  long term perspective  but we must measure the impact over 10 year periods
  it 's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down in the corner where we all would like to live together 
 and of course 
 lowering child mortality is a matter of utmost importance
 from humanitarian aspects it 's a decent life for children we are talking about  
 but it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind because it 's about the environment 
 we will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don 't stabilize the world population
  let 's be clear about that  
 and the way to do that that is to get child mortality down get access to family planning and behind that drive female education and that is fully possible  let 's do it thank you very much
