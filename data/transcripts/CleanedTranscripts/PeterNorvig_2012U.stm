  is both a learner and a teacher this is me being inspired by my first tutor my mom  
 and this is me teaching introduction to artificial
  to two hundred students at stanford university 
 now the students and i enjoyed the class 
 but it occurred to me that while the subject matter of the class is advanced and modern the teaching technology isn 't 
 in fact i use basically the same technology as this 14th century classroom  
 note
 the textbook the sage on the stage and the sleeping guy in the back
  just like today  
 so my co teacher sebastian thrun and i thought  there must be a better way  
 we challenged ourselves to create an online class that would be equal or better in quality
 to our stanford class  but to bring it to anyone in the world for free  
 we announced the class on july 29th and within two weeks  fifty thousand
  people had signed up for it and that grew to one hundred and sixty thousand students from two hundred and nine countries 
 we were thrilled to have that kind of audience  and just a bit terrified that we hadn 't finished preparing the class yet 
 so we got to work  we studied what others had done what we could copy and what we could change 
 benjamin bloom had showed that one on one tutoring works best
  so that 's what we tried to emulate like with me and my mom even though we knew it would be 
 here an overhead video camera is recording me as i 'm talking and drawing on a piece of paper 
 a student said this class felt like sitting in a bar with a really smart friend who 's explaining something you haven 't grasped  but are
  and that 's exactly what we were aiming for 
 now from khan academy we saw that short 10 minute videos worked much better than trying to record an hour long lecture and put it on the small format screen  
 we decided to go even shorter and more interactive our typical video is two minutes  sometimes shorter  never more than six  
 and then we pause for a quiz
  i 'm explaining how a computer uses the grammar of english to parse sentences  
 and here there 's a pause and the student has to reflect understand what 's going on and check the right boxes before they can continue 
 students learn best when they 're actively practicing  
 we wanted to engage them to have them grapple with ambiguity and guide them to synthesize the key ideas themselves  we mostly avoid questions like here 's a formula now tell me
  the value of y when x is equal to two we preferred open ended questions 
 one student wrote now i 'm seeing bayes networks and examples of game theory everywhere i look 
 and i like that kind of response that 's just what we were going for we didn 't want students to memorize the formulas  we wanted to change the way they looked at the world 
 and we succeeded 
  i should say the students succeeded  
 and it 's a little bit ironic that we set about to disrupt traditional education  and in doing so we ended up making our online class much more like a traditional 
  college class than other online classes  most online classes the videos are always available  you can watch them any time you want  
  you may not ever get around to it so we brought back the innovation of having due dates you could watch the videos
 any time you wanted during the week but at the end of the week  you had to get the homework done  this motivated the students to keep going  and it also meant
 that everybody was working on the same thing at the same time  so if you went into a discussion forum you could get an answer from a peer within minutes 
  by the students themselves  
 from daphne koller and andrew ng we learned the concept of flipping the classroom students watched the videos on their own  and then they come together to discuss them 
 from eric mazur i learned about peer instruction 
 that peers can be the best teachers  because they 're the ones that remember what it 's like to not understand  
 sebastian and i have forgotten some
 of
  couldn 't have a classroom discussion with tens of thousands of students so we encouraged and nurtured these online forums  
 and finally  from teach for america i learned that a class is not primarily about information more important is motivation and determination it was crucial that the students see 
  that we 're working hard for them and they 're all supporting each other  
 about half of the one hundred and sixty thousand students watched at least one video each week  and over twenty thousand finished all the homework putting in fifty to one hundred hours they got this statement of accomplishment  
 so what have we learned 
 well  we tried some old ideas and some new and put them together  
 but there are more ideas to try  sebastian 's teaching another class now i 'll do one in the fall 
 stanford coursera
  udacity mitx and others have more classes coming it 's a really exciting time
