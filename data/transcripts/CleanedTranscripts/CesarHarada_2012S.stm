  and radioactivity 
 on the top line this is the bp oil spill  billions of barrels of oil gushing in the gulf of mexico
  the middle line is millions of tons of plastic debris accumulating in our ocean  
 and the third line is radioactive material leaking from fukushima nuclear power plant in the pacific ocean  
 well the three big problems have in common
 that they are man made problems but they are controlled by natural forces
  this should make us feel very terribly awful as much as it should make us feel hopeful because
 if we have the power to create these problems  we may as well have the power to remediate these problems but what about natural forces  
 well that 's exactly what i want to talk about today is how we can use these natural forces to remediate these man made problems  
 when the bp oil spill happened i was working at mit  and i was in charge of developing
  an oil spill cleaning technology  and i had a chance to go in the gulf of mexico and meet some fishermen
 and see the terrible conditions in which they were working more than seven hundred of these boats which are fishermen boats repurposed
 with oil absorbent in white and oil containment in orange were used but they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface 
 and the health of the cleaners were
  very deeply affected 
 i was working on a very interesting technology at mit but it was a very long term view of how to develop technology  
 and it was going to be a very expensive technology 
 and also it would be patented  so i wanted to develop something that we could develop very fast that would be cheap
  in the gulf of mexico  and that would be using renewable energy  
 so i quit my dream job  and i moved to new orleans  and i kept on studying how the oil spill was happening 
 currently what they were doing is that they were using these small fishing boats  and they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt 
 if you 're using the exact same amount of surface of
  just paying attention to natural patterns and if you 're going up the winds you can collect a lot more material 
 if you 're multiplying the rig  so you multiply how many layers of absorbent you 're using you can collect a lot more  but it 's extremely difficult to move oil absorbent against the winds 
 the surface currents and the waves these are enormous forces  so the very simple idea was to use the ancient technique of sailing and tacking of the wind to capture or intercept the oil that is drifting down the wind
  so
 this didn 't require any invention we just took a simple sailing boat and we tried to pull something long and heavy  
 but as we tacked back and forth what we lost was two things we were losing pulling power and direction  
 and so i thought  what about if we just take the rudder from the back of the boat to the front 
 would we have better control  
 so i built this small sailing robot with the rudder at the front and
  was trying to pull something very long and heavy so that 's a 
 object just to pull  and i was surprised with just a  14 centimeter rudder i could control four meters of absorbent 
 then i was so happy that i kept playing with the robot  and so you see the the robot has a
 front rudder here normally it 's at the back 
  realized that the maneuverability of this was really amazing  and i could avoid an obstacle at the very last second more maneuverable than a normal boat 
 then i started publishing online and some friends from korea  they started
 being interested in this and we made a boat which has a front rudder and a back rudder  so we started interacting with this 
 and it was slightly better although it was very small and a bit off balance but then we thought  what
  and that 's the first boat in history that completely changed the shape of the hull in order to control it 
 and the properties of sailing that we get are very superior compared to a normal boat  when we 're turning we have the feeling of
  this is low speed  low wind speed  and the maneuverability is very increased  and here i 'm going to do a small jibe  and look at the position of the sail  
 what 's happening is that because the boat changes shape the position of the front sail and the main sail are different to the wind we 're catching wind from both sides  
 and this is exactly what we 're looking
  if we want to pull something long and heavy  we don 't want to lose pulling power nor direction  
 so i wanted to know if this was possible to put this at an industrial level  so we made a large boat with a large sail and with a very light hull inflatable very small footprint so we have a very big
 size and power ratio  after this we wanted to see if we could implement this
 and automate the system so we used the same system but we added a structure to it so we could activate the machine  so we used the same
 bladder inflated system  and we took it for testing  
 so this is happening in the netherlands  we tried in the water without any skin or ballast just to see how it works  
 and then we mounted a camera for controlling it  
 but quickly we saw that we would need a lot more weight at the bottom  so we had to take it back to the lab
 and then we built a skin around it we put batteries remote controllers  and then we put
  the water and then we we let it go in the water and see how well it would work so
 let some rope out  and hope it 's going to work  and
 it worked okay but we still have a long way our small prototype has given us good insight that it 's working very well  but we still need to work a lot more on this  
 so what we are doing is an accelerated evolution of sailing technology we went from a back rudder to a front rudder to
  two rudders to multiple rudders to the whole boat changing shape  and the more we are moving forward  and the more the design looks simple and
 cute but i wanted to show you a fish because
 in fact it 's very different from a fish a fish will move because by by changing like this but our boat is propelled by the wind still
  and the hull controls the trajectory  so
 i brought to you for the first time on the ted stage protei number eight  it 's not the last one but it  it 's a good one for making demos  
 so the first thing as i show you in the video is that we may be
 able to
 control the trajectory of a sailing boat better or we may be able to never be in irons so never facing the wind  we always can catch the wind from both sides
  but new properties of a sailing boat  so
 if you 're looking
 at the boat from this side  this might remind you of an airplane profile an airplane  when you 're moving in this direction starts to lift  and that 's how it takes off now
 if you 're taking the same system  and you 're putting vertical you 're bending  and if you 're moving this this way forward  
 your instinct will tell you that you might go this way  but if you 're moving fast enough
  what we call lateral lift  so we could get further or closer to the wind  
 other property is this a normal sailing boat has a centerboard here and a rudder at the back 
 and these two things are what creates most resistance and turbulence behind the boat but because this doesn 't have either
  we hope that if we keep working on this hull design we can improve and have less resistance 
 the other thing is most boats when they reach a certain speed  and they are going on waves they start to hit and slap on the surface of the water and a lot of the energy moving forward is lost  
 but if we 're going with the flow  if we pay attention to natural patterns instead of trying to be strong but if you 're going with the flow  we may absorb a lot of environmental noises so the the wave energy 
 to actually
 save some energy to move forward  
 so we may have developed the technology which is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy  but
 the idea is what is the purpose of technology if it doesn 't reach the right hands  normal technology or innovation happens like this somebody has an interesting
  some other scientist or engineer they take it to the next level they make a theory about it and maybe they patent it and then some industry will make a contract of
 exclusivity to manufacture and sell it and then eventually a buyer will buy it and we hope that they are going to use [ it ] for a good purpose 
 what we really want is that this innovation happens continuously the inventor and engineers and also the manufacturers and everybody works at the same
  but this would be sterile if this was happening in a parallel and uncrossed process  what you really want is not a sequential not parallel development you want to have a network of innovation you want everybody like we 're doing now to work at the same time  
 and that can only happen if these people all together decide to share the information  
 and that 's exactly what open hardware is about it 's to replace
 competition by
  to transform any new product into a new market  
 so what is open hardware essentially open hardware is a license it 's just an intellectual property setup  
 it means that everybody is free to use modify and distribute  and in exchange we only ask for two things the name is credited the name of the project
 and also the people who make improvement they share back with the community so it 's a very simple condition  and i started this project alone in a garage in new orleans
  but quickly after i wanted to publish and share this information so i made a kickstarter which is a crowd fundraising platform  and in about one month we fundraised thirty thousand dollars 
 with this money i hired a team of young engineers from all over the world and we rented a factory in rotterdam in the netherlands  
 we were peer learning we were engineering  we were
  most importantly we were trying our prototypes in the water as often as possible to fail as quickly as possible to learn from 
 this is a proud member of protei from korea  and on the right side this is a multiple masts design proposed by a team in mexico  
 this idea really appealed to gabriella levine in new york  and so she decided to prototype this idea that she saw  and she documented every step
  which is a website for sharing inventions less than one week after this is a team in
 eindhoven it 's a school of engineering  they made it  but they eventually published a simplified design they
 also made it into an instructable  and in less than one week they had almost ten thousand views  and they got many new friends 
 we 're working on also simpler technology not that complex with younger people
 and also older people like this dinosaur is from mexico
  so protei is now an international network of innovation for selling technology using this
 and what puts us together is that we have a common at least  global understanding of what the word business is or what it should be 
 this is how most work
  what 's most important is to make lots of profit  and you 'll be using technology for that 
 and people will be your work force instrumentalized  
 and environment is usually the last priority it will be just a way to say  greenwash your audience and say increase your price tag 
 what we 're trying to do or what we believe  because this is how we believe the world really works is that without the environment you have nothing 
 we have the people so we need to protect each other yes and
  and profit is necessary to make this happen thank you very much 
 if we have the courage to understand or accept that this 
 actually how the world really works  and this is the order of priority that we need to choose 
  for developing environmental technology because we need to share information  
 what 's next for us so this small machine that you 've seen we 're hoping to make small toys like one meter remote control protei that you can upgrade so replace the remote control parts
 by androids  so the mobile phone  and arduino micro controller so you could be controlling this from your mobile phone your tablet  then what we want
  versions so we can test the maximum performance of these machines so we can go at very very high speed  so imagine yourself you are laying down in a flexible torpedo sailing at high speed 
 controlling the shape of the hull with your legs and controlling the sail with your arms  so that 's what we 're looking for developing 
 and we replace the human being to go for example for measuring radioactivity you don 't want a human to be sailing those robots with batteries motors
  sensors  
 this is what our teammates we dream of at night we hope that we can sometime clean up oil spills 
 or we can gather or collect plastic in the ocean  
 or we can have swarms of our machines controlled by
 multi player video game engines to control many of these machines to monitor coral reefs
 or to monitor fisheries
 is that we can use open hardware technology to better understand and protect our oceans
