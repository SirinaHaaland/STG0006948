  a time of social upheaval and questioning and on a personal level an awakening sense of idealism 
 the war in vietnam was raging the civil rights movement
 was under way
 and pictures had a powerful influence on me 
 our political and military leaders were telling us one thing and photographers were telling us another 
 i believed the photographers and so did millions of other americans 
 their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism they not only recorded history they helped change the course of history 
 their pictures became
 became part of our collective consciousness and as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience change became not only possible but inevitable 
 it puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact 
 what happens at ground level 
 far from the halls of power happens to ordinary
 citizens one by one and i understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view 
 it gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice my ted wish 
 theres a vital story that needs to be told
 and i wish for ted to help me gain access to it
 and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting
 ways to use news photography in the digital era  thank you very much
