  great pleasure to be here it 's a great pleasure to speak after brian cox from cern i think
 cern is the home of the large hadron collider what ever happened to the small
  is the small hadron collider because the small hadron collider once was the big thing  
 now the small hadron collider is in a cupboard  
 overlooked and neglected  you know when the large hadron collider started  and it didn 't work 
 and people tried to work out why it was the small hadron collider team who sabotaged it because they were so jealous  
 the whole hadron collider family needs unlocking
  the lesson of brian 's presentation in a way all those fantastic pictures
 is this really 
 that vantage point determines everything that you see what brian was saying was science has opened up successively different vantage points from which we can see ourselves  and that 's why it 's so valuable  
 so the vantage point you take determines virtually everything that you will see the question that you will ask will determine
  much of the answer that you get and so if you ask this question  where would you look to see the future of education 
 the answer that we 've traditionally given to that is very straightforward at least in the last twenty years you go to finland finland is the best place in the world to see school systems  the finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there 's a very high suicide
  but by golly they are qualified  and they have absolutely amazing education systems 
 so we all troop off to finland and we wonder at the social democratic miracle of finland
 and its cultural homogeneity and all the rest of it and then we struggle to imagine how we might
 bring lessons back  well  so for this last year with the help of cisco who sponsored me for some balmy reason to do this
 i 've been looking somewhere else because actually radical innovation does sometimes come
  from the very best but it often comes from places where you have huge need
 unmet latent demand
 and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work traditional high cost solutions which depend on professionals  which is what schools and hospitals are so i ended 
  up in places like this this is a place called monkey hill  it 's one of the hundreds of favelas in rio
  most of the population growth of the next fifty years will be in cities 
 we 'll grow by six cities of twelve million people a year for the next thirty years  
 almost all of that growth will be in the developed world  almost all of that growth will be in places like monkey hill this is where you 'll find the fastest growing young populations
  of the world so if you want recipes to work for virtually anything health education government politics
 and education you have to go to these places and if you go to these places you meet people like this this is a guy called juanderson 
 at the age of fourteen 
 in common with many 14 year olds in the brazilian education system he dropped out of school
 it was boring and juanderson instead went into what provided kind of opportunity and hope in the place that he lived
  which was the drugs trade  
 and by the age of sixteen with rapid promotion he was running the drugs trade in ten favelas he was turning over two hundred thousand dollars a week he employed two hundred people he was going 
  to be dead by the age of twenty five and luckily he met this guy  who is rodrigo baggio  the owner of the first laptop to ever appear in brazil
 computers donated by corporations put them  into community centers in favelas
 and created places like this what turned juanderson around was technology for learning that made learning fun and accessible 
 or you can go to places like this this is kibera  which is the largest slum in east africa millions of people
  stretched over many kilometers  and there i met these two azra
 on the left maureen on the right they just finished their kenyan certificate of secondary education 
 that name should tell you that the kenyan education system borrows almost everything from britain circa one thousand nine hundred and fifty
 but has managed to make it even worse  so there are schools in slums like this  they 're places like this that 's where maureen went to school  they 're private schools there are no state schools
  in slums and
 the education they got was pitiful  
 it was in places like this this a school set up by some nuns in another slum called nakuru half the children in this classroom have no parents because they 've died through 
 aids the other half have one parent because the other parent has died through aids
  the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and queens of kenya or britain  they are to stay alive to earn a living to not become hiv positive  
 the one technology that spans rich and poor in places like this is not anything to do with industrial technology it 's not to do with electricity or water  it 's the mobile 
  phone if you want to design from scratch virtually any service in africa  you would start now with
 or you could go to places like this this is a place called the madangiri settlement colony which is a very developed slum about 
  minutes outside new delhi where i met these
 characters who showed me around for the day  the remarkable thing about these girls and the sign of the kind of social revolution sweeping through the developing world is that these girls are not married
  ten years ago they certainly would have been married now they 're not married and they want to go on to study further to have a career  they 've been brought up by mothers who are illiterate  who have never ever done homework 
 all across the developing world there are millions of parents tens hundreds of millions who for the first time are with children doing homework and exams
  and the reason they carry on studying is not because they went to a school like this  this is a private school  this is a fee pay school this is a good school  this is
 the best you can get in hyderabad in indian education the reason they went on studying was this  this is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum by a revolutionary 
 social entrepreneur called sugata mitra who has conducted the most radical experiments showing that children in the right conditions can learn on their
  own with the help of computers 
 those girls have never touched google  they know nothing about wikipedia  imagine what their lives would be like if you could get that to them 
 so if you look as i did through this tour  
 and by looking at about a hundred case studies of different social entrepreneurs working in these very extreme conditions look at the recipes
  that they come up with for learning they look nothing like school  what do they look like 
 well  education is a global religion and education plus technology is a great source of hope you can go to places like this this is a school 
  three hours outside of sao paulo most of the children there have parents who are illiterate  many of them don 't have electricity at home
  it completely obvious to use computers websites make videos  so on and so forth when you go to places like this what you see is
  that education in these settings works by pull not push  most of our education system is push i was literally pushed to school  
  if you want to attract people like juanderson who could for instance  buy guns  
 wear jewelry ride motorbikes and get girls through the drugs trade and you want to attract him into education having a compulsory curriculum doesn 't really make sense that isn 't really going to attract him  
 you need to pull him  and so education needs to work by pull not push  and so the idea of a curriculum is completely
  irrelevant in a setting like this  you need to start education from things that make a difference to them in their settings what does that well
 the key is motivation  and there are two aspects to it one is to deliver extrinsic motivation that education has a payoff  
 our education systems all work on the principle that there is a payoff but you have to wait quite a long time that 's too
  long if you 're poor  
 waiting ten years for the payoff from education is too long when you need to meet daily needs when you 've got siblings to look after or a business to help with so you need 
  education to be relevant and help people to make a living there and then  often 
  rocha in belo horizonte in the third largest city in brazil  he 's invented more than two hundred games to teach virtually any subject under the sun in the 
  schools and communities that taio works in the day always starts in a circle and always starts from a question  
  from a lesson or started from the premise that
 you have to engage people first before you can possibly teach them 
 our education systems you do all that stuff afterward  if you 're lucky  sport drama music these things they teach through 
 they attract people to learning because it 's really a dance project or a circus project or the best example of all
  el sistema in venezuela it 's a music project  
 and so you attract people through that into learning not adding that on after all the learning has been done and you 've eaten your cognitive greens  
 so el sistema in venezuela uses a violin as a technology of learning taio rocha uses making soap as a technology of learning 
 and what you find when you go to these schemes
  is that they use people and places in incredibly creative ways  masses of peer learning 
 how do you get learning to people when there are no teachers 
 when teachers won 't come when you can 't afford them  and even if you do get teachers  what they teach isn 't relevant to the communities that they serve  well you create your own
  or you bring in specialist skills but you find ways to get learning that 's relevant to people through technology people and places that are different so this is a school in a bus on a
 building site in pune the fastest growing city in asia 
 pune has five thousand building sites  it has thirty thousand children on those building sites that 's one city  
 imagine that urban explosion
  that 's going to take place across the developing world and how many thousands of children will spend their school years on building sites  
 well this is a very simple scheme to get the learning to them through a bus  
 and they all treat learning not as some sort of academic analytical activity but as that 's something that 's productive 
 something you make something that you can do perhaps earn a living from
 so i met this character steven  
 he 'd spent three years in nairobi living on the streets because his parents had died of aids and he was finally brought back into school  not by the offer of gcses but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter a practical making skill  
 so the trendiest schools in the world high tech high and
  espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity here  there isn 't really an option learning has to be productive in order for it to make sense  
 and finally they have a different model of scale and it 's a chinese restaurant model of how to scale  
 and i learned it from this guy  who is an amazing character he 's probably the most remarkable social entrepreneur in education in the world his name is madhav chavan  
 and he created something called pratham
 pratham runs preschool play groups for now twenty one million children in india it 's the largest ngo in education in the world 
 and it also supports working class kids going into indian schools he 's a complete revolutionary he 's actually a trade union organizer by background and that 's how he learned the skills to build his organization
  when they got to a certain stage pratham got big enough to attract some pro bono support from mckinsey
 mckinsey came along and looked at his model and said you know what you should do with this madhav you should turn it into mcdonald 's  
 and what you do when you go to any new site is you kind of roll out a franchise and it 's the same wherever you go it 's reliable and
 people know exactly where they are and there will be no mistakes and madhav said why do we have to do it that way why can 't we do it more
  like the chinese restaurants there are chinese restaurants everywhere but there is no chinese restaurant chain  yet everyone knows
 what is a chinese restaurant they know what to expect  even though it 'll be subtly different and the colors will be different and the name will be different  you know a chinese restaurant when you see it 
 these people work with the chinese restaurant model same principles different applications and different settings not the mcdonald 's model
 the mcdonald 's model scales the chinese restaurant model spreads  so
 mass education started with social entrepreneurship in the 19th century  and that 's desperately what we need again on a global scale  and what can we learn from all of that  
 well we can learn a lot because our education systems are failing desperately in many ways  they fail to reach the
  people they most need to serve  they often hit their target but miss the point
 improvement is increasingly difficult to organize  
 our faith in these systems incredibly fraught and this is just a very simple way of understanding
 what kind of innovation what kind of different design we need there are two basic types of innovation there 's sustaining innovation  which will sustain an
  existing institution or an organization  and disruptive innovation that will break it apart create some different way of doing it 
 there are formal settings schools colleges  hospitals in which innovation can take place and informal settings communities families social networks  
 almost all our effort goes in this box sustaining innovation in formal settings getting a better version of the essentially
  bismarckian school system that developed in the 19th century  
 and as i said the trouble with this is that in the developing world there just aren 't teachers to make this model work you 'd need millions and millions of teachers in china india nigeria and the rest of developing world to meet need 
 and in our system we know that simply doing more of this won 't eat into deep educational inequalities
  especially in inner cities and former industrial areas  so that 's why we need three more kinds of innovation 
 we need more reinvention and all around the world now you see more and more schools reinventing themselves  they 're recognizably schools but they look different 
 there are big picture schools
 in the
  fourteen of them  only two of them are in schools most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools
 there is an amazing school in northen queensland called jaringan  and they all have the same kind of features  highly collaborative very personalized 
 often pervasive technology
  learning that starts from questions and problems and projects not from
  knowledge and curriculum  
 so we certainly need more of that but because so many of the issues in education aren 't just in school they 're in family and community 
 what you also need  definitely is more on the right hand side you need efforts to supplement schools  
 the most famous of these is reggio emilia
  learning system to support and encourage people in schools the most exciting is the harlem children 's zone 
 which over ten years led by geoffrey canada has through a mixture of schooling and family and community projects  
 attempted to transform not just education in schools but the entire culture and aspiration
 of about ten thousand families in harlem
  we need more of that completely new and radical thinking you can go to places
 an hour away less
 from this room just down the road  which need that 
 which need radicalism of a kind that we haven 't imagined  and finally you need transformational innovation that could imagine getting learning to people in completely new and different ways  
 so we are on the verge
  every child up to the age of fifteen who wants a place in school will be able to have one in two thousand and fifteen it 's an amazing thing  
 but it is unlike cars which have developed so rapidly and orderly  
 actually the school system is recognizably an inheritance from the 19th century from a bismarkian model of german schooling that got taken up by english reformers and
 often
  by
 religious
 missionaries taken up in the united states as a force of social cohesion
  and then in japan and south korea as they developed it 's recognizably 19th century in its roots  and of course it 's a huge achievement and of course it will bring great things 
 it will bring skills and learning and reading but it will also lay waste to imagination 
  to social confidence  it will stratify society as much as it liberates it 
 and we are bequeathing to the developing world school systems that they will now spend a century trying to reform that is why we need really radical 
  thinking  and why radical thinking is now more possible and more needed than ever in how we learn
