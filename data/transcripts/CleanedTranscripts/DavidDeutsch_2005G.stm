  we 've been told to go out on a limb and
 say something surprising so i 'll try and do that but i want to start with two things that everyone
 already knows  and the first one in fact is something that
 has been known for most
  of recorded history  and that is that
 the planet earth or the solar system or our environment or whatever is
 uniquely suited to sustain
 our evolution or creation as it used to be thought and our
  and most important our future survival
 nowadays this idea has a dramatic name spaceship earth  
 and the idea there is that outside the spaceship the universe is implacably hostile and inside is all we have all we depend on 
 and we only get the one chance if we mess up our spaceship we 've got nowhere else to go 
  to what was believed for most of human history 
 human beings are not in fact  the hub of existence 
 as stephen hawking famously said we 're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that 's in orbit around a typical star which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy and so on 
 now
 the first of those two things that everyone knows is is kind of saying that we 're
 at a very un typical place  uniquely suited and so on and the second one is saying that that we 're at a typical place and 
 especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions 
 then they seem
 a little bit to conflict with each other
  but that doesn 't prevent them from both being completely false and they are  so
 let me start with the
 with the second one typical 
 well  is this a typical place well let 's look around you know look in a random direction and we see
 a wall
 chemical scum and
 that 's not typical of the universe at all all you 've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction
 and look back  and you won 't see any walls or chemical scum at all all you see is a blue planet and if you go further than
  'll see
 the sun the solar system and the stars and so on but that 's still not typical of the universe because stars
 come in galaxies
 and most places in the universe a typical place in the universe is nowhere near any galaxies  so
 let 's go out further till we 're outside the galaxy and look back and yeah there 's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us and
 at this point
  we 've come
 one hundred thousand light years from here  but we 're still nowhere near
 a typical place in the universe to get to a typical place you 've got to go one thousand times as far as that 
 into intergalactic space and so what
  in the universe look like well at enormous expense  ted has arranged a 
 immersion virtual reality rendering of
 the view from intergalactic space  can we have the lights off please so we can see it 
  intergalactic space is completely dark pitch dark  it 's so dark that if you were to
 be looking at the nearest star to you and that star were to explode as a supernova 
 and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you you still wouldn 't be able to see even a glimmer
 that 's how big and how dark the universe is and that 's despite the fact that
 a supernova is so bright so brilliant an event 
 that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light years 
 and yet from intergalactic space it 's so far away you wouldn 't even see it it 's also very cold out there
  three degrees above absolute zero  and it 's very empty  the vacuum there is one million times less dense
 than the highest vacuum that our best technology on earth can currently create so that 's how
 different a typical place is from this place  
  this place is so can we have the lights back on please  thank you 
 now how do we know about an environment that 's so far away and so different and so alien
 from anything we 're used to well the earth our environment in the form of us
 is creating knowledge well what does that mean well  look out even
  than we 've just been i mean from here with a telescope and you 'll see things that look like stars they 're called 
  originally meant 
  which means things that look a bit like stars but they 're not stars and we know what they are 
 billions of years ago and billions of light years away  the material at the center of
  super massive black hole and then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse and some of the matter
 back out in the form of tremendous jets which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of i think it 's a trillion suns  
 now  the physics of the human brain
 could hardly be more unlike the physics
  of such a jet  we couldn 't survive for an instant in it  language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets it would be a bit like experiencing 
  a supernova explosion but at point blank range and for millions of years at a time 
 laughter and yet
  happened in precisely such a way
 that billions of years later on the other side of the universe  some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe and model and predict and explain above all
 there 's your reference
 what was happening there in reality the one
 physical system the brain contains an accurate working model of the other the quasar
 not just a superficial image of it though it contains that as well  
 but an explanatory model embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure now that is knowledge  
 and if that weren 't amazing enough the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time 
 that is the growth of knowledge
 the laws of physics have this special property 
 that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure
 and to do it more and more so over time  so we are a chemical scum that is
  this chemical scum has universality 
 its structure contains with ever increasing precision the structure of everything this place and not other places in the universe is a hub which contains within itself
 the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality  and so far from being insignificant the fact that the laws of physics allow this or even mandate
 that this can happen
 is one of the most important things about the physical world 
 now how does the solar system   our environment in the form of us
 acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe well  one thing that 's
 true about stephen hawking 's remark i mean it is true but
  the wrong emphasis one thing that 's true about it is that
 it doesn 't do it with any special physics there 's no special dispensation no miracles involved  it does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance 
 one of them is matter because
 the the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing information processing is computation computation requires a computer there 's no known way of making a computer without matter 
  need energy to make the computer and most important to make the media in effect onto which we record the knowledge that we discover and then
 thirdly less tangible but just as essential for the  open ended creation of knowledge of explanations is
 evidence 
  environment is inundated with evidence we happen to get round to testing let 's say  
 newton 's law of gravity about three hundred years ago 
 but the evidence that we used to do that was was falling down on every square meter of the earth for billions of years before that and will continue to fall
 for billions of years afterwards  
 and the same is true for all the other sciences as far as we know 
 evidence to
  discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking on our planet our location
 is saturated with evidence and also with matter and energy 
 out in intergalactic space those three prerequisites for the open ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply as i
  it 's empty it 's cold and it 's dark out there 
 or is it now actually that 's just another parochial misconception because
 imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space the same size as our home the solar system now that cube is very empty 
  by human standards  but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter 
  make say a self contained space station on which there 's a colony of scientists that that are devoted to creating an open ended stream of knowledge and so on 
 now it 's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space
 and and form it into other elements and so on but the thing is in a comprehensible universe if something isn 't forbidden by the laws of
  physics  
 then what could possibly prevent us from doing it other than knowing how in other words it 's a matter of knowledge not resources   if we could do that we 'd automatically have an energy supply because
 this transmutation would be a fusion reactor
 and evidence well  again it 's dark out there to human senses but all you 've got to do is take a telescope even one of
 look out and you 'll see the same galaxies as we do from here  and
 with a more powerful telescope you 'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies you 'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics and
 locally there you could build particle accelerators and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry and so on 
 probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips
  because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life bearing planet and back  
 but i have to tell you and sorry richard but i never did like biology field trips much and
 i think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years 
 so in fact intergalactic space does contain
 all the prerequisites for the open ended creation of knowledge any such cube anywhere in the universe could become
 the same kind of hub that we are if
 the knowledge of how to do so were present there  
 so we 're not in a uniquely hospitable place  if intergalactic space is capable of creating an
  explanations  
 then so is almost every other environment so is the earth  so is a polluted earth  
 and the limiting factor there and here is not resources  because they 're plentiful but knowledge which is scarce 
 now this cosmic
 view may and i think ought to make us feel very special
  but it should also make us feel vulnerable because it means that without the specific knowledge that 's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe  we won 
  't survive them all it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light years away and we 'll all be dead
  all sorts of things from astrophysics to
 scientific experiments gone wrong  and most importantly to
 terrorism with weapons of mass destruction  
 and he thinks that civilization has only a fifty percent chance of surviving this century i think he 's going to talk about that later in the conference  
 now  i don 't think that
 probability is the right category to discuss this issue in but i do agree with him about this we can survive and we can fail
  to survive 
 but it depends not on chance  but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time
  the danger is not at all unprecedented species go extinct all the time  civilizations end 
 the overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history  and if we want to be the exception to that
 then logically our only hope
 is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others namely our special relationship with the laws of physics 
 our ability to create new explanations  new knowledge to be a hub of existence  
 so let me now apply this to
  current controversy  not because i want to advocate any particular solution but just to illustrate the kind of thing i mean and the controversy is global warming  
 now  i 'm a physicist but i 'm not the right kind of physicist in regard to global warming i 'm just a layman  
 and the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory  
 and according to that
  theory  it 's already too late to avoid a disaster because
 if it 's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent co2 emissions with something like the kyoto protocol with its constraints on economic activity and its
 enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars or whatever it is then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure
  actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem merely to postpone it by a little 
 so it 's already too late to avoid it and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger it was probably already too 
  late in the 1970s when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age in which
  billions would die 
 now the lesson of that seems clear to me and i don 't know why it isn 't informing public debate 
 it is that we can 't always know  when we know of an impending disaster 
 and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself 
 then there 's not going to be much
  no precautions and no precautionary principle
 can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee  hence  we need a stance of 
 not just
  true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure but that 's only if we know what to prevent if you
 've been punched on the nose then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching
  you how to avoid punches 
 if medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only then it would achieve very little of either the world is buzzing 
  at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs  
 and not at all costs  but efficiently and cheaply and some such plans exist things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide
 at the moment these things are fringe research they 're not central to the human effort to face this
  problems in general  
 and with problems that we are not aware of yet the ability to put right not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely
 is our only hope not just of solving problems but of survival  so
 take two stone tablets  and carve on them on one of them
