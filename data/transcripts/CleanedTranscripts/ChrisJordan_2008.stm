  my work is about the
 behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously on a collective level 
 and what i mean by that it 's the behaviors that we 're in denial about  
 and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness 
  individuals we all do these things all the time everyday  it 's like when you 're mean to your wife because you 're mad at somebody else  
 or when you drink a little too much at a party just out of anxiety  
 or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt  or whatever  and
 when we do these kind of things when three hundred million people do unconscious behaviors then it can add up to a catastrophic
  consequence that nobody wants and no one intended  and that 's what i look at with my photographic work  this is an image i just recently completed that is
 when you stand back at a distance it looks like some kind of neo gothic cartoon image of a factory spewing out pollution
  and as you get a little bit closer  it starts looking like lots of pipes like maybe a
 chemical plant or a refinery or maybe a
  hellish freeway interchange  
 and as you get all the way up close you realize that it 's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups  
 and in fact this is one million plastic cups  which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights in the united states every six hours 
 we use four million cups a day on
  airline flights and virtually none of them are reused or recycled they just don 't do that in that industry 
 now that number is dwarfed by the number of paper cups we use every day  
 and that is forty million cups a day for hot beverages most of which is coffee  i couldn 't fit forty million cups on a canvas but i was able to put four hundred and ten thousand 
 that 's what four hundred and ten thousand cups looks like that 's fifteen minutes of our cup consumption  and if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life that 's the size it would be
  and there 's an hour 's worth of our cups  and there 's a day 's worth of our cups you can still see the little people way down there that 's as high as a 42 story building and
 i put the statue of liberty in there as a scale reference 
 speaking of justice there 's another phenomenon going on in our culture that i find deeply troubling and that is that america right now  has the largest percentage of its population in prison of any country on earth
  one out of four people one out of four humans in prison
 are americans imprisoned in our country  
 and i wanted to show the number the number is two point three million americans were incarcerated in two thousand and five  and that 's gone up since then but we don 't have the numbers yet so i wanted to show two point three million prison uniforms
  and
  in the actual print of this piece each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge they 're tiny they 're barely visible as a piece of material  and to show two point three million of them 
 required a canvas that was larger than any printer in the world would print  and so i had to divide it up into multiple panels that are ten feet tall by twenty five feet wide  
  every time i look at this this piece i always wonder if my mom 's whispering to my dad he finally folded his laundry 
 i want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction  and this particular one is about cigarette addiction  i wanted to
 make a piece that shows the actual number of americans who die from cigarette smoking 
 more than four hundred thousand people die in the united states every year from smoking cigarettes  and so this piece is made up of lots and lots of
  boxes of cigarettes  and as you slowly step back you see that it 's a painting by van gogh  called skull with cigarette 
 it 's a strange thing to think about that on nine eleven when that tragedy happened three thousand americans died and do you remember the response  
 it reverberated around the world  and
 will continue to reverberate through
  will be something that we talk about in one hundred years  and yet on that same day one thousand one hundred americans died from smoking  
 and the day after that another one thousand one hundred americans died from smoking  and every single day since then one thousand one hundred americans have died and today one thousand one hundred americans are dying from cigarette smoking and we aren 't talking about it
 we dismiss it the tobacco lobby  it 's too strong we just dismiss it out of our consciousness  
 and knowing what we
  know
 about the destructive power of of cigarettes  we continue to allow our children our sons and daughters to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking  
 and this is what the next piece is about this is just lots and lots of cigarettes sixty five thousand cigarettes  which is equal to the number of teenagers who will start smoking this month and every month in the u s more than seven hundred thousand
 children in the united states aged eighteen and under begin smoking every year 
 one more strange epidemic in the united states that that i want to acquaint you with is this
 this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs  this is an image i 've made out of
 lots and lots of vicodin well actually i only had one vicodin that i scanned
  scanned
 lots and lots of times 
 and so as you stand back you see two hundred and thirteen thousand vicodin pills which is the number of hospital emergency room visits yearly in the united states attributable to abuse 
  and misuse of prescription painkillers and and anti anxiety medications
  drug overdoses are prescription medications a strange phenomenon  
 this is a piece that i just recently completed about another tragic phenomenon and that is the phenomenon  this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery 
 three hundred and eighty four thousand women  american
  for elective breast augmentation surgery  
 it 's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift
  given to young girls who are about to go off to college 
 so i made this image
 out of barbie dolls  and so as you stand back
 you see this kind of floral pattern and as you get all the way back you see thirty two thousand barbie dolls  which represents the number
  of breast augmentation surgeries that are performed in the u s each month  the vast majority of those are
 on women under the age of twenty one and strangely enough the only plastic surgery
 that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction and most of that is being done by men 
 now i want to emphasize that these are just examples  i 'm not holding these out as being the biggest issues
  they 're just examples  and the reason that i do this it 's because
 i have this fear that we aren 't feeling enough as a culture right now  there 's this kind of anesthesia in america at the moment
 we 've lost our sense of outrage 
 our anger
  and our grief about what 's going on in our culture right now what 's going on in our country the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world
  they 've gone missing these feelings have gone missing our cultural joy our national joy is nowhere to be seen  
 and one of the the causes of this i think 
 is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind
 of of worldview  this holoptical worldview  this holographic image that we 're all trying to create in our mind of of the interconnection of things
  footprints one thousand miles away of the things that we buy  the social consequences ten thousand miles away of of the daily decisions that we make as consumers as we try to build this view  and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture  
 the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers
  the hundreds of millions in the billions and now in the trillions  bush 's new budget is in the trillions  and these are numbers that our brain just doesn 't have the ability to comprehend 
 we can 't make meaning out of these enormous statistics  
 and so that 's what i 'm trying to do with my work is to take these numbers these statistics from the raw language of data  
 and to translate them into a more universal visual language that can be felt
 because my belief is if we can feel these issues if we can feel these things more deeply then they 'll matter to us
 more than they do now  and if we can find that 
 then we 'll be able to find within each one of us what it is that we need to find to face the big question 
 which is how do we change 
 that to me is the big question
  that we face as a as a people right now how do we change how do we change as a culture  and how do we each individually
 take responsibility for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of and
 that is our own behavior 
 my belief is that you don 't have to make yourself bad
 to look at these issues  
 i 'm not pointing the finger at america in a blaming way  i 'm simply saying this is who we are right now  
 and if there are things that we see that we don 't like about our culture  then we have a choice
 the degree of integrity that each of us can
  can
 bring to the surface to bring to this question the depth of character
 that we can summon as we show up for the question of how do we change
 it 's already defining us as individuals and as a nation  and it will continue to do that on into the future
  and it will profoundly affect
 the well being the quality of life of the billions of people who are going to inherit
 the results of our decisions  
 i 'm not speaking abstractly about this  
 i 'm speaking this is who we are in this room
 right now in this moment
