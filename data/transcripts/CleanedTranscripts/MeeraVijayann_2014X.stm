  talking about empowerment is odd  because when we talk about empowerment what affects us most are the stories  
 so i want to begin with an everyday story what is it really like to be a young woman in india now 
 i 've spent the last
 twenty seven years of my life in india  lived in three small towns two major cities and i 've had several experiences  
 when i was seven a private tutor who used to come home to teach me mathematics
 molested me 
 he would put his hand up my skirt 
 he put his hand up
  skirt and told me he knew how to make me feel good
 at seventeen a boy from my high school circulated an email
 detailing all the sexually aggressive things he could do to me
 because i didn 't pay attention to him 
 at nineteen  i helped a friend whose parents had forcefully married her to an older
  man escape an abusive marriage 
 at twenty one when my friend and i were walking down the road one afternoon 
 a man pulled down his pants and masturbated in front of us 
 we called people for help and nobody came 
  when i was walking home one evening  
 two men on a motorcycle attacked me  i spent two nights in the hospital recovering from trauma and injuries  
 so
 throughout my life i 've seen women
 family friends colleagues live through these experiences  and they seldom talk about it 
 so in simple words life in india is not easy
 but today i 'm not going to talk to you about this fear i 'm going to talk to you about an interesting path of learning that this fear took me on 
 so what happened one night in december two thousand and twelve changed my life  
 so a young girl a 23 year old student  boarded a bus in delhi with her male friend 
 there were six men on
  the bus young men who you might encounter every day
 in india  and the chilling account of what followed was played over and over again in the indian and international media 
 this girl was raped repeatedly  
 forcefully penetrated with a blunt rod  beaten  bitten and left to die 
 her friend was gagged attacked and knocked unconscious
 she died on the 29th of december 
 and at a time when most of us here were preparing to welcome the new year india plunged into darkness 
 for the first time in our history men and women in indian cities
 woke up to the horrific truth about the true state of women in the country
  like many other young women i was absolutely terrified i couldn 't believe that something like this could happen in a national capital  
 i was angry and i was frustrated  
 but most of all i felt utterly completely helpless  
 but really what do you do right some write blogs some ignore it some join protests i did all of it in fact that was what everyone was doing two years ago
 so the media was filled with stories about
 all the horrific deeds that indian men are capable of 
 they were compared to animals sexually repressed beasts in fact so alien and unthinkable was this event in an indian mind
 that the response from the indian media public and politicians proved
 one point 
 no one knew what to do and no one wanted to be responsible for it 
 in fact these were a few insensitive comments which were made in the media by prominent people in response to sexual violence against women in general  
 so the first one is made by a member of parliament the second one is made by a spiritual leader  and the third one was actually the defendants
  when the girl was fighting for her life and she passed away 
 now as a woman watching this day after day i was tired  
 so as a writer and gender activist i have written extensively on women 
 but this time i realized it was different because a part of me realized i was a part of that young woman too 
 and i decided i wanted to change this so
 i did something spontaneous hasty  i logged
  citizen journalism platform called ireport  
 and i recorded a video talking about what the scene was like in bangalore  
 i talked about how i felt i talked about the ground realities and i talked about the frustrations of living in india  
 in a few hours  the blog was shared widely
  comments and thoughts poured in from across the world in that moment a few things occurred to me 
 one technology was always at hand for many young women like me 
 two like me most young women hardly use it to express their views  
 three  i realized for the first time that my voice mattered  so in the months that followed
 i covered a trail of events in bangalore which had no
 space in the mainstream news 
 in cubbon park which is a big park in bangalore  i gathered with over one hundred others when groups of young men came forward to wear skirts to prove that clothing does not invite rape 
 when i reported about these
  felt i had charge i felt like i had a channel to release all the emotions i had inside me  
 i attended the town hall march when students held up signs saying kill them hang them 
 you wouldn 't do this to your mothers or sisters 
 i went to a candlelight vigil where citizens gathered together to talk about the issue of sexual violence openly  
  the reactions confused me
  while supportive comments poured in from across the world  as did vicious ones  so some called me a hypocrite some called me a victim a rape apologist some even said i had a political motive  
 but this one comment kind of describes
  what we are discussing here today  
 but i was soon to learn that this was not all 
 as empowered as i felt with the new liberty that this citizen journalism channel gave me  
 i found myself in an unfamiliar situation 
 so sometime last august i logged onto facebook and i was looking through my news feed and i noticed there was a link that was being shared by my friends  i clicked on the
  it led me back to
 a report uploaded by an american girl called michaela cross  the report was titled india  the story you never wanted to hear 
 and in this report she recounted her firsthand account of facing sexual harassment in india  
 she wrote there is no way to prepare for the eyes the eyes that every day stared
  such entitlement at my body with no change of expression whether i met their gaze or not 
 walking to the fruit seller 's or the tailor 's i got stares so sharp that they sliced away bits of me piece by piece 
 she called india a traveler 's heaven and a woman 's hell  she said she was stalked  groped and masturbated at  now late that evening the
  it was on
 news channels across the world everyone was discussing it it had over a million views a thousand comments and shares  
 and i found myself witnessing a very similar thing 
 the media was caught in this vicious cycle of opinion and outburst and no outcome whatsoever  
 so that night as i sat wondering how i should respond
  i found myself filled with doubt you see as a writer i approached this issue as an observer
 as an indian i felt embarrassment and disbelief 
 and as an activist i looked at it as a defender of rights  but as a citizen journalist 
 i suddenly felt very vulnerable  
 i mean here she was a young woman
 was using a channel to talk about her experience just as i was and yet i felt unsettled  
 you see no one ever tells you that true empowerment comes from giving yourself the permission to think and act 
 empowerment is often made to sound as if it 's an ideal it 's a wonderful outcome when we talk about empowerment we often talk about
 giving people access to materials
  giving them access to tools  but the thing is empowerment is an emotion it 's a feeling the first step to empowerment
 is to give yourself the authority  
 the key to independent will  and for women everywhere no matter who we are or where we come from 
 that is the most difficult step 
 we fear the sound of our own voice for it means admission but it is this that gives us the power to change our environment
  this situation where i was faced with so many different kinds of realities  i was unsure how to judge because i didn 't know what it would mean for me  
 i feared to judge because i didn 't know what it would be if i didn 't support the same view as this girl i didn 't know what it would mean for me if
 i  i was challenging someone
  it was simple i had to make a decision should i speak up or should i stay quiet  
 so after a lot of thought 
 i recorded a video blog in response and i told michaela well there are different sides to india  and i also 
  tried to explain that things would be okay and i expressed my regret for what she had faced and a few days later  i was invited to talk on
  air with her and
 for the first time i reached out to this girl who i had never met who was so far away  but yet i felt so close to 
 since this report came to light  more young people than ever were discussing sexual harassment on the campus  
 and the university that michaela belonged to gave her the assistance she needed
  the university even took measures to train its students to equip them with the skills that they need to confront challenges such as harassment  
 and for the first the time i felt i wasn 't alone 
 you see if there 's anything that i 've learned as an active citizen journalist
  over the past few years it is our dire lack as a society to actively find avenues where our voices can be heard 
 we don 't realize that
 when when we are standing up we are not just standing up as individuals 
 we are standing up for our communities our friends our peers most of us say that women are denied their rights  but the truth
  women deny themselves these rights in a recent survey in india ninety five percent of the women
 who work in i t aviation hospitality and call centers said they didn 't feel safe returning home alone after work in the late hours or in the evening 
 in bangalore where i come from this number is eighty five percent
  rural areas in india  
 if anything is to go by the recent gang rapes in badaun and acid attacks in odisha and aligarh are supposed to go by 
 we need to act really soon 
 don 't get me wrong the challenges that women will face in telling their stories is real  
 but we need to start pursuing and trying to identify mediums to participate in our system and not just pursue the media
  blindly 
 today  more women than ever are standing up and questioning the government in india  and this is a result of that courage 
 there is a sixfold increase in women reporting harassment and the government passed the criminal law act in two thousand and thirteen
  to protect women against sexual assault as i end this talk i just want to say
 that i know a lot of us in this room have our secrets  
 but let us speak up let us fight the shame and talk about it it could be
 a platform a community your loved one whoever or
 whatever you choose  but let us speak up the truth is the end to this problem begins with us thank you
