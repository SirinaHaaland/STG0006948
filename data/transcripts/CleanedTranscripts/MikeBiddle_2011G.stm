  i 'm a garbage man  and you might find it interesting that i became a garbage man  because i absolutely hate waste 
 i hope within the next ten minutes to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life and i 'd like to start at the very beginning think back when you
  were just a kid how did look at the stuff in your life  perhaps it was like these toddler rules it 's my stuff if i saw it first 
 the entire pile is my stuff if i 'm building something 
 the more stuff that 's mine the better  and of course  it 's your stuff if it 's broken
  well after spending about twenty years in the recycling industry it 's become pretty clear to me that we don 't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults  and let me tell you why i have that perspective 
 because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people 's discarded stuff now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff 
 but it 's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world well less than one percent
  in fact the united nations estimates that there 's about eighty five billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year and that 's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream  
 and if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth that number well more than doubles  and of course the more developed the country the bigger these mountains  
 now when you see these mountains  most people think of garbage 
 we see
 above ground mines and the reason we see mines is because there 's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place 
 and it 's becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams  because as we 've heard all week at ted 
 the world 's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff and of course  they want the toys
  the tools that many of us take for granted  and what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day  it 's mostly many types of plastics and many types 
  of metals and the metals we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world and the
  we get from oil  
 which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract 
 and these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we 're already starting to see today 
 the good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end of life stuff and starting to recycle our end of life stuff  particularly in regions of the world like here in europe
 that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner
  most of what 's extracted from our  end of life stuff if it makes it to a recycler are the metals 
 to put that in perspective and i 'm using steel as a proxy here for metals because it 's the most common metal
 if your stuff makes it to a recycler  probably over ninety percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose plastics are a whole other story
 well less than ten percent are are recovered in fact it 's more like five percent most of it 's incinerated or landfilled now most people think that 's because plastics are a throw away material have very little value
  but actually plastics are several times more valuable than steel  and there 's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel  
  's predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another 
 they have very different densities they have different electrical and magnetic properties  and they even have different colors  so it 's very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials 
 plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range they have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties  and any plastic can be
  any color as you probably well know so the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don 't work for plastics  
 another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world and sadly to say  particularly from the united states where we don 't have any recycling policies in place like here in europe
 finds its way to developing countries for
  people for as little as a dollar a day  pick through our stuff they extract what they can which is mostly the metals circuit boards and so forth and they leave behind mostly what they can 't recover which is again mostly the plastics  
 or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here  and they extract the metals by hand 
  i call this environmental arbitrage  and it 's not fair it 's not safe and it 's not sustainable 
 now because the plastics are so plentiful and by the way those other methods don 't lead to the recovery of plastics obviously
 but people do try to recover the plastics  this is just one example this is a photo i took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in mumbai india 
 they store the plastics on the roofs they bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these and people try very hard to separate the plastics by color by shape by feel by any technique they can 
 and sometimes they 'll resort to what 's known as the burn and sniff technique where they 'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic  
 none of these techniques result in any
  amount of recycling in any significant way  and by the way  please don 't try this technique at home  
 so what are we to do about this space age material at least what we used to call a space aged material these plastics  well i certainly believe that it 's far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke  
 so about twenty years ago i literally started in my garage tinkering around trying to figure out how to separate these very
  similar materials from each other and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends in the mining world actually and in the plastics world and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world because after all we 're doing above ground mining  
 and we eventually broke the code this is the last frontier of recycling it 's the last major material to be recovered in any
 significant amount on the earth and we finally figured out how to do it and in the process we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics 
 the traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals you breakdown the molecules you recombine them in very specific ways to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day  
  we said there 's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics and not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint 
  and it 's plentiful as i hope that you 've been able to see from the photographs  
 and because we 're not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them  we 're using a mining approach to extract the materials we have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment  
 we have enormous energy savings i don 't know how many other projects on the planet right now can save eighty to ninety percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way  
  plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life 
 our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them  
 and we make a drop in replacement for that plastic that 's made from petrochemicals 
 our customers get to enjoy huge co2 savings they get to close the loop with their products  and they get to make
  the short time period i have i want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this it starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits they recover the metals and leave behind what 's called shredder residue it 's their waste a
 very complex mixture of materials but predominantly plastics  
 we take out the things that aren 't plastics such as the metals they missed  carpeting foam  rubber  wood glass  paper you name
  even an occasional dead animal unfortunately  
 and it goes in the first part of our process here which is more like traditional recycling we 're sieving the material we 're using magnets we 're using air classification it looks like the willy wonka factory at this point 
 at the end of this process we have a mixed plastic composite many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics  this goes into the more sophisticated part of our process and the really hard work multi step separation process begins  
 we grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail we use a very highly automated process
  to sort those plastics  not only by type  but by grade  and out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic one type one grade  
 we then use optical sorting to color sort this material  we blend it in 
  50 000 lb blending silos we push that material to extruders where we melt it push it through small die
  and we chop those strands into what are called pellets  and this becomes the currency of the plastics industry 
 this is the same material
 that you would get from oil  and today  we 're producing it from your old stuff and it 's going right back
 into your new stuff
  instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country
 or literally going up in smoke you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products 
 in your office 
 or back at work in your home and these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic replacing virgin plastic to make their new products
  so i hope i 've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life  we took our clues from mother nature 
 mother nature wastes very little reuses practically everything  
 and i hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer that 's a label i 've always hated my entire life
 and think of yourself as just using resources in one form until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time and
  finally i hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to if it 's broken  
 it 's my stuff thank you for your time
