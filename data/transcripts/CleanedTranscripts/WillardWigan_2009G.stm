  what i wanted to do is to
 show the world
 that the little things can be
 the biggest things
 we all seem to think that 
 you know if we look down on the ground there 's nothing there  and we use the word nothing 
 nothing doesn
  because there is always something my mother told me that  when i was a child that i should always respect the little things
  what made me do this work i shall go into my my story this all started when i was age five
  what made me do it  at school  i will admit this academically i couldn 't express myself so
 i was 
  my world was seen as less  so
 i decided i didn 't really want to be a part of that world  i thought i need to retreat
 into something else  so when my mother used to take me to school she thought i was at school and i used to
 do a u turn when her back was turned and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden
  now the one time i was in the shed and
 my mother suspected something thinking i was at school 
 my mother was like the woman in tom and jerry
  so you 'd just see her feet 
  i was hiding in the shed like that and all of a sudden  
 and then i saw her legs  and then she said
 grabbed me like that because my mother was quite big and she lifted me up and she says how come you 're not at school i told her i couldn 't face it because the
  the teacher was treating me ridiculing me and
 using me as an example of failure so i
 told her at that age  obviously i couldn 't express it that way but i told her i didn 't feel right  
 and then she just said you 're going back to school tomorrow and walked off and i didn 't expect that  because i expected one of these
  but i didn 't get it so i 'm
  as i looked down on the ground  i noticed there was some ants running around
 and i went into this little fantasy world and i thought these ants 
 are they looking for the queen ant or do they need somewhere to live so i thought perhaps if i made these ants some
  so i did  
 and how i set about that i got some splinters of wood and i sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass  constructed this little apartment  
 well it
 looked like a little shanty shed when i 'd finished but i thought perhaps the ant won 't know it 'll probably move in
 so they did that was a bit crude at the time and i made all these little apartments and little merry go rounds seesaws and swings little ladders  
 and then i encouraged the ants to come ' round by putting sugar and things like that  
 and then i sat down and all the ants
 came along and all i could hear was is this for us
 and they moved in and decided not to pay me any rent
  this world that we can 't see  so i realized that there was more to life than just
 everything that we see around us that 's huge so i started to educate myself on this molecular level  
 and as i as i got older i continued i showed my mother my mother told me to take it smaller  now
 i shall show you something here
 explain as you can see  
 that 's a pinhead
  me to do this was a gentleman called peter huf and he says to me willard can you put my house on a pinhead 
 so i say how are you going to fit in there 
 and then he said to me i don 't believe you can do it can you really do it and i says
 try me and then he said but i don 't believe that you can do this so i said 
 ok so to cut a long story short i went home went underneath the microscope  and i crushed up
 a piece of glass  crushed it up and underneath
  underneath the microscope there were splinters of glass some of them were quite jagged  
 so i was crushing up these pieces of glass  which as you can see that 's the actual frame of the house  and
 the actual roof is made up of
 a fiber which i found in my sister 's old teddy bear 
 so i got the teddy bear and i said do you mind if i pull out one of your fibers
 so i did  and i looked at it beneath the microscope and some of  it was flat so i decided to slice these up with the tool that i make
 by i sharpen the the end of a needle into a blade  and then i i actually slow down my whole nervous system  and then i
 work between my heartbeat
  move and at the same time i have to watch i don 't inhale my own work at the same time 
 because that has happened to me 
 so what i did like i said come back to the glass  i found these little
  bits of glass  and i had to make them square  so i 'm thinking how can i do this so what i did i got an oilstone broke the edge of an oilstone off 
 and what i did i took pieces of glass and i started to rub them  i used a little tweezer which i made from a hair clip  
 and i built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn 't crush the
  and then i started rubbing very very gently 
 till some of the edges were quite square  
 and then i constructed it and how i constructed it is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead  and then pushing the glass in with its own friction  
 and as i was doing it  what happened the instrument that i used turned into a catapult  and it went like
  huf isn 't going to be very happy when i told him his house has gone to another into the atmosphere somewhere 
 so to cut the story short i decided that i had to go back and do it so i found some more and i decided to sort of construct
  my breath working between my heartbeat  and making sure everything is leveled because it 's such a
 a small
 sculpture  nothing can can go wrong  and i decided to build it up then i used fibers out of my jumper  which i held
 and stretched and made the beams going around the house  and the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed i used a money spider 's web
 to actually attach certain things
  things which sent me insane but i managed to do it and
 when i finished it  i came back the next day i noticed that the house was occupied 
 have we ever heard of a dust mite
  darren dust mite and his family moved in
  as you can see  bart simpson is having a little argument  
  they 're arguing about the space on the pin there 's not enough room for the two of them  so i
 didn 't think he was going to throw bart off i think he was just warning him actually but this one was made out of a nylon tag
 out of my shirt what i did i plucked the tag out
 and
 put it underneath the microscope i used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end
  what i did is the same process where i just kind of hold my breath and
 just work away
 very very slowly manipulating the plastic 
 cutting it because it behaves different whenever you work on that level things behave different because it 's on this molecular level things change
 and they act different and sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air and
  different things happen  but i had to make a little barrier going around it out of cellophane to stop
 stop it moving then static electricity set in  and it went  
 and i 'm trying to remove it and the static is interfering with everything so
 there is sweat dripping off my head because i have to carve homer simpson like
  and after i 've cut out the shape then i have to make sure that there is room for bart 's neck 
 so after i 've done the same thing then i have to paint it  and after i 've actually sculpted them
  i have to paint them  i experimented with a
 i found a dead fly and i plucked the hair off the fly 's head decided to make a paintbrush
  even though they get on our nerves i would never kill an insect because
  all creatures great and small there is a hymn that says that so
 what i decided to do is to pluck
 fine hair out of my face  and i looked at it
 underneath the microscope that was the paintbrush  
 and whilst i 'm painting i have to be very careful because the paint starts to to turn into little blobs and it starts to
 dry very quickly  so i have to be very quick
  if i 'm not it will end up looking not like what it 's supposed to look like it could end up looking like humpty dumpty
 or somebody else  so i have to be very very careful 
 this one took me approximately  i would say  six to seven weeks 
  rough estimate sometimes five six to seven weeks you can 't always anticipate 
 as you can see  that 's charlton heston brought down to size
  i enjoyed your film that 's why as you can see there 's an aphid fly there that 's just to show the scale
 and the actual size
 of the sculpture  i would say it probably measures a
 quarter of a millimeter in america they say a period stop  so say if you cut a period stop in half
 a full stop that 's about the size of the whole thing it
 's made the chariot is made of gold
 and charlton heston is made of
 a floating fiber which i took out of the air  when the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers  and what i normally do is
 walk ' round a room
  to find one 
 and then i put it underneath the microscope  i remember one time i was doing it and the window was open  
 and there was a lady standing by the bus stop and she saw me walking around like this and
 then she looked at me  and then i went
  to actually do this thing the actual chariot is made of gold  i had a 24 karat gold ring and i cut off a little flake of gold and i bent it ' round and made it into the chariot 
 and the horse is made from nylon and the spider 's web is for the reins on the horse to get the symmetrical shape of the horse was very difficult  
 because i had to get the horse to rear up and look as though it was in some kind of action
  i did this one a gentleman seen it and said to me 
 there 's no way you can do this you must have used some kind of machine there 's no way a man can do that it must be a machine 
 so i says ok then if you say it 's a machine
  most famous statue in the world this one   i would
  to put the torch on the top
  that one is more or less the same type of process the bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand
  because i wanted to get a bit of the stone effect i used a microscopic shard of diamond to actually carve the actual base  
 well i can look at this one and i can be very proud of this  because that statue has always
 sort of kept an image in my head of you know the beginning of people
 coming to america so it 's sort of ellis island and seeing america for the first time  and that 's the first thing they saw so i wanted to have that little image
  and this is it 
 and we all know that is
 the hulk i wanted to create movement
 in the eye of a needle because we know we see needles but people aren 't familiar with the eye of a needle apart from putting a thread through it  so i broke the needle
  and
 made a needle look like the hulk 's broken it it 's
 i had to make little holes in the base of the needle to shove his feet in so most of my work i don 't use glue they go in with their own friction  
 and that 's how i managed to do it  as you can see he 's looking at the moment he 's got a little grimace on his face
 and
  mouth must be probably about three microns so the eyes are probably about one micron or something  
 that ship there
 that 's made from 24 karat gold  and i normally rig it with the web of a money spider  
 but i had to rig it with strands of glue  because the web of the spider  it was
 sending me insane because i couldn 't get the web to move off and
  that  's 24 karat gold and it 's constructed i built it  constructed each plank of gold  and the whole thing is sort of
 symmetrical the flag had to be made out of little strands of gold  it 's almost like
 doing a surgical operation
 to get this thing right
  it 's something i wanted to do just to show how i could get the symmetrical shape the actual rigging on the reins on the horse are made from the same sort of thing
 and that was done with a
 particle from
  green around there by scraping the particles off a green shirt and then pressed onto the needle it 's very painstaking work  but
 the best things come in small packages
