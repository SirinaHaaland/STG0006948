  i 'm
 very pleased to be here today to talk to you all about
 how we might repair the damaged brain  
 and i 'm particularly excited by this field because as a neurologist myself  i believe that this offers one of the great ways that we might be able to offer hope
 for patients who today live with devastating
 and yet untreatable diseases of the brain  
 so here 's the problem  
 you can see here the picture of somebody 's brain with alzheimer 's disease next to a healthy brain  
 and what 's obvious is in the alzheimer 's brain  ringed red there 's obvious damage atrophy scarring  
 and i could show you equivalent pictures from other disease  multiple sclerosis motor neuron disease
  parkinson 's disease  even huntington 's disease  and they would all tell a similar story  
 and collectively these brain disorders represent one of the major public health threats of our time  
 and the numbers here are really rather staggering 
 at any one time there are thirty five million people today living with one of these brain diseases  and the annual cost globally is
  seven hundred billion dollars i mean just think about that that 's greater than one percent of the global gdp  
 and it gets worse  because all these numbers are rising because these are by and large
  living longer  so the question we really need to ask ourselves is why
  given the devastating impact of these diseases to the individual 
 never mind the scale of the societal problem  why are there no effective treatments  
 now in order to consider this i first need to give you a crash course in how the brain works
 so in other words i need to tell you everything i learned at medical school 
 but believe me this isn 't going to take
  so the brain is terribly simple it 's made up of four cells  
 and two of them are shown here  there 's the nerve cell  and then there 's the myelinating cell or the insulating cell  it 's called oligodendrocyte 
 and when these four cells work together in health and harmony 
 they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity  and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think to emote
  emote to remember to learn move feel and so on 
 but equally  each of these individual four cells alone or together can go rogue or die  
 and when that happens you get damage  you get damaged wiring you get disrupted connections  
 and that 's evident here
 with the slower conduction 
 but ultimately this damage will manifest as disease clearly  
 and if the starting dying nerve cell is a motor nerve for example  you 'll get motor neuron disease  
 so i 'd like to give you a real life illustration of what happens with motor neuron disease  
 so this is a patient of mine called john john i saw just last week in the clinic  and i 've asked john to tell us something about what were his
  problems that led to the initial diagnosis of motor neuron disease
  further down in that journey  and i 've now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament
  what these two clips show
 is not just the devastating consequence of the disease  but they also tell us something about the shocking pace of the disease  
 because in just eighteen months eighteen months 
 a fit adult man has been rendered wheelchair and 
 and let 's face it john could be anybody 's father brother or friend so that 's what happens when the motor nerve dies
  what happens when that myelin cell dies  you get multiple sclerosis  so the scan on your left
 is an illustration of the brain  and it 's a map of the connections of the brain  
 and superimposed upon which are areas of damage we call them lesions of demyelination but they 're damage  and they 're white  
 so i know what you 're thinking here you 're thinking
  god this bloke came up and said he 's going to talk about hope  
 and all he 's done is give a really rather bleak and depressing tale i 've told you these diseases are terrible they 're devastating numbers are rising 
 the costs are ridiculous and worst of all we have no treatment  where 's the hope 
 well you know what i think there is hope  
 and there 's hope in this next
  of this brain section of somebody else with m s because what it illustrates
 is amazingly the brain can repair itself it just doesn 't do it well enough  
 and so again there are two things i want to show you first of all is the damage of this patient with  m s and again it 's another one of these white masses  
 but crucially the area that 's ringed red
 highlights an area that is pale blue but that area that is pale blue was once white  so it was damaged it 's now repaired
 just to be clear it
 's not because of doctors it 's in spite of doctors not because of doctors this is spontaneous repair 
 it 's amazing and it 's occurred because there are stem cells in the brain even 
 which can enable new myelin new insulation to be laid down over the damaged nerves  
 and this observation is
 important for two reasons the first
 is it challenges one of the orthodoxies that we learnt at medical school or at least i did  admittedly last century
  which is that the brain doesn 't repair itself  unlike say the bone
 or the liver but actually it does but it just doesn 't do it well enough  and the second thing it does and it gives us a very clear direction of travel
  you don 't need to be a rocket scientist to know what to do here  you simply need to find ways of promoting the endogenous spontaneous repair that occurs anyway  
 so the question is  why if we 've known that for some time as we have  why
 do we not
 have those treatments  and that in part reflects the complexity of drug development now
 drug development you might think of as a rather expensive but risky bet
 and the odds of this bet are roughly this they 're ten thousand to one against 
 because you need to screen about ten thousand compounds to find that one potential winner  
 and then you need to spend fifteen years and spend over a billion dollars  and even then you may not have a winner  
 so the question for us is can you change the rules of the game and can you shorten the odds 
 and in order to do that you have to think where is the bottleneck
  in this drug discovery and one of the bottlenecks is early in drug discovery all that screening occurs in animal models  
 but we know that the proper study of mankind is man to borrow from alexander pope  so the question is can we study these diseases using human
 material and of course
  absolutely we can we can use stem cells  and specifically we can use human stem cells  
 and human stem cells are these extraordinary but simple cells that can do two things 
 they can self renew or make more of themselves  
 but they can also become specialized to make bone liver  or crucially nerve cells  maybe even the motor nerve cell or the myelin cell  
 and the challenge has long been can we harness the power
  the undoubted power of these stem cells
 in order to realize their promise for regenerative neurology  
 and i think we can now  and the reason we can is because there have been several major discoveries in the last ten twenty years one of them was here in edinburgh  and it must be the only celebrity sheep dolly  
 so dolly was made in edinburgh  and dolly was an example of the first
 cloning of a mammal from an adult cell  but i think the even more significant
  breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today
 was made in two thousand and six by a japanese scientist called yamanaka  
 and what yamaka did in a fantastic form of scientific cookery 
 was he showed that four ingredients just four ingredients could effectively convert any cell adult cell  into a master stem cell
  and the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate  
 because what it means that from anybody in this room but particularly patients you could now generate a bespoke personalized tissue repair kit 
 take a skin cell  make it a master pluripotent cell  so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their disease  
 both to study but potentially to treat 
 now the idea of that at medical school this is a recurring theme isn 't it me and medical school would have been ridiculous  but it 's an absolute reality today
  and i see this as the cornerstone of regeneration repair and hope  
 and whilst we 're on the theme of hope for those of you who might have failed at school there 's hope for you as well
  because this is the school report of john gerdon [ i believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist on his present showing this is quite ridiculous ] so they didn 't think much of him then 
 but what you may not know is that he got the nobel prize for medicine just three months ago  
 so to return to the original problem
  what is the opportunity of these stem cells or this disruptive technology for repairing the damaged brain  which we call regenerative neurology  
 i think there are two ways you can think about this as a fantastic 21st century drug discovery tool 
 and or as a form of therapy so i want to tell you a little bit about both of those in the next few moments 
 drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this
 you take a patient with a disease  let 's say motor neuron disease  you take a skin sample you do the pluripotent
 reprogramming as i 've already told you 
 and you generate live motor nerve cells that 's straightforward because that 's what pluripotent cells can do but crucially you can then compare their behavior
  but healthy counterparts ideally from an unaffected relative that way you 're matching for genetic variation  
 and that 's exactly what we did here this was a collaboration with colleagues in london chris shaw  in the 
  and tom maniatis 
 and what you 're looking at and this is amazing these are living growing motor nerve cells from a patient with motor neuron disease it happens to be an inherited form i mean
  just imagine that this would have been unimaginable ten years ago  
 so apart from seeing them grow and put out processes we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce  but crucially we can then track their individual health
 and compare the diseased motor nerve cells to the healthy ones  and when you do all that
 and put it together  you realize that the diseased ones which is represented in the red line are two and a half times more likely to die
 than the healthy counterpart
 and the crucial point about this is that you then have a fantastic assay to discover drugs  
 because what would you ask of the drugs and you could do this through a high throughput automated screening system 
 you 'd ask the drugs give me one thing find me a drug that will bring the red line closer to the blue line  
 because that drug will be a high value candidate that you could probably take direct
  to human trial and almost bypass that bottleneck that i 've told you about in drug discovery with the animal models if that makes sense it
 's fantastic  
 but i want to come back to how you might use stem cells directly to repair damage  and again there are two ways to think about this  and they 're not mutually exclusive 
  and i think in the long run the one that will give us the biggest dividend but it 's not thought of that way just yet 
 is to think about those stem cells that are already in your brain and i 've told you that 
 all of us have stem cells in the brain  even the diseased brain  and surely the smart way forward is to find ways that you can promote and activate those stem cells in your brain already
 to react and respond appropriately to damage to repair it that will be the future there will be drugs that will do that
  but the other way
 is to effectively parachute in cells  transplant them in to replace dying or lost cells  even in the brain  
 and i want to tell you now an experiment it 's a clinical trial that we did which recently completed  which is with colleagues in ucl david miller in
  so this study was very simple we took patients with multiple sclerosis
 and asked a simple question would stem cells from the bone marrow be protective of their nerves  so what we did was we took this bone marrow  
 grew up the stem cells in the lab  and then injected them back into the vein i 'm making this sound really simple  it took five years off a lot of people 
  and it put gray hair on me and caused all kinds of issues  but
 conceptually it 's essentially simple 
 so we 've given them into the vein  right  
 so in order to measure whether this was successful or not we measured the optic nerve as our outcome measure 
 and that 's a good thing to measure in m s because patients with  m s sadly suffer with problems with vision loss of vision  unclear vision 
 and so we measured the size of the optic nerve using the scans with david miller three
  times twelve months six months and before the infusion
 and you can see the gently declining red line  
 and that 's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking which makes sense because their nerves are dying we then gave the stem cell infusion
 and repeated the measurement twice three months and six months
 and to our surprise almost the line 's gone up that suggests that the intervention has been protective
 i don 't think myself that what 's happened is that those stem cells have made new myelin or new nerves 
 what i think they 've done is they 've promoted the endogenous stem cells or precursor cells to do their job wake up lay down new myelin  
 so this is a proof of concept i 'm
 very excited about that 
 so i just want to end with the theme i began on which was regeneration and hope  so here i 've asked john
 what his hopes are for the future
