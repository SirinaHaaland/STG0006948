  this afternoon is
 something a little different than what 's scheduled foreign policy you can
 figure that out by watching i don 't know rachel maddow or somebody but i want to talk about
 young people and structure young people and structure
  was last wednesday afternoon
 at a school in brooklyn new york at cristo rey high school run by the jesuits  
 and i was talking to this group of students and take a look at them 
 they were around me in three directions you 'll noticed that almost all of them are minority  
 you 'll notice that the building is rather austere it 's an old new york school building nothing fancy they still have old blackboards and whatnot
  there are about three hundred kids in this school and the school 's been going now for four years  and they 're about to graduate their first class
 twenty two people are graduating and all twenty two are going to college  
 they all come from homes where there is for the most part just one person in the home  usually the mother or the grandmother  and that
  and they come here for their education and for their structure now i had this picture taken  and it was put up on my facebook page last week 
 and somebody wrote in huh 
 why does he have him standing at attention like that and then they said but he looks good 
 he does look good  because kids need structure 
 and the trick i play in all of my school appearances is that when i get through with my little homily to the kids
  i then invite them to ask questions and when they raise their hands i say come up and i make them come up and stand in front of me 
 i make them stand at attention like a soldier put your arms straight down at your side  look up open your eyes stare straight ahead and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear 
 no slouching no pants hanging down none of that
  and this young man his name is his last name cruz he loved it that 's all over his facebook page and it 's gone viral 
 so people think i 'm being unkind to this kid no we 're having a little fun 
 and the thing about it i 've done this for years the younger they are the more fun it is 
 when i get six and seven year olds in a group i have to figure out how to keep them quiet you know that they 'll always start yakking  and so i play a little game with them before i
  make them stand at attention i say now listen  in the army  when we want you to pay attention we have a command  
 it 's called ' at ease ' it means everybody be quiet and pay attention listen up do you understand
  i don 't think so 
 but anyway  it 's a game i play  and it comes obviously from my military experience  
 because for the majority of my adult life  i worked with young kids teenagers with guns i call them 
 and we would bring them into the army  and the first thing we would do is to put them in
 an environment of structure 
 put them in ranks 
 make them all wear the same clothes  cut all their hair off so they look alike 
 make sure that they are standing in ranks  we teach them how to go right face left face so they can obey instructions and know the consequences of not obeying instructions 
 it gives them structure and then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately the drill sergeant 
 and they hate him
  drill sergeant starts screaming at them and telling them to do all kinds of awful things  but then the most amazing thing happens over time 
 once that structure is developed  once they understand the reason for something  
 once they understand mama ain 't here son
  i 'm your worst
  i 'm your daddy and your mommy
  and that 's just the way it is you got that son yeah and then when i ask you a question there are only three possible answers yes sir no sir and no excuse sir don
 't start telling me why you didn 't do something it 's yes sir no sir no excuse sir 
 you didn 't shave but sir no don 't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning i 'm telling you you didn 't shave no excuse sir attaboy  you 're learning fast 
 but you 'd be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure in
 eighteen weeks they have a skill they are mature  and you know what they come to admire the drill sergeant and they never forget the drill sergeant 
 they come to respect him 
 and so we need more of this kind of structure and respect in the lives of our children 
 i spend a lot of time with youth
  let 's fix the schools let 's do more for our teachers let 's put more computers in our schools let 's get it all online 
 that isn 't the whole whole answer  it 's part of the answer  but the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school
 with structure in that child 's heart and soul to begin with when does the learning process begin does it begin in first grade no no it begins the first time
 a child in a mother 's arms
 looks up at the mother
 and says oh this must be my mother she 's the one who feeds me oh yeah when i don 't feel so good down there she
 takes care of me it
 's her language i will learn and at that moment they shut out all the other languages that they could be learning at that age  but by three months
  and if the person doing it  whether it 's the mother or grandmother whoever 's doing it  
 that is when the education process begins that 's when language begins  
 that 's when love begins that 's when structure begins  that 's when you start to imprint on the child that you are special  
 you are different from every other child in the world  and we 're going to read to you a child who has not been read to
 is in danger when that child gets to school
  a child who doesn 't know his or her colors or doesn 't know how to tell time doesn 't know how to tie shoes doesn 't know how to do those things and doesn 't know how to do something that
 goes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid mind mind your manners mind your adults  mind what you 're saying 
 this is the way children are raised properly  
 and i watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they 're much to the distress of my
  my children they are acting just like we did you know you imprint them 
 and that 's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school 
 and i 'm working at all the energy i have to sort of communicate this message that we need preschool 
 we need head start we need prenatal care 
 the education process begins even before the
  is born  and if you don 't do that you 're going to have difficulty and we are having difficulties in so many of our communities and so many of our schools
 where kids are coming to first grade and their eyes are blazing they 've got their little knapsack on and they 're ready to go  
 and then they realize they 're not like the other first graders who
  read to can do their alphabet and by the third grade the kids who didn 't have that structure
 and minding in the beginning
 start to realize they 're behind and what do they do they act it out  they act it out and they 're on their way to jail
 or they 're on their way to being dropouts  it 's predictable  if you 're not at the right reading level at third grade  you are a candidate for
  and we have the highest incarceration rate because we 're not getting our kids the proper start in life the last chapter in my book is called the gift of a good start the
 gift of a good start every child ought to have a good start in life  
 i was privileged to have that kind of good start  i was not a great student  i was a public school kid in new york city  and i didn 't do
  i have my entire new york city board of education transcript from kindergarten through college  i wanted it when i was writing my first book 
 i wanted to see if my memory was correct and my god it was 
 straight c everywhere  
 and i finally bounced through high school got into the city college of new york with a seventy eight point three average which i shouldn 't have been allowed in with  
 and then i started out in engineering and that only lasted six months
 and then i went into geology rocks for jocks this is easy and
 then i found rotc i found something that i did well and something that i loved doing  
 and i found a group of youngsters like me who felt the same way  and so my whole life then was dedicated to rotc and the military  and i say to young kids
  as you 're growing up and as this structure is being developed inside of you always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing  
 and when you find those two things together  man you got it that 's what 's going on and that 's what i found 
 now the authorities at ccny were getting tired of me being there i 'd been there four and a half going on five years and
 my grades were not
 doing particularly well and i was in occasional difficulties with the administration  
 and so they said but he does so well in rotc look he gets straight a 's in that but not
  else and so they said 
 let 's take his rotc grades and roll them into his overall gpa and see what happens and they did and it brought me up to two point
 so they shipped me off to the army  and
 lo and behold many years later i 'm considered one of the greatest sons the city college of new york has ever had so 
 i tell young people everywhere it ain 't where you start in life  it 's what you do with life
 that determines where you end up in life  and you are blessed to be living in a country that no matter
  where you start you have opportunities
 so long as you believe in yourself you believe in the society and the country  and you believe
 that you can self improve and educate yourself as you go along and that 's the key to success  
 but it begins with the gift of a good start if we
  that gift to each and every one of our kids if we don 't invest
 at the earliest age  we 're going to be running into difficulties it 's why we have a dropout rate of roughly twenty five percent overall and
 almost fifty percent of our minority population living in low income areas  because they 're not getting the gift of a good start 
 my gift of a good start was not only
 being in a nice family a good family but having a family that said to me
 we came to this country in banana boats
 in one thousand nine hundred and twenty and one thousand nine hundred and twenty four 
 we worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day we 're not doing it so that you can stick something up your nose
 or get in trouble  and don 't even think about dropping out if i had ever gone home
  they had expectations for all of the cousins and the extended family of immigrants that lived in the south bronx  
 but they had more than just expectations for us they stuck into our hearts
 like a dagger
 a sense of shame don 't you shame this family
 sometimes i would get in trouble  and my parents were coming home and i was in my room waiting
 for what 's going to happen  and i would sit there saying to myself okay look take the belt and hit me but god don 't give me that  ' shame the family ' bit again 
 it devastated me when my mother did that to me  and i also had this extended network children need a network children need to be part of a tribe a family
  in my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings  i don 't know how many of you are new yorkers  
 but there were these tenement buildings and these women were always hanging out one of the windows  leaning on a pillow  
 they never left 
 i so help me god i grew up walking those streets and they were always there
  but what they did was keep us in play  they kept us in play  and they didn 't care
 whether you became
 a doctor or a lawyer or a general  and they never expected any generals in the family
  as long as you got an education and then you got a job don 't give us
  have time to waste for that  and then you can support us  that 's the role of you guys and so it 's so
 essential that we kind of put this
 culture back into our
 families all families and it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people
  and i 'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren it 's not enough you 've got to reach out and back and find kids like mr cruz
 who can make it
 if you give them the structure if you reach back and help if you mentor  if you invest in boys and girls clubs 
 if you work with your school system make sure it 's the best school system and not just your kid 's school but the school
 uptown in harlem not just downtown montessori on the west side all of us
  have to have a commitment to do that and we 're not just investing in the kids we 're investing in our future  we 're going to be a 
 country in one more generation 
 those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority  
 and we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority we have to make sure they 're ready to be the leaders of this great country of ours 
 a country that is like
 no other 
 a country that amazes me every single day a country that 's fractious we 're always arguing with each other  that 's how the system 's supposed to work
  it 's a country of such contrasts but it 's a nation of nations we touch every nation every nation touches us 
 we are a nation of immigrants that 's why we need sound
  's ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy to welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation 
 or we can send back home with an education to help their people rise up out of poverty one of
 the great stories i love to tell is about my
 love of going to my hometown of new york and walking up park avenue on a beautiful day and admiring everything and seeing all the people go by from all over the world  but
 i always have to do is stop at one of the corners
 and get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler  gotta have a dirty water dog 
 and no matter where i am or what i 'm doing i 've got to do that i even did it when i was secretary of state i 'd
 come out of my suite at the waldorf astoria
 be walking up the street and i would hit around
  street looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler in those days i had five bodyguards around me and three new york city police cars would roll alongside to make sure
 nobody whacked me while i was going up park avenue 
 and i would order the hot dog from the guy and he 'd start to fix it and then he 'd look around at the bodyguards and the police cars i 've got a green card i 've got a green card
  nothing  but i gotta have my hot dog i did it just last week it was on a tuesday evening
 down by columbus circle  and the scene repeats itself so often i 'll go up and
 ask for my hot dog  and the guy will fix it and as he 's finishing he 'll say i know you i see you on television
  you can 't pay me i 've been paid  america has paid me i never forget where i came from but now i 'm an american sir  thank you i
 accept the generosity continue up the street  and it washes over me my god it 's the same country that greeted my parents this way ninety years ago 
 so we are still that magnificent country but we are fueled
 by young people coming up from
 every land in the world  and it is our obligation as contributing citizens to this wonderful country of ours
 to make sure that no child gets left behind  thank you very much
