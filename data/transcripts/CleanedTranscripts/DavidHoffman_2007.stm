  fifty years ago in the old soviet union a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside 
 with it they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space
 the rocket was huge  and packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside 
 on october four one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven they launched their rocket one of the russian scientists wrote at the time 
 we are about to create a new planet
 that we will call sputnik in the olden days explorers like vasco da gama and columbus had the good fortune
 to open up the terrestrial globe  now we have the good fortune to open up space  
 and it is for those in the future to envy us our joy 
 you 're watching snippets from sputnik my fifth documentary feature  which is just about completed  it tells the story of sputnik  and the
 story of what happened to america as a result for days after the launch sputnik was a wonderful curiosity
 a man made moon visible by ordinary citizens  
 it inspired awe and pride
 that humans had finally launched an object into space
  but just three days later on a day they called red monday 
 the media and the politicians told us and we believed that sputnik was proof that our enemy
  had beaten us in science and technology  and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs  using their sputnik rocket
 as an ibm missile all hell broke loose sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit america
 historians say the equal of pearl harbor or nine eleven
  it provoked the missile gap  it exploded an arms race  
 it began the space race  
 within a year congress funded huge weapons increases and we went from one thousand two hundred nuclear weapons to twenty thousand  
 and the reactions to sputnik went far beyond weapons increases  for example  some here will remember
 this day june one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight the national civil defense drill  where tens of millions of people in
 underground 
 or the gallup poll that showed that seven in ten americans believed that a nuclear war would happen  and that at least fifty percent of our population was going to be killed
  but sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well 
 for example some in this room went to school on scholarship because of sputnik  
 support for engineering  math and science education in general boomed
  and vint cerf points out that sputnik led directly to arpa  and the internet and of course nasa
  my feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media 
 but it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation  into something that was overall
  will soon be released in closing i would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors  longtime tedster jay walker  and i 'd like to thank you all
