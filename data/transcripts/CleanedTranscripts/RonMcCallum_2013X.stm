  or four years old i remember my mum reading a story to me and my two big brothers and
 i remember putting up my
  my hands to feel the page of the book to feel the picture they were discussing 
 and my mum said darling  remember that you can 't see
 and you can 't feel the picture
 and you can 't feel the print on the page and i thought to myself but that 's what i want to do  i love stories  i want to read 
  little did i know
 that i would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true 
 i was born premature by about ten weeks  which resulted in my blindness  
 some sixty four years ago  the condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia  and it 's now very rare in the developed world  
 little did i know
  that i 'd been born at the right place and the right time  that i was in a country where i could participate
 in the technological revolution there are
  million totally blind people on our planet  but those of us who 've shared in the technological changes mainly come from north america
  japan and other developed parts of the world  
 computers have changed the lives of us all in this room and around the world but i think they 've changed the lives of we blind people more than any other group 
 and so
 i want to tell you about the interaction between computer based adaptive technology and the many volunteers who helped me over the years
  to become the person
 i am today  
 it 's an interaction between volunteers passionate inventors and technology and it 's a story that many other blind people could tell but let me tell you a bit about it today  
 when i was five i went to school and i learned braille it 's an ingenious system of six dots that are punched into paper
  can feel them with my fingers  in fact i think they 're putting up my grade six report i don 't know where julian morrow got that from 
 i was pretty good in reading but religion and musical appreciation needed more work 
 when you leave the opera
  find there 's braille signage in the lifts look for it have you noticed it 
 i do i look for it all the time 
 when i was at school
 the books were transcribed by transcribers voluntary people who punched one dot at a time so i 'd have volumes to read and that had been going on mainly by women
  century in this country but it was the only way i could read 
 when i was in high school  i got my first philips reel to reel tape recorder  
 and tape recorders became my sort of  pre computer medium of learning  
 i could have family and friends read me material  
 and i could then read it back as many times as i needed  
 and it brought me into contact with volunteers and helpers for example
  when i studied
 at graduate school at queen 's university in canada  
 the prisoners at the collins bay jail agreed to help me  i gave them a tape recorder  and they read into it as one of them said to me ron we ain 't going anywhere at the moment 
 but think of it these men who hadn 't had the educational opportunities i 'd had
  helped me gain post graduate qualifications in law
 by their dedicated help well i went back and became an academic at melbourne 's monash university and
 for those  twenty five years tape recorders were everything to me in fact in my office
 students family and friends all read me material 
 mrs lois doery whom i later came to call my surrogate mum read me many thousands of hours onto tape 
 one of the reasons i agreed to give this talk today was that i was hoping that lois would be here so i could introduce you to her and publicly thank her
  but sadly her health hasn 't permitted her to come today  but i thank you here lois from this platform
  and i thought to myself this thing 's got a glass screen not much use to me 
 how very wrong i was in 
 in the month our eldest son gerard was born i got my first blind computer
  see it up there and you see it has no what do you call it no screen 
 it 's a blind computer 
 it 's a keynote gold
  at the time i think there 's more memory in my watch 
 it was invented by russell smith a passionate inventor in new zealand who was trying to help blind people sadly he died in a light plane crash in two thousand and five but his memory lives on in my heart
  for the first time  i could read back what i had typed into it it had a speech synthesizer i 'd written my first coauthored labor law book on a typewriter in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine purely from memory 
 this now allowed me to read back what i 'd written and to enter the computer world  even with
  a machine that would scan books and read them out in synthetic speech  optical character recognition units then only operated usually on one font 
 but by using 
 device flatbed scanners and speech synthesizers he developed a machine that could read any font  and
  the month that my associate professorship at monash university was announced the law school got one  and i could use it 
  for the first time  i could read what i wanted to read by putting a book on the scanner  i didn 't have to be nice to people 
 i no longer would be censored for example  
 i was too shy then  and i 'm actually too shy now to ask anybody to read me out loud sexually explicit material 
 but you know i could pop a book on in the middle of the night
 the
 kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop that 's what it 's shrunk to and now i can scan the latest novel and not wait to get it into talking book libraries  i
 can keep up with my friends there are many people who have helped me in my life and
 many that i haven 't met one is another american inventor ted henter 
 ted was a motorcycle racer  but in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight he had a car accident and lost his sight which
 is devastating if you 're trying to ride motorbikes  he then turned to being a
  he teamed up with bill joyce to develop a program
 that would read out what was on the computer screen from the net or from what was on the computer it 's called jaws job access with speech and it sounds like this
  you see if i read like that i 'd fall asleep  i slowed it down for you i 'm going to ask that we play it at the speed i read it can we play that one
  when you 're marking student essays you want to get through them fairly
 but you know  i find reading with machines a very lonely process  
 i grew up with family friends reading to me and i loved the warmth
 and the breath and the closeness of people reading do you love being read to and one of my
  to me and the children down near manly beach harry potter and the philosopher 's stone isn 't that a great book i
 still love being close to someone reading to me  but i wouldn 't give up the technology because it 's allowed me to lead a
 great life 
 of course talking books for the blind predated all this technology after all
  the long playing record was developed in the early 1930s and now we put talking books on cds using the digital
 access system known as daisy  but
 when i 'm reading with synthetic voices  i love to come home and read a racy novel with a real voice 
 now there are still barriers
  front of we people with disabilities many websites we can 't read using jaws and the other technologies websites are often very
 visual  and there are all these sorts of graphs that aren 't labeled and buttons that aren 't labeled and that 's why the world wide web consortium three known as
  internet users or internet site owners to make their sites compatible so that we persons without vision can have a level playing field 
 there are other barriers brought about by our laws 
 for example  australia like about one third of the world 's countries has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled
 or read for we
  blind persons  but those books can 't travel across borders 
 for example  in spain there are a one hundred thousand accessible books in spanish  in argentina there are fifty thousand  
 in no other latin american country are there more than a couple of thousand  but it 's not legal to transport the books from spain to latin america 
  there are hundreds of thousands of accessible books in the united states britain canada australia etc 
 but they can 't be transported to the sixty countries in our world where english is the first and the second language  and remember i was telling you about harry potter  
 well because we can 't transport books across borders  there had to be separate versions read in all the different english speaking countries  britain  united states
  and new zealand all had to have separate readings of harry potter 
 and that 's why next month in morocco a meeting is taking place between all the countries it 's something that a group of countries and the world blind union are advocating a cross border treaty
 so that if books are available under a copyright exception and the other country has a copyright exception we can transport those books across borders and give life to people particularly in developing countries blind people
  don 't have the books to read i want that to happen 
 my life has been extraordinarily blessed with marriage
 and children
 and certainly interesting
 work to do  whether it be
 at the university of sydney law school where i served a term as dean or now as i sit on the united nations committee on the rights of persons with disabilities in geneva  
 i 've indeed been a very fortunate human being 
 i wonder what the future will hold the technology will advance even further  
 but i can still remember my mum saying sixty years ago
  be able to read the print with your fingers i 'm so glad
 that the interaction between braille transcribers  volunteer readers and passionate inventors 
 has allowed this dream of reading to come true for me and for blind people throughout the world 
 i 'd like to thank
 my researcher hannah martin who is my slide clicker who clicks the slides
  and my wife  professor mary crock who 's the light of my life is coming on to collect me  i want to thank her too i think i have to say goodbye now  bless you thank you very
