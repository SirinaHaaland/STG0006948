  i 'd like to start with a short story it 's about a little boy
 whose father was
 a history buff and who used to take him by the hand to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis
 on the outskirts of their camp 
 they would always stop by to visit these huge winged bulls that used to guard the gates of that ancient metropolis and the boy used to be scared of these winged bulls but at the same time they excited him 
 and the dad used to use those bulls to tell the
  to the san francisco bay area many decades later where i started a technology company that brought the world
 its first 3d laser scanning system let me show you how it works female voice long range laser scanning
  with two mirrors the scanner calculates the beam 's horizontal and vertical angles  giving accurate x  y and z coordinates 
 the point is then recorded into a 3d visualization program 
 all of this happens in seconds
  you can see here these systems are extremely fast they collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution 
 a surveyor with
 traditional survey tools would be hard pressed to produce maybe five hundred points in a whole day 
 these babies would be producing something like ten thousand points a second 
 so
  can imagine this was a paradigm shift in the
 survey and construction as well as in reality capture industry 
 approximately ten years ago my wife and i started a foundation to do good  and right about that
  magnificent bamiyan buddhas hundred and eighty foot tall in afghanistan 
 were blown up by the taliban  they were gone in an instant and unfortunately there was no detailed documentation of these buddhas  this clearly devastated 
  me and i couldn 't help but wonder about the fate of my old friends  the winged bulls and the fate
  heritage sites all over the world both my wife and i were so touched by this
 that we decided to expand the mission of our foundation
 to
 include digital heritage preservation of world sites 
 we called the project cyark which stands for cyber archive 
 to date with the help of a global network of partners we 've completed
 close to fifty projects  let me show you some of them  chichen itza  rapa nui
 and what you 're seeing here are the cloud of points
 babylon  
 rosslyn chapel  
 pompeii  
 and our latest project mt rushmore  which happened to be one of our most challenging projects as you see here  we had to develop
 a special rig
 to bring the scanner up close and personal the results of our work in the field
 are used to produce media and deliverables to be used by conservators and researchers we also
 produce media for dissemination to the public
 free through the
  cyark website  these would be used for education cultural tourism  etc what you 're looking at in here
 is a 3d viewer that we developed that would allow the display and manipulation of [ the ] cloud of points in real time  cutting sections through them and extracting dimensions  this happens to be the cloud of points for tikal  
 in here you see a traditional
 2d architectural engineering drawing that 's used for preservation  
 and of course we tell the stories through fly throughs and here this is a fly through the cloud of points of tikal  and here you see it
 rendered and photo textured with the photography that we take of the site and so this is not a video this is actual
  two to three millimeter accuracy 
 and of course the data can be used to develop 3d models that are very accurate and very detailed and here you 're looking at 
  a model that 's extracted from the cloud of points for stirling castle it 's used for studies for visualization as well as for education
  apps that include narrated virtual tools  
 the more i got involved in the heritage field  the more it became clear to me that we are
 losing the sites
 and the stories faster than we can physically preserve them
  of course 
 earthquakes and all the natural phenomena floods  tornadoes etc 
 take their toll  
 however  what occurred to me was human caused destruction  which was not only causing a significant portion of the destruction  but actually it was accelerating 
 this includes arson  
  acid rain not to mention terrorism and wars 
 it was getting more and more apparent that we 're fighting a losing battle we 're losing our sites
 and the stories  and basically we 're losing
 a piece and a significant piece of our collective memory imagine us as a human race
 not knowing where we came from luckily
  the last two or three decades digital technologies have been developing
 that have helped us to develop tools that we 've brought to bear in the digital preservation in our digital preservation war this includes 
 for example the 3d
 laser scanning systems  
  digital photography not to mention the internet because of this accelerated pace of destruction  
 it became clear to us that we needed to challenge ourselves and our partners
 to accelerate our work and we created a project we call the cyark five hundred challenge
 and that is to digitally preserve
  five hundred world heritage sites in five years  we do have the technology that 's scaleable and
 our network of global partners
 has been expanding and can be expanded at a rapid rate so we 're comfortable that this task can
  to me the five hundred is really just the first five hundred 
 in order to sustain our work into the future  we use technology centers
 where we partner with local universities and colleges to take the technology to them  whereby they
  then can help us
 with digital preservation of their heritage sites and at the same time it gives them
 the technology to benefit from in the future  
 let me close with another short story two years ago  we were approached by a partner of ours
 to digitally preserve an important heritage site a unesco heritage site in uganda  
 the royal kasubi tombs the work was done
  in the field  
 and the data was archived and publicly disseminated through the cyark website  last march  
 we received very sad news  the royal tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson a few days
  we received a call is the data available
 and can it be used for reconstruction 
 our answer of course was yes  
 let me leave you with a final thought 
 our heritage is much more than our collective memory
 it 's our collective treasure we owe it to our children our grandchildren and the generations
 we will never meet to keep it safe and to pass it along thank you
  i 'm staying here because
 we wanted to demonstrate to you
 the power of this technology and so while i 've been speaking you
 have been scanned 
 the two wizards that i have that are behind
  the curtain will help me bring the results on the
  and of course you can fly through the cloud of points you can
 look at it from on top from the ceiling you can look from different vantage points but i 'm going to ask doug to zoom in on
 an individual in the crowd just to show the amount of detail that we can create 
 so you have been digitally preserved in about
  about four minutes i 'd like to
 thank the wizards here
  we were very lucky to have two of our partners participate in this the
 historic scotland  and the glasgow school of art  i 'd like to also thank personally the
 efforts of
 david mitchell who is the director of conservation at historic scotland  david 
 and doug pritchard who 's the head of visualization at the glasgow school of art  let 's give them a hand
