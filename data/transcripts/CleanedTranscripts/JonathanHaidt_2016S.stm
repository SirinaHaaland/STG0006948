  it feels like the world is in a place that we haven 't seen for a long time people don 't just disagree in the way that we 're familiar with on the
  political divide there are much deeper differences afoot what on earth is going on and how did we get here   jh this is different
  there 's a much more apocalyptic sort of feeling  survey research by pew research shows that
 the degree to which we feel that the other side is not just we don 't just dislike them we strongly dislike them  and we think that they are a threat to the nation  those numbers have been going up and up and those are over fifty percent now
 on both sides people are scared because it feels like this is different than before  it 's much more intense  whenever i look at 
  any sort of social puzzle i always apply the three basic principles of moral psychology and i think they 'll help us here  
 so the first the first thing that you have to always keep in mind when you 're thinking about politics
 is that we 're tribal we evolved for tribalism one of the simplest and greatest insights into human social nature is the bedouin
  proverb me against my brother me and my brother against our cousin me and my brother and cousins against the stranger 
 and that that tribalism allowed us to create large societies and to come together in order to compete with others 
 that brought us out of the jungle and out of small groups but it means that we have eternal conflict
  the question you have to look at is what aspects of our society are
 making that more bitter and what are calming them down ca that 's a very dark proverb you 're saying that that 's actually baked into most people 's mental wiring at some level jh oh absolutely this is just a basic aspect of human social cognition but
 we can also live together really peacefully  and we 've invented all kinds of fun ways of like playing war i mean  sports politics these are all ways that we get to exercise this
 this tribal nature without actually hurting anyone we
  also really good at trade and exploration and meeting new people so you have to see our tribalism as something that goes up or down it 's not like we 're doomed to always be fighting each other  but we 
  'll never have world peace ca the size of that tribe can shrink or expand
  as we 've all inherited it comes out of the labor versus capital distinction and the working class
  but i think what we 're seeing now increasingly is a divide in all the western democracies between
 the people who want to stop at nation the people who are more parochial and i don 't mean that in a bad way people who have much more of a sense of being rooted they care about their their town their community and their nation  
 and then those who
 and who whenever i get confused i just think of the john lennon song imagine imagine there 's no countries nothing to kill or die
  for and so these are the people who 
  want more global governance they don 't like nation states they don 't like borders  you see this all over europe as well there 's a great metaphor guy actually his name is shakespeare writing ten years ago in britain
 those of us who grew up with the beatles and that sort of hippie philosophy of of dreaming of a more connected world it felt so idealistic and how could anyone think badly about that 
 and what you 're saying is that actually millions of people today
 feel that that isn 't just
 silly it 's actually dangerous and wrong and they 're scared of it jh i think the big issue especially in europe but also here is the issue of immigration and i think this is where
 we have to look very carefully at the social science about diversity and immigration once something becomes politicized once it becomes something  that the left loves and the right
 then even the social scientists can 't think straight about it now diversity is good in a lot of ways  it clearly creates more innovation the american economy has grown enormously
  immigration do a lot of good things but what the globalists i think don 't see what they don 't want to see is that
 ethnic diversity
 cuts social capital and trust  there 's a very important study by robert by robert putnam the author of bowling alone 
 looking at social capital databases and basically the more people feel that they are the same  
 the more they trust each other  the more they can have a redistributionist welfare state scandinavian countries are so wonderful because they have this legacy of being
  small homogenous countries  
 and that leads to a progressive welfare state a set of progressive left leaning values  which says drawbridge down the world is a great place people in syria are suffering we must welcome them in and it 's a beautiful thing 
 but
 if and i was in sweden this summer if the discourse in sweden is fairly politically correct and they can 't talk about the downsides
  you end up bringing a lot of people in that 's going to cut social capital it makes it hard to have a welfare state
 and they
 might end up as we have in america with a racially divided  visibly racially divided society  so this is all very uncomfortable to talk about but i think this is the thing especially in europe and for us too we need to be looking at ca you 're saying that people
 of reason people who would consider themselves not racists but moral upstanding people
  have a rationale that says humans are just too different that we 're in danger of
 overloading our sense of what humans are capable of by mixing in people who are too different jh yes but i can make it much more palatable palatable
 by saying it 's not necessarily about race it 's about culture 
  there 's wonderful work by a political scientist named karen stenner who shows that when people have a sense
 that we are all united we 're all the same  there are many people who have a predisposition to authoritarianism those people aren 't particularly racist when they feel as through there 's not a threat to our social and moral order  
 but if you prime them experimentally by thinking we 're coming apart people are getting more different then they get more racist homophobic they want to kick out the deviants
  so it 's in part that you get an authoritarian reaction
  left following through the lennonist line the john lennon line
 does things that create an authoritarian reaction we 're certainly seeing that in america with the alt right we saw it in britain we 've seen it all over europe 
 but the more positive part of that is that i think the localists or the nationalists are actually right that if you emphasize our
  then race doesn 't actually matter very much so an assimilationist approach to immigration
 removes a lot of these problems and if you value having a generous welfare state you 've got to emphasize that we 're all the same ca 
 ok  so rising immigration and fears about that are one of the causes of the current
 divide  what are other causes jh the next principle of moral psychology is that intuitions
  there 's some really interesting work on how our high intelligence and our verbal abilities might have evolved not to help us find out the truth  but to help us manipulate each other defend our reputation 
 we 're really really good at justifying ourselves  and when you bring group interests into account so it 's not just me it 's my team versus your team  whereas if you 're evaluating evidence that your side is wrong
  can 't accept that so this is why you can 't win a political argument if you
 're debating something you can 't persuade the person with reasons and evidence  because that 's not the way reasoning works
 so now give us the internet give us google i heard that barack obama was born in kenya let me google that oh my god ten million hits look
  this has come as an unpleasant surprise to a lot of people social media has often been framed by
  techno optimists as this great connecting force that would that would bring people together
  and there have been some unexpected counter effects to that jh 
 that 's right that 's why i 'm very enamored of yin yang views of of human nature and left right that each side is right about certain things  but then it
  blind to other things and so the left generally believes that human nature is good bring people together knock down the walls and all will be well  
 the right social conservatives not libertarians social conservatives generally believe
 people can be greedy and
 sexual and selfish and we need regulation and we need restrictions 
 so yeah if you knock down all the walls  allow people to communicate all over the world you get a lot of porn and a lot of
  you have to see six to ten different threads all coming together  i 'll just list a couple of them
   so in america one of the big actually
  and europe one of the biggest ones is world war ii there 's interesting research from joe henrich and others that says if your country was at war especially when you were young 
 then we test you thirty years later in a commons dilemma or a prisoner 's dilemma you 're more cooperative
  because of our tribal nature if you 're my parents were teenagers during world war ii and
 they would they would go out looking for scraps of aluminum to help the war effort i mean everybody pulled together  and so then these people go on
  up through business and government they take leadership positions they 're really good at compromise and cooperation  they all retire by the ' 90s so we 're left with baby boomers
 by the end of the ' 90s and their youth was spent fighting each other within each country
  another in america is the purification of the two parties there used to be liberal republicans and conservative democrats  so america had a mid 20th century that was really bipartisan 
 but
 because of a variety of factors that started things moving by the ninety 's we had a purified
 liberal party and conservative party so now the people in either party really are different and we really don 't want our children to marry them
  so the purification of the parties  third is the internet and as i said it 's just the most amazing
 stimulant for post hoc reasoning and demonization ca the tone of what 's
 happening on the internet now is quite troubling  i just did a quick search on twitter about the election and saw two tweets next to each other
  is troubling to me because you can have an argument or a disagreement about something you can get angry at someone 
 disgust i 've heard you say takes things to a much deeper level
  's right  disgust is different  anger you know  i have kids they fight ten times a day and they love each other thirty times a day you just go back and
  marital therapy if you look at the faces if one of the couple shows disgust or contempt
 that 's a predictor that they 're going to get divorced soon whereas if they show anger that doesn 't predict anything because if you deal with anger well it actually is good
  so this election is different
  's something unique to him
 but as as we demonize each other more and again through the manichaean
 worldview the idea that the world is a battle between good and evil as this has been ramping up we 're more likely not just to say they 're wrong or i don 't like them but we say
 they 're evil they 're satanic they 're disgusting they 're revolting  and then we want nothing to do with them  and that 's why i think we
 seeing it for example on campus now we 're seeing more the urge to keep people off campus silence them keep them away i 'm afraid that this whole generation of young people if their introduction to
 to politics involves a lot of disgust  they 're not going to want to be involved in politics as they
  can 't do it with reasons  i think
  i studied disgust for many years and i think about emotions a lot  and i think that the opposite of disgust is actually love 
 love
 is all about like disgust is closing off borders  love is about
  so personal relationships i think are probably the most powerful means we have
  you can be disgusted by a group of people but then you meet a particular person and you genuinely discover that they 're lovely
  and then gradually that chips away or changes your your category as well
  the tragedy is americans used to be much more
  or politics and now that it 's become this great moral divide there 's a lot of evidence that we 're moving to be near people who are like us politically it 's harder to find somebody who 's on the other side 
 so they 're over there they 're far away it 's harder to get to know them ca what would you say to
  really important thing to keep in mind there 's research by
 political scientist alan abramowitz showing that
 american democracy is increasingly governed by what 's called negative partisanship 
 that means you think ok there 's a candidate  you like the candidate you vote for the candidate but with the rise of negative advertising and social media
  and all sorts of other trends increasingly the way elections are done is that each side tries to make the other side so horrible so awful that you 'll vote for my guy by default  
 and so as we more and more vote against the other side and not for our side you have to keep in mind
 that
  if people are on the left 
  i used to think that republicans were bad but now donald trump proves it and now every republican i can paint with all the things that i think about trump and that 's not necessarily true  they 're generally not very happy with their candidate  this is the most
 negative partisanship election in american history
  so you have to first separate your feelings about the candidate from your feelings about the people who are given a choice
  and then you have to realize
 that because we all live in a separate moral world the metaphor i use in the book is that we 're all trapped in the matrix 
 or each moral community is a matrix a consensual hallucination  and so if you 're within the blue matrix  
 everything 's completely compelling that the other side they 're troglodytes they 're racists they 're the worst people in the world and you have all the facts to back that up 
 but somebody in the next house from yours is living in a different moral matrix  they live in a different video game
 and they see a completely different set of facts and each one sees different threats to the country  and what i 've found from being in the middle and trying to understand both sides is both sides are right  
  there are a lot of threats to this country and each side is constitutionally incapable of seeing them all
  i feel your pain i can put myself in your shoes and we apply it to the poor the needy the suffering 
 we don 't usually apply it to people who we feel as other or we 're disgusted by 
 what would it look like to build that type of of empathy jh actually i think
  empathy is a very very hot topic in psychology and it 's a very popular word on the left in particular empathy is a good thing  and empathy for the preferred classes of victims so it 's important to empathize 
  with the groups that we on the left think are so important that 's easy to do because you get points for that
  dealing with our race problems and legal discrimination  and that was our top priority for a long time and it still is important  
 but i think this year  i 'm hoping it will make people see
 that we have an existential threat on our hands 
  divide i believe is by far the most important divide we face we still have issues about race and gender and lgbt  but this is the urgent need of the next fifty years and
 things aren 't going to get better on their own
  so we 're going to need to do a lot of institutional reforms and we could talk about that but that 's like a whole long  wonky conversation
  but i think it starts with people realizing that this is a turning point  and
 yes  we need a new kind of empathy we need to realize 
 this is what our country needs  and this is what you need if you don 't want to raise your hand if you want to spend the next four years as angry and worried as you 've been for the last year raise your hand
 if you want to escape from this  read buddha read jesus read marcus aurelius they have all kinds of great advice for how to
 drop the fear reframe things stop seeing other people as your enemy
 there 's a lot of guidance in ancient wisdom for this kind of empathy ca here 's my last question personally what can
  people do
 to help heal jh yeah it 's very hard to just decide to overcome your deepest prejudices and there 's research showing that
 political prejudices are deeper and stronger than race prejudices in the country now
  so i think you have to make an effort that that 's the main thing make an effort to actually meet somebody everybody has a cousin a brother in law somebody who 's on the other side so after this
  wait a week or two because it 's probably going to feel awful for one of you
 but wait a couple weeks and then reach out and and say you want to talk and before you do it read dale carnegie how to win friends and influence people i 'm totally serious 
 you 'll learn techniques if you start by acknowledging if you start by saying you know we don 't agree on a lot but one thing i really respect about you uncle bob or about you conservatives
  you can find something
 if you start with some appreciation it 's like magic
 this is one of the main things i 've learned that i take into my human relationships i still make lots of stupid mistakes  but i 'm incredibly good at apologizing now and at acknowledging what somebody was right about 
  and if you do that then the conversation goes really well and it 's actually really fun ca jon
  ground that we 're on is a ground populated by deep questions of morality and human nature 
 your wisdom couldn 't be more relevant thank you so much for sharing this time with
