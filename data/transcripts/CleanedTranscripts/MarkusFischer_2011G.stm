  dream of mankind to fly like a bird  birds are very agile they fly not with rotating components so they fly only by flapping their
  so we looked at the birds  and we tried to make a model that is powerful ultralight  and it must have excellent 
 aerodynamic qualities that would fly by its own and only by flapping its wings  
  as a role model  
 so we bring a team together  there are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics in the field of building gliders  and 
 the task was to build an ultralight  indoor flying model
 that no one would be hurt if it
 fell down  so why do we do all this we are a company in the field of automation  
 and we 'd like to do very lightweight structures because that 's energy efficient  and we 'd like to learn more about
 pneumatics and
  your seat belts on and put your
  without a skin  we have a wingspan of about two meters the length is one meter and six  and the weight is only four hundred and fifty grams  
 and it is all out of carbon
  fiber in the middle we have a motor  and we also have a gear in it  and we use the gear to transfer
 the circulation of the motor  so within the motor we have three hall sensors so we know exactly where the wing is
  we have the possibility to fly like a bird  so if you go down you have the large area of propulsion and if you go up 
 the wings are not that large  and it is easier to get up
  the next thing we did or the challenges we did was to coordinate this movement  we have to turn it go up and go down  we have a split wing  with the split wing  we get the lift
 at the upper wing  and we get the propulsion at the lower wing also we see how we measure
  we had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency  so therefore it rises 
 up from passive torsion to active torsion from thirty percent up to eighty percent 
  only if you control and regulate it you will get that aerodynamic efficiency  so the overall consumption of energy is about
