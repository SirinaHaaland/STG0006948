  with national geographic  but i want to share a secret 
 this image is totally incorrect  
 totally incorrect i see a couple of people crying in the back that i 've blown their idea of mermaids
 right the mermaid is indeed real  but anyone who 's gone on a dive will know that the ocean looks more like this 
 it 's because the ocean is this massive filter  and as soon as you start going underwater you 're going to lose your colors and it 's going to get dark and blue very quickly but we 're humans we 're terrestrial
  and we 've got trichromatic vision  so we see in red green and blue  and we 're just complete color addicts we love eye popping color  
 and we try to bring this eye popping color underwater with us so there 's been a long and sordid history of bringing color underwater and it starts eighty eight years ago
 with bill longley and charles martin who were trying to take the
  scuba suits where you 're pumping air down to them and they 've got a pontoon of 
 magnesium powder and the poor people at the surface are not sure when they 're going to pull the string when they 've got their frame in focus and boom a pound of high explosives would go 
 off so they could put a little bit of light underwater and get an image like this beautiful
  they 're creating an artificial environment so we can satisfy our own addiction to color 
 and looking at it the other way what we 've been finding is that instead of bringing color underwater with us 
 that we 've been looking at the blue ocean  and it 's a crucible of blue and these animals living there for millions of years have been evolving all sorts of ways to
  take in that blue light and give off other colors  and here 's just a little sample of what this secret world looks like it 's like an underwater light show 
  're seeing here is blue light hitting this image  these animals are absorbing the blue light and immediately transforming this light
  so if you think about it the ocean 
  percent of the planet 
 and blue light can extend down to almost a one thousand meters as we go down underwater  after about ten meters all the red is gone  so if you see anything 
 under ten meters that 's red it 's an animal transforming and creating its own red 
  environment on our planet  
 and my gateway my gateway into this world of  biofluorescence begins with corals and i want to give a full ted talk on corals and just how cool these things are 
 one of the things that they do one of their miraculous feats is they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins fluorescent molecules and in this coral it could be making up to fourteen percent of its body mass could be this fluorescent protein
 so you wouldn 't be making like fourteen percent muscle and not using it so it 's likely doing something that has a functional role and for the last ten fifteen years 
 this was so special to me because this molecule has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary tools in biomedical science  and it 's allowing us to better see inside ourselves 
 how do i study this 
 in order to study biofluorescence we swim at night  and when i started out i was just using these blue duct tape filters over my strobe  so i could make sure i 'm actually seeing the light that 's being transformed by the animals 
 we 're making an exhibit for the museum of natural history 
 and we 're trying to show off how great the fluorescent corals are on the reef and something happened that just blew me away
 this 
 in the middle of our corals is this green fluorescent fish it
 's the first time we 've ever seen a green fluorescent fish or any vertebrate for that matter and we 're rubbing our eyes checking the filters thinking that somebody 's maybe playing a joke on us with the camera
  but the eel was real  it was
 the first green fluorescent eel that we found and this just changed my trajectory completely
  so i had to put down my corals and team up with a fish scientist john sparks and begin a search around the world to see how prevalent 
  this phenomenon is and fish are much more interesting than corals because they have really advanced vision  and some of the fish even have the way that i was photographing
  they have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence  so i wanted to seek this out further  
 so we designed a new set of gear and we 're scouring the reefs around the world looking for fluorescent life  and it 's a bit like e t phone home we 're out there swimming swimming with this blue light 
 and we 're looking for a response for animals to be absorbing the light and transferring this back to us 
  know almost nothing about they 're only about the size of my finger  
 and they spend about ninety nine point nine percent of their time hidden under a rock  but these eels do come out to mate under full moon nights  and that full moon night 
  translates underwater to blue perhaps they 're using this as a way to see each other quickly find each other mate go back into
  for the next long stint of time 
 but then we started to find other fluorescent marine life like this green fluorescent bream with its like racing stripes along along its head and its nape and it 's almost camouflaged
 and fluorescing at the same intensity as the fluorescent coral there
 after this fish we were introduced to this red fluorescent
  cloaked and hidden on this rock the only time we 've ever seen this it 's either on red fluorescent algae or red fluorescent coral 
 later we found this stealthy green 
  these lizardfish come in many varieties and they look almost exactly alike under white light  but if you look at them under fluorescent light you see lots of patterns you can really see the differences among them and in total we just reported this last year we
  found over two hundred species of biofluorescent fish one of my inspirations is french artist and biologist
 he really captures this entrepreneuring creative spirit in biology he would design his own gear make his own cameras  and he was fascinated with the seahorse  hippocampus erectus  and he filmed for the first time the seahorse
  giving birth
  so this is the male seahorse they were one of the
 first fish to start swimming upright with their brain above their head the males give birth just phenomenal creatures
 so he stayed awake for days he even put this electrical visor on his head that would shock him  so he could capture
  seahorses in the exact same species that he was studying  and here 's our footage 
  the most cryptic fish you could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse  they would blend right into the algae
  which would also fluoresce red  but they 've got great vision and they go through this long mating ritual and perhaps they 're using it in that effect 
 but things got pretty edgy
 when we found
 green
 fluorescence in the stingray  because stingrays are in the elasmobranch class  which includes sharks  so
 i 'm like a coral biologist somebody 's got to go down and check to see if the sharks are
  fluorescent and there i am and
 i was like maybe i should go back to corals 
 laughter it turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent and then we found it in a deep dark canyon
 off the coast of california we found the first
  right underneath all the surfers here it is they 're just about a meter long 
 and they call them a swellshark because if they 're threatened they can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube about twice their size and wedge themselves under a under a rock so they don 't get eaten by a predator  
 and here is our first footage of these
  are fluorescent and areas that are not fluorescent but they 've also got these twinkling spots on them that are much brighter than other parts of the shark  
 but this is all beautiful to see i was like this is gorgeous but
 what does it mean to the shark can they see this and we looked in the literature  and nothing was known about this shark
  so i took this shark to eye specialist ellis loew at cornell university  and we found out that this shark sees discretely and acutely in the blue green interface  probably about one hundred times better than we can see in the dark but they only see blue green 
 so what it 's doing is taking this blue world and it 's absorbing the blue creating green it 's creating contrast that they can indeed see so we have a model showing that it creates an ability for them to see all these patterns  and males and females
  also have we 're finding distinct patterns among them  
 but our last find came really just a few miles from where we are now in the solomon islands swimming at night  i encountered the first
 sea turtle so now it 's going from fish and sharks into reptiles   which
  this is only one month old but it shows us that we know almost nothing about this hawksbill turtle 's vision  
 and it makes me think about how much more there is to learn  and here in the solomon islands there 's only a few thousand breeding females of this species left and this is one of the hotspots for them  
  so it shows us how much we need to really protect these animals while they 're still here and understand them 
 i wanted to know how deep does it go does this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean so we started
  using submarines  and we equipped them with special blue lights on the front here  and we dropped down and we noticed one important thing
 that
 as we get down to one thousand meters  it drops off there 's no biofluorescent marine life down there below one thousand meters almost nothing it 's just darkness
  so it 's mainly a shallow phenomenon  and below one thousand meters we encountered the bioluminescent zone where nine out of ten animals are actually making their own lights and flashing and blinking
  as i try to get deeper this is slapping on a one person submarine suit some people call this my jacques cousteau meets woody allen moment 
 laughter but as we explore down here i was thinking about how do we interact with life delicately because we 're entering a new age of exploration
  where we have to take great care  and we have to set examples how we explore  so i 've teamed up with roboticist rob wood at harvard university  and we 've been designing squishy underwater robot fingers
  so we can delicately interact with the marine life down there the idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean come from oil and gas and military
 're not really caring to be gentle some corals could be one thousand years old you don 't
 want to just go and crush them with a big claw  so my dream is something like this at night i 'm in a submarine i have force feedback gloves  and i could delicately 
  set up a lab in the front of my submarine where the squishy robot fingers
  are delicately collecting and putting things in jars and we can conduct our research 
 back to the powerful applied applications here you 're looking at a living brain that 's using the dna of fluorescent marine creatures 
 this one from jellyfish and corals to illuminate the living brain and see its connections  
 at yale  who has actually designed and engineered a fluorescent protein that responds to voltage  so he could see when a single neuron fires you 're essentially 
 looking at a portal into consciousness that was designed by marine creatures  
  our universe looks like a human brain cell  and then here we are in the deep ocean  and we 're finding marine creatures and cells that can illuminate the human mind and it
 's my hope
 that with illuminated minds  we could ponder the overarching interconnectedness of all life and fathom how much more lies in store if we keep our oceans healthy
