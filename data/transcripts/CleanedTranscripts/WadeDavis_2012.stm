  is not a story of tibet and it 's not a story of the amazon
 i won 't be taking you to the high arctic the life of the inuit or to the searing sands of the sahara
 this is actually a story of my own backyard
  backyard it
 's a land known to the tahltan people and all the first nations of british columbia as the sacred headwaters
 the source of the three great salmon rivers of home the skeena the stikine
 and the nass
 it 's a valley where in a long day perhaps too you can follow the tracks of grizzly and wolf and drink
  from the very sources of water that gave rise and cradled the great civilizations of the northwest coast
 it 's such a beautiful place it 's the most stunningly wild place i 've ever been it 's the sort of place that we as canadians could throw england and they 'd never find it
 john muir in one thousand eight hundred and seventy nine went up just the lower third of the stikine and he was so enraptured he called it a yosemite one hundred and fifty miles long he came back to california
 and named his dog after that river of enchantment
 in the lower forty eight the farthest you can get away from a maintained road is twenty miles in the northwest quadrant of british columbia an area of land the size of oregon there 's one road
 a narrow ribbon of asphalt that slips up the side of the coast mountains to the yukon
 i followed that road in the early one thousand nine hundred and seventy s soon after it was built to take a job as the
  first park ranger in spatsizi wilderness my job description was deliciously vague wilderness assessment and public relations
 in two four month seasons i saw not a dozen people there was no one to relate publicly to
 but in the course of these wanderings i came upon an old shaman 's grave that led to an encounter with a remarkable man alex jack
 an gitxsan elder and chief who had lived as a trapper and a hunter in that country for all of his life
 and over the course of thirty years i recorded traditional tales from alex
 mostly mythological accounts of wy ghet the trickster transformer of gitxsan lore who in his folly taught the people how to live on the land
 and just before alex died at the age of ninety six he
  gave me a gift it was a tool carved from
 caribou bone by his grandfather in one thousand nine hundred and ten and it turned out to be a specialized implement used by a trapper to skin out the eyelids of wolves
 it was only when alex passed away that i realized that the eyelids in some sense were my own and having done so much to allow me to learn
  to see alex in his own way was saying goodbye
 well isolation has been the great saving grace of this remarkable place but today isolation could be its doom
 you 've heard so much about the developments of the tar sands the controversy about the keystone and the enbridge pipelines but these are just elements
 of a tsunami of industrial development that is sweeping across all of the wild
  country of northern canada
 in tahltan territory alone there are forty one major industrial proposals some with great promise some of great concern
 on todagin mountain
 revered by the tahltan people as a wildlife sanctuary in the sky home to the largest population
  of stone sheep on the planet
 imperial metals but the seventy five th biggest mining company in all of canada has secured permits to establish an open pit copper and gold mine which will process thirty thousand tons of rock a day for thirty years
 generating hundreds of millions of tons of toxic waste that by the project 's design will simply be dumped
 into the lakes of the sacred headwaters
 at the headwaters itself
 has plans to extract methane gas
 from coal seams that underly a million acres fracking the coal with hundreds of millions of gallons of toxic chemicals
 establishing perhaps as many as six thousand wellheads and eventually a network of roads and pipelines and flaring wellheads
 all to generate methane gas that most likely will go east to
  fuel the expansion of the tar sands
 for over a decade the tahltan people both clans wolf and crow have resisted this assault on their homeland men women and children
 of all ages elders in wheelchairs have blockaded the only road access to the interior
 for them the headwaters is a kitchen it 's a sanctuary
 it 's a burial ground of their ancestors and those who really own it are the generations as yet unborn
 the tahltan have been able with the support of all canadians who live downstream all local politicians to resist this
 assault on their homeland but now everything hangs in the balance decisions that will be made this year will literally
  determine the fate of this country
 the tahltan have called for the creation of a tribal heritage reserve which will set aside the largest protected area in british columbia
 our goal is not only to help them do that
 but to encourage our friends the good people at shell not only to withdraw from the sacred headwaters but to move forward
  with us and join us as we do the remarkable the extraordinary
 set aside a protected area that will be for all time not simply the sacred headwaters of the tahltan people
 but the sacred headwaters of all people in the world
 the tahltan need your help we need your help and if any of you would like to join us
  on this great adventure please come and see me later today thank you very much
