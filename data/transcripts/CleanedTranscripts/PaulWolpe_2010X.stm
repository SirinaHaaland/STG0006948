  talk about design 
 but not design as we usually think about it 
 i want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific biotechnological culture where for really the first time in history  we have the power to design bodies to design animal bodies to design
  human bodies in the history of
 our planet  there have been three great waves of evolution  
 the first wave of evolution is what we think of as darwinian evolution 
 so as you all know species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments and the pressures of those environments selected which changes through
  random mutation
 in species were going to be preserved 
 then human beings stepped out of the darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution  
 which was we changed the environment in which we evolved  
 we
 altered our
  ecological niche by creating civilization and that has been the second great couple one hundred thousand years one hundred and fifty thousand years
 flow of our evolution 
 by changing our environment we put new pressures on our bodies to evolve whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities all the way through modern medicine  we have changed our own evolution
  now we 're entering a third great wave of
 evolutionary history  which has been called many things intentional evolution evolution by design very different than intelligent design
 whereby we are actually now intentionally designing and altering the physiological forms that inhabit our planet  
 so i want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications
  are for us and for our species as well as our cultures  because of this change now we actually have been doing it for a long time
  we started selectively breeding animals many many
 thousands of years ago  and if you think of dogs for example
  there isn 't a dog on this earth that 's a natural creature dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like  
 but we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them we don 't have to do it that way anymore  
 this is a beefalo 
 a beefalo is a
  perhaps pretty soon you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket  this is a geep a 
 hybrid  
 the scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards  
 i think they said it tasted like chicken  
  created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama  and they are now using these in certain cultures 
 then there 's the liger  this is the largest cat in the world the 
  hybrid  it 's bigger than a
  and in the case of the liger there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild  but
 these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology and then finally everybody 's favorite  the zorse  
 none of this is photoshopped  these are real creatures  and so one of the things we 've been doing is using genetic enhancement
  normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics  
 and if that were all this was about then it would be an interesting thing but something much much more
 powerful is happening now 
 these are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep sea jellyfish we all know that some
 well  they 've now taken that gene that bioluminescent gene and put it into mammal cells  these are normal cells and what you see here is these cells
 glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light  once they could do that with cells they could do it with organisms  so they did it with mouse pups
  and by the way the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because that 's a bioluminescent gene from coral while this is from jellyfish  
 they did it with pigs  
 they did it with puppies  
 and in fact  they did it with monkeys 
 and if you can do it with monkeys though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes
  they can do it in monkeys they can probably figure out how to do it in apes which means they can do it in human beings 
 in other words  it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings
 that glow in the dark 
 be easier to find us at night  and in fact right
  now in many states you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets  these are zebra fish they 're normally black and silver  these are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to 
  be yellow green red  and they are actually available now in certain states other states have banned them nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures there is no area of the government not the
 pets  and so some states have decided to allow them some states have decided to
 ban them some of you may have read about the fda 's consideration right now of 
 salmon the salmon on top is a genetically engineered chinook salmon using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat
  make it grow much faster using a lot less feed 
 and right now the fda is trying to make a final decision on whether pretty soon you could be eating this fish it 'll be sold in the stores and before you get too worried about it here in the united states  
 the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has
  so even as we worry about it we have allowed it to go on in this country much different in europe without any regulation and even without any identification on the package  
 these are all the first cloned animals of their type  
 so in the lower right here you have dolly the first cloned sheep now happily stuffed in a museum in edinburgh  
 ralph the rat the first cloned rat cc the cat for cloned cat
  snuppy the first cloned dog snuppy for seoul national university puppy created in south korea by the very same man that some of you may remember
  had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo which he had not he actually was the first person to clone a dog which is a very difficult thing to do because dog genomes are very plastic  
  the first cloned horse it 's a haflinger horse cloned in italy a real gold ring of cloning because there are many horses that win important races who are geldings 
 in other words  the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed  
 but if you can clone that horse you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud
 these were the first cloned calves  the first cloned grey wolves  and then finally  the first cloned piglets  alexis 
 carrel  janie and dotcom 
 in addition  we 've started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species this is the use of
  now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create so with antithrombin in that goat that goat has been genetically modified so that 
  the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that gtc genetics wants to create 
  knockout pigs from the national institute of animal science in south korea are pigs that they are going to use in fact to try to create all 
  kinds of of drugs and other industrial types of chemicals that they want the blood and the milk of these animals to produce for them  instead of producing them in an industrial way
 created in order to save endangered species  the guar is an endangered southeast asian ungulate 
 a somatic cell a body cell was taken from its body  gestated in the ovum of a cow and then
 that cow gave birth to a guar same thing happened with the mouflon where it 's an endangered
 species of sheep
 it was gestated in a regular sheep
 body  
 which actually raises an interesting biological problem we have two kinds of dna in our bodies we have our nucleic dna that everybody thinks of as our dna  but we 
  also have dna in our mitochondria which are the energy packets of the cell that dna is passed down through our mothers  
  is not a guar and not a mouflon  
 but a guar with cow mitochondria and therefore cow mitochondrial dna and a mouflon with another species of sheep 's mitochondrial dna 
  these are really hybrids not pure animals and it raises the question of how we 're going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology a question that we 're not really sure yet
  how to solve this lovely creature is an asian cockroach  and what they 've done here is they 've put
 electrodes in its ganglia and its brain
 and then a transmitter on top and it 's on a big computer tracking ball  and now using a joystick  they can send
  this creature around the lab
 and control whether it goes left or right forwards or backwards they 've created a kind of insect bot or bugbot  
 it gets worse than that or perhaps better than that this actually is one of
 darpa 's very important darpa is the defense research agency one of their projects these
 goliath beetles are wired in their wings they have a computer chip strapped to their backs  and they can fly these creatures around the lab
 they can make them go left right they can make them take off they can 't actually make them land they put them about one inch above the ground and then they shut everything off and they go pfft but
 it 's the closest they can get to a landing  
 and in fact this technology has gotten so developed that this creature this is a moth this is the moth in in its pupa stage and that 's when they put the wires in and they put in the
  computer technology so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth it is already prewired the wires are already in its body and they 
  can just hook it up to their technology  and now they 've got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance they can put little cameras on them and perhaps
  it 's not just insects  this is the ratbot or the robo rat by sanjiv talwar at suny downstate  again  it 's got technology it 's got electrodes going into its left 
  and right hemispheres it 's got a camera on top of its head the scientists can make this creature
  they have it running through mazes controlling where it 's going they 've now created an organic
 robot  the graduate students in sanjiv talwar 's
 lab said is this ethical we 've taken away the autonomy of this animal i 'll get back to that in a minute 
 there 's also been work done with monkeys this is
 miguel nicolelis of duke he took owl monkeys wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they
  moved especially looking at the movement of their right arm the computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways  they then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm which you see 
  here in the picture put the arm in another room pretty soon the computer learned by reading the monkey 's brainwaves to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey
 's arm did then he put a video
 monitor in the monkey 's cage that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm and the monkey got fascinated the monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm this prosthetic arm would do 
 and eventually she was moving it and moving it and eventually stopped moving her right arm and staring at the screen could move the prosthetic arm in the other room
  only with her brainwaves which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have
  three independent functional arms 
 and it 's not just technology that we 're putting into animals  this is thomas demarse at the university of florida he took twenty thousand 
  and then sixty thousand disaggregated rat neurons so these are just individual neurons from rats
  integrated chip and he used that as the it piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator  
 so now we have organic computer chips made out of living
  eel brain this is a brain from a lamprey eel it is living
  brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides  attached photosensitive sensors to the brain put it into a cart 
 here 's the cart the brain is sitting there in the middle and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart  when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart the cart moves toward
  the light when you turn it off it moves away it 's photophilic  so now we have a complete living
 lamprey eel brain is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts  sitting there in its nutrient medium 
 i don 't know  but in fact it is a fully living
 brain that we have managed to keep alive
 to do our bidding
  so  we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes  this is a mouse created by charles vacanti of the
 university of massachusetts
  he
 altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and
  created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with 
  xenotransplantation this is where we are in this process  finally  
  where he took a cell took a dna synthesizer which is a machine created an artificial genome put it in 
  a different cell the genome was not of the cell he put it in and that cell then reproduced as the other cell 
 in other words that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent it did not have an organic parent  
 and so asks the economist the first artificial organism
  and its consequences so you may have thought
 that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that 
 but in fact that 's not what frankenstein 's lab looks like  this is what frankenstein 's lab looks like  this is a dna synthesizer  and here at the bottom 
 are just bottles of a t c and g the four chemicals that make up our dna chain
 and so we need to ask ourselves some questions for the first time in the history of this planet  we are able to directly design organisms  we can manipulate the plasmas of life with unprecedented power  
 and it confers on us a responsibility is everything okay is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want do we have free reign to design
  animals do we get to go someday to pets ' r ' us and say look i want a dog i 'd like it to have the head of a of a dachshund  the body of a retriever 
 maybe some pink fur and let 's make it glow in the dark 
 does industry get to create creatures who in their milk in their blood and in their saliva and other bodily fluids create the drugs and industrial molecules we
  want
 and then warehouse them as organic manufacturing machines 
 do we get to create organic robots where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings  
 and then the final step of this 
 once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then
 's already happening it 's not science fiction 
 we are not only already using these things in animals some of them we 're already beginning to use on our own bodies 
 we are now taking control of our own evolution  we are directly designing the future of the species of this planet 
  it confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now it is the
  responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future
