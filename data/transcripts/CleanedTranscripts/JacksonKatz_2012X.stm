  i 'm going to share with you a paradigm shifting perspective
 on the issues of gender violence sexual assault domestic violence relationship abuse sexual harassment sexual abuse of children  that whole range of issues that i 'll refer to in shorthand as 
  they 've been seen as women 's issues that some good men help out with but i have a problem with that frame and i don 't accept it  i don 't see these as women 's issues that some good men help out with in 
  fact i 'm going to argue that these are men 's issues  first and foremost now obviously 
 obviously they 're also women 's issues so i appreciate that but calling
 gender violence a women 's issue is part of the problem for a number of reasons the first is that it gives men an excuse not to pay
  attention  right a lot of men hear the term women 's issues and we tend to tune it out and we think i 'm a guy that 's for the girls or that 's for the women and a lot of men literally don 't get beyond the first sentence
 as a result it 's almost like a chip in our brain is activated and the neural pathways take our attention in a different direction when we hear the term women 's issues this is also true by the way of the word gender because a lot of people hear the word gender 
 and they think it means
  so they think that gender issues is synonymous with women 's issues there 's some confusion about the term gender and let me illustrate that confusion by way of analogy so let
 's talk for a moment about race in the us when we hear the word race a lot of people think that means african american latino asian american native american 
 south asian pacific islander on and on 
 a lot of people when they hear the word sexual orientation think it means gay
  bisexual and a lot of people when they hear the word gender think it means women in each case  the dominant group doesn 't get paid attention to as if white people don 't have some sort of racial identity 
  or belong to some racial category or construct as if heterosexual people don 't have a sexual orientation 
  to even think about its dominance because that 's one of the key characteristics of power and privilege  the ability to go unexamined  lacking introspection in fact being rendered invisible 
 in large measure in the discourse about issues that are primarily about us and this is amazing how this works in domestic and sexual violence how men have been largely erased from so much of the conversation about a subject that is centrally about men
 and i 'm going to illustrate what i 'm talking about
 by using the old tech  
 i 'm old school on some fundamental regards i make films and i work with high tech but i 'm still old school as an educator and i want to share with you this
 exercise that illustrates on the 
  level how the way that we think literally the way
  conspires to keep our attention off of men this is about domestic violence in particular but you can plug in other
 analogues this comes from the work of the feminist linguist julia penelope  it starts with a very basic english sentence john beat
 mary that 's a good english sentence john is the subject beat is the verb mary is the object good sentence 
 now we 're going to move to the second sentence which says the same thing in the passive voice
  was beaten
 by john 
 and now a whole lot has happened in one sentence  we 've gone from john beat mary to mary was beaten by john we 've shifted our focus in one sentence from john
 to mary and you can see john is very close to the end of the sentence well close to dropping off the map of our psychic plain
  the third sentence john is dropped and we have mary
 was beaten and now it 's all about mary we 're not even thinking about john it 's totally focused on mary over the past generation the term we 've used synonymous with beaten is battered so we have mary was
 battered 
 and the final sentence in this sequence  flowing from the others is mary is a battered woman 
 so now mary 's very identity mary is a battered
  woman
 is what was done to her by john in the first instance but we 've demonstrated that john has long ago left the conversation  those of us who work in the domestic and sexual violence field know that
 victim blaming is pervasive in this realm  which is to say blaming the person to whom something was done rather than the person who did it  
  they attracted to them why do they keep going back what was she wearing at that party what a stupid thing to do why was she drinking with those guys in that hotel room 
 this is victim blaming and there are many reasons for it  but one is that our cognitive structure is set up to blame victims this is all unconscious our whole cognitive structure is set up to ask questions about women and women 's choices and what they 're doing thinking wearing 
 and i 'm not going to shout down people who ask questions about women
 it 's a legitimate thing to ask but 's let 's be clear asking questions about mary is not going to
  get us anywhere in terms of preventing violence we have to ask a different set of questions 
 the questions are not about mary they 're about john
  they include things like why does john beat mary  why is domestic violence still a big problem in the us and all over the world what 's going on why do so many men abuse physically emotionally  verbally and other ways 
 the women and girls and the men and boys that they claim to love what 's going on with men
 why do so many adult men sexually abuse little girls and boys  why is that a common problem in our society and all over the world today why
 do we hear over and over again about new
 scandals erupting in major institutions like the catholic church or the penn state football program or the
 boy scouts of america on and on and on and then local communities all over the country and all over the world   we hear about it all the time the sexual abuse of children
 what 's going on with men why do so many men rape women
 in our society and around the world why do so many men rape other men  what is going on with men and then what
 is the role of the various institutions in our society that are helping to produce abusive men at pandemic rates because this isn 't about individual perpetrators that 's a naive way to understanding what is a much deeper and more systematic social problem
  monsters who crawl out of the swamp and come into town and do their nasty business and then retreat into the darkness  that 's a very naive notion right  
 perpetrators are much more normal
 than that and everyday than that so the question is what are we doing here in our society and in the world what are the roles of various institutions in helping to produce
  the role of religious belief systems the sports culture the pornography culture the family structure economics and how that intersects and race and ethnicity and how that intersects  how does all this work 
 and then once we start making those kinds of connections and asking those important and big questions then we can talk about how we can
  how can we do something differently  how can we change the practices how can we change the socialization of boys and the definitions of manhood that lead to these current outcomes these are the kind of
  questions
 that we need to be asking and the kind of work that we need to be doing but if we 're endlessly focused on what women are doing and thinking
 in relationships or elsewhere  we 're not going to get to that piece 
 i understand that a lot of women who have been trying to speak out about these issues  today and yesterday and for years and years often get shouted down for their
  you know what all this is about it 's called kill the messenger it 's because the women who are standing up and speaking out for themselves and for other women as well as for men and boys
 it 's a statement to them to sit down and shut up keep the current system in place because we don 't like it when people rock the boat we don 't like it when people challenge our power you
  down and shut up  basically and thank goodness that women haven 't done that  thank goodness that we live in a world where there 's so much women 's leadership that can that can counteract that  but one of the powerful 
  roles that men can play in this work is that we can say some things that sometimes women can 't say or better yet we can be heard saying some things that women often can 't be heard saying 
  colleagues and i always say this is we need more men who have the courage and the strength to start standing up and saying some of this stuff 
 and standing with women and not against them and pretending that somehow this is a battle between the sexes and other kinds of nonsense we live in the world together  and by the way one of the things that really bothers me about some of the rhetoric
 against feminists and others who
  rape crisis movements around the world is that somehow like i said that they 're anti male what about all the boys who are profoundly affected in a negative way by what some adult man is doing against their mother 
 themselves their sisters 
 what about all those boys  
 what about all the young men and boys who have been traumatized by adult men 's violence you know what the same system that produces men who abuse women  produces men who abuse other men and if we want to talk about male victims let 's talk about male victims most male victims of violence are the victims of other
  men 's violence so that 's something that both women and men have in common we are both victims of men 's violence  so we have it in our direct self interest not to mention the fact
 that most men that i know have women and girls that we care deeply about in our families and our friendship circles and every other way  so there 's so many reasons why we need men to speak out 
  the nature of the work that i do and my colleagues do in the sports culture and the us military  in schools  
 we pioneered this approach called the bystander approach to gender violence prevention  and i just want to give you the highlights of the bystander approach because it 's a big
 thematic shift although there 's lots of particulars but the heart of it is instead of seeing men as
  women as victims or
 women as perpetrators men as victims or any combination in there i 'm using the gender binary i know there 's more than men and women there 's more than male and female  
 and there are women who are perpetrators and of course there are men who are victims
 there 's a whole spectrum but instead of seeing it in the binary fashion 
 we focus on all of us as what we call bystanders  and a bystander is defined as anybody who is not
 a perpetrator or a victim in a given situation  so in other words friends teammates
  coworkers  family members those of us who are not directly involved in a dyad of abuse  but we are embedded in social family work school and other peer culture 
  relationships with people who might be in that situation what do we do how do we speak up how do we challenge our friends how do we support our friends  but how do we not
  of abuse now when it comes to men and male culture the goal is to get men who are not abusive to challenge men who are and when i say abusive i don 't mean just men who are beating women we 're not just saying a man 
  whose friend is abusing his girlfriend needs to stop the guy at the moment of attack that 's a naive way of creating a
 social change it 's along a continuum we 're trying to get men to interrupt each other so for example if you 're a guy and you 're in a group of guys playing poker
 hanging out no women present and another guy says something sexist or degrading or or harassing about women  
 instead of laughing along or pretending you didn 't hear it we need men to say hey that 's not funny that
 could be my sister you 're talking about and could you joke about something else or could you talk about something else i don 't appreciate that kind of talk just like
  you 're a white person and another white person makes a racist comment you 'd hope  i hope that
 white people would interrupt that racist enactment by a fellow white person just like with heterosexism if you 're a heterosexual person and you yourself don 't enact harassing or abusive behaviors towards people of
 varying sexual orientations if you don 't say something in the face of other heterosexual people doing that then in a sense isn 't your silence a form of consent and complicity well the bystander approach is trying to give people tools
 to interrupt that process and to speak up
  to create a peer culture climate where the abusive behavior will be seen as unacceptable not just because it 's illegal but because it 's wrong and unacceptable in the peer culture and if we can get to the place 
  where men who act out in sexist ways will lose status young men and boys who act out in sexist and harassing ways towards girls and women as well as towards other boys and men  
  lose status as a result of it guess what we 'll see a radical diminution of the abuse because the typical perpetrator is not sick and twisted he 's a normal guy in every other way  
 isn 't he now  
 among the many great things that martin luther king said in his short life was in the end what will hurt the most
 is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends in the end what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our
  there 's been an awful lot of silence in male culture about this ongoing tragedy of men 's violence against women and children  hasn 't there there
 's been an awful lot of silence and all i 'm saying is that we need to break that silence and we need more men to do that  
 now 
 it 's easier said than done  
 because i 'm saying it now  but i 'm telling you it 's not easy in male culture for guys to challenge each other  which is one of the reasons why
 part of the paradigm shift that has to happen is not just understanding these issues as
  men 's issues  but they 're also leadership issues for men because ultimately  the responsibility for taking a stand on these issues should not fall on the shoulders of little boys or teenage boys in high school or
 or college men it should be on adult men with power adult men with power are the ones we need to be holding accountable for being leaders on these issues because when somebody speaks up in a peer culture and challenges and interrupts 
 he or she
 is being a leader
  but on a big scale we need more adult men with power to start prioritizing these issues  and we haven 't seen that yet have we now  
 i was at a dinner a number of years ago  
 and i work extensively with the us military all the services  and i was at this dinner and this woman said to me
 i think she thought she was a little clever she said so how long have you been doing sensitivity training with the marines
 and i said with all due respect  
 i don 't do sensitivity training with the marines  i run a leadership program in the in the marine corps now i know it 's a bit pompous my response but it
 's an important distinction  because i don 't believe that what we need is sensitivity training we need leadership training because for example when a professional coach or a manager of a
 baseball team or a football team and i work extensively in that realm as well
 makes a sexist comment  makes a homophobic statement makes a racist comment 
 there will be discussions on the sports blogs and in sports talk radio and some people will say he needs sensitivity training other people will say well get off it that 's political correctness run amok he made a stupid statement move on 
 my argument is he doesn 't need sensitivity training he needs leadership training  because he 's being a bad leader  because in a society with  with gender diversity and sexual diversity
 and racial and ethnic diversity you make those kind of comments you 're failing at your leadership if we can make this point
 that i 'm making to powerful men and women in our society at all levels of institutional authority and power  
 it 's going to change the paradigm of people 's thinking 
 you know for example  i work a lot in college and university athletics throughout north america
  about how to prevent domestic and sexual violence right  
 there 's no excuse for a college or university to not have domestic and sexual violence prevention training mandated for all student athletes coaches administrators as part of their educational 
  process we know enough to know that we can easily do that  but you know what 's missing the leadership but it 's not the leadership of student
  it 's the leadership of the athletic director the president of the university the people in charge who make decisions about resources and who make decisions about priorities in the institutional settings   that 's a failure in most cases of men 's leadership look at penn state penn state
 is the mother of all teachable moments for the bystander approach you had so many situations in that realm where men in powerful positions failed to act to protect
  it 's unbelievable really  but when you get into it you realize there are pressures on men there are constraints within peer cultures on men  which is why we need to encourage men
 to break through those pressures and one of the ways to do that is to say there 's an awful lot of men who care deeply about these issues i know this i work with men and i 've been working with tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of men for many many decades now 
 it 's scary when you
  how many years  but
 there 's so many men who care deeply about these issues but caring deeply is not enough we need more men with the guts with the courage with the strength 
 with the moral integrity to break our complicit silence
 and
 challenge each other and stand with women and not against them 
 by the way we owe it to women  there 's no question about it but we also owe it to our sons  we also owe it to young men who are growing up all over the world in situations where they didn 't make the choice to
 a man in a culture that tells them that manhood is a certain way they didn 't make the choice  we that have a choice 
 have an opportunity and a responsibility to them as well  i hope that going forward 
 men and women working together can begin the change and the transformation that will happen so that future generations won 't have the level of tragedy that we deal with on a daily basis  i know we can do it
