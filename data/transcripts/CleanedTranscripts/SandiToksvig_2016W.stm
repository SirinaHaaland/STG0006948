  excited to be here everything in america is so much bigger than in europe look at me i am huge 
 it 's fantastic and ted talks ted talks are where
  everybody has great ideas so the question is where do those great ideas come from well
 it 's a little bit of debate but it 's generally reckoned that the average person that 's me has about fifty thousand thoughts a day which is a lot until you realize 
  that ninety five percent of them are the same ones you had the day before 
 and a lot of mine are really
  i know i must clean the floor  oh i forgot to walk the dog my most popular don 't eat that cookie 
 laughter so ninety five percent repetition that leaves us with just a five percent window of opportunity each day to actually think something new 
  my new thoughts are useless the other day i was watching some sports on television and i was trying to decide why i just don 't engage with it some of it i find curious this is odd do you
 think it would be worth being that flexible just to be able to see your heel at that angle 
 and here 's the thing i 'm never going to be able to relate to that because i 'm never going to be able to do it ok
 but i 'll tell you the truth the truth is i have never been any good at sport  ok  i 've reached that wonderful age when all my friends say oh i wish i was as fit as i was when i was eighteen 
 and i always feel rather smug then 
 i 'm exactly as fit as i was when
  i couldn 't run then i 'm certainly not going to do it now 
 laughter so then i had
 my new idea  why not engage people like me in sport  i think what the world needs now is the olympics for people with zero athletic ability 
 oh it would be so much more
  it 's a terrible
 idea  and
 i also know why i don 't engage with sport when i watch it on television it 's because probably
 ninety seven percent of it is about men running and men kicking things men trying to look
 neatly packaged in lycra there is
  is so little female sport on television that a young woman watching might be forgiven for thinking and how can i put this nicely that
 the male member is the very lever you need to get yourself off the couch and onto a sports ground 
 the inequalities in sport
  so this is what happens to me  i have a brand new idea  and immediately i come back to an old one the fact is there is not now  nor has there ever been in the whole of 
  history a single country in the world where women have equality with men not one one hundred and ninety six countries it hasn 't happened in the whole of evolution so here is a picture of evolution
  we women are not even in it 
 it 's a wonder men have been able to evolve quite so brilliantly so 
 it bugs me and i know i should do something about it but i 'm busy ok i have
  i 've got three kids i 've got an elderly mom in fact if i 'm honest with you one of the reasons i came out here is because ted talks said i could have fifteen minutes to myself and i never have that much time so i 'm
 busy and anyway i already had a go at changing the world here 's the thing ok  everybody has inside
  themselves what i call an activation button 
 it 's the button that gets pressed when you think i must do something about this it gets pressed for all sorts of reasons maybe you face some kind of inequality or you 've come across an injustice of some 
  kind sometimes an illness strikes or you 're born in some way disadvantaged or perhaps underprivileged   so i was born gay ok i 've always known i don 't think my family were the least bit surprised 
 inside i genuinely believed that i looked like clint eastwood  
 so my activation button was pressed when i had my kids three wonderful kids 
 born to my  then partner now here 's the thing i work on television in britain by the
  they were born i was already hosting my own shows and working in the public eye i love what i do  but i love my kids more
 and i didn 't want them to grow up with a secret one thousand nine hundred and ninety four 
 when my son my youngest was born there was not as far as i was aware a single out gay woman in british public life  
 i don 't think secrets are a good thing i think they are a cancer of the soul  so i decided to come out
 everybody warned me
  that i would never work again  but i decided it was absolutely worth the risk  well it was hell
  in britain we have a particularly vicious section of the right wing press and they went nuts  and their hatred stirred up the less stable elements of society  
 and we got death threats enough death threats that i had to take the kids into hiding  and we had to have
 police protection
  and i promise you there were many moments in the still of the night when i was terrified by what i had done
 eventually the dust settled against all expectation i carried on working  
 and my kids were and continue to be absolutely fantastic i remember when my son was six he had a friend over to play they were in the next room i could hear them chatting the friend said to my son
  little anxious to hear so i leant in to hear and my son said it 's fantastic because if one of them 's sick you 've still got another one to cook for you 
 so my activation button for gay equality was pressed and along with many many others i campaigned for years
  for gay rights and in particular the right to marry the person that i love in the end we succeeded  and in two thousand and fourteen on the day that the law was changed i married my wife who i love very much indeed we didn
 't do it in a quiet way we did it on the stage at the royal festival hall in london
  it was a great event the hall seats two and a half thousand people
  we invited one hundred and fifty family and friends then i let it be known to the public anybody who wanted to come and celebrate  please come and join us it would be free to anybody who wanted to come
 two and half thousand people turned up 
 every kind of person you can imagine gays straights  rabbis nuns married people black white the whole of humanity was there and i remember standing on that
  and i
 genuinely thought my activation days were over ok so every year in that same hall i host a fantastic concert
 to celebrate international women 's day  we gather the world 's only all female orchestra  we play fantastic
  music by forgotten or overlooked women composers we have amazing conductors it 's marin alsop there from baltimore conducting petula clark singing and i give a lecture on women 's history 
 i love to gather inspirational stories from the past and pass them on too often i think
 for the right for women in britain to vote  and their slogan was deeds not words and boy they succeeded because women did indeed get the vote in 
  giving this talk about this and as i 'm talking what i realized is this was not a history lecture i was giving this was not something where the job was
  this was something where there was so much left to do  nowhere in the world for example do women have equal representation in positions of power ok let 's take a very quick 
  look at the top one hundred companies in the london stock exchange in two thousand and sixteen top one hundred companies 
  there are more men called john running ftse one hundred companies 
 than there are women there are fourteen run by men called
  why does it matter  well it 's that pesky business of the gender pay gap  nowhere in the world do women earn the same as men and 
  that is never going to change unless we have more women at the top in the boardroom we have plenty of laws  the equal pay act in britain was passed in
  many many women who from early november until the end of the year by comparison to their male colleagues are effectively working for free
 in fact the world economic forum estimates that women will finally get equal pay
  the day before i came out to give my talk the world economic forum revised it so that 's good because that 's a terrible two thousand one hundred and thirty three do you know what they revised it to
 yeah another fifty three years ok  
 we are not going to get equal pay in my grandchildren 's grandchildren 's lives under the current system  and i have
  waited long enough i 've waited long enough in my own business in two thousand and sixteen i became the very first woman on british television to host a 
 panel show isn 't that great wonderful i 'm thrilled but but two thousand and
 sixteen  the first television 's been around for eighty
  may be television 's not so important but it 's kind of symptomatic isn 't it two thousand and sixteen the un were looking for a brand new ambassador
 to represent women 's empowerment and gender equality and who did they choose  wonder woman
  yes they chose a cartoon ok 
 because no woman was up to the job
  the representation of women in positions of power is shockingly low it 's true in congress  and it 's certainly true in the british parliament in two thousand and fifteen  the number of men elected 
 to the parliament that year was greater than the total number of women who have ever been members of parliament and why does it matter here 's the thing if they 're 
  not at the table literally in britain at that table helping to make the laws do not be surprised if the female perspective is
 it 's a great role model for young people to see a woman in charge in two thousand and sixteen britain got its second female prime minister theresa may
 came to power the day she came to power she was challenged just do one thing  do one thing in the first one hundred days that you 're in office
 to try and improve lives for women in britain  and what did she do  nothing 
  's much too busy cleaning up the mess the boys made 
 even having a female leader they always find something better to do than to sort out the pesky issue of inequality  so i keep talking about equality like 
  it matters does it  well let 's take a very quick look at the stem industries ok so science technology engineering and mathematics pretty much important in every single aspect
  glass ceiling in the stem industries
 what if the cure for cancer or the answer the global warming lies in the head of a young female scientist who fails to progress  
 so i thought all these things  and i knew i had to do
  and i spoke to my wonderful friend brilliant journalist catherine mayer in britain  and we rather foolishly and i i suspect there was wine involved 
 we decided to found a brand new political party because here 's the critical thing the one place women and men are absolutely equal
 is at the ballot box we had no idea what we were doing we didn 't know how complicated it was to start a political party  i thought it can 't be
  that difficult men have been doing it for years 
 so we started
 by calling it the women 's equality party and straightaway people said to me why did you call it that
 yes because bras are famously made of flammable material 
 that 's why all women spark when they walk here
 's quick history sidebar for you no woman ever burnt her bra
  it 's a story made up by a journalist thank goodness journalism has improved since then  so 
 i announced what we were going to do in a broadcast interview  and straightaway the emails started coming first hundreds then thousands and thousands from every age group from the very 
  young to women in their ' 90s to hundreds of wonderful men people wrote and said please can i help please can i visit you at party headquarters
  was a wonderful tight group of fabulous friends trying to answer emails pretty much
 in our pajamas 
 we were all busy many of us had careers many of us had children but we did what women do  and we shared the work 
 and almost instantly we agreed on certain fundamental things  first thing we want
 to be the only political party in the world whose main aim was to no longer need to exist  that 's a fantastic
 we wanted to be the only political party with no particular political leaning we wanted people from the left from the right from the middle every age group  
 because the whole point was to work with a simple agenda let 's get equality in every aspect of our lives and when we 're finished let 's go home and get the other chores done 
  have this but in britain we have two major political parties they 're the dinosaurs of politics and how they speak to each other is shameful and poisonous i 'm
 sure you 've never had that kind of name calling 
 and lying here wouldn 't it be great if just one politician said do you know my opponent has a point let 's see if we can 't work together
  and let 's get more women into politics  ok let 's immediately get more women into politics by being the only political party to offer free childcare to our candidates so they can get out of the house and start campaigning 
 within ten months
  we had more than seventy branches of our party across the uk  we stood candidates for election in london scotland and wales in may two thousand and sixteen one in twenty people 
  voted for our candidate for london mayor  and when the men in the race saw how many votes we were attracting wonder of wonders they began to talk about the need to tackle gender equality
  know i 've been promised change since i was a child it was always coming women were going to stand shoulder to shoulder with men all i got were empty promises and disappointment enough disappointment
  to found a political party but here is my new idea for today this is my five percent ok  and this one is really good the fact is this is not enough it is not enough to found one political party for equality in a single country what
  we need is a seismic change in the global political landscape and the wonderful thing about the model we have created is that it would work anywhere it would work in 
  america it would work in australia it would work in india it 's like we 've made the perfect recipe anybody can cook it and it 's good for everybody
  millions of women across the world to say that 's enough to the traditional battles of politics to say stop the bickering let 's get the work done we could literally change the world  and i want that
  want it for our sons because the fact is equality is better for everyone come on people let 's activate let 's change the world  i know
