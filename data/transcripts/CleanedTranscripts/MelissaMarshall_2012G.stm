  five years ago  i experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be alice in wonderland  
 penn state asked me a communications teacher to teach a communications class for engineering students 
  really scared scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big unfamiliar words  
 but as these conversations unfolded 
 i experienced what alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world 
 that 's just how i felt as i had those conversations with the students i was amazed at the
  that they had and i wanted others to experience this wonderland as well  
 and i believe the key to opening that door is great communication 
 we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest 
  challenges from energy to environment to health care among others 
  it 's our responsibility as non scientists to have these interactions  
 but these great conversations can 't occur if our scientists and engineers don 't invite us in to see their wonderland so scientists and engineers please talk nerdy to us
  i want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy
 and that your engineering is engaging
  first question to answer for us so what tell us why your science is relevant to us don 't just tell me that you study trabeculae 
 but tell me that you study trabeculae which is the mesh like structure of our bones because it 's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis  
 and when you 're describing your science beware of jargon jargon is a barrier to
  understanding of your ideas sure you can say spatial and temporal but why not just say space and time which is so much more accessible to us 
 and making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down instead as einstein said make everything as simple as possible but no simpler 
 you can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas
 a few things to consider are having examples stories and analogies those are ways to engage and excite us about your content  and
 when presenting your work
 drop the bullet points have you ever wondered why they 're called bullet points 
 what do bullets do bullets kill and they will kill your presentation a slide like this is not
  only boring  but it relies too much on the language area of our brain and causes us to become overwhelmed  
 instead this example slide by genevieve brown is much more effective it 's showing that the special structure of trabeculae  are so strong that they actually inspired 
  the unique design of the eiffel tower  and the trick here is to use a single  readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a
  bit lost and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what 's being described
  so scientists and engineers
