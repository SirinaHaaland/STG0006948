  has everybody heard of crispr i would be shocked if you hadn 't this is a technology it 's for genome editing
 and it 's so versatile and so controversial that it 's sparking all sorts of really interesting conversations  should we bring back the woolly
  mammoth 
 should we edit a human embryo  and my personal favorite 
 how can we justify wiping out an entire species that we consider harmful to humans off the face of the earth using this technology 
 this type of science is moving much faster than the regulatory mechanisms that govern it and so for the past six years
  i 've made it my personal mission
 to make sure that as many people as possible understand these types of technologies and their implications now crispr has been
 the subject of a huge media hype  and the words that are used most often are easy and cheap 
 so what i want to do is drill down a little bit deeper and look into some of the the myths and the
 around  crispr 
 if you 're trying to crispr a genome  the first thing that you have to do is damage the dna
  the damage comes in the form of a double strand break through the double helix  and then the cellular repair processes kick in 
 and then we convince those repair processes to make the edit that we want and not a natural edit that 's how it works
 it 's a two part system  you 've got a cas9 protein and something called a guide rna i like to think of it as a guided missile  
 so the cas9 i love to anthropomorphize so the cas9 is kind of this pac man thing that wants to chew dna and the guide rna is the leash that 's keeping it
 out of the genome until it finds the exact spot where it matches  and the combination of
  those two is called crispr it 's a system that we stole from an ancient ancient bacterial immune system  
 the part that 's amazing about it is that the guide rna only twenty letters of it are what target the system 
 this is really easy to design and it 's really cheap to
  that 's the part that is modular in the system everything else stays the same  this makes it a remarkably easy and powerful system to use 
 the guide rna and the cas9 protein complex together go bouncing along the genome  and when they find a spot where the guide rna matches 
 then it inserts between the two strands of the double helix  it rips them apart 
 that triggers the cas9 protein to cut
  and all of a sudden  you 've got a cell that 's in total panic because now it 's got a piece of dna that 's broken 
 what does it do it calls its first responders  
 there are two major repair pathways  the first just takes the dna and shoves the two pieces back together 
 this isn 't a very efficient system  because what happens is sometimes a base drops out or a base is added
  it 's an ok way to maybe like  
 knock out a gene  but it 's not the the way that we really want to do genome editing the second repair pathway is a lot more interesting in this repair pathway it takes 
 a homologous piece of dna and now mind you in a diploid organism like people we 've got one copy of our genome from our mom and
 one from our dad so if one gets damaged it can use the other chromosome to repair it so that 's where this comes from 
 the repair is made  and now the genome is safe again 
 the way that we can hijack this is we can feed it a false piece of dna a piece that has homology on both ends but is different in the middle  
 so now you can put whatever you want in the center and the cell gets fooled 
 so you can change a letter  you can take letters out but most importantly you can
  stuff new dna in kind of like a trojan horse
 crispr is going to be amazing in terms of the number of different scientific advances that it 's going to catalyze  the thing that 's special about it is this 
  modular targeting system i mean we 've been shoving dna into organisms for years right  
  we can actually put it exactly where we want it the thing is that there 's a lot of
 talk about it being cheap and it being easy and
 i run a community lab  
 i 'm starting to get emails from people that say stuff like hey can i come to your open night and like maybe use crispr and engineer my genome
  but i 've heard it 's cheap i 've heard it 's easy we 're going to explore that a little bit so how cheap is it yeah  it is cheap in comparison 
 it 's going to take the cost of the average materials for an experiment from thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars and it cuts the time a lot too it can cut it from weeks
  that 's great  you still need a professional lab to do the work in you 're not going to do anything meaningful outside of a professional lab i mean
  don 't listen to anyone who says you can do this sort of stuff on your kitchen table
 it 's really not easy to do this kind of work not to mention there 's a patent battle going on so even if you do invent something the broad institute
  are in this incredible patent battle it 's really fascinating to watch it happen 
 because they 're accusing each other of fraudulent claims and then they 've got people saying oh well i signed my notebook here or there 
 this isn 't going to be settled for years  and when it is you can bet you 're going to pay someone a really hefty licensing fee in order to use this stuff 
 so is it really cheap
  it 's cheap if you 're doing basic research and you 've got a lab how about easy let 's look at that claim  
 the devil is always in the details  
 we don 't really know that much about cells they 're still kind of black boxes  for example  we don 't know why some guide rnas work really well and some guide rnas don 't  
 we don 't know why some cells want to do one repair pathway and some cells would rather do the
  other 
 and besides that there 's the whole problem of getting the system into the cell in the first place in a petri dish that 's not that hard but if you 're trying to do it on a whole organism it gets really tricky 
 it 's ok if you use something like blood or bone marrow those are the targets of a lot of research now there was a great story of some
  little girl who they saved from leukemia by taking the blood out editing it and putting it back with a
 precursor of crispr 
 and this is a line of research that people are going to do  but right now if you want to get into the whole body you 're probably going to have to use a virus so you take the virus you put the crispr into it you let the virus infect the cell  but now you 've got this virus in there  
 and we don 't know what the long term effects of that are plus 
  very small percentage but they 're still there  what 's going to happen over time with that 
 these are not trivial questions  and there are scientists that are trying to solve them and they will eventually hopefully be solved  
 but it ain 't plug and play not by a long shot so is it really easy  
 well  if you spend a few years working it out in your particular system
  it is now the other thing is we don 't really know that much about how to make
 a particular thing happen
 by changing particular spots in the genome we 're a long way away from figuring out how to give a pig wings for example  
 or even an extra leg i 'd settle for an extra leg that would be kind of cool right  
 but what is happening is that crispr is being used by thousands and thousands of scientists to
  do really really important work like making better models of diseases in animals for example or for taking
 pathways that produce valuable chemicals and getting them into industrial production in fermentation vats
  or even doing really basic research on what genes
  this is the story of crispr we should be telling  
 and i don 't like it that the flashier aspects of it are drowning all of this out  lots of scientists did a lot of work to make crispr happen  
 and what 's interesting to me is that these scientists are being supported
 by our society  think about it  we 've got an infrastructure that allows a certain percentage of people
 to spend all their time doing research
  that makes us all the inventors of crispr 
 and i would say that makes us all the shepherds of crispr we all have a responsibility  
 so i would urge you to really learn about these types of technologies  because really only in that way are we going to be able to guide
 the development of these technologies the use of these technologies and make sure that in the
  end it 's a positive outcome for both the planet and for us thanks
