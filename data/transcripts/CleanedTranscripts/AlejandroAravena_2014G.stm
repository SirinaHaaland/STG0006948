  any power in design that 's the power of synthesis  the more complex the problem  the more the need for simplicity  
 so allow me to share three cases where we tried to apply design 's power of synthesis  
 let 's start
  start with the global challenge of urbanization  
 it 's a fact that people are moving towards  cities and even if counterintuitive  it 's good news  
 evidence shows that people are better off in cities  
 but there 's a problem that i would call the 3s menace  
 the scale  speed and scarcity of means with which we will have to respond to this phenomenon
  has no precedence in history 
 for you to have an idea out of the three billion people living in cities today one billion are under the line of poverty 
 by two thousand and thirty out of the five billion people that will be living in cities 
 two billion are going to be under the line of poverty 
  that means that we will have to build
 a one 
 city per week
 with ten thousand dollars per family
 during the next fifteen years a one million person city per week with ten thousand dollars per family if we don 't solve this equation it is not that people
  will stop coming to cities they will come anyhow  
 but they will live in slums favelas and informal settlements  so what to do  
 well an answer may come from favelas and slums themselves 
 a clue could be in this question we were asked ten years ago  we were asked to accommodate one hundred families that had been occupying
 illegally half a hectare
 in the center of the city of iquique in the north of chile using a $ ten thousand subsidy with which we had to buy the land 
 provide the infrastructure and build the houses that in the best of the cases would be of around forty square meters
  and by the way they said 
 the cost of the land because it 's in the center of the city is three times more than what social housing can normally afford  
 due to the difficulty of the question we decided to include the families in the process of understanding the constraints  
 and we started a participatory design process and testing what was available
  only way to accommodate all of them was by building in height 
 and they threatened us to go on a hunger strike if we even dared to offer this as a solution  because they could not make the tiny apartments expand  
 so the conclusion with the
  families and this is important not our conclusion with the families was that we had a problem we had to innovate  so what did we do 
 well a middle class family
 lives reasonably well in around eighty square meters  but
 when there 's no money what the market does is to reduce the size of the house
 to forty square meters  what we said was what if  
 instead of thinking of forty square meters
 as a small house why don 't we consider it half of a good one when you rephrase the
  problem as half of a good house instead of a small one  the key question is which half do we do  
 and we thought we had to do with public money the half that families won 't be able to do individually
  we identified five design conditions that belonged to the hard half
  a house and we went back to the families to do two things join forces and split tasks 
 our design was something in between a building and a house 
 as a building it could pay for expensive well located land  
 and as a house  it could expand if
 in the process of not being expelled to the periphery while getting a house families kept their network and their jobs
  we knew that the expansion would begin right away  so we went from this initial social housing
 to a middle class unit achieved by families themselves within a couple of weeks 
 this was our first project in iquique ten years ago this is our last project in chile  different designs
  same principle you provide the frame  and from then on families take over  
 so
 the purpose of design 
 trying to understand and trying to give an answer to the 3s menace scale speed and scarcity is to channel people 's own building
  we won 't solve the one million people per week equation unless we use people 's own power for building  
 so with the right design slums and favelas may not be the problem but actually the only possible solution  
 the second case is how design can contribute to sustainability in two thousand and
  we entered the competition for the angelini innovation center and the aim was to build the right environment for knowledge creation  
 it is accepted that for such an aim knowledge creation interaction among people face to face contact it 's important and we agreed on that 
 but for us the question of the right environment was a very literal question we wanted to have a working space with the right light with the right temperature with
  the right air  
 so we asked ourselves 
 does the typical office building help us in that sense  well how does that building look typically  
 it 's a collection of floors one on top of each other with a core in the center with
  and then a glass skin on the outside
 that due to direct sun radiation  creates a huge greenhouse effect inside  
 in addition to that let 's say a guy working on the seventh floor goes every single day through the third floor but has no idea what the guy on that floor is working on  
 so we thought well  maybe we have
  to turn this scheme inside out  and what we did was let 's have an open atrium a
 hollowed core  the same collection of floors  but have the walls and the mass in the perimeter  
 so that
 when the sun
  's not impacting directly glass but a wall 
 when you have an open atrium inside you are able to see what others are doing from within the building and you have a better way to control light  
 and when you place the mass and the walls in the perimeter  then you are preventing direct sun radiation  
 you may also open those windows and get
  we just made those openings of such a scale that they could work as elevated squares  outdoor spaces throughout the entire height of the building  
 none of this is rocket science  you don 't require sophisticated programming it 's not about technology this is just
  and by using common sense  we went from one hundred and twenty kilowatts per square meter per year  which is the typical energy consumption for cooling a glass tower 
 to forty
 kilowatts per square meter per year  so with the right design sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use of common
  last case i would like to share is how design can provide more comprehensive answers against natural disasters 
 you may know that chile in two thousand and ten was hit by an eight point eight richter scale earthquake and tsunami  
 and we were called to work in the reconstruction of the constitucin in the southern part of the
  we were given one hundred days 
 three months to design almost everything from public buildings to public space  street grid transportation housing and mainly
 how to protect the city against future tsunamis  
 this was new in chilean urban design  
 and there were in the air a couple of alternatives first one  forbid installation on ground zero  thirty million dollars spent mainly in land expropriation
 this is exactly what 's being discussed in japan nowadays and if you have a disciplined population like the japanese this may work 
 but we know that in chile  this land is going to be occupied illegally anyhow  so this alternative was unrealistic and undesirable 
 second alternative build a
 big wall heavy infrastructure to resist the energy of the waves
  this alternative was conveniently lobbied by big building companies because it meant forty two million dollars in contracts and was also politically preferred because it required no land expropriation  
 but japan proved that trying to resist the force of nature is useless 
  and we started a participatory design process
  i don 't know if you were able to read the subtitles but you can tell from the body language that participatory design is not
  it is actually not even with the families trying to find the right answer  
 it is mainly trying to identify with precision what is the right question there is nothing worse than answering well the wrong question  
 so it was pretty obvious after this process that well  
 we chicken out here and go away because it 's too tense  or we go even further
 in asking what else is bothering you what other problems do you have and you want us to take care of now that the city
 will have to be rethought from scratch  
 and what they said was look  fine to protect the city against future tsunamis we really appreciate but the next one is going to come in what twenty years  
 but every single year  we have problems of flooding due to rain
  in addition we are in the middle of the forest region of the country  and our public space sucks  it 's poor and it 's scarce 
 and the origin of the city our identity is not really connected to the buildings that fell  it is connected to the river  but the river cannot be accessed publicly because its shores are privately owned
  so we thought that we had to produce a third alternative  
 and our our approach was against geographical threats have geographical answers 
 what if  in between the city
 and the sea
 we have a forest
 a forest that doesn 't try to resist the energy of nature  but dissipates it by introducing friction 
 a forest that may be able to laminate the water and prevent the flooding 
 that may pay the historical debt of public space  
 and that may provide finally
  access to the river  
 so as a conclusion of the participatory design  the alternative was validated politically and socially but there was still the problem of the cost
 forty eight million dollars  so what we did was a survey in the public investment system  and found out that
 were three ministries with three projects in the exact same place not knowing of the existence of the other projects the sum of them
 million dollars  
 so design 's power of synthesis is trying to make a more efficient use of the scarcest resource in cities which is not money but coordination 
 by doing so we were able to save four million dollars and that is why the forest is today under construction
 so
 be it the force of self construction 
 the force of common sense  or the force of nature  all these forces need to be translated into form  
 and what that form is modeling and shaping is not cement
  life itself 
 design 's power of synthesis is just an attempt to put at the innermost core of architecture the force of life 
 thank you so much
