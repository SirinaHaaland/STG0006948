  the history of computers
 we 've been striving to shorten the gap between us and digital information the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination
  can go wild
 and this gap has become shorter
 shorter and even shorter and now this gap is shortened down to less than a millimeter the thickness of a touch screen glass and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone
 but i wondered what if there could be no boundary at all
 i started to imagine what this would look like
 first i
  created this tool which penetrates into the digital space so when you press it hard on the screen it transfers its physical body into pixels
 designers can materialize their ideas directly in three d and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen
 so with this tool this boundary
  has been broken
 but our two hands still remain outside the screen how can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands
 at microsoft applied sciences along with my mentor cati boulanger
 i redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace
 by combining a transparent display and depth cameras for sensing your fingers and face now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard and reach
  inside this three d space and grab pixels with your bare hands
 applause because windows and files have a position in the real space selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf
 then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window architects can stretch or rotate the models with their two
  hands directly
 so in these examples we are reaching into the digital world
 but how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead
 i 'm sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online but now you don 't have to worry about it what i got here is an online augmented fitting room
 this is a view
  that you get from head mounted or see through display when the system understands the geometry of your body
 taking this idea further i started to think
 instead of just seeing these pixels in our space how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it
 what would such a future look like at mit media lab
 along with my advisor hiroshi ishii and my collaborator rehmi post
 we created this one physical pixel
 well in this case
 this spherical magnet acts like a three d pixel in our space which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little three d space
 what we did was essentially canceling gravity
 and controlling the movement by
  combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies
 and by digitally programming the object we are liberating the object from constraints of time and space which means that now human motions can be recorded and played back
 and left permanently in the physical world so choreography can be taught physically over distance
  and michael jordan 's famous shooting can be replicated over and over as a physical reality
 students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion physics
 and unlike computer screens or textbooks
 this is a real tangible experience that you can touch and feel and it 's very powerful
 and what 's more exciting
 than just turning what 's currently in the computer physical
 is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities laughter
 as you can see the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surroundings without disconnecting
  ourselves from our world today we started by talking about the boundary
 but if we remove this boundary the only boundary left is our imagination thank you
