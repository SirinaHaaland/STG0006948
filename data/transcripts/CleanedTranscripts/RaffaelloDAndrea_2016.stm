  what started as a platform for hobbyists is poised to become a multibillion dollar industry  
 inspection  environmental monitoring photography and film and journalism  
 these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones and their enablers are the capabilities being developed at research facilities around the world for
  example before aerial package delivery entered our social consciousness 
 an autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six meter tall tower composed of one thousand five hundred bricks in front of a live audience at the frac centre in france 
 and several years ago they started to fly with ropes by tethering flying machines they can achieve high speeds and accelerations in very tight
  they can also autonomously build tensile structures  skills learned include how to carry loads how to cope with disturbances and in general how to interact with the physical world 
 today we want to show you some new projects that we 've been working on 
 their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved with autonomous flight  
 now for a system to function autonomously it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in
  back at our lab at eth zurich we often use external cameras to locate objects which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks 
 for the demos you will see today however we will use new localization technology developed by verity studios a spin off from our lab  
 there are no external cameras each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space and onboard
  to determine what its actions should be the only external commands are
  an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it 
 like other fixed wing aircraft it is efficient in forward flight  much more so than helicopters and variations thereof  
 unlike most other fixed wing aircraft however it is capable of hovering  which has huge advantages for takeoff landing and general
  there is no free lunch unfortunately 
 one of the limitations with tail sitters is that they 're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts 
 we 're developing new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation 
 the idea is for the aircraft to recover no matter what state it finds itself
  and through practice improve its performance over time
  when doing research we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that try to get at the heart of a matter 
 for example one such question would be what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight  now there are practical reasons why you may want to know the
  answer to such a question 
 helicopters for example are affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts all conspiring to do you bodily harm 
 it turns out that decades ago  skilled pilots were able to fly  remote controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts a propeller and a tail rudder 
 we recently discovered that it could be done with just one 
  's mechanically simplest controllable flying machine invented just a few months ago  
 it has only one moving part a propeller  
 it has no flaps no hinges  no ailerons no other actuators no other control surfaces just a simple propeller  
 even though it 's mechanically simple there 's a lot going on in its little electronic brain to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space
  even so it doesn 't yet have the sophisticated algorithms of the tail sitter which means that in order to get it to fly  i have to throw it just right 
 and because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low  given everybody watching me what we 're going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night
  an exercise in frugality this machine here the  omnicopter with its eight propellers
 is an exercise in excess 
 what can you do with all this surplus the thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric 
 as a result it is ambivalent to orientation 
 this gives it an extraordinary capability  it can move anywhere it wants in space irrespective of where it is facing and even of how it is rotating
  it has its own complexities  mainly having to do with the interacting flows from its eight propellers 
 some of this can be modeled while the rest can be learned on the fly  let 's take a look
  if flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives they will need to become extremely safe and reliable 
 this machine over here is actually two separate two propeller flying machines  this one wants to spin clockwise this other one wants to spin counterclockwise  when you put them together  they behave like one
  if anything goes wrong however a motor fails a propeller fails  electronics even a battery pack
  disabling one of its halves
  this last demonstration is an exploration of synthetic swarms 
 the large number of autonomous coordinated entities offers a new palette for aesthetic expression 
 we 've taken commercially available micro quadcopters each weighing less than a slice of bread by the way and outfitted them with our localization technology and custom algorithms 
 because each unit knows where it is in space
 there is really no limit to their number
  one
  these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up new revolutionary roles for flying machines 
 that ultrasafe one over there for example has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on broadway 
 the reality is that it is difficult to predict the impact of nascent technology and for folks like us
  us the real reward is the journey and the act of creation  it 's a continual reminder of how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is 
 that it allows creative clever creatures to sculpt it in such spectacular ways 
 the fact that this technology has such huge commercial and economic potential
  is just icing on the cake  thank you
