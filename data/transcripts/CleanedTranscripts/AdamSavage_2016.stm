  there 's this fact that i love that i read somewhere once that
 one of the things that 's contributed to homo sapiens  ' success as a species is our lack of body hair that our hairlessness 
  our nakedness combined with our invention of clothing  gives us the ability to modulate our body temperature
 and thus be able to survive in any climate we choose 
 and now we 've evolved to the point where we can 't survive without clothing and it 's more than just utility now it 's a communication everything that we choose to put on is a narrative a story about where we 've been what we 're doing 
 who we want to be
  i was a lonely kid i didn 't have an easy time finding friends to play with and i ended up making a lot of my own play i made a lot of my own toys
  it began with ice cream there was a 
 in my hometown  and they served ice cream from behind the counter in these giant five gallon cardboard tubs  and someone told me i was eight years old someone told me that when they were done with those tubs they
 washed them out and kept them in the back and if you asked they would give you one it took me a couple of weeks to work up the courage but i did  
 and they did they gave me one i went home with this beautiful cardboard tub
 i was trying to figure out what i could do with this exotic material metal ring top and bottom i started turning it over in my head and i realized wait a minute
 my head actually fits inside this thing yeah  i cut a hole out i put some acetate in there and i made myself a space helmet
  i needed a place to wear the space helmet 
 so i found a refrigerator box a couple blocks from home i pushed it home and in my parents '
 guest room closet i turned it into a spaceship  i started with a control panel out of cardboard i cut a hole for a radar screen and put a flashlight underneath it to light 
  it i put a view screen up which i offset off the back wall and this is where i thought i was being really clever without permission
  i painted the back wall of the closet black and put a star field which i lit up with some christmas lights
 i found in the attic  and i went on some space missions 
 a couple years later  the movie jaws came out i was way too young to see it but i was caught up in jaws fever like everyone else in america at the time there
  store in my town that had a jaws costume in their window and my mom must have overheard me talking to someone about how awesome i thought this costume was because a couple days before halloween she blew my freaking mind
 by giving me this jaws costume 
 now  i recognize it 's a bit of a trope for people of a certain age to complain that kids these days have no idea how good they have it
  but let me just show you a random sampling of entry level kids ' costumes you can buy online right now and this is the
 my mom bought for me 
 this is a paper thin shark face and a vinyl bib with the poster of jaws on it 
 and i loved it a
 couple years later my dad took me to a film called excalibur i actually got him to take me to it twice which is no small thing because it is a hard
  but it wasn 't the blood and guts or the boobs that made me want to go see it again  they helped it was the armor the armor in 
  beautiful to me these were literally knights in shining
 armor and moreover the knights in excalibur wear their armor everywhere all the time they wear it at dinner  they wear it to bed
 i was like are they reading my mind  i want to wear armor all the time laughter
 so i went back to my favorite material the gateway drug for making corrugated cardboard and i made myself a suit of armor  
 replete with the neck shields and a white horse now that i 've oversold it here 's a picture of the armor that i made
  this is only the first suit of armor i made inspired by excalibur a couple of years later  i convinced my dad to embark on making me a proper suit of armor 
 over about a month he graduated me from cardboard to roofing aluminum called flashing and still one of my all time favorite attachment materials
  we carefully over that month constructed an articulated suit of aluminum armor with compound curves we drilled holes in the helmet so that i could breathe 
 and i finished just in time for halloween and wore it to school  now  this is the one thing in this talk that i don 't have a slide to show you because no photo exists of this armor 
 i did wear it to school  there was a yearbook photographer patrolling the halls but he never found me for reasons that are about to become
  there were things i didn 't anticipate about wearing a complete suit of aluminum armor
 to school 
 in third period math i was standing in the back of class and i 'm standing in the back of class because the armor did not allow me to sit down 
 this is the first thing i didn 't anticipate and then my teacher looks at me sort of concerned about halfway through the class and says are you feeling ok i 'm thinking are you
  feeling ok i 'm wearing a suit of armor 
 i am having the time of my and i 'm just about to tell her how great i feel when the classroom starts to list to the left and disappear down this long tunnel and then i woke up in the nurse 's office
  i had passed out from heat exhaustion wearing the armor  and when i woke up i wasn 't embarrassed about having passed out in front of my class
  a whole bunch of years some colleagues and i get hired to make a show for discovery channel called mythbusters and over fourteen years  i learn on the job how to build experimental methodologies and how to tell stories about them for television 
 i also learn early on that costuming can play a key role in this storytelling i use costumes to add humor  comedy  color and narrative clarity to the stories we 're telling
  then we do an episode called dumpster diving and i learn a little bit more about the deeper implications of what costuming means to me in
 the episode dumpster diving the question we were trying to answer is is jumping into a dumpster as safe as the movies would lead you to believe laughter
 the episode was going to have two distinct parts to
 one was where we get trained to jump off buildings by a stuntman into an air bag
 and the second was the graduation to the experiment we 'd fill a dumpster full of material and we 'd jump into it i wanted to visually separate these two elements  and i thought well 
 for the first part we 're training so we should wear
 sweatsuits oh let 's put ' stunt trainee ' on the back of the sweatsuits that 's for the training but for the second part i wanted something really visually
  so i went to haight street i bought some beautiful knee high
 buckle boots i found a long flowing coat on ebay i got sunglasses which i had to wear contact lenses in order to wear the day of the experiment shoot comes up and i step out of my car in this costume and my crew takes a look at me 
 and start suppressing their church giggles  they 're like
 total embarrassment over the fact that it 's so nakedly clear to my crew that i 'm completely into wearing this costume 
 laughter but the producer in my mind reminds myself that in the high speed shot in slow mo that flowing coat is going to look beautiful behind me 
 five years into the mythbusters
  we got invited to appear at san diego comic con i 'd known about comic con for years and never had time to go this was the big leagues this was costuming mecca people 
  fly in from all over the world to show their amazing creations on the floor in san diego and i wanted to participate i decided that i would put together an elaborate costume that covered me completely and i would walk the floor of san diego  comic con anonymously
  the costume i chose hellboy that 's not my costume that 's actually hellboy 
 but i spent months assembling the most screen accurate hellboy costume i could from the boots to the belt to the pants to the right hand of doom i found a guy who made a prosthetic 
  hellboy head and chest and i put them on i even had contact lenses made in my prescription i wore it onto the floor at comic con and i can 't even tell you how balls hot it was in that costume
  sweating i should 've remembered this i 'm sweating buckets and the contact lenses hurt my eyes and none of it matters because i 'm totally in love 
 not just with the process of putting on this costume and walking the floor but also with the community of other costumers it 's not called costuming at cons
  now ostensibly cosplay means people who dress up as their favorite characters from film and television and especially anime but it is so much more than that these aren 't just people who 
  find a costume and put it on they mash them up they bend them to their will they change them to be the characters they want to be in those productions they 're super clever and genius they let their freak flag fly and it 's
  but more than that they rehearse their costumes at comic con or any other con you don 't just take pictures of people walking around you go up and say hey i like your costume can i take your picture and then you 
 give them time to get into their pose they 've worked hard on their pose to make their costume look great for your camera  and it 's so beautiful to watch 
  and i take this to heart at subsequent cons i learn heath ledger 's shambling walk as the joker from the dark knight
  how to be a scary ringwraith from lord of the rings and i actually frighten some children i learned that 
  head laugh that chewbacca does  
 and then i dressed up as no face from spirited away 
 if you don 't know about spirited away and its director hayao miyazaki first of all you 're welcome this
 is a masterpiece and one of my all time favorite films it 's about a young girl named
 gets lost in the spirit world in an abandoned japanese theme park 
 and she finds her way back out again with the help of a couple of friends she makes a captured dragon named  haku and a lonely demon named 
  is lonely and he wants to make friends and he thinks the way to do it is by luring them to him and producing gold in his
  but this doesn 't go very well and so he ends up going on kind of a rampage until chihiro saves him rescues him  
 so i put together a no face costume 
 and i wore it on the floor at comic con 
 and i very carefully practiced no face 's gestures i resolved i would not speak in this costume at all 
 when people asked to take my picture i would nod and and i would shyly stand next to them
  they would take the picture and then i would secret out from behind my robe a chocolate gold coin and at the end of the photo process i 'd make it appear for them 
 like that and people were freaking out holy crap gold from no face oh my god this is so cool and i 'm feeling and i 'm walking the floor and it 's fantastic and
 about fifteen minutes in something happens  
 somebody grabs my
 and they put a coin back into it and i think maybe they 're giving me a coin as a return gift but no this is one of the coins that i 'd given away  
 i don 't know why  and i keep on going i take some more pictures  and then it happens again
 understand  i can 't see anything inside this costume i can see through the mouth i can see people 's shoes  i can hear what they 're saying and i can see their feet  but the third time
  someone gives me back a coin i want to know what 's going on 
 so i sort of tilt my head back to get a better view  and what i see is someone walking away from me going like this  
 and then it hits me it 's bad luck to take gold from no face in the film spirited away
  is cosplay 
 we are all of us on that floor injecting ourselves into a narrative that meant something to us and we 're making it our own 
 we 're connecting with something important
 inside of us and the costumes are how we reveal ourselves to each other thank you
