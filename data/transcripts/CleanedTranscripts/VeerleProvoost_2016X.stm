  it 's not an easy question  today we have adoption
  many parents face tough questions
 and tough decisions shall we tell our child about the sperm donation 
 if so when what words to use sperm donors are often referred to
 as biological fathers but should we really be using the word father as a philosopher and
  social scientist i have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood 
 but today i will talk to you about what i learned from talking to parents and children  
 i will show you that they know what matters most in a family even though their family looks a little different  i will show you
 their creative ways of dealing with tough questions
 but i will also show you the parents ' uncertainties 
 we interviewed couples who received fertility treatment at ghent university hospital  
 using sperm from a donor in this treatment timeline you can see two points at which we conducted interviews
  we included heterosexual couples where the man for some reason did not have good quality sperm and lesbian couples
 who obviously needed to find sperm elsewhere  we also included children 
 i wanted to know how those children define concepts like parenthood and family 
 in fact that is what i asked them
  only not in that way  
 i drew an apple tree instead 
 this way  i could ask abstract philosophical questions in a way that did not make them run off 
 so as you can see the apple tree is empty  
 and that illustrates my research approach  by designing techniques like this
  i can bring as little meaning and content as possible to the interview  because i want to hear that from them  
 i asked them 
 what would your family look like if it were an apple tree  
 and they could take a paper apple for everyone who in their view was a member of the family write a name on it and hang it wherever they wanted  and i would ask
  questions 
 most children started with a parent or a sibling  one started with boxer 
 the dead dog of his grandparents at this point none of the children started mentioning the donor  
 so  
 i asked them about their birth
  before you were born it was just
 your mom and dad or mom and mommy can you tell me how you came into the family 
 and they explained  one said 
 my parents did not have good seeds  
 but there are friendly men out there who have spare seeds they bring them to the hospital  and they put them in a big jar 
 my mommy went there and she
  took two from the jar  one for me and one for my sister  she put the seeds in her belly somehow
 and her belly grew really big and there i was hmm 
 so only when they started mentioning the donor  i asked questions about him using their own words
  words  i said if this would be an apple
 for the friendly man with the seeds  what would you do with it 
 and one boy was thinking out loud holding the apple and he said 
 i won 't put this one up there with the others he 's not part of my family  
 but i will not put him on the ground that 's too cold and too hard
  i think he should be in the trunk  
 because he made my family possible 
 if he would not have done this that would really be sad because my family would not be here  and i would not be here 
 so also parents constructed family tales tales to tell their children
  couple explained their insemination by taking their children to a farm to watch a vet inseminate cows  
 and why not it 's their way of explaining their 
  with family narratives diy  and we had another couple who made books a book for each child they were really works of
 containing their thoughts and feelings throughout
 the treatment they even had the hospital parking tickets in there 
 so it is diy  finding ways words and images to tell your family story to your child 
 and these stories
 were highly diverse but they all had
  it was a tale of longing for a child
 and a quest for that child  it was about how special and how deeply loved their child was  
 and research so far shows that these children are doing fine they do not have more problems than other kids  
  these parents
 also wanted to justify their decisions through the tales they tell 
 they hoped that their children would understand their reasons for making the family in this way  
 underlying was a fear
 that their children might disapprove and would reject the non genetic parent  and that fear is understandable because we live in a very
  and geneticized society
 a world that still believes that true families consist of one mom one dad and their genetically related children  
 well  
 i want to tell you
 about a teenage boy he was  donor conceived but not part of our study one day he had an argument with his father  and he yelled you
 're telling me what to do you 're not even my father
 that was exactly what the parents in our study feared 
 now the boy soon felt sorry  and they made up  but it is the reaction of his father that is most interesting 
 he said this outburst
 had nothing to do with the lack of
  it was about
 puberty being difficult  it 's what they do at that age  it will pass 
 what this man shows us
 is that when something goes wrong  we should not immediately think it is because the family is a little different 
 these things happen in all families  
 and every now and then all parents may wonder
  am i a good enough parent these parents too 
 they above all wanted to do what 's best for their child  but they also sometimes wondered  
 am i a real parent  
 and their uncertainties were present long before they even were parents at the start of treatment  when they first saw the counselor
 they paid close attention to the counselor
  because they wanted to do it right  even ten years later they still remember the advice they were given
 so when they thought about the counselor
 and the advice they were given we discussed that and we saw one
  when our son asks us ' do i have a dad '
 we will say ' no you do not have a dad '
 but we will say nothing more not unless he asks because he might not be ready for that the counselor said so 
 well i
 don 't know that 's quite different from how we respond to children 's questions like milk is that made in a factory
 we will say no  it comes from cows and we will talk about the farmer and the way the milk ends up in the shop  
 we will not say 
 no milk is not made in a factory 
 so something strange happened here  and of course these children noticed that one boy said
  parents loads of questions  but they acted really weird 
 so you know i have a friend at school  and she 's made in the same way  when i have a question  i just go and ask her 
 clever guy  problem solved  
 but his parents did not notice and it certainly was not what they had in mind nor what the counselor had in mind
 when they were saying how important it is to be an
  family  
 and that 's the strange thing about advice  when we offer people pills we gather evidence first 
 we do tests we do follow up studies  we want to know and rightly so what this pill is doing and how it affects people 's lives  
 and advice
  it is not enough for advice or for professionals to give advice that is
 theoretically sound  or well meant it should be advice that there is evidence for
 evidence that it actually improves patients ' lives  so the philosopher in me would now
  i will not end here with what went wrong  i would not be doing justice to the warmth we found in those families 
 remember the books and the trip to the farmer  when parents do things
 work for them they do brilliant things what i want you to remember
 as members of families in no matter what form or shape is that
 what families need
 are warm relationships  and we do not need to be professionals to create those most of us do just fine
  although it may be hard work and from time to time  we can do with some advice 
 in that case  bear in mind three things 
 work with advice that works for your family remember you 're the expert because you live your family
  in your abilities and your creativity  because you can do it yourself  thank you
