  i used to be a malthusian this was my mental model of the world  
 exploding population small planet it 's going to lead to ugly things  
 but i 'm moving past malthus  because i think that we just might be about one hundred and fifty years from a kind of new enlightenment
  here 's why 
 this is the u n ' s population data you may have seen 
 for the world  and the world 's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than ten billion  late this century and after that most likely it 's going to begin to decline 
 so what then  
 most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth  so a lot of economists
  look at declining population and expect to see stagnation  maybe depression  
 but a declining population is going to have at least two very beneficial economic effects 
 one  fewer people on a fixed amount of land
 make investing in property a bad bet
  in the cities a lot of the
 cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value  
 take away land speculation  price of land drops  and that begins to lift a heavy burden
 off the world 's poor number two a declining population
 means scarce labor scarce labor drives wages as wages increase that also lifts the burden
  on the poor and the working class  now i 'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the black death  but look what happened in europe
 after the plague  rising wages land reform  
 technological innovation  birth of the middle class  
  social movements
 like the renaissance  and later the enlightenment 
 most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward romanticizing the past  all of the western religions begin
 with the notion of eden  and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future  
 so human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide
 from the good old days
 but i think we 're in for another change about two generations after the top of that curve  
 once the effects of a declining population start to settle in 
 at that point we 'll start romanticizing the future again instead of the nasty brutish past 
 so why does this matter why talk about social economic movements that may be more than a century away
 transitions are dangerous times  
 when land owners start to lose money and labor demands more pay  there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future 
 fear for the future
 leads to some rash decisions  if we have a positive view about the future
 then we may be able
  to accelerate through that turn instead of careening off a cliff
