  extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence 
 and it is my job my responsibility as an astronomer to remind people
 that alien hypotheses
  always be a last resort now i want to tell you a story about that it involves
 data from a nasa mission  ordinary people and one of the most extraordinary stars in our galaxy 
 it began in two thousand and nine with the launch of nasa 's kepler mission 
 kepler 's main scientific objective was to find planets outside of our solar system it did this by staring at a single field in the sky this
  one with all the tiny boxes  
 and in this one field it monitored the brightness of over one hundred and fifty thousand stars continuously for four years  taking a data point every thirty minutes 
 it was looking for what astronomers call a transit 
 this is when the planet 's orbit is aligned in our line of sight just so that the planet
  crosses in front of a star 
 and when this happens  it blocks out a tiny bit of starlight  which you can see as a dip in this curve  
 and so the team at nasa had developed very sophisticated computers to search for transits in all the kepler data 
  of the first data release astronomers at yale were wondering an interesting thing  
 what if computers missed something  
 and so we launched the citizen science project called planet hunters
 to have people look at the same data 
 the human brain has an amazing ability for pattern recognition  sometimes even better than a computer  however there was a lot of skepticism around this
 my colleague debra fischer founder of the planet hunters project said that people at the time were saying you 're crazy  there 's no way that a computer will miss a signal 
 and so it was on the classic human versus machine gamble  and if we found one planet  we would be thrilled 
 when i joined the team four years ago  
 we had already found a couple 
 and today with the help of over three hundred
  thousand science enthusiasts  we have found dozens  and we 've also found one of the most mysterious stars in our galaxy  
 so to understand this let me show you what a normal transit in kepler data looks like 
 on this graph on the left hand side you have the amount of light and on the bottom is
  the white line is light just from the star what astronomers call a light curve  
 now when a planet transits a star it blocks out a little bit of this light  and the depth of this transit reflects the size of the object itself
  and so for example let 's take jupiter 
 planets don 't get much bigger than jupiter jupiter will make a one percent drop in a star 's brightness earth on the other hand 
 is eleven times smaller than jupiter and the signal is barely
  visible in the data so back to our mystery 
 a few years ago planet hunters were sifting through data looking for transits and they spotted a mysterious signal coming from the star 
 the observations in may of two thousand and nine were the first they spotted and they started talking about this in the discussion forums 
 they said and object like jupiter would make a
  drop like this in the star 's light  but they were also saying it was giant 
 you see transits normally only last for a few hours  and this one lasted for almost a week  
 they were also saying that it looks asymmetric  
 meaning that instead of the clean u shaped dip that we saw with jupiter  it had this strange slope that you can see on the left side 
 this seemed to indicate that
  whatever was getting in the way and blocking the starlight was not circular like a planet  
 there are few more dips that happened but for a couple of years it was pretty quiet  
 and then in march of two thousand and eleven  we see this 
 the star 's light drops by a whole fifteen percent  and this is huge compared to a planet  which would only make a one percent drop
 we described this feature as both smooth and clean  
 it also is asymmetric  having a gradual dimming that lasts almost a week  and then it snaps right back up to normal in just a matter of days  
 and again  after this not much happens
 until
 february of two thousand and thirteen things start to get really crazy  there is a huge
  complex of dips in the light curve that appear  and they last for like a hundred days all the way up into the kepler mission 's end 
 these dips have variable shapes some are very sharp and some are broad  and they also have variable durations some last just for a day or two and some for more than a week  
 and there 's also up and down trends within some of these dips almost like
 several independent
  events were superimposed on top of each other and at this time this star drops in its brightness
 over twenty percent  this means that whatever is blocking its light has an area of over one thousand times the area of our planet earth  
 this is truly remarkable  
  when they saw this they notified the science team that they found something weird enough that
 it might be worth following up 
 and so when the science team looked at it we 're like yeah  there 's probably just something wrong with the data but we looked really really really hard and
 the data were good  
 and so what was happening had to be astrophysical meaning that something in space was getting in the way and blocking starlight
  and so at this point we set out to learn everything we could about the star to see if we could find any clues to what was going on 
 and the citizen scientists who helped us in this discovery they joined along for the ride watching science in action firsthand 
 first somebody said  you know what if
  very young and it still had the cloud of material it was born from surrounding it  
 and then somebody else said  well  what if the star had already formed planets and two of these planets had collided  similar to the earth moon forming event  
 well  both of these theories could explain part of the data  
 but the difficulties were that the star showed no signs of being young 
 and there was no glow from any of the material that was heated up by the star 's light  and you would expect this
  if the star was young or if there was a collision and a lot of dust was produced  and so somebody else said  well  how about
 a huge swarm of comets that are passing by this star in a very elliptical orbit  well  it ends up that this is actually consistent with our
  but i agree it does feel a little contrived  you see it would take hundreds of comets to reproduce what we 're observing 
 and these are only the comets that happen to pass between us and the star  and so in reality we 're talking
 thousands to tens of thousands of comets but
 of all the bad ideas we had this one was the best  and so we went ahead and published our findings
 let me tell you this was one of the hardest papers i ever wrote scientists are meant to publish results  and this situation was far from that  
 and so we decided to give it a catchy title and we called it where 's the flux i will let you work out the acronym
  this isn 't the end of the story around the same time i was writing this paper i met with a colleague of mine jason wright  and he was also writing a paper on kepler data  
 and he was saying that with kepler 's extreme precision 
 it could actually detect alien megastructures around stars  but it didn 't 
 and then i showed him this weird data that our citizen
  now i have to rewrite my paper so yes the natural explanations were weak
 and we were curious now  so we had to find a way to rule out aliens so together  
 we convinced a colleague of ours who works on seti the search for extraterrestrial intelligence that this would be an extraordinary target to pursue  
  proposal to observe the star with the world 's largest radio telescope at the green bank observatory 
 a couple months later  news of this proposal
 got leaked to the press
 and now there are thousands of articles over ten thousand articles on this star alone  and if you search google images  
 this is what
  you may be wondering ok tabby well  how do aliens actually explain this light curve  ok  
 well  imagine a civilization that 's much more advanced than our own in this hypothetical circumstance  
 this civilization would have exhausted the energy supply of their home planet 
 so where could they get more energy well  they have a host star just like we have a sun
  and so if they were able to capture more energy from this star then that would solve their energy needs  
 so they would go and build huge structures these giant megastructures like ginormous solar panels are called dyson spheres  
 this image above are lots of artists ' impressions
  of dyson spheres  it 's really hard to provide perspective on the vastness of these things  but you can think of it this way
 the earth moon distance is a quarter of a million miles 
 the simplest element
 on one of these structures
 is one hundred times that size they 're enormous 
 and now imagine one of these structures in motion around a star you can see how it would produce anomalies
  in the data such as uneven  unnatural looking dips  but it remains that even alien megastructures
 cannot defy the laws of physics you see anything that uses a lot of energy
 is going to produce heat  and we don 't observe this  but it could be something as simple as
 they 're just reradiating it away in another direction
 just not at earth  
 another idea that 's one of my personal favorites
 is that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet  
 now i admit that this would produce a lot of dust that we don 't observe  
 but if we 're already invoking aliens in this explanation then
  who is to say they didn 't efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes you can see how this quickly captures your imagination 
 well there you have it we 're in a situation
 that could unfold to be a natural phenomenon we don 't understand or an alien technology we don 't understand 
 personally as a scientist
 my money is on the natural explanation  but don 't get me wrong i do think it would be awesome to find aliens  
 either way there is something new and really interesting to discover 
 so what happens next  we need to continue to observe this star to learn more about what 's
  but professional astronomers like me we have limited resources for this kind of thing  and kepler is on to a different mission  
 and i 'm happy to say that
 once again citizen scientists have come in and saved the day 
 you see this time  amateur astronomers with their backyard telescopes
 stepped up immediately and started observing this star nightly at their own facilities and
  am so excited to see what they find 
 what 's amazing to me is that this star would have never been found by computers because we just weren 't looking for something like this  
 and
 what 's more exciting is that there 's more data to come 
 there are new missions that are coming up that are observing millions more stars
 all over the sky
  and
 just think 
 what will it mean when we find another star like this  and what will it mean if we don 't find another star like this thank you
