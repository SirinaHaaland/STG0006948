  i am going to teach you how to play my favorite game 
 massively multiplayer thumb wrestling it 's the only game in the world that i
  know of that allows you the player the opportunity to experience
 ten positive emotions in sixty seconds or less this is true  so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute  you will get to feel 
 joy  relief love surprise pride curiosity excitement awe and wonder contentment and creativity all in the span of one minute so this sounds pretty good right now you 're willing to play 
  really quickly and we 're going to do a little hands on demo while they 're coming up i should let you know this game was invented ten years ago by an artists ' collective in austria named monochrom so thank you monochrom okay  so most people are familiar with traditional 
  let 's just remind them one two three four i declare a thumb war
 we wrestle and of course sunni beats me because she 's the best now
  the first thing about massively multiplayer thumb wrestling we 're the gamer generation there are a billion gamers on the planet now  so we need more of a challenge  so the first thing we need 
 is more thumbs so eric come on over  so we could get three thumbs together  
  can 't like wait while they fight it out and then swoop in at the last minute that is not how you win 
 ah who did that eric you did that so eric would have won he was the first person to pin my thumb  okay so that 's the first rule and we can see that three or four is kind of the typical number of thumbs 
  in a node but if you feel ambitious you don 't have to hold back we can really go for it so you can
  the only other rule you need to remember is gamer generation we like a challenge  i happen to notice you all have some thumbs you 're not using  so i think we should kind of get some more involved  and if we had just four people we would do it just like this
  and we would try and wrestle
 both thumbs at the same time perfect now if we had more people in the room  instead of just wrestling in a closed
  we might reach out and try and grab some other people  and in fact that 's what we 're going to do right now we 're going to try and get all something like i don 't know one thousand five hundred thumbs in this room connected 
  in a single node  and we have to connect both levels so if you 're up there 
  before we get started can i have the slides back up here really quick because if you get good at this game i want you to know there are some advanced levels so this is the the kind of simple level right  but
 there are advanced configurations this is called the death star configuration any star wars fans and
 this one 's called the mbius strip any science geeks you get that one this is the hardest level this is the extreme  so we 'll stick with the normal one for now and i 'm going to give you thirty seconds  every thumb into the node
  connect the upper and the lower levels you guys go on down there thirty seconds into the network make the node
  stand up it 's easier if you stand up everybody up up up up up 
 stand up my friends all
 right don 't start wrestling yet if you have a free thumb wave it around
  sure it gets connected  
 okay  we need to do a last minute thumb check if you have a free thumb wave it around to make sure grab that thumb 
 reach behind you there you go any other thumbs okay on the count of three you 're going to go try to keep track grab grab grab it
  while you are basking in the glow of having won your first
  let 's do a quick recap on the positive emotions so
 curiosity  i said massively multiplayer thumb wrestling you were like what the hell is she talking about so i provoked a little curiosity creativity it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all 
  the thumbs into the node i 'm reaching around and i 'm reaching up so you used creativity that was great how about surprise  the actual feeling of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once is pretty surprising you heard that sound go up in the room  we
  as you started to wrestle maybe you 're starting to win or this person 's like really into it so you kind of
 get get the excitement going 
 we have relief you got to stand up you 've been sitting for awhile so the physical relief getting to shake it out we had joy you were laughing smiling look at your faces this room is full of joy  we had
 some contentment i didn 't see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing so you were totally content to be playing the most important three
  and wonder we had everybody connected physically for a minute when was the last time you were at ted and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room and it 's truly awesome and wondrous and speaking of physical 
  connection  you guys know i love the hormone oxytocin  you release oxytocin you feel bonded to everyone in the room  you guys know that the best way to release oxytocin quickly is to hold someone else 's hand for at least six seconds you guys were all holding hands for way more than six
  so we are all now biochemically primed to love each other that is great
