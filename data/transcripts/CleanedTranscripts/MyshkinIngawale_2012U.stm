  build stuff i 've always liked to build stuff my team at biosense a startup i co founded with my doctor and engineer friends has built
  which can do blood testing of hemoglobin without pricks without needles i believe this is going to democratize health care
 they 're two big words i don 't know what they mean laughter
 in fact in two thousand and nine i was even more clueless
 i had absolutely no idea what was going to happen next i was in fact
 busy trying to finish off my ph d which was in a completely unrelated area of how people interact
 contributors interact how articles are formed in wikipedia trying to figure out how quality emerges from the system
 i was also building
 something called the copenhagen wheel which is just a really beautiful beautiful electric bike at a lab at mit called senseable city lab
 i was lucky enough that i visited mumbai my house back for a vacation
 so at that time i was
 planning a road trip i visited a place called parol about two hours north of mumbai
 this is a place where my friend abhishek sen
 was interning he 's a doctor there and that 's his actual photograph laughter
 so abhishek actually made me wait he was out there in parol delivering a baby i was waiting and
  when he did emerge he was ashen faced he told me that there had been two deaths the mother and child both had died
 the reason he told me was something called post partum hemorrhage
 he explained this meant severe internal bleeding what was really shocking for me was that he said that this is entirely due to undiagnosed anemia
 now anemia i 'm an engineer but even
  i knew that anemia is something which is not supposed to be fatal it is something which
 probably the cure is known i mean folic acid iron tablets very cheap affordable cures exist to control anemia so why was this woman dying it was completely preventable 
  five minutes away from there
  i had the center the medical center which was distributing subsidized iron tablets
 so
 the whole nature of this thing completely shocked me and i knew that there had to be a way to prevent this
 my mom is a pediatrician and i asked her
 she told me that this is how you would typically test for anemia take a blood sample and run it through a machine called a coulter counter
 this is a dollar ten thousand machine which was available in mumbai it 's also available here or in any part i guess in europe and most cities in the world but this is not
  available in parol also that woman who was operating the machine the technician is not available in parol laughter now
 this
 this struck me as i love to fix things i wanted to fix this i got a friend of mine an engineer and three other doctors abhishek joined the team and we wanted to
  this problem by the time i step down from here there will be ten people who have lost their lives through a completely completely preventable problem
 now let me take you back to parol you saw the woman there the nurse in india this is called an asha worker it 's essentially a village health worker a matron
 she is really the center of the health care system public health care runs on the asha worker not the doctor
 now we knew we had to design something which she could use we knew it had to be
  these three things that the machine had to have we knew it had to be something which had no needles no pricking so it would have adoption it would not have
 medical waste all those problems
 it had to be simple enough for that woman asha worker to use and thirdly it had to be something which she could carry in her kit she goes village to village doing screenings
 we thought we could build it so
 we built it
 but but it didn 't work laughter
 so we built it again and we did we did this thirty two times laughter
 but i 'm very excited to tell you that last year we did build it it
 and i have it here in my purse
 so this is a machine called the touchb quik what it does is
 it measures my hemoglobin oxygen and pulse rate i put it on my finger switch it on
 and in about twenty seconds it 'll give me on the little screen here a value of hemoglobin
 oxygen saturation and heart rate
 this will help asha workers diagnose anemia at the point of care applause i 'll explain a
 little bit about how it works you might have seen a little light inside of it in fact there are three lights in there three wavelengths of light
 and we essentially pass light
 through the tissue
 and from understanding how much of it is transmitted how much of it is scattered and how much of it is absorbed we can figure out how much hemoglobin is there in the blood and this is 
  something which is based on a principle called photoplethysmography we are actually really very excited about what else non invasive techniques like this will be able to crack in the future one of the things which my intern here pratesh built is a mobile
  application which can now send all this data anywhere it wants to go there 's a bunch of very exciting stuff which we are doing i would love to tell you a little bit more about it but fundamentally
 what i believe is that the map behind of me is called basically the map of anemia it 's the death rates caused by anemia globally
 you 'll notice of course that there are hot spots south asia africa my business plan is very simple i
  to sell these to every clinic in the world
 that 's a simple bottom line business plan and by the time i 'm done in two thousand and twenty when the who publishes the data again this is going to be the map of anemia
