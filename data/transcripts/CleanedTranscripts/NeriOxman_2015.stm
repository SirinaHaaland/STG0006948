  two twin domes 
 two radically opposed design cultures  one is made of thousands of steel parts  the other of a single silk
  one is synthetic  the other organic  
 one is imposed on the environment  the other creates it  one is designed for nature  the other is designed by her 
 michelangelo said that when he looked at raw marble he saw a figure struggling to be free the chisel was michelangelo 's only tool  
 but living things
  are not chiseled they grow 
 and in our smallest units of life our cells  we carry all the information that 's required for every other cell
 to function
 and to replicate 
 tools also have consequences 
 at least since the industrial revolution the world of design has been dominated by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production 
 assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts
  framing the imagination of designers and architects who have been trained to think about their objects as assemblies of discrete parts with distinct functions  
 but you don 't find homogenous material assemblies in nature  
 take human skin for example our facial skins are thin with large pores our back skins are thicker with small pores
 one acts mainly as filter  
 the other mainly as barrier  and yet it 's the same skin no parts no assemblies it 's a system that gradually varies its functionality by varying elasticity 
 so here this is a split screen to represent my split world view  the split personality of every designer and architect operating today between the chisel and the gene
 between machine and organism between assembly and growth  between henry ford and charles darwin 
 these two worldviews my left brain and right brain analysis and synthesis will play out
 on the two screens behind me my work at its simplest level is about uniting these two worldviews
  moving away from assembly and closer into growth  
 you 're probably asking yourselves  why now  why was this not possible ten or even five years ago  
 we live in a very special time in history a rare time 
 a time when the confluence of four fields is giving designers access to tools we 've never
  had access to before these fields are computational design allowing us to design complex forms with simple code 
 additive manufacturing letting us produce parts
 by adding material rather than carving it out materials engineering which lets us design the behavior of materials in high resolution 
 and synthetic biology
  enabling us to design new biological functionality by editing dna  
 and at the intersection of these four fields my team and i create please meet the minds and hands of my students 
 we design objects and products and structures and tools across
  like this robotic arm with an 80 foot diameter reach with a vehicular base that will one day soon print entire buildings 
 to nanoscale graphics made entirely of genetically engineered microorganisms that glow in the dark 
 here we 've reimagined the mashrabiya an archetype of ancient arabic architecture 
 and created a screen where every aperture is uniquely sized to shape the form of light and heat moving through it
  in our next project  we explore the possibility of creating a cape and skirt this was for a paris fashion show with iris van herpen
 like a second skin that are made of a single part stiff at the contours flexible around the waist 
 together with my 
  printing collaborator stratasys we 3d printed this cape and skirt with no seams between the cells and i 'll show more objects
  like it this helmet combines stiff and soft materials in 
 resolution this is the resolution of a human hair it 's also the resolution of a ct scanner that designers have access to such
 analytic and synthetic tools enables
  to design products that fit not only the shape of our bodies  but also the physiological makeup of our tissues  
 next we designed an acoustic chair a chair that would be at once structural comfortable and would also absorb sound  
 professor carter my collaborator and i turned to nature for inspiration  and by designing this irregular surface pattern it becomes
  we printed its surface out of forty four different properties 
 varying in rigidity  opacity and color  corresponding to pressure points on the human body 
 its surface as in nature  
 varies its functionality not by adding another material or another assembly but by continuously and delicately varying material property
  but is nature ideal 
 are there no parts in nature  
 i wasn 't raised in a religious jewish home 
 but when i was young my grandmother used to tell me stories from the hebrew bible and one of them stuck with me and came to define much of what i care about 
 as she recounts on the third day of creation god commands the earth to grow a fruit bearing fruit tree
 for this first fruit tree  there was to be no differentiation between
 trunk  branches  leaves and fruit  the whole tree was a fruit  
 instead the land grew trees that have bark and stems and flowers  the land
 created a world made of parts i often ask myself what would design
  design be like if objects were made of a single part would we return to a better state of creation 
 so we looked for that biblical material that fruit bearing fruit tree kind of material  and we found it 
 the second most abundant biopolymer on the planet is called chitin and some one hundred million tons of it are produced
 every year by organisms such as shrimps crabs scorpions and butterflies  
 we thought if we could tune its properties we could generate structures that are multifunctional out of a single part  so that 's what we did  
 we called legal seafood we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells we grinded them and we produced
  varying chemical concentrations we were able to achieve a wide array of properties
 from dark stiff and opaque  to light soft and transparent 
 in order to print the structures in large scale  we built a robotically controlled extrusion system with multiple nozzles  
 the robot would vary material properties on the fly and create these
  material one hundred percent recyclable when the parts are ready they 're left to dry and find a form naturally upon contact with air 
 so why are we still designing with plastics  
 the air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain photosynthetic microorganisms that first appeared on our planet three point five billion
  ago as we learned yesterday  
 together with our collaborators at harvard and mit we embedded bacteria that were genetically engineered to rapidly capture carbon from the atmosphere and convert it into sugar 
 for the first time  we were able to generate structures that would seamlessly transition from beam
 to mesh  and if scaled even larger
  windows a fruit bearing fruit tree  
 working with an ancient material one of the first lifeforms on the planet plenty of water
 and a little bit of synthetic biology  we were able to transform a structure made of shrimp shells into an architecture that behaves
  and here 's the best part  
 for objects designed to biodegrade put them in the sea  and they will nourish marine life  
 place them in soil  and they will help grow a tree  
 the setting for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system we looked for the possibility of creating
  clothing for interplanetary voyages  to do that we needed to
  contain bacteria and be able to control their flow 
 so like the periodic table  we came up with our own table of the elements new lifeforms that were computationally grown
 additively manufactured
 and biologically augmented 
 i like to think of synthetic biology as
  precious metals you 're synthesizing new biological functionality inside very small channels it 's called
 microfluidics 
 we 3d printed our own channels in order to control the flow of these liquid bacterial cultures 
 in our first piece of clothing we combined two microorganisms the first is cyanobacteria  it lives in our oceans and in freshwater ponds and the second
  the bacterium that inhabits the human gut  
 one converts light into sugar  the other consumes that sugar and produces biofuels useful for the built environment now
 these two microorganisms never interact in nature 
 in fact they never met each other they 've been here engineered for the first time to have a relationship inside a piece of clothing  
 think of it as evolution
 not by natural selection  but evolution by design 
 in order to contain these relationships we 've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract that will help flow these bacteria and alter their function along the way  
 we then started growing these channels on the human body varying material properties according to the desired functionality where we wanted more photosynthesis
  we would design more transparent channels 
 this wearable digestive system  when it 's stretched end to end
 spans sixty meters this is half the length of a football field  and ten times as long as our small intestines  
 and here it is for the first time unveiled at ted
  our first photosynthetic wearable liquid channels glowing with life inside a wearable clothing thank you 
 mary shelley said we are unfashioned creatures but only half made up 
 what if design could provide that other half what if we could create structures that would augment living matter 
 what if we could create personal 
  scan our skins repair damaged tissue
 and sustain our bodies  
 think of this as a form of edited biology 
 this entire collection wanderers that was named after planets was not to me really about fashion per se but it provided an opportunity to speculate about the future of our race on our planet and beyond  
 to combine scientific insight with lots of mystery
 and to move away from the age of the machine
 to a new age of symbiosis between our bodies  
 the microorganisms that we inhabit our products and even our buildings i call this material ecology  
 to do this we always need to return back
 to nature by now you know that a 3d printer prints material in layers
  also know that nature doesn 't it grows it adds with sophistication 
 this silkworm cocoon for example  creates a highly sophisticated architecture a home inside which to metamorphisize no additive manufacturing today gets even close to this level of sophistication
  it does so by combining not two materials but two proteins
 in different concentrations  
 one acts as the structure  the other is the glue or the matrix  holding those fibers together and this happens across scales  
 the silkworm first attaches itself to the environment it creates a tensile structure
 and it then starts spinning a  compressive cocoon  tension and compression the two forces of life
  single material 
 in order to better understand how this complex process works we glued a tiny earth magnet to the head of a silkworm 
 to the spinneret we placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors  and that allowed us to create this 3 dimensional point cloud and visualize
 the complex architecture of the silkworm cocoon
  we placed the silkworm on a flat patch not inside a box  we realized it would spin a flat cocoon and it would still healthily
 so we started designing different environments different scaffolds  and we discovered that the shape the composition the structure of the cocoon was directly informed
 by the environment 
 silkworms are often boiled to death inside their cocoons their silk unraveled and used in the textile industry  
 we realized that designing these templates allowed us to give shape to raw silk
 without boiling a single cocoon 
 they would healthily healthily
  and we would be able to create these things so we scaled this process up to architectural scale  
 we had a robot spin the template out of silk and we placed it on our site  
 we knew silkworms migrated toward darker and colder areas 
 so we used a sun path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat on our structure  
 we then created holes or apertures that would lock in the rays of light and heat
  distributing those silkworms on the structure  
 we were ready to receive the caterpillars  we ordered six thousand five hundred silkworms from an online silk farm
  and after four weeks of feeding they were ready to spin with us we placed them carefully at the bottom rim of the scaffold and as
  they mate they lay eggs  and life begins all over again just like us but much much shorter  
 bucky fuller said that tension is the great integrity  
 and he was right 
 as they spin biological silk over robotically spun silk  they give this entire pavilion its integrity and over two to three weeks six
  five hundred silkworms spin six thousand five hundred kilometers in a curious symmetry this is also the length of the silk road 
 the moths after they hatch produce one point five million eggs this could be used for two hundred and fifty additional pavilions for the future
  so here they are the two worldviews  one spins silk out of a robotic arm
  the other fills in the gaps 
 if the final frontier of design is to breathe life into the products and the buildings around us to form a two material ecology  then designers must unite these two worldviews  
 which brings us back of course  to the beginning 
 here 's to a new age of design a new age of creation that takes us from
  and that demands of us for the first time that we mother nature  thank you
