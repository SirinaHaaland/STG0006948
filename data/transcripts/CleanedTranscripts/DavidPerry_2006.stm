  i grew up in northern ireland right up in the very very north end of it there where it 's absolutely freezing cold  this was me running around in the back garden  mid summer 
 i couldn 't pick a career in ireland the obvious choice is the military but to be honest it actually kind of sucks
  my mother wanted me to be a dentist
  but the problem was that people kept blowing everything up so i actually went to school in belfast which was where all the action happened 
 and this was a pretty common sight  the school i went to was pretty boring they forced us to learn things like latin
 the school teachers weren 't having much fun the sports were very dirty or very
  i cleverly chose rowing which i got very good at and i was actually rowing for my school here
 until this fateful day and i flipped over right in front of the entire school and that was the finishing post right there so this was
 extremely embarrassing but our school at that time got a grant from the government and they got an incredible computer the research machine 3dz
 and they left the programming manuals lying around and so students like myself with nothing to do
 we would learn how to program it  
 also around this time at home  this was the computer that people were buying it was called the sinclair zx80 this was a 1k computer  and you 'd buy your programs on cassette tape actually
 i 'm just going to pause for one second because i heard that there 's a prerequisite to speak here at ted you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair  so i brought a picture with big hair 
 i just want to get that out of the way  so after the sinclair  zx80
 came along the very cleverly named sinclair
  the picture at the bottom there 's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son that 's what they thought they had built it for the reality is we got the programming manual and we started making games for it  we were programming in basic 
 which is a pretty awful language for games so we ended up learning assembly language so we could really take control of the hardware  
  a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing battlestar galactica the graphics were just horrible you had to have an even better imagination to play this game death rider 
 but of course the scientists couldn 't help themselves  they started making their own video games  
 this is one of my favorite ones here where they have rabbit breeding  so males choose the lucky rabbit  
 it was around this time we went from
 to 16k which was quite the leap  and if you 're wondering how much 16k is this ebay logo here 
 and in that amount of memory someone programmed a full flight simulation program  and that 's what it looked like
  i spent ages flying this flight simulator and i honestly believed i could fly airplanes by the end of it 
 here 's clive sinclair now launching his
 color computer he 's recognized as being the father of video
  games in europe he 's a multi millionaire and i think that 's why he 's smiling in this photograph  
 so i went on for the next twenty years or so making a lot of different games some of the highlights were things like the terminator aladdin 
 the teenage mutant hero turtles because i was from the united kingdom they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children so they decided to call
  the last game i did was
 based on trying to get the video game industry and hollywood to actually work together on something instead of licensing from each other to actually work now
 chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me 
 so i 've done that the video game industry in two thousand and five
  billion dollar business it grows every year last year was the biggest year 
 by two thousand and eight we 're going to kick the butt of the music industry by two thousand and ten we
 're going to hit forty two billion forty three percent of gamers are female so there 's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware 
 the average age of gamers well obviously it 's for children right well no actually it 's thirty years old and interestingly the people who buy the most games are 
  is our target audience 
 all video games are violent of course the newspapers love to to beat on this but eighty three percent of games don 't have any mature content whatsoever  
 so it 's just not true online gaming statistics 
 i brought some stuff on world of warcraft it 's five point five million players  it makes about eighty million bucks a month in subscriptions  it costs fifty bucks just to install it on your computer making the publisher about another two hundred and seventy five million 
 the game costs about eighty million dollars to
  basically it pays for itself in about a month a player in a game called project entropia 
 actually bought his own island for twenty six thousand five hundred dollars you have to remember that this is not a real island he didn 't actually buy anything just some data  
 but he got great terms on it  this purchase included mining and hunting rights ownership of all land on the island and a castle with
  this market is now estimated at over eight hundred million dollars annually
 and what 's interesting about it is the market was actually created by the gamers themselves  
 they found clever ways to trade items and to sell their accounts to each other so that they could make money while they were playing their games 
 i dove onto ebay a couple of days ago just to see what was gong on typed in world of warcraft got six thousand items i liked this one the best a level sixty warlock with lots of epics for one hundred and
  guy obviously had some pain while making it  so as far as popularity of games what do you think these people are doing here  it turns out they 're actually
 in hollywood bowl in los angeles listening to the l a philharmonic playing video game music 
 that 's what the show looks like you would expect it to be cheesy but it 's not it 's very very epic and a very beautiful concert and the people that went there absolutely loved it 
 what do you think these people are doing
  they 're actually bringing their computers so they can play games against each other and this is happening in every city around the world this is happening in your local cities too you 're probably just not aware of it now
 chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago here just to show how video game graphics
 have been improving i wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it  but what i want you to do is to try to understand it we 're on this curve and the graphics are getting so ridiculously better
  i 'm going to show you up to maybe two thousand and seven  but i want you to try and think about what games could look like ten years from now so we 're going to start that video video 
 throughout human history people have played games 
 as man 's intellect and technology have evolved so too
  the way it is think about that 's where we are right now and the curve that we 're on means that this is going to continue to get better  this is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw if you wanted to get a job
 in the video game industry today you need to be really an incredible artist and once we get enough of those guys we 're going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we 've never been to before or characters that we 've just never seen before 
 so the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio  but if you were to go to a game developers conference what they 're all talking about is emotion purpose meaning understanding and feeling you 'll hear about talks like can a video game make you cry and these are the kind of
  topics we really actually care about i came across a student who 's absolutely excellent at expressing himself and this student agreed that he would
 he would not show his video to anybody until you here at ted had seen it so i 'd like to play this video  
 so this is a student 's opinion on what his experience of games are video 
 i like many of you live somewhere between reality and video games
  part of me
 a true living breathing person has become programmed electronic and virtual 
 the boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy has finally begun to crumble  i 'm a video game addict
 and this is my story
  the year of my birth the nintendo entertainment system also went into development
 i played in the backyard learned to read  and even ate some of my vegetables  
 most of my childhood was spent playing with legos  
  was the case for most of my generation  i spent a lot of time in front of the tv
 mr rogers  walt disney  nick junior  and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly left their mark on me 
 when my parents bought my sister and i our first nintendo whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive electronic
  entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me
  my virtual reality 
  and it 's not because of a certain number of hours i have spent playing  or nights i have gone without sleep to finish the next level it
 is because i have had life altering experiences in virtual space and video games had begun to erode my own understanding
 of what is real and what is not 
 i 'm addicted because even though i know i 'm losing my grip on reality  i still crave more
  from an early age i learned to invest myself emotionally in what unfolded before me on screen
  today after twenty years of watching tv geared to make me emotional 
 even a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes  
 i am just one of a new generation that is growing up a generation
  who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world 
 video games are nearing an evolutionary leap  a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real as the films we see in theatres or the news we watch on tv
  and while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds may still be limited  what i do learn applies to my real life
  play enough video games and eventually you will really believe you can snowboard fly a plane drive a nine second quarter mile  or kill a man  
 i know i can 
 unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it video games actually allow us to become part of the machine 
 they allow us to sublimate into the culture of
  we are interacting with our entertainment 
 i have come to expect this level of interaction 
 without it the problems faced in the real world poverty  war  disease and genocide lack the levity they should 
 their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time tv 
 but the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound
  lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional 
 i have fought in wars feared for my own survival watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel more real than any textbook or any
 news story  the people who create these games are smart they know what makes me scared  excited panicked proud
  these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create 
 a well designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience 
 as one becomes more experienced the awareness of physical control melts away  
 i know what i want and i do it 
 no buttons to push no triggers to pull 
 just me and the game 
 my fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my
  i know violent video games make my mother worry  
 what troubles me is not that video game violence is becoming more and more like real life violence  but that real life violence is starting to look more and more like a video game
 these are all troubles outside of myself i however have a problem very close to home
  something has happened to my brain 
 perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds all of our gut instincts the things we know to do before we even think 
 while some of these instincts may be innate most are learned and all of them are hardwired into our
  brains these instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds 
 only in recent years has the technology behind video games allowed for a true overlap in stimuli 
 as gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life  only virtually
  consider this
 my real life car has about twenty five thousand miles on it in all my driving games i 've driven a total of thirty one thousand four hundred and fifty nine miles to
 some degree i 've learned how to drive from the game the sensory cues are very similar it 's a funny feeling when you have spent more time doing something on the tv than you have
  when i am driving down a road at sunset all i can think is this is almost as beautiful as my games are 
 for my virtual worlds are perfect more beautiful and rich than the real world around us  
 i 'm not sure what the implications of my experience are but
 the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me 
 today i believe big brother would find much more success brainwashing the masses with video games rather than just
  simply tvs video games are fun  engaging  and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re programming 
 but maybe brainwashing isn 't always bad
  imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other or helps us to understand the problems we 're all facing in the real world there is a potential to do good as well 
  it is critical as these virtual worlds continue to mirror the real world we live in that game developers realize that they have tremendous responsibilities before them
  i 'm not sure what the future of video games holds for our civilization
 but as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap there is a greater and greater potential
 for other people to feel the same way i do 
 what i have only recently come to realize is that beyond the graphics sound game play and emotion
  it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating and addictive to me  i know that i am losing my grip 
 part of me is just waiting to let go  
 i know though that no matter how amazing video games may become or how flat the real world may seem to us
  that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug dp wow 
 i found that video very very thought provoking and that 's why i wanted to bring it here for you guys to see
  and what was interesting about it is the obvious choice for me to talk about was graphics and audio but as you heard michael talked about all these other elements as well 
 video games give an awful lot of other things too and that 's why people get so addicted the most important one being fun  the name of this track is the magic to come who is that going to come from is it going to come from the best 
  directors in the world as we thought it probably would i don 't think so i think it 's going to come from the children who are growing up now that aren 't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past they 're going to do it their way
  the tools that we 've created the same with students or highly creative people writers and people like that 
 as far as colleges go there 's about three hundred and fifty colleges around the world teaching
 video game courses that means there 's literally thousands of new ideas some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great there 's nothing worse than having to listen to someone try and
  this is just a cool shot because this is students coming to school after class  the school is closed they 're coming back at midnight because they want to pitch their video
  game ideas i 'm sitting at the front of the class and they 're actually pitching their ideas so it 's hard to get students to come back to class but it is possible 
 this is my daughter her name 's emma she 's seventeen months old 
 and
 i 've been asking myself what is emma going to experience in the video game world and as i 've shown here  
 we have the audience  she 's never going to know a world where you can 't press a button and have millions of people ready to play  you know 
 we have the technology she 's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren 't stunning and really immersive  
 and as the student
  video showed we can impact and move she 's never going to know a world where video games aren 't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry  i just hope she likes video games 
 so my closing thought 
 games on the surface seem simple entertainment but for those that like to look a little deeper the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiers to creative minds that like to think big 
 where better to challenge those minds than here at ted thank you
