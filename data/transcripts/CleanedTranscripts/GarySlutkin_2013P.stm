  physician trained in infectious diseases and following my training  i moved to somalia
 from san francisco and my goodbye greeting from the chief of infectious diseases at san francisco general was
 gary this is the biggest mistake you 'll ever make but i landed in a refugee situation
 that had a million refugees
 in forty camps  and there were six of us doctors there
 were many epidemics there my responsibilities were largely related to tuberculosis  
 and then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera
 so it was the spread of tuberculosis and the spread of cholera that i was responsible for
 inhibiting  
 and in order to do this work we of course because of the limitation in health workers had to recruit refugees to be a specialized new category of health worker 
 following three years of work in somalia
  got picked up by the world health organization and got assigned to the epidemics of aids my primary responsibility was uganda 
 but also i worked in rwanda and burundi
 and zaire  now congo  
 tanzania malawi and several other countries  and my last assignment there was to run a unit called intervention development  which was responsible for designing interventions
  interventions  after ten years of working overseas  i was exhausted i really had very little left  
 i had been traveling to one country after another i was emotionally feeling very isolated  i wanted to come home i
 'd seen a lot of death  in
  and epidemic death has a different feel to it it 's full of panic and fear  and i 'd heard the women
 wailing and crying in the desert and i wanted to come home and take a break
 and maybe start over  i was not aware of any epidemic problems in america
  in fact i wasn 't aware of any problems in america  in fact seriously  and in fact i would visit friends of mine  and
 i noticed that they had water that came right into their homes  how many of you have such a situation 
 laughter and some of them many of them actually had water that came into more than one room 
 and i noticed that they would move this little thermoregulatory device to change the temperature in their home by one degree
 or two degrees  and now i do that  
 and i really didn 't know what i would do but friends of mine began telling me about children shooting other children with guns  
 and i asked the question  what are you doing about it what are you in america doing about it  
 and there were two essential explanations or ideas that were prevalent
  one was punishment  and this i had heard about before  we who had worked in behavior knew that punishment
 was something that was discussed but also that it was highly overvalued it was not a main driver of behavior nor was it a main
 driver of behavior change and besides
  it reminded me
 of ancient epidemics that were previously completely misunderstood because the science hadn 't been there before epidemics
 of plague or typhus or leprosy 
 where the prevalent ideas were that there were bad people or bad humors or bad air  
 and widows were dragged around the moat and dungeons were part of the solution 
 the other explanation or
  solution suggested is please fix all of these things  the schools the community the homes the families everything  
 and i 'd heard this before as well i 'd called this the everything theory  
 or eoe everything on earth  but we 'd also realized in treating other processes and problems that sometimes you don 't need to treat everything and so the
 the sense that i had was there was a giant gap here  
 the problem of violence was stuck  and this has historically been the case in many other issues diarrheal diseases had been stuck malaria had been stuck  frequently a strategy has to be rethought 
 it 's not as if i had any idea what it would look like  but there was a sense that we would have to do something with new categories of workers
  and something having to do with behavior change and something having to do with public education  but i began to ask questions and search out
 the usual things that i had been exploring before like what do the maps look like what do the graphs look like what does the data look like  
 and the maps of violence in most u s cities looked like this there was clustering
 this reminded me of clustering that we 'd seen also in infectious epidemics for example cholera  
 and then we looked at the maps and
 the maps showed this typical wave upon wave upon wave because all epidemics are combinations of many epidemics and it also looked like
  and then we asked the question  well what really predicts a case of violence  and it turns out that the greatest predictor of a case of violence is a preceding case of violence  
 which also sounds like if there is a case of flu someone gave someone a case of flu or a cold or the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis is having been exposed to tuberculosis 
 and so we see that violence is in a way  behaving like a contagious disease
 're aware of this anyway even in our common experiences or our newspaper stories of the spread of violence
 from fights or in gang wars or in civil wars or even in genocides  
 and so there 's good news about this though because there 's a way to reverse epidemics and there 's really only three things that are done to reverse epidemics  and the first of it is interrupting
  transmission  in order to interrupt transmission you need to detect and find first cases  in other words  for t b you have to find somebody who has active t b who is infecting other people make sense  
 and there 's special workers for doing that for this particular problem we designed a new category of
  like a sars worker or someone looking for bird flu  might find first cases  in this case it 's someone who 's very angry because someone looked at his girlfriend or owes him money and you can find workers and train them into these specialized
 categories  and the second thing to do of course is to prevent further spread that means to find who else has been exposed 
 but may not be spreading so much right now like someone with a smaller case of t b or someone who is just hanging
  out in the neighborhoods but in the same group  and then they need to be in a way  managed as well  particular to the specific disease process  
 and then the third part the shifting the norms  
 and that means a whole bunch of community activities  remodeling public education  and then you 've got what you might call group immunity  and that combination of factors is how the aids
  epidemic in uganda was very successfully reversed  
 and so what we decided to do in the year two thousand is kind of put this together in a way by hiring in new categories of workers the first being violence interruptors 
 and then we would put all of this into place in one neighborhood in what was the worst police district in the united states at the time so violence interruptors hired from the same group
  credibility  trust  access just like the health workers in somalia  but designed for a different category and trained in persuasion cooling people 
  down buying time  reframing  and then another category of worker  the outreach workers to keep people in a way on therapy for six to
  but the object is behavior change and then a bunch of community activities for changing norms  now our first experiment of this resulted in a 
  67 percent drop in shootings and killings in the west garfield neighborhood of chicago and this was
 a beautiful thing for the neighborhood itself first fifty or sixty days  then ninety days
  then there was unfortunately another shooting in another ninety days  and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon they were using parks they weren 't using before  the sun was out everybody was happy  but of course  
 the funders said wait a second do it again 
 and so we had to then fortunately  
 get the funds to repeat this experience and this is one of the next four neighborhoods that had a 45 percent drop
  in shootings and killings and since that time this has been replicated twenty times there have been independent evaluations supported by the justice department and by the cdc and performed by johns hopkins that have shown 
 reductions in shootings and killings using this new method  in fact there have been three independent evaluations of this now 
 now we 've gotten a lot of attention as a result of this including being featured on the new york times
  magazine cover story  the economist in two thousand and nine said this is the approach that will come to prominence and even a movie was made around our work [ the interrupters ]
 however not so fast 
 because a lot of people did not agree with this way of going about it we got a lot of criticism a lot of opposition  and a lot of opponents  in other words what do you mean health problem
 what do you mean epidemic what do you mean no bad guys  and there 's whole industries designed
 for managing bad people what do you mean  hiring people who have backgrounds  
 my
 business friends said
  you 're being criticized tremendously you must be doing something right 
 laughter my musician friends added the word dude so anyway  
 additionally 
 there was still this problem and we were getting highly criticized as well for not dealing with all of these other problems 
 yet we were able to manage malaria and reduce hiv and reduce diarrheal diseases in places with awful
 without healing the economy  
 so what 's actually happened is although there is still some opposition  the movement is clearly growing many of the major cities in the u s including new york 
  city and baltimore and kansas city their health departments are running this now chicago and new orleans the health departments are having a very large role in this this is being embraced more by law enforcement than
  it had been years ago  
 trauma centers and hospitals are doing their part in stepping up and the u s conference of mayors has endorsed not only the approach but the specific model  
 where there 's really been uptake even faster is in the international environment where
 there 's a 55 percent drop in the first neighborhood in puerto rico  where interruptions are just beginning in honduras
 where the strategy has been applied in kenya for the recent elections  and where there have been five hundred interruptions in iraq 
 so violence is responding as a disease even as it behaves as a disease so the theory in a way is kind of being validated by the
  the institute of medicine came out with a workshop report which went through some of the data including the neuroscience on how this problem is really
 transmitted  
 so i think this is good news 
 because it allows us an opportunity to come out of the middle ages which is where i feel this field has been it
 gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility
 of replacing some of these prisons with
  playgrounds or parks  and to consider the possibility of converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods  
 and to allow there to be a new strategy a new set of methods a new set of workers 
 science in a way  replacing morality  and moving away from emotions is the most important part of the solution to
  science as a more important part of the solution 
 so i didn 't mean to come up with this at all
  it was a matter of i wanted actually a break 
 and we looked at maps we looked at graphs we asked some questions and
