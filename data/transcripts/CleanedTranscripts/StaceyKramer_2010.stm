  if you will a gift i 'd like for you to picture it in your mind it 's not too big
 about the size of a golf ball so envision what it looks like all wrapped up but before i show you what 's inside
 i will tell you it 's going to do incredible things for you  
 it will bring all of your family together 
 you will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven 't heard from in years  
 adoration and admiration will overwhelm you  
 it will recalibrate what 's most important in your life it will redefine your sense of spirituality
 and faith you
 'll have a new understanding and trust in your body you
 'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy you
 'll expand your vocabulary meet new people and you 'll have a healthier lifestyle 
 and get this you 'll have an
  meals  flowers will arrive by the truckload people will say to you you look great have you had any work done 
 and you 'll have a lifetime supply
 of good drugs you 'll be challenged inspired motivated and humbled 
  and that 's an incredible deal 
 by now i know you 're dying to know what it is and where you can get one  
 does amazon carry it  does it have the apple logo on it is there a waiting list
  not likely this gift came to me about five months ago it looked more like this when it was all wrapped up not quite so pretty  
 and this 
 and then this 
 it was a rare gem a brain tumor  hemangioblastoma the gift that keeps on giving
  giving 
 and while i 'm okay now i wouldn 't wish this gift for you i 'm not sure you 'd want it but i wouldn 't change my experience 
 it profoundly altered my life in ways i didn 't expect
 in all the ways i just shared with you so the next time you 're faced
 with something that 's unexpected  unwanted
 and uncertain  consider that it just may be a gift
