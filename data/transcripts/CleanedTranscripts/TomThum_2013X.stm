  i 've come here today to come clean about what i do for money
 basically i use my mouth in strange ways in exchange for
  i usually do this kind of thing in seedy downtown bars and on street corners so this mightn 't be the most appropriate setting but i 'd like to give you guys a bit of a demonstration about what i do
  and
  and now for my next number i 'd like to
  very much tedx if you guys haven 't figured it out already my name 's tom thum and i 'm a beatboxer which means all the
  sounds that you just heard were made entirely using just my voice and the only thing was my voice and i can assure you
 there are absolutely
 no effects
 on this microphone whatsoever
 and i 'm very very stoked
  i 'm very very stoked to be here today
 representing my kinfolk and all those that haven 't managed to make a career out of an innate ability for inhuman noisemaking
 because it is a bit of a niche market and there 's not much work going on especially where i 'm from you know i 'm from brisbane
  which is a great city to live in yeah all right most of brisbane 's here that 's good laughter
 you know i 'm from brizzy
 which is a great city to live in but
 let 's be honest it 's not exactly the cultural hub of the southern hemisphere so i do a lot of my work
 outside brisbane and outside australia and so the pursuit of this crazy passion of mine has enabled me to see
  so many amazing places in the world so i 'd like to share with you if i may my experiences so ladies and gentlemen
 i would like to take you on a journey throughout the continents and throughout sound itself
 we start our journey in
  whole lot
  we reach our final destination ladies and gentlemen i would like to share with you some technology that i brought all the way from the thriving metropolis of brisbane
 these things in front of me here are called kaoss pads and they allow me to do a whole lot of different things with my voice
 for example the one on the left here
 allows me to add a little bit of reverb to my sound
 which gives me that trumpet
 and
  the other ones here i can use them in unison to
 mimic the effect of a drum machine or something like that i can sample in my own sounds and i can play it back just by hitting the pads here noises
  to share
  my hands
 and last but not least the one on my right here allows me to loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop
 my voice
 so with all that in mind ladies and gentlemen i would like to take you on a journey to a completely separate part of earth
 as i transform the sydney opera house into a smoky downtown jazz bar all
 right boys take it away
  ladies and gentlemen i 'd like to introduce you to a very special friend of mine one of the greatest double bassists i know mr smokey jefferson let 's take it for a walk come on baby
  ladies and gentlemen i 'd like to introduce you to the star of the show
 one of the greatest jazz legends of our time music lovers and jazz lovers alike please give a warm hand of applause for the one and only mr peeping
