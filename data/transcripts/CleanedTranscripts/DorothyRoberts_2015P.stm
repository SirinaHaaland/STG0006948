  fifteen years ago  i volunteered to participate in a research study that involved a genetic test 
 when i arrived at the clinic to be tested i was handed a questionnaire 
 one of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race
 black  asian or native american  i wasn 't quite sure how to answer the question 
 was it aimed at measuring the diversity of research participants ' social backgrounds 
 in that case  i would answer with my social identity and check the box for black 
 but what if
  the researchers were interested in investigating some association between ancestry and the risk for certain genetic traits 
 in that case  wouldn 't they want to know something about my ancestry  which is just as much european as african  
 and how could they make scientific findings about my genes
 if i put down my social identity as a black
  after all i consider myself a black woman with a white father rather than a white woman with a black mother entirely for social reasons  
 which racial identity i check has nothing to do with my genes  
 well  despite the obvious importance of this question to the study 's scientific validity  
  't worry about it just put down however you identify yourself 
 so i check black 
 but i had no confidence in the results of a study that treated a critical variable so unscientifically 
 that personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing got me thinking 
 where else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions
 well i found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice 
 it shapes physicians ' diagnoses  measurements  treatments  prescriptions 
 even the very definition of diseases 
 and the more i found out
  the more disturbed i became 
 sociologists like me have long explained that race is a social construction 
 when we identify people as black white  asian native american latina 
 we 're referring to social groupings with made up demarcations that have changed over time and vary around the world 
 as a legal scholar  i 've also studied how lawmakers not
  biologists have invented the legal definitions of races  
 and it 's not just the view of social scientists 
 you remember when the map of the human genome was unveiled at a white house ceremony in june two thousand 
 president bill clinton famously declared
  i believe one of the great truths to emerge from this triumphant expedition inside the human genome is that in genetic terms human beings 
 regardless of race  are more than ninety nine point nine percent the same 
  francis collins who led the human genome project and now heads nih  echoed president clinton 
 i am happy that today  the only race we 're talking about is the human race 
 doctors are supposed to practice evidence based medicine 
 and they 're increasingly called to join the genomic revolution but their habit of treating
  this important indicator of kidney function by race 
 as you can see in this lab test the exact same
 creatinine
  i 've been told it 's based on an assumption that
 have more muscle mass than people of other races  but what sense does it make for a
 doctor to automatically assume
 i have more muscle mass than that female bodybuilder  wouldn 't it be far more accurate and
 to determine the muscle mass of individual patients just by looking at them  
 well doctors tell me they 're using race as a shortcut  it 's a crude but convenient proxy
 for more important factors like muscle mass  enzyme level genetic traits they just don 't have time to look for 
 but race is a bad proxy 
 in many cases race adds no relevant information at all it 's just a distraction  
 but race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures
  it blinds doctors to patients ' symptoms  family illnesses 
 their history their own illnesses they might have
 all more 
 than the patient 's race race can 't substitute for these important
  doctors also tell me race is just one of many factors they take into account but there are numerous medical tests like the gfr 
 that use race categorically to treat black white asian patients differently
 just because of their race
  race medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable
 to harmful biases and stereotypes 
 black and latino patients are twice as likely to receive no pain medication as whites for the same
 painful long bone fractures
 because of stereotypes that black and brown people feel less pain exaggerate their pain
  and are predisposed to drug addiction the food and drug administration has even approved a 
 medicine it 's a pill called bidil to treat heart failure in 
  patients a cardiologist developed this drug without regard to race or genetics but it became
  convenient for commercial reasons to market the drug to black patients the fda then allowed
 the
 company the drug company to test the efficacy in a clinical trial that only included
  it speculated that race stood in as a proxy for some unknown genetic factor
 that affects heart disease or
 response to drugs  
 but think about the dangerous message it sent that black people 's bodies are so substandard 
 a drug tested in them is not guaranteed to work in other patients
 in the end the drug company 's marketing scheme failed for one thing black patients were understandably wary of using a drug just for black people 
 one elderly black woman stood up in a community meeting and shouted give me what the white people are taking
  wait until you learn that many doctors in the united states still use an updated version
 of a diagnostic tool that was developed by a physician during the slavery era 
 a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked to justifications for slavery 
 dr samuel cartwright
 graduated from the university of pennsylvania medical school 
 he practiced in the deep south before the civil war  and he was a well known expert on what was then called negro medicine 
 he promoted the racial concept of disease that people of different races suffer from different diseases
  that slavery was beneficial for black people
 for medical reasons  
 he claimed that because black people have lower lung capacity than whites forced labor was good for them  
 he wrote in a medical journal 
  it is the red vital blood sent to the brain that liberates their minds when under the white man 's control 
 and it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood that chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom 
 to support this theory cartwright helped to perfect a medical device
 for measuring breathing called 
  to show the presumed deficiency in black people 's lungs  
 today  doctors still uphold cartwright 's claim
 the black people as a race have lower lung capacity than white people 
 some even use a modern day 
 that actually has a
  so the machine adjusts the measurement for each patient according to his or her race it 's a well known function called correcting for race 
 the problem with race medicine extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients  
 its focus on innate racial differences
  in disease diverts attention and resources from the social determinants that cause appalling racial gaps in health 
 lack of access to high quality medical care 
 food deserts in poor neighborhoods  
 exposure to environmental toxins  high rates of incarceration 
 and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination
  you see race is not a biological category that naturally produces these health disparities because of genetic difference 
 race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences but because of the impact of social inequality on people 's health 
 yet race medicine pretends the answer
  to these gaps in health can be found in a race specific pill 
 it 's much easier and more lucrative to market a technological fix
 for these gaps in health than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them  
 the reason i 'm so passionate about ending race medicine isn 't just
  because it 's bad medicine 
 i 'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity
  despite the many visionary breakthroughs in medicine we 've been learning about 
 there 's a failure of imagination when it comes to race
 would you imagine with me just a moment  what would happen if doctors stopped
 treating patients by race  suppose they rejected
  18th century classification system and incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge of human genetic diversity and unity
 that human beings cannot be categorized into biological races  
 what if 
 instead of using race as a crude proxy for some more important factor 
 doctors actually investigated and addressed that more important factor 
 what if doctors joined the forefront of
  a movement to end the structural inequities caused by racism not by genetic difference 
 race medicine is bad medicine it 's poor science
 and it 's a false interpretation of
  it is more urgent than ever to finally abandon this backward legacy
 and to affirm our common humanity by ending the social inequalities that truly divide us
