  the oceans cover some seventy percent of our planet and i think arthur c clarke probably had it right when he said that perhaps we ought to call our planet
 planet ocean  and the oceans are hugely productive as you can see by the satellite image of photosynthesis the production of new life in fact the oceans produce half
  of the new life every day on earth as well as about half the oxygen that we breathe  
 in addition to that it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on earth and much of it we don 't know about but i 'll tell you some of that today 
 that also doesn 't even get into the whole protein extraction that we do from the ocean that 's about ten percent of our our global needs and one hundred percent of some island nations
  if you were to descend into the ninety five percent of the biosphere that 's livable  it would quickly become pitch black  interrupted only by pinpoints of light from bioluminescent organisms 
 and if you turn the lights on you might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by because those are the denizens of the deep the things that live in the deep ocean 
 and eventually the deep sea floor would come into view  this type of habitat covers more of the earth 's surface than all other habitats
  and yet we know more about the surface of the moon and about mars than we do about this habitat despite the fact that we have yet to extract a gram of food a breath of oxygen or a drop of water from those bodies  
 and so ten years ago an international program began called the census of marine life  which set out to try and improve our understanding of life in the global oceans 
 it involved seventeen different projects around the world as you can see these are the footprints of the different projects  and i hope you 'll appreciate the level of global coverage that it managed
  to achieve it all began when two scientists fred grassle and jesse ausubel met in woods hole massachusetts where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute 
 and fred was lamenting the state of marine biodiversity and the fact that it was in trouble and nothing was being done about it well
 from that discussion grew this program that involved two thousand seven hundred scientists from more than eighty countries around the world who engaged in five hundred and forty ocean expeditions at a combined cost
  of six hundred and fifty million dollars to study the distribution diversity and abundance of life in the global ocean  
 and so what did we find we found spectacular new species the most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked from the shoreline to the abyss form microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between 
 and the limiting step here wasn 't the unknown diversity of life but rather the taxonomic specialists who can identify and
  these species that became the limiting step they in fact are an endangered species themselves 
 there are actually four to five new species described everyday for the oceans  and as i say it could be a much larger number  
 now i come from newfoundland in canada it 's an island off the east coast of that continent
 where we experienced one of the worst fishing
  in human history  
 and so this photograph shows a small boy next to a codfish it 's around one thousand nine hundred now when i was a boy of about his age i would go out fishing with my grandfather and we would catch fish about half that size  and i thought that was the norm because i had never seen fish like this 
 if you were to go out there today twenty years after this fishery collapsed if you could catch a fish which would be a bit of a challenge it would be half that size still so what we 're experiencing is something called shifting baselines our expectations of what the oceans can produce
 is something that we don 't really appreciate because we haven 't seen it in our lifetimes  now most of us and i would say me included 
 think that human exploitation of the oceans really only became very serious in the last fifty to perhaps one hundred years or so 
 the census actually tried to look back in time using every source of information they could get their hands on  
 and so anything from restaurant menus to monastery records to ships ' logs to see what the oceans looked like because science data
  really goes back to at best world war ii for the most part  
 and so what they found in fact is that exploitation really began heavily with the romans  and so at that time of course there was no refrigeration so fishermen could only
 catch what they could either eat or sell that day  
 but the romans developed salting and with salting it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances  and so began industrial fishing
  so these are the sorts of extrapolations that we have of what sort of loss we 've had relative to pre human impacts on the ocean  they range from sixty five to ninety eight percent for these major groups of organisms as shown in the dark blue bars  
 now for those species the we managed to leave alone that we protect for example marine mammals in recent years and sea birds there is some recovery so it 's not all hopeless  but for the most part we 've gone from salting to exhausting
 now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one it 's from trophy fish caught off the coast of florida  and so this is a photograph from the 1950s i want you to notice the scale 
  on the slide because when you see the same picture from the 1980s we see the fish are much smaller and we 're also seeing a change in terms of the composition of those fish 
  actually laughable in terms of the size for a trophy fish  but this is no laughing matter the oceans have lost a lot of their productivity and we 're responsible for it 
 so what 's left actually quite a lot  there 's a lot of exciting things and i 'm going to tell you a little bit about them and i want to start with a bit on technology  because of course this is a ted conference and you want to hear something on technology  
 so one of the tools that we use to sample the deep ocean are remotely operated vehicles so these are tethered vehicles we lower down to the sea floor where they 're our eyes and our hands for working
  on the sea bottom 
 so a couple of years ago i was supposed to go on an oceanographic cruise and i couldn 't go because of a scheduling conflict 
 but through a satellite link i was able to sit at my study at home with my dog curled up at my feet a cup of tea in my hand  and i could tell the pilot i want a sample right there and that 's exactly what the pilot 
  did for me that 's the sort of technology that 's available today that really wasn 't available even a decade ago  so it allows us to sample these amazing habitats that are very
  far from the surface and very far from light 
 and so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans is acoustics or sound waves  and the advantage of sound waves is that they actually pass well through water unlike light and so we can send out 
  sound waves they bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back  and so in this example a census scientist took out two ships one would
 send out sound waves that would bounce back they would be received by a second ship  and that would give us very precise estimates in this case of two hundred and fifty billion herring in a period of about a minute  and that 's an area about the size of manhattan island  
 and to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool because knowing how many fish are there is really critical 
 we can also use satellite tags to track animals as they move through the oceans  and so for animals that come to the surface to
  such as this elephant seal it 's an opportunity to send data back to shore and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean  and so from that we can produce these tracks for example the dark blue shows you where the
 elephant seal moved in the north pacific now i realize for those of you who are colorblind this slide is not very helpful but stick with me nonetheless 
 for animals that don 't surface we have something called pop up tags which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets and then at some period of time it pops up to the surface and again relays that data back to shore because
  gps doesn 't work under water that 's why we need these tools  and so from this we 're able to identify these blue highways these hot spots in the ocean that should be real priority areas for ocean conservation
  now one of the other things that you may think about is that when you go to the supermarket and you buy things they 're scanned and so there 's a barcode on that product that tells the computer exactly what the product is 
 geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding
  what barcoding does is use a specific gene called co1 that 's consistent within a species but varies among species 
 and so what that means is we can unambiguously identify which species are which even if they look similar to each other but may be biologically quite different  now one of the nicest examples i like to cite 
  on this is the story of two young women high school students in new york city who worked with the census they went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in new york
  city and they barcoded it well what they found was mislabeled fish  so for example they found something which was sold as tuna  which is very valuable 
 was in fact tilapia which is a much less valuable fish  they also found an endangered species sold as a common one 
 so barcoding allows us to know what we 're working with and also what we 're eating 
 the ocean biogeographic information system is the database for all the census data it 's open access you can
  all go in and download data as you wish  and it contains all the data from the census plus other data sets that people were willing to contribute  
 and so what you can do with that is to plot the distribution of species and where they occur in the oceans 
 what i 've plotted up here is the data that we have on hand  this is where our sampling effort has concentrated  
 now what you can see is we 've sampled the area in the north atlantic 
 in the north sea in particular and also the east coast of north america fairly well
 that 's the warm colors which show a well sampled region the cold colors the blue and the black show areas where we have almost no data  so even after a 10 year census there are large areas that still remain unexplored 
 now there are a group of scientists living in texas  working in the gulf of mexico who decided really as a labor of love to pull together all the knowledge they could about biodiversity in the gulf of mexico  
 and so they put this together a list of all the species where they 're known to occur
 and it really seemed like a very esoteric  scientific type of exercise  
 but then of course there was the deep horizon oil spill so all of a sudden this labor of love for no obvious economic reason has become a critical piece of information in terms 
  of how that system is going to recover how long it will take and how the lawsuits and the multi billion dollar
  did we find well i could stand here for hours but of course i 'm not allowed to do that but i will tell you some of my favorite discoveries from the census 
 so one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity where do we find the most species of ocean life  
 and what we find if we plot up the well known species is this sort of a distribution  and what we see is that for coastal tags for those organisms that live near the shoreline they 're most diverse in the tropics this is something we 've actually known for a while
  so it 's not a real breakthrough what is really exciting though is that the oceanic tags or the ones that live far from the coast are actually more diverse at intermediate latitudes  
 this is the sort of data again that managers could use if they want to prioritize areas of the ocean that we need to conserve you can do this on a global scale but you can also do it on a regional scale  and that 's why biodiversity data can be so valuable
  while a lot of the species we discovered in the census are things that are small and hard to see that certainly wasn 't always the case for example while it 's hard to believe that a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists 
 it did until a few years ago when south african fishermen requested an export permit and scientists realized that this was something new to science  
  this bigfin squid is seven meters in length but to be fair it lives in the deep waters of the mid atlantic ridge  so it was a lot harder to find  
 but there 's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things 
 this particular shrimp  we 've dubbed it the jurassic shrimp it 's thought to have gone extinct fifty years ago at least it was until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast
  shows that the ocean because of its vastness can hide secrets for a very long time so steven spielberg eat your heart out 
 if we look at distributions in fact distributions change dramatically and so one of the records that we had was this sooty shearwater which undergoes these spectacular migrations all the way from new zealand all the way up to
 alaska and back again in search of endless summer as they complete their life cycles
  we also talked about the white shark cafe this is a location in the pacific where white shark converge we don 't know why they converge there  we simply don 't know that 's a question for the future 
 one of the things that we 're taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive now this little critter it 's only about half a millimeter in size not terribly charismatic
 but it was only discovered in the early 1980s but the really interesting thing about it is that a few years ago census
 scientists discovered that this guy can thrive in oxygen poor sediments in the deep mediterranean sea so now they know that in fact animals can live without oxygen at least some of them  and that they can adapt to even the harshest of conditions 
 if you were to suck all the water out of the ocean  this is what you 'd be left behind with and that 's the biomass of life on the sea floor  now what we see is huge biomass towards the poles and not much biomass in between 
  we found life in the extremes and so there were new species
 that were found that live inside ice and help to support an ice based food web 
 and we also found this spectacular yeti crab that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at easter island and this particular species really
 captured the public 's attention  
 we also found the deepest vents known yet five thousand meters the hottest vents at four hundred and seven degrees celsius vents in the south pacific and also in the arctic where none had been found before  so even new environments are still
  within the domain of the discoverable  now in terms of the unknowns there are many and i 'm just going to summarize just a few of them very quickly for you 
 first of all we might ask how many fishes in the sea  we actually know the fishes better than we do any other group in the ocean other than marine mammals  
 and so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery how many more species we 're likely to discover 
 and from that we actually calculate that we know about sixteen thousand five hundred marine species
 and there are probably another one thousand to four thousand left to go so we 've done pretty well we 've got about seventy five percent of the fish  maybe as much as ninety percent  
 but the fishes as i say are the best known so our level of knowledge is much less for other groups of organisms  
 now this figure is actually based on a brand new paper that 's going to come out in the journal plos biology  and what is does is predict how many more species there are on land and in the ocean  
 and what they found is that
  think that we know of about nine percent of the species in the ocean that means ninety one percent even after the census still remain to be discovered  and so that turns out to be about two million species once all is said and done so we still have quite a lot of work to do
 in terms of unknowns  now this bacterium is part of mats that are found off the coast of chile  and
 these mats actually cover an area the size of greece  and so this particular bacterium
  visible to the naked eye but you can imagine the biomass that represents  but the really intriguing thing about the microbes is just how diverse they are a single drop of seawater could contain one hundred and sixty different types of microbes 
 and the oceans themselves are thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types so that 's really exciting what are they all doing out there we actually
 don 't know the most exciting thing i would say about this census is the role of global science and so as we see in this image of light
 during the night there are lots of areas of the earth where human
 development is much greater and other areas where it 's much less but between them we see large dark areas of relatively unexplored ocean 
 the other point i 'd like to make about this is that this ocean 's interconnected marine organisms do not care about international boundaries they move where they will  and so the importance then of global collaboration becomes all the
  more important 
 we 've lost a lot of paradise for example these tuna that were once so abundant in the north sea are now effectively gone 
 there were trawls taken in the deep sea in the mediterranean which collected more garbage than they did animals and that 's the deep sea that 's the environment that we consider to be among the most pristine left on earth 
 and there are a lot of other pressures ocean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with as well as ocean warming
 and the effects they 're going to have on coral reefs on the scale of decades in our lifetimes we 're going to see a lot of damage to coral reefs  
 and i could spend the rest of my time which is getting very limited going through this litany of concerns about the ocean but i want to end on a more positive note  
 and so the grand challenge then is to try and make sure that we preserve what 's left because there is still spectacular beauty  and the oceans are so productive there 's so much going on in there that 's of relevance to humans that we really
  to even from a selfish perspective  try to do better than we have in the past so we need to recognize those hot spots and do our best to protect them when
 we look at pictures like this they take our breath away in addition to helping to give us breath by the oxygen that the oceans provide 
 census scientists worked in the rain  they worked in the cold they worked under water and they worked above water trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery the still vast unknown the spectacular adaptations
  we see in ocean life  
 so whether you 're a yak herder living in the mountains of chile  whether you 're a stockbroker in new york city or whether you 're a tedster living in edinburgh the oceans matter  and as the oceans go so shall we thanks for listening
