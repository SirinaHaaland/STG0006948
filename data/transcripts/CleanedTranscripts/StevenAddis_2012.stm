  photography has been my passion ever since i was old enough to pick up a camera  but today i want to share with you
 the fifteen most treasured photos of mine  and i didn 't take any of them  there were no
  no stylists no chance for reshoots not even any regard for lighting in fact most of them were taken
 by random tourists my story begins
 when i was in new york city for a speaking engagement  and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday we 're on the corner of 
 we happened to be back in new york exactly a year
  so we decided to take the same picture  
 well you can see where this is going  approaching my daughter 's third birthday my wife said hey why don 't you take sabina back to new york
 and make it a father daughter trip  and continue the ritual this is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture you know it 's remarkable
 how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger no one 's ever refused
  and luckily no one 's ever run off with our camera 
 back then we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives it 's really become sacred to us this one was taken just weeks after nine eleven  
 and i found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five year old could understand  
 so these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment or even a specific trip  
 they 're also ways for us to freeze time for one week in october
 and reflect on our times
 and how we change from year to year  and not just physically  but in every way  
 because while we take the same photo our perspectives change  
 and she reaches new milestones  
 and i get to see life through her eyes and how she interacts with and sees everything 
 this very
  focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year  
 recently on one trip we were walking  
 and she stops dead in her tracks  and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little
 on our earlier trips  and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a
 five year old standing in that exact spot she said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier  
 and now what she 's looking at in new york are colleges  because she 's determined to go to school in new york and it hit me one of
  most important things we all make are memories
