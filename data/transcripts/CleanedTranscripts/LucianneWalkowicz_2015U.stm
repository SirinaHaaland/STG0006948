  we 're at a tipping point in human history a species poised between gaining the stars and losing the planet we call home  
 even in just the past few years we 've greatly expanded our knowledge of how earth fits within the context of our universe  nasa 's kepler mission has
  discovered thousands of potential planets around other stars indicating that earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy 
 kepler is a space telescope that measures the subtle dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them  blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us 
 kepler 's data reveals planets ' sizes
 as well as their distance from their parent star  together this helps us understand whether these
  planets are small and rocky like the terrestrial planets in our own solar system and also how much light they receive from their parent sun 
 in turn this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover might be habitable or not 
 unfortunately  at the same time as we 're discovering this treasure trove of potentially habitable worlds our own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity
 was the hottest year on record  glaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia are now disappearing in a matter of decades 
  planetary scale environmental changes that we have set in motion
 are rapidly outpacing our ability to alter their course  
 but i 'm not a climate scientist i 'm an astronomer  i study planetary habitability as
  by stars
 with the hopes of finding the places in the universe where we might discover life beyond our own planet you could say that i look for choice alien real estate 
 now as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe i can tell you that the more you look for planets like earth 
 the more you appreciate our own planet itself  
 each one of these new worlds invites a comparison
  between the newly discovered planet
 and the planets we know best  those of our own solar system  
 consider our neighbor mars mars is small and rocky 
 and though it 's a bit far from the sun it might be considered a potentially habitable world if found by a mission like kepler 
 indeed it 's possible that mars was habitable in the past and in part this is why we study mars so much 
 our rovers like curiosity
  across its surface scratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it 
 orbiters like the maven mission sample the martian atmosphere  trying to understand how mars might have lost its past habitability 
 private spaceflight companies now offer not just a short trip to near space but the tantalizing possibility of living our lives on mars  
 but though these martian vistas resemble the deserts of our own home world places that are tied
  in our imagination to ideas about pioneering and frontiers  compared to earth mars is a pretty terrible place to live  
 consider the extent to which we have not colonized the deserts of our own planet places that are lush by comparison with mars  
 even in the driest highest places on
  the air is sweet and thick with oxygen exhaled from thousands of miles away by our rainforests 
 i worry i worry that this excitement about colonizing mars and other planets
 carries with it a long dark shadow the implication and belief by some
 that mars will be there to save us from the self inflicted destruction of the only truly habitable planet we know of the earth
  as much as i love interplanetary exploration i deeply disagree with this idea 
 there are many excellent reasons to go to mars but for anyone to tell you that mars will be there to back up humanity
 is like the captain of the titanic telling you that the real party is happening later on the lifeboats
  are not opposed to one another no they 're in fact two sides of the same goal to understand preserve and improve life into the future 
 the extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas they 're just closer to home 
 if we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces out of hostile inhospitable spaces here on earth  
 perhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own
  environment and moving beyond it 
 i leave you with a final thought experiment fermi 's paradox 
 many years ago the physicist enrico fermi asked that 
 given the fact that our universe has been around for a very long time and we expect that there are many planets within it we should have found evidence for alien life by now 
 so where are they 
 well one possible solution to fermi 's
  paradox
 is that as civilizations become technologically advanced enough to consider living amongst the stars 
 they lose sight of how important it is to safeguard the home worlds that fostered that advancement to begin with 
 it is hubris to believe that interplanetary colonization alone will save us from ourselves 
 but planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration can work together
 if we truly believe in our ability to bend the hostile environments of mars for human habitation 
 then we should be able to surmount the far easier task of preserving the habitability of the earth
