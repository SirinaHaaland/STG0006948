  i am holding something remarkably old  
 it is older than any human artifact  older than life on earth  older than the continents and the oceans between them 
 this was formed over four billion years ago in the earliest days of the
  solar system while the planets were still forming this rusty lump of nickel and iron may not appear special but when it is cut open 
 you can see that it is different from earthly metals 
 this pattern reveals metallic crystals that can only form out in space where molten metal can cool extremely slowly a few degrees every million years  
 this was once part of a much larger object
 one of millions left over after the planets formed we call these objects asteroids 
 asteroids are our oldest and most numerous cosmic neighbors  
 this graphic shows near earth asteroids orbiting around the sun shown in yellow and swinging close to the earth 's orbit shown in blue 
 the sizes of the earth sun and asteroids have been greatly exaggerated so you can see them clearly  
 teams of scientists across the globe are searching for these
  objects discovering new ones every day steadily mapping near earth space 
 much of this work is funded by nasa 
 i think of the search for these asteroids as a giant public works project but instead of building a highway we 're charting outer space building an archive that will last for generations 
 these are the one thousand five hundred
  and these are all of the known near earth asteroids which at last count was thirteen thousand seven hundred and thirty three 
 each one has been imaged  cataloged and had its path around the sun determined 
 although it varies from asteroid to asteroid the paths of most asteroids can be predicted for dozens of years and the paths of some asteroids can be predicted with incredible precision 
 for example scientists at the jet propulsion laboratory
  predicted where the asteroid toutatis was going to be four years in advance to within thirty kilometers in those four years toutatis traveled eight point five billion kilometers 
 that 's a fractional precision of
  reason i have this beautiful asteroid fragment is because like all neighbors  asteroids sometimes drop by unexpectedly 
 three years ago today a small asteroid exploded over the city of chelyabinsk russia 
 that object was about nineteen meters across or about as big as a convenience store 
 objects of this size hit the earth every fifty years or so
 sixty six million years ago a much larger object hit the earth causing a massive extinction seventy five percent of plant and animal species were lost including sadly the dinosaurs 
 that object was about ten kilometers across and ten kilometers is roughly the cruising altitude of a seven hundred and forty seven jet 
 so the next time you 're in an airplane snag a window seat look out and imagine a rock so enormous that resting
  on the ground it just grazes your wingtip 
 it 's so wide that it takes your plane one full minute to fly past it that 's the size of the asteroid that hit the earth 
 it has only been within my lifetime that asteroids have been considered a credible threat to our planet 
 and since then there 's been a focused effort underway to discover and catalog these objects 
 i am lucky enough to be part of this effort i 'm part of a team
  of scientists that use nasa 's neowise telescope 
 now neowise was not designed to find asteroids it was designed to orbit the earth and look far beyond our solar system to seek out the coldest stars and the most luminous galaxies and it did that very well for its designed lifetime of seven months  
 but today  six years later it 's still
  we 've repurposed it to discover and study asteroids and although it 's a wonderful little space robot these days it 's kind of like a used car 
 the cryogen that used to refrigerate its sensors is long gone so we joke that its  air conditioning is broken 
 it 's got nine hundred and twenty million miles on the odometer  
 but it still runs great and reliably takes a photograph of the sky every eleven seconds it 's taken twenty three photos since i began speaking to you 
 one of the reasons neowise is so
  valuable is that it sees the sky in the thermal infrared that means that instead of seeing the sunlight that asteroids reflect neowise sees the heat that they emit  this is a vital capability since some 
  asteroids are as dark as coal and can be difficult or impossible to spot with other telescopes  
 astronomers are using every technique at their disposal to discover and study
 and ten a historic milestone was reached the community together discovered over ninety percent of asteroids bigger than one kilometer across objects capable of massive destruction to earth  
 but the job 's not done yet an object one hundred and forty meters or bigger could decimate a medium sized country 
 we 've only found twenty five percent of those 
 we must keep searching the sky for near earth asteroids we are the only species able to understand calculus or build telescopes  
 we know how to find these objects this is our responsibility  
 if we found a hazardous asteroid with significant early warning we could nudge it out of the way  
 unlike earthquakes hurricanes or volcanic eruptions an asteroid impact can be precisely predicted and prevented 
 what we need to do now is map
  near earth space  we must keep searching the sky thank you
