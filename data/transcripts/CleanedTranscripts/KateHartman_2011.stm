  i like to make devices that play with the ways that we relate and communicate  
 so i 'm specifically interested in how we as humans relate to ourselves  each other
  and the world around us 
 so just to give you a bit of context as june said i 'm an artist a technologist and an educator  i teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics and much of what i do is either
  wearable or somehow related to the human form  and so anytime i talk about what i do i like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter  
 and it 's pretty simple  
 everybody 's got one
 all of you i can guarantee  everyone in this room all of you over there the people in the cushy seats the people up top with the laptops we all have bodies 
 don 't be ashamed  it 's something that
  we have in common and they act as our primary interfaces for the world  and so when working as an interaction designer or as an artist who deals with participation
 creating things that live on in or around the human form it 's really a powerful space to work within 
 so within my own work i use a broad range of
  so i communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing 
 and to tell you a bit about the things that i make the easiest place to start the story is with
 a hat  
 and so it all started several years ago late one night when i was sitting on the subway riding home  and i was thinking  
 and i tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little and so i was thinking about
  how it might be great if i could just take all these noises like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head if i could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that i could share them with somebody else  
 and so i went home and i made a prototype of this hat  
 and i called it the muttering hat because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you but you could detach them and share them with somebody else
  so i make other hats as well this one is called the talk to yourself hat it 's fairly 
  it physically carves out conversation space for one and when you speak out loud the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears
  so when i make these things it 's really not so much about the object itself but rather the negative space around the object so what happens when a person puts this thing on 
  what kind of an experience do they have and how are they transformed by wearing it 
 so many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves so this this particular device is called the gut listener
  listener  and it is a tool that actually enables one to
 listen to their own innards 
 and so some of these things are actually more geared toward expression and communication and so the inflatable heart is an external organ that
 can be used by the wearer to express themselves so they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions so they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst 
 and some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences so the discommunicator is a tool for arguments
 actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered 
 and in the end some of these things just act as invitations  so the ear bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say
  so even though i 'm really interested in the relationship between people i also consider the ways in which we relate to the world around us  and so when i was first living in new york city a few years back i was thinking a lot about
 the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how i would like to better relate to them 
 and i thought well hey  maybe if i want to better relate to walls  maybe i need to be more wall like myself so i made a wearable wall
 that i could wear as a backpack and
 so i would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that i could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me 
 and so so jumping off of that 
 thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world  i have this ongoing project called botanicalls which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols
 so when a plant is thirsty it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like twitter  
 and so this really shifts the human plant dynamic  because
 a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time  
 and so kind of thinking about scale my most recent obsession is actually with
 of course  and so
 glaciers are these magnificent beings and there 's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them but what i 'm particularly interested in is in human glacier relations 
 because there seems to be an issue 
 the glaciers are actually leaving us  they 're both shrinking and retreating and some of them have disappeared altogether  and so i actually live in canada
  now so i 've been visiting one of my local glaciers and
 this one 's particularly interesting because of all the glaciers in north america it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year 
 they actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier and this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter 
 when i meet a glacier for the very first time 
 what do i do
 there 's no kind of social protocol for this  i really just don 't even know how to say hello do i
 carve a message in the snow or perhaps i can assemble one out of dot and dash ice cubes
 ice cube morse code or perhaps i need to make myself a speaking tool like an icy megaphone that i can use to amplify my voice when i direct it at the ice
 but really the most satisfying experience i 've had is the act of listening which is what we need in any good relationship and i was really struck by how much it affected me this very basic shift in my physical orientation
 helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier and so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world
 these days  i actually made a device called the glacier embracing suit
 and so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice 
 once again it 's this invitation that
 asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug 
  this is actually just the beginning these are initial musings for this project and just as with the wall how i wanted to be more wall like with this project i 'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace  
 and so my intent is to
 actually just take the next ten years and
 go on a series of collaborative projects where i work with people from different disciplines artists technologists scientists to kind of work on this project of how we can improve
  so beyond that in closing 
 i 'd just like to say that we 're in this era of communications and device proliferation and it 's really tremendous and exciting and sexy
  but i think what 's really important is thinking about how we can can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world
