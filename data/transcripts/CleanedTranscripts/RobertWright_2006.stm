  i 've got apparently eighteen minutes
 to convince you that history has a direction an arrow that in some fundamental sense it 's good that the arrow points to something positive
  now  when the ted
 before the avian flu had reached europe it was before hamas had won the palestinian election eliciting various counter measures by israel 
 and to be honest if i had known
 when i was asked to give this upbeat talk that even as i was giving the upbeat talk 
  but i didn 't ok so we 're here i 'll do what i can i 'll do what i can i 've got to warn you the sense in which
 my worldview is
 upbeat has always been kind of subtle sometimes even elusive the
 sense in which i can be uplifting and inspiring i mean
  a kind of a certain grim dimension to the way i i try to uplift so
 if grim inspiration 
  the most you can hope for ok  today that 's that 's if i succeed i 'll see what i can do ok 
 now  in one sense the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial if you 're just talking about social structure
  ok clearly that 's gotten more complex a little over the last ten thousand years has reached higher and higher levels
 and in fact that 's actually sustaining a long standing trend that predates human beings  
 ok  that biological evolution was doing for us because what happened in the beginning this stuff encases itself in a cell 
 then cells start hanging out together in societies eventually they get so close they form multicellular organisms
 then you get complex multicellular organisms they form societies  
 but then at some point one of these multicellular organisms does something completely amazing with this stuff which is it launches a whole second kind of evolution cultural evolution
 and amazingly that evolution sustains the trajectory that biological evolution had established toward greater complexity
  evolution we mean the evolution of ideas a lot of you have heard the term memes 
 the evolution of technology i pay a lot of attention to so you know one of the first things you got was a little hand axe generations go by somebody says hey why don 't we put 
  it on a stick 
 just absolutely delights the little ones  next best thing to a video game
  this may not seem to impress but technological evolution is progressive so another another ten twenty thousand years and armaments technology takes you here 
 laughter impressive and the rate of of technological evolution evolution speeds up so a mere quarter of a century after this you get this 
 ok 
 and this 
  i 'm sorry it was a cheap laugh but i wanted to find a way to transition back to this idea of the unfolding apocalypse and i thought 
 so what
 threatens to happen with this unfolding apocalypse is the collapse of global social organization  
 now first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are to be on the brink of true global
  social organization  originally you had the most complex societies the hunter gatherer village
 stonehenge is the remnant of a chiefdom which is what you get with the invention of agriculture multi village polity with centralized rule 
 with the invention of writing you start getting cities this is blurry  i kind of like that because it makes it look like a one celled organism and reminds you how many levels organic
 organization has already moved through to get to this point  and then you get to you know you get empires
 i want to stress  you know  social organization can transcend political bounds this is the silk road connecting the chinese empire and the roman empire so you had social 
  complexity spanning the whole continent even if no polity did similarly today you 've got nation states point is there 's
  collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds this is actually just a picture of the earth at night  and i 'm just
 putting it up because i think it 's pretty does kind of convey the sense that
 this is an integrated system  now  i explained this growth of complexity by reference
  assuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading very quickly  
 the key idea is the distinction between zero sum games in which correlations are inverse always a winner and a loser non zero sum games
 in which correlations
 can be positive ok so like in tennis  usually it 's win lose it always
  if you 're playing doubles the person on your side of the net they 're in the same boat as you so you 're playing a non zero sum game with them it 's either for the better or for the worse ok a lot of forms of 
 behavior in the realm of economics and so on in everyday life
 often leads to cooperation the argument i make is basically that well non zero sum games have always been part of life you have them in hunter gatherer societies  
 but then through technological evolution new forms of
 technology arise
  arise that facilitate or encourage the playing of 
  games involving more people
 over larger territory social structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and to harness this productive potential so you get cities  you know and you get all the non zero sum games you don 't think about that are being played across the world like have you ever thought
 when you buy a car how many people on how many different continents contributed to the
  the manufacture of that car those are people in effect you 're playing a non zero sum game with i mean there are certainly
 plenty of them around now  
 this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way because when you think of non zero you think win win you know  that 's good well
  that actually it 's not intrinsically upbeat first of all it can accommodate it doesn 't deny the the existence of of inequality exploitation war but there 's a more fundamental reason that it 's not intrinsically upbeat because
 a non zero sum game all it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse it doesn 't necessarily predict a win win outcome 
  in a way  the question is on what grounds
 am i upbeat at all about history and the answer is first of all on balance i would say people have played their games to more win win outcomes than
  lose lose outcomes on balance i think history is a net positive in the non zero sum game department
  most amazes me most impresses me and most uplifts me which is that
 there is a moral dimension to history there is a moral arrow we have seen moral progress over time two thousand five hundred years ago 
 members of one greek city state considered members of another greek city state subhuman
 and treated them that way  and then this this moral revolution arrived and they decided that actually
  greeks are human beings  it 's just the persians who aren 't fully human and don 't deserve to be treated very nicely  but this was progress you know give them credit and now today we 've seen 
  more progress i think i hope most people here would say that all people everywhere are human beings deserve to be treated decently
  years ago  and i attribute it to this 
 dynamic  i think that 's the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities ethnicities religions as there is today 
 if you asked me you know why am i not in favor of bombing japan well i 'm only half joking when i say they built my car we have this non zero sum relationship  and i think that does lead to
 a kind of a tolerance to the extent that
  you realize that someone else 's welfare is positively correlated with yours you 're more likely to cut them a break  i kind of think this is
 this is a kind of a business class morality  
 unfortunately i don 't fly trans atlantic business class often enough to know or any other kind of business class really  
 but i assume that in business class you don 't hear many expressions of you know bigotry about racial groups
  or ethnic groups because the people who are flying trans atlantic business class are doing business with all these people they 're making money off all these people and i i really do think that in that sense at least 
 capitalism has been a constructive force and more fundamentally it 's a non zero sumness that has been a constructive force
 in expanding people 's realm of moral awareness
  not only economic by any means it 's not always commerce but but it has driven us to the verge of a moral truth  which is the fundamental
 equality of everyone it has done that as it has moved global 
 moved us toward a global level of social organization it has driven us toward moral truth  i think that 's wonderful
  the unfolding apocalypse and you may wonder ok  that 's all fine sounds great moral direction in history but but what about this so called clash of civilizations  
 well  
 first of all 
 i would emphasize that it fits into the non zero sum framework ok  
 if you look at the relationship between the so called muslim world and western world two terms i don 't like but can 't really avoid
 in such a short span of time
  they 're efficient if nothing else it 
  and by that i mean if people in the muslim world get more hateful more resentful 
 less happy with their place in the world it 'll be bad for the west if they get more happy it 'll be good for the west so that 
 dynamic  and i would say the non zero sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends
 but more intense in a kind of negative way it 's the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more
 possible 
 and one reason is because of something i call the growing lethality of hatred more and more it 's possible for grassroots hatred abroad to manifest itself in the form of organized
  american soil and that 's pretty new  and i think it 's probably going to get a lot worse 
  trends in information technology in technologies that can be used for purposes of munitions like biotechnology
 and
 nanotechnology we may be hearing more about that today  and there 's something i worry about especially which is that that this dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope
  i have in mind is terrorism happens here we overreact to it
 that  you know  we 're not sufficiently surgical in our retaliation leads to more hatred abroad more terrorism we overreact because being human we feel like retaliating  
 and it gets worse and worse and worse you could call this the positive feedback of negative vibes  but i think in something
  we really shouldn 't have the word positive there at all even in a technical sense so let 's call it the death spiral of negativity 
 i assure you if it happens at the end both the west and the muslim world
 will have suffered   so  
 what do we do well  first of all we can do a lot more with arms control the international regulation of dangerous technologies i have a whole global governance sermon that i will spare you right
  because i don 't think that 's going to be enough anyway although it 's essential  
 i think we 're going to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world i think you 're just going to have to see less hatred among groups less bigotry
  and you know  
 racial groups religious groups whatever  i 've got to admit i feel silly saying that it sounds so kind of pollyannaish i feel like rodney king you know saying why can 't we all just get
  i don 't really see any alternative given the way i read the situation 
 there 's going to have to be moral progress there 's going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world
  given how dangerous it 's becoming  
 in my defense i 'd say as naive as this may sound  it 's ultimately grounded in cynicism
  of morality is that it boils down to self interest it 's when people 's fortunes are correlated it 's when your welfare conduces to mine that i decide oh yeah i 'm all in favor of your welfare that 's what 's responsible for this growth of
 this moral progress so far  and i 'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes and if people respond to it intelligently  we will see the development of tolerance
 and so on the norms that we need you know we will see the further evolution of this kind of 
 morality so these two things you know if they get people 's attention
 and drive home the positive correlation and people do what 's in their self interests which is further the moral evolution then they could actually have a constructive
  i lump growing lethality of hatred and death spiral of negativity under the general rubric reasons to be cheerful 
 doing the best i can ok  i never called myself mr uplift i 'm just
 doing what i can here now  launching a moral
  revolution has got to be hard right i mean what do you do  and i think the answer is a lot of different people are going to have to do a lot of different things
  we all start where we are 
 speaking as an american who has children whose security ten twenty thirty years down the road i worry about what i personally want to start out doing is figuring out why so many people around the world hate us  ok  i think that 's a
  i also like it because it 's an intrinsically kind of morally redeeming exercise   because to understand why somebody in a very different culture does something somebody you 're kind of viewing 
  as alien  who 's doing things you consider strange in a culture you consider strange to really understand
  get it so when they feel resentful it 's kind of like the way i feel resentful when this happens and for somewhat the same reasons that 's true understanding  
 and i think that is an expansion of your of your moral compass when you manage to do that it 's especially hard to do when people hate you 
 ok  because you don 't really in a sense want to
  i can kind of understand how a human being in those circumstances would hate the country i live in that 's not a pleasant thing but i think it 's something that we 're going to have to
  know there are people who don 't like this whole business of understanding the grassroots  the root causes of things 
  they don 't want to know why people hate us  i want to understand it the reason you 're trying to understand why they hate us is to get them to quit hating us 
 the idea when you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate their
  humanity and better understand them
 is part of an effort to get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run i think it 's the first step toward that that 's the long term goal 
 there are people who worry about this
 and in fact i myself apparently was denounced on national tv a couple of nights ago
 because of an op ed i 'd written it was kind of along these lines
  and the allegation was that i have quote affection for terrorists now the good news is that the person who said it was ann coulter i mean  
 if you 've got to have an enemy do make it ann coulter 
 but it 's not a crazy concern  ok  because understanding behavior can lead to a kind of empathy and it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love and so on but i think we
  lot closer to erring
 on the side of not comprehending the situation clearly enough  than in comprehending it so clearly that we just can 't you know get the army out to kill terrorists  so i 'm not really worried about it
  will have forced us to a higher moral level
 and a kind of saving
 higher moral level something that kind of literally saves the world if you look at the word salvation in the bible
 the christian usage that we 're familiar with saving souls that people go to heaven that 's actually a latecomer the original meaning
 of the word salvation in the bible is about saving the social system 
 yahweh is our savior means he has saved the nation of israel which at the time was a pretty high level social organization
