  i moved to northern california and i lived in a little town called elk on the mendocino coast  
 and i didn 't have a phone or tv but i had u s mail  
 and life was good back then if you could remember it
  the general store for a cup of coffee
 and a brownie and i 'd ship my film to san francisco and lo and behold  two days later
  it would end up on my front door which was way better than having to fight the traffic of hollywood 
 i didn 't have much money  
 but i had time and a sense of wonder so i started shooting
  photography  it would take me a month to shoot a four minute roll of film because that 's all i could afford 
 i 've been shooting time lapse flowers continuously 
  hours a day seven days a week for over thirty years  and to see them move is a dance i 'll never get tired of 
  it also provides a third of the food we eat 
 beauty and seduction
 is nature 's tools for survival  because we protect what we fall in love with it opens our hearts and makes us realize we are a part of nature
 and we 're not separate from it when we see ourselves in nature  it also connects us
 to every one
  because it 's clear that it 's all connected in one when
 people see my images a lot of times they 'll say oh my god have you ever wondered what that meant the 
 oh means it caught your attention makes you present makes you mindful 
 the my means it connects with
  deep inside your soul it
 creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard and god 
 god is that personal journey we all want to be on to be inspired 
 to feel like we 're connected to a universe that celebrates life  
 did you know that eighty percent of the information we receive comes through our
  if you compare light energy to musical scales  it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see which is right in the middle
  and aren 't we grateful for our brains that can you
 know take this electrical impulse that comes from light energy to create images in order for us to explore our world
 and aren 't we grateful that we have hearts that can feel these vibrations
 in order for us to allow ourselves to feel the pleasure and the beauty of nature
 nature 's beauty is a gift that cultivates
 appreciation and gratitude music
 so i have a gift i want to share with you today a project i 'm working on called happiness revealed
  'll give us a glimpse into that perspective from the point of view of a child and an elderly man of that world child
 when i watch tv 
 it 's just some shows that you just that are pretend
  and when you explore you get
 more imagination than you already had
 when you get more imagination  it makes you want to go deeper
  can get more and see beautifuller things
  this is just another day in your life it
 's not just another day it 's the
 one day that is given to you today  
 it 's given to you it 's a gift 
 it 's the only gift that you have right now  and the only
  appropriate response is gratefulness  
 if you do nothing else but to cultivate
 that response
 to the great gift that this unique day is
  to respond
 as if it were the first day in your life
 and the very last day then
 you will have spent this day very well 
 begin by opening your eyes and be surprised that you have eyes you can open
 array of colors that is constantly offered to us for pure enjoyment
 look at the sky 
 we so rarely look at the sky we
 so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment with clouds coming
  just think of the weather and even with the weather we don 't think of all the many nuances of weather we just think of
 good weather and bad weather 
 this day right now has unique weather  maybe a kind that will never
  sky will never be the same as it is right now 
 open your eyes look at that 
 look at the faces of people whom you meet  
 each one has an
 incredible story
  story that you
 could never fully fathom not only their own story but the story of their ancestors
  places all over the world flows together and meets you
  gives to us you flip a switch and
  number of gifts to which we can open your heart and
 so i
 wish you that you will open your heart to all these blessings and let them flow through
 you that everyone whom you will meet on this day
 will be blessed by
  just by your presence 
 let the gratefulness overflow into blessing all
 a good day
