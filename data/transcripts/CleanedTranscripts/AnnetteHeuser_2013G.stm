  almost two years ago  i was driving in my car in germany  and i turned on the radio  
 europe at the time was in the middle of the euro crisis  and all the headlines were about european countries
 getting downgraded by rating agencies
 in the united states i listened and thought to myself what are these rating agencies  and why is everybody so upset about their work 
 well  if you were sitting next to me in the car that day and would have told me that i would devote the next years to trying to reform them 
 obviously i would have called you crazy  but guess what 's really crazy
 the way these rating agencies are run  and i would like to explain to you not only why it 's time to change this but also how we can do it 
 so let me tell you a little bit about what rating agencies really do 
 as you would read a car magazine before purchasing a new car or taking a look at a product review before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get
  investors are reading ratings before they decide in which kind of product they are investing their money 
 a rating can range from a so called aaa which means it 's a top performing product  and it can go down to the level of the 
 which means it 's a fairly risky investment rating agencies are rating
  companies they are rating banks they are rating even financial products like the infamous  mortgage backed securities  
 but they can also rate countries 
 and these ratings are called sovereign ratings  and i would like to focus in particular on these sovereign ratings  
 and i can tell as you 're listening to me right now you 're thinking so why should i really care about this right be honest
  well  ratings affect you they affect all of us 
 if a rating agency rates a country it basically assesses and evaluates a country 's debt
 and the ability and willingness of a country to repay its debt so if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency
  the country has to pay more in order to borrow money on the international markets so it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer because you and your fellow countrymen have to pony up more in order to borrow  
 but what if a country can 't afford to pay more because it 's maybe too expensive  
 well  then the country has less available for other services like roads schools
  and this is the reason why you should care 
 because sovereign ratings affect everyone and that is the reason why i believe they should be defined as public goods  they should be transparent  accessible 
 and available to everyone at no cost  
 but here 's the situation  the rating agency market is dominated by three players and three players
  and fitch
 and we know whenever there is a market concentration there is really no competition  there is no incentive
 to improve the quality of your product  
 and let 's face it the credit rating agencies have contributed  
 putting the global economy on the brink and yet they have to change the way they operate  
 the second
  you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer 
 obviously not right that would be irresponsible  but that 's actually what 's going on in the rating agency sector every single day  
 the customers of these rating agencies like countries or companies  
 they are paying for their own ratings  and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest  
 the third point is
 the rating agencies are not really telling us how they are coming up with their ratings 
 but in this day and age you can 't even sell a candy bar without listing everything that 's inside  
 but for ratings a crucial element of our economy 
 we really do not know what all the different
  we are allowing the rating agencies to be intransparent about their work  and we need to change this 
 i think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul not just a trimming at the margins 
 i think it 's time for a bold move i think it 's time to upgrade the system  
 and this is why we at the bertelsmann foundation have invested a lot of time and effort
  thinking about an alternative for the sector  
 and we have developed the first model for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk  
 and we call it by its acronym incra
 incra would make a difference to the current system
 by adding another nonprofit player to the mix it would be based on a nonprofit model
 that would be based on a sustainable
  endowment the endowment would create income that would allow us to run the operation to run the rating agency  and it would also allow us to make our ratings publicly available 
 but this is not enough to make a difference right 
 incra would also be based on a very very clear governance structure that would avoid any conflict of interest  and it would include
 many stakeholders from society 
 incra would not only be a european or an american rating agency it would be a truly international one in which in particular the emerging economies 
 would have an equal interest voice and representation  
 on a broader set of indicators 
 think about it that way  if we conduct a sovereign rating we basically take a look at the economic soil of a country 
 its macroeconomic fundamentals  but we also have to ask the question  who is cultivating the economic soil of a country right 
  a country has many gardeners and one of them is the government so we have to ask the question how is a country governed how is it managed  
 and this is the reason why we have developed what we call forward looking indicators 
 these are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country  
 i hope you would agree it 's important for you to know if your government
  important for you to know
 if the government of your country is able to manage a crisis  if the government is finally able to implement the reforms that it 's promised 
 for example if incra would rate south africa right now 
 of course we would take a very very close look at the youth unemployment of the country the highest in the world
  if over seventy percent of a country 's population under the age of thirty five
 is unemployed of course this has a huge impact on the economy today and even more so in the future 
 well our friends at moody 's standard & poor 's and fitch will tell us we would take this into account as well  but guess what we do not know
  how they will take this into account  and this leads me to the third big difference that incra would make
 incra would not only release its ratings but it would also release its indicators and methodology  so in contrast to the current system 
 incra would be fully transparent  
 so in a nutshell incra would offer an alternative to the current
  system of the big three rating agencies
 by adding a new nonprofit player to the mix that would increase the competition 
 it would increase the transparency of the sector  and it would also increase the quality 
 i can tell that sovereign ratings may still look to you like this very small piece of this very complex global financial world  
 but i tell you it 's
  a very important one and a very important one to fix  because sovereign ratings affect all of us 
 and they should be addressed and should be defined
 as public goods  and this is why we are testing our model right now and why we are trying to find out if it can bring together a group of able and
 willing actors to bring incra to life 
 i truly believe building up incra is in everyone 's interest  and that we have the unique opportunity right now
 to turn incra into a cornerstone of a new more inclusive financial system  
 because for way too long we have left the big financial players on their own 
 it 's time to give them some company  thank you
