  it 's a story that 's deeply unsettled millions in china  
 footage of a two year old girl hit by a van and left bleeding in the street by passersby  footage too graphic to be shown
 the entire accident is caught on camera  
 the driver pauses after hitting the child  his back wheels seen resting on her for over a second 
 within two minutes three people pass two year old wang yue by 
 the first walks around the badly injured toddler completely  others look at her before moving
  there were other people who walked past wang yue and a second van ran over her legs before a street cleaner raised the alarm 
 she was rushed to hospital but it was too late  she died 
 i wonder how many of you looking at that said to yourselves just now i would not have done that 
 i would have stopped to help raise your hands if that thought occurred to you
 as i thought that 's most of you  
 and i believe you i 'm sure you 're right  but before you give yourself too much credit look at this  
 unicef reports that in two thousand and eleven  
 six point nine million children under five died from preventable
  thinks that that 's good news because the figure has been steadily coming down from twelve million in one thousand nine hundred and ninety  that is good 
 but still  six point nine million
 is nineteen thousand children dying every day  does it really matter
 that we 're not walking past them in the street does it really matter that
  that they 're far away  
 i don 't think it does make a morally relevant difference  
 the fact that they 're not right in front of us the fact of course that they 're of a different nationality or race  none of that seems morally relevant to me 
 what is really important is can we
 reduce that death toll can we save some of those nineteen thousand children dying every day
 and the answer is yes we can each of us
 spends money on things that we do not really need  you can think what your own habit is whether it 's a new car a vacation or just something
 like buying bottled water when the water that comes out of the tap is perfectly safe to drink
  you could take the money you 're spending on those unnecessary things and give it to this organization the against malaria foundation 
 which would take the money you had given
 and use it to buy nets like this one
 to protect children like this one  and we know reliably that if we provide nets they 're used
  and they reduce the number of children
 dying from malaria just one of the many preventable diseases that are responsible for some of those nineteen thousand children
 dying
 every day  
 fortunately more and more people are understanding this idea  
 and the result is a growing movement effective altruism 
 it 's important because it combines both the heart and the head
  the heart of course you felt  you felt the empathy for that child  but it 's really important to use the head as well
 to make sure that what you do is effective and well directed and not only that but also i think reason helps us
 to understand that other
  wherever they are are like us that they can suffer as we can that parents grieve for the deaths of their children as we do  
 and that just as our lives and our well being matter to us  it matters just as much to all of these people  
 so i think reason is not just some neutral tool to help you get whatever you want it does help us to put perspective on our
  and i think that 's why many of the most significant people in effective altruism
 have been people who have had backgrounds in philosophy
 or economics or math
  and that might seem surprising because a lot of people think philosophy is remote from the real world 
 economics we 're told just makes us more
  and we know that math is for nerds 
 but in fact it does make a difference and in fact there 's one particular nerd who has been a particularly effective
 altruist because he got this 
 this is the website of the bill & melinda gates foundation and if you look at the words on the top right hand side it says all lives have equal
  that 's the understanding the rational understanding of our situation in the world that has led to these people
 being the most effective altruists in history  
 bill and melinda gates and warren buffett 
 no one not andrew carnegie
  not john d rockefeller has ever given as much to charity
 as each one of these three  
 and they have used their intelligence to make sure that it is highly effective 
 according to one estimate the gates foundation has already saved five point eight million lives
 and many millions more people getting diseases that would
  made them very sick even if eventually they survived 
 over the coming years  undoubtably the gates foundation is going to give a lot more is going to save a lot more lives well
 you might say that 's fine if you 're a billionaire  you can have that kind of impact  
 but if i 'm not what can i do  so i 'm going to look at four questions that people ask that maybe stand in the way of them giving
  they worry how much of a difference they can make  but you don 't have to be a billionaire  
 this is toby ord he 's a research fellow in philosophy at the university of oxford 
 he became an effective altruist when he calculated that with the money that he was likely to earn throughout his career an academic career  he could give enough
 to cure eighty thousand people
  people of blindness in developing countries
 and still
 have enough left for a perfectly adequate
 standard of living  so toby founded an organization called giving what we can
 to spread this information to unite people who want to share some of their
  and to ask people to pledge to give ten percent of what they earn over their lifetime to fighting global poverty  
 toby himself does better than that he 's pledged to live on eighteen thousand pounds a year that 's less than thirty thousand dollars
 and to give the rest to those organizations  and yes  toby is married and he does have a mortgage
  this is a couple at a later stage of life  
 charlie bresler and diana schott who when they were young when they met were activists against the vietnam war  
 fought for social justice  
 and then moved into careers as most people do didn 't really do anything very active about those values although they didn 't abandon them  
 and then as they got to the age at which many people start to think of retirement 
 they returned to
  them  and they 've decided to cut back on their spending to live modestly  and to give both money and time
 to helping to fight global poverty 
 now  mentioning time might lead you to think well  should i abandon my career and put all of my time into saving some of these nineteen thousand lives that are lost every day
 one person who 's thought quite a bit about this issue of how you can have a career that will have the biggest impact for good in the world is will crouch 
 he 's a graduate student in philosophy 
 and he 's set up a website
 called eighty thousand hours the number of hours he estimates most people spend on their career to advise people on how to have the best most effective career
  but you might be surprised to know that one of the careers that he encourages people to consider if they have the right abilities and character is
 to go into banking or finance 
 why because if you earn a lot of money you can give away a lot of money and if you 're successful in that career
  you could give enough to an aid organization
 so that it could employ  let 's say five
 aid workers
 in developing countries and each one of them would probably do about as much good as you would have done  so you can quintuple
 the impact by leading that kind of career  
 here 's one young man who 's taken this advice  his name is matt
  he was a student
 at princeton in philosophy and math  actually won the prize for the best undergraduate philosophy thesis last year when he graduated  
 but he 's gone into finance
 in new york he 's already earning enough so that he 's giving a six figure sum to effective charities and still leaving himself with enough to live on 
 matt has also helped me to set up an organization that i 'm working with that has the name taken
  from the title of a book i wrote the life you can save which is trying to change our culture so that
 more people think that if we 're going to live an ethical life it 's not enough just to follow the
 and not cheat steal maim kill  but that if we have enough we have to share some of that with people who have so little and the
  organization draws together people of different generations like holly morgan who 's an undergraduate who 's pledged to give ten percent of the little amount that she has 
 and on the right ada wan  who has worked directly for the poor  but has now gone to yale to do an mba to have more to give 
 many people will think though  
  really all that effective so let 's talk about effectiveness  toby ord is very concerned about this and
 he 's calculated that some charities are hundreds or even thousands of times more effective than others  so it 's very important to find the effective ones 
 take for example  providing a guide dog for a blind person 
 that 's a good thing to do right
  a good thing to do  but you have to think what else you could do with the resources  
 it costs about forty thousand dollars to train a guide dog and train the recipient so that the guide dog can be an effective help to a blind person  
 it costs somewhere between twenty and fifty dollars to cure a blind person in a developing country if they have trachoma  
  so you do the sums  and you get something like that you could provide one guide dog for one blind american 
 or you could cure between four hundred and two thousand people of blindness 
 i think it 's clear what 's the better thing to do  
 but if you want to look for effective charities 
 this is a good website to go to givewell exists to really assess the impact of charities not just whether they
 and it 's screened hundreds of charities
 and currently is recommending only three of which the against malaria foundation is number one  
 so it 's very tough if you want to look for other recommendations
 and giving what we can both have a somewhat broader list  but you can find effective
  and not just in the area of saving lives from
 the poor  i 'm pleased to say that there is now also a website looking at effective animal organizations  that 's another cause that i 've been concerned about all my life  
  the immense amount of suffering that humans inflict on literally tens of billions of animals every year  so if you want to look for effective organizations to reduce that suffering you can go to effective animal activism 
  effective altruists think it 's very important to make sure that our species survives at all so they 're looking at ways to reduce the risk of extinction  
 here 's one risk of extinction that we all became aware of recently when an asteroid passed close to our planet  
 possibly research could help us not only to predict the path of
  asteroids that might collide with us  but actually to deflect them  so some people think that would be a good thing to give to there 's many possibilities 
 my final question is some people will think it 's a burden to give  
 i don 't really believe it is i 've enjoyed giving all of my life since i was a graduate student it 's been something fulfilling to me  
 charlie bresler said to me that he 's not an altruist he thinks that the life he 's saving is his own  
 and holly morgan told me that she
 used to battle depression until she got involved with effective altruism  and now is one of the happiest people she knows 
 i think one of the reasons for this is that being an effective altruist helps to overcome what i call the sisyphus problem  
 here 's sisyphus as portrayed by titian  condemned by the gods to push a huge boulder up to the top of the hill just as he gets there  the effort
  becomes too much the boulder escapes rolls all the way down the hill he has to trudge back down to push it up again and the same thing happens again and again for all eternity 
 does that remind you of a consumer lifestyle  
 where you you work hard to get money you spend that money on consumer goods which you hope you 'll enjoy using  
 but then
  the money 's gone you have to work hard to get more spend more and to maintain the same level of happiness it 's kind of a hedonic treadmill you never get off  and you never really feel satisfied  
 becoming an effective altruist
 gives you that meaning and fulfillment  
 it enables you to have a solid basis for self esteem on which you can feel your life was really worth living  
 i 'm going to conclude
 by telling you about an email that i received
 while i was writing this this talk just a month or so ago it 's
 from a man named chris croy  who i 'd never heard of this is a picture of him
 showing him recovering from surgery  why was he recovering from surgery  the email began
  i anonymously donated my right kidney to a stranger  that started a kidney chain which enabled four people to receive kidneys 
 there 's about one hundred people each year in the u s and more in other countries who do that 
 i was pleased to read it chris went on to say that he 'd been influenced by my writings in what he did 
 well i have to admit i 'm also somewhat embarrassed by that because i still have two kidneys
 but chris went on to say that he didn 't think that what he 'd done was all that amazing  
 because he calculated that the number of life years that he had added to people the extension of life 
 was about the same that you could achieve if you gave five thousand dollars to the against malaria foundation 
 and that did make me feel a little
  bit better because i have given more than five thousand dollars to the against malaria foundation
 and to various other effective charities  
 so if you 're feeling bad because you still have two kidneys as well  there 's a way for you to get off the hook
