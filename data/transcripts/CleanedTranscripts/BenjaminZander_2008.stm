  probably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen who went down to africa in the 1900s they were sent down to find if there was any opportunity for selling shoes and they wrote telegrams back to manchester 
  and one of them wrote situation hopeless stop they don 't wear shoes and the other one wrote 
 glorious opportunity they don 't have any shoes yet 
 now there 's a similar situation in the classical music world  because there are some people who think that classical music is dying  
 and there are some of us who think you ain 't seen nothing yet  
 and rather than go into statistics and trends and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing
  the record companies that are folding i thought we should do an experiment tonight
  not really an experiment because i know the outcome but it 's like an experiment  now  before we start 
 before we start i need to do two things one is i
 want to remind you of what a  seven year old child sounds like when he plays the piano maybe you have this child at home he sounds something like this
  some of you recognize this child  now if he practices for a year and takes lessons he 's now eight and he sounds like this 
 he practices for another year and takes lessons he 's nine
  if you 'd waited for one more year you would have heard this
  what happened was not maybe what you thought which is he suddenly became passionate engaged involved got a new teacher he hit
 puberty  or whatever it is what actually happened was the impulses were reduced you see the first time  he was playing with an impulse on every note 
  can see it by looking at my head
  i 'm going to move my shoulder over move my body no the music pushed me over  which is why i call it one buttock 
 can be the other buttock 
 you know a gentleman was once watching
 a presentation i was doing when i was working with a young pianist he was the president of a corporation in ohio  i was working with this young pianist and said the trouble with you
  player  you should be a one buttock player i moved his body while he was playing and suddenly the music took off it took flight the audience gasped when they heard the difference  then i got a letter 
  from this gentleman he said i was so moved i went back and i transformed my entire company into a one buttock company 
 now the other thing i wanted to do is to tell you about you there are one thousand six hundred people i believe
  my estimation is that probably forty five of you are absolutely passionate about classical music you adore classical music your fm is always on 
  that classical dial  you have cds in your car and you go to the symphony your children are playing instruments you can 't imagine your life without classical music  
 you 've come home from a long day and you take a glass of wine and you put your feet up a little vivaldi in the background doesn 't do any harm  
 that 's the second group  now comes the third group  people who never listen to classical music it 's just simply not part of your life you might hear it like second hand smoke at the airport 
  when you come into the hall but otherwise you never hear it that 's probably the largest group and then there 's a very small group  these are the people who who think they 're  tone deaf
 amazing number of people think they 're tone deaf actually i hear a lot my husband is tone deaf 
 actually you cannot be tone deaf nobody is tone deaf if you were tone deaf you couldn 't change the gears on your car in a stick shift car  
 you couldn 't tell the difference between
 somebody from texas and somebody from rome  and the telephone
  the telephone if your mother calls on the miserable telephone  she calls and says hello you not only know who it is you know what mood she 's in
  you have a fantastic ear  everybody has a fantastic ear  so nobody is tone deaf but i tell you what it doesn 't work for me
 to go on with this thing with such a wide gulf between those who understand love and are passionate about classical music
  and those who have no relationship to it at all the tone deaf people they 're no longer here  but even between those three categories it 's too wide a gulf so i 'm not going to go on until 
 every single person in this room downstairs and in aspen and everybody else looking 
  that 's what we 're going to do now you notice that there is not the slightest doubt
 in my mind that this is going to work if you look at my face right 
 it 's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he 's leading to realize whatever he 's dreaming  
 imagine if martin luther king had said i have a dream of course i 'm not sure they 'll be up to it
  all right so i 'm going to take a piece of chopin this is a beautiful prelude by chopin some of you will know it
  piece is long and you 've had a long day you might
  drift off
 then your
 companion will dig you in the ribs and say wake up it 's culture and then you feel even worse 
 but has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you but because of us did anybody think while i was playing why is he using so many impulses if i 'd done this with my head you certainly
  the rest of your life every time you hear classical music you 'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses  
 so let 's see what 's really going on here we have a  b this is a  b 
 the next note is a  c and the job of the c is to make the b sad  and it does
  two notes 
 but basically it 's just a b with four sads 
 now it goes down to a now to  g and then to  f so we have b
  nobody is you know every village in bangladesh and every hamlet in china
  who 's expecting that e chopin didn 't want to reach the e there because what will have happened 
 it will be over like hamlet do you remember act one scene three he finds out his uncle killed his father he keeps on going up to his uncle and almost killing him  
 and then he backs away he goes up to him again almost kills him  the critics sitting in the back row there they have to have an opinion so they say hamlet is a procrastinator 
 or they say hamlet has an oedipus
  complex no otherwise the play would be over stupid 
 that 's why shakespeare puts all that stuff in hamlet ophelia going mad the play within the play and yorick 's skull and the gravediggers that 's in order to delay
 until act five he can kill him  it 's the same with the chopin he 's just about to reach the e
  finally he goes down to e but it 's the wrong chord because the chord he 's looking for is this one and
 instead he does now we call that a deceptive cadence  because it deceives us i tell my students if you have a deceptive
  it 's the wrong chord now he tries e again
  comes home after a long day  turns off the key in his car and says aah 
 i 'm home because we all know where home is  
 so this is a piece which goes from away to home i 'm going to play it all the way through and you 're going to follow b c b c b c b down to a down to g down to
 f almost goes to e but otherwise the play would be over he goes back up to b he gets very excited goes to f sharp goes to e it 's the wrong chord it 's the wrong chord
  and finally goes to e  and it 's home and what you 're going to see is 
 because for me to join the b to the e i have to stop thinking about every single note along the way and start thinking about the long long line
  you know we were just in south africa and you can 't go to south africa without thinking of mandela in jail for 
 what was he thinking about lunch no he was thinking about the vision
 for south africa and for human beings 
 this is about vision this is about the long line like the bird who flies over the field and doesn 't care about the fences
  so now you 're going to follow the line all the way from b to  e and i 've one last request before i play this piece all the way through 
 would you think of somebody who you adore 
 who 's no longer there 
 a beloved grandmother a lover somebody in your life who you love with all your heart 
 but that person is no longer with you 
 bring that
 person into your mind and at the same time follow the line all the way from b to e  and you 'll hear everything that chopin had to say
  thing
  you may be wondering why i 'm clapping well i did this at a school in boston with about seventy seventh graders  12 year olds i
  busy people involved in all sorts of different things listening understanding and being moved by a piece
  is something am i sure that every single person followed that understood it was moved by it of course i can 't be sure but i 'll tell you what happened to me in ireland
 during the troubles ten years ago  and i was working with some catholic and protestant kids
 on conflict resolution  and i did this with them a risky thing to do because they were street kids  and one of them came to me the next morning
  i 've never listened to classical music in my life but when you played that shopping piece 
 he said my brother was shot last year and i didn 't cry for him  
 but last night when you played that piece he was the one i was thinking about 
 and i felt the tears streaming down my face and it felt really good to cry for my brother so i made up my mind at that moment
  the music profession doesn 't see it that way they say three percent of the population likes classical music  if only we could move it to four percent our problems would be over 
 laughter how would you walk how would you talk how would you be
  three percent of the population likes classical music if only we could move it to four percent how would you walk or talk how would you be if you thought everybody loves classical music they just haven 't found out about it yet 
 see these are totally different worlds  
 now  i had an amazing experience i was forty five years old i 'd been conducting for twenty years  and i suddenly had a realization 
 the conductor of an orchestra doesn 't make a sound my picture appears on the front of the cd
 but the conductor doesn 't make a sound he depends for his power on his ability to make other people powerful  
 and that changed everything for me  it was totally life changing people in my orchestra said ben what happened that 's what happened i realized my job was to
  and of course i wanted to know whether i was doing that how do you find out you look at their eyes  if their eyes are shining  you know you 're doing it 
 you could light up a village with this guy 's eyes
  right so if the eyes are shining you know you 're doing it  if the eyes are not shining you get to ask a question  and this is the question who am i being
  that my players ' eyes are not shining  we can do that with our children too who am i being 
 that my children 's eyes are not shining  that 's a totally different world now we 're all about to end this magical
 on the mountain week we 're going back into the world  and i say  it 's appropriate for us to ask the question who are
 we being
 as we go back out
 into the world  
 and you know i have a definition of success for me it 's very simple it 's not about wealth and fame and power  it 's about how many shining eyes i have around me  
 so now  i have one last thought  which is that it really makes a difference what we say
 the words that come out of our mouth i learned this from a woman who survived auschwitz one of the rare survivors she went to auschwitz when she was fifteen years old
 and and
 her brother was eight and the parents were lost  and
 she told me this she said 
 we were in the train going to auschwitz  and i looked down and saw my brother 's shoes were missing  i said ' why are you
  can 't you keep your things together for goodness ' sake ' the way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother 
 unfortunately it was the last thing she ever said to him because she never saw him again  he did not survive 
 and so when she came out of auschwitz she made a vow she told me this she said i walked out of auschwitz into life
 and i made a vow  and the vow was i will never say anything that couldn 't stand as the last thing i ever say
 now  can we do that no and we 'll make ourselves wrong and others wrong  but it is a possibility to live into
