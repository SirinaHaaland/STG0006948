  years old and his career is just reaching its pinnacle he 's been christened the voice of a generation and he 's churning out classic
 classic songs at a seemingly impossible rate 
 but there 's a small minority of dissenters  and they claim that bob dylan is stealing other people 's songs 
 two thousand and four  brian burton  aka danger mouse  
 takes the beatles ' white album combines it with jay z 's the black album to create the grey album the grey album becomes an immediate sensation online and the beatles ' record company sends out
  unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property 
 now the grey album is a remix it is new media created from old media it was made using these three techniques copy  
 transform and combine it 's how you remix you take existing songs 
 you chop them up you transform the pieces you combine them back together again and you 've got a new song but that new song is clearly comprised of old songs  
 but i think these aren 't just the
  components of remixing 
 i think these are the basic elements of all creativity  
 i think everything is a remix  and i think this is a better way to conceive of creativity all right
 let 's head back to one thousand nine hundred and sixty four and let 's hear where some of dylan 's early songs came from we 'll do some side by side comparisons here all right this first song you 're going to
  'll hear dylan 's masters of war
  so that 's the same basic melody and overall structure this next one  is the patriot game by dominic behan alongside that you 're going to hear with god on our side
  so in this case dylan admits he must have heard the patriot game he forgot about it then when the song kind of bubbled back up in his brain he just thought it was his song 
 last one this is who 's going to buy you ribbons another traditional folk tune  alongside that is don 't think twice it 's all right this one 's more about the lyric
  there 's a lot of these it 's been estimated that two thirds of the melodies dylan used in his early songs were borrowed this is pretty typical among folk singers  
 here 's the advice of dylan 's idol woody guthrie the worlds are the important thing don 't worry about tunes take a tune  sing high when they sing low 
 sing fast when they sing slow and you 've got a new tune applause
 and that 's that 's what guthrie did right here
  this case performed by the carter family guthrie adapted it into this land is your land 
 so bob dylan like all folk singers  he copied melodies he transformed
  he combined them with new lyrics which were frequently their own concoction of previous stuff
 now american copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others  instead these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property  
 now  creative works may indeed be kind of like property  but it 's property that we 're all building on and creations can only take root and grow
 once that ground has been prepared
  ford once said i invented nothing new i simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work 
 progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable 
 two thousand and seven  
 the iphone makes it debut apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early but its time was approaching because its core technology had been evolving for decades
 that 's multi touch controlling a device by touching its display 
 here is steve jobs introducing multi touch and making a rather foreboding joke steve jobs and we have invented a new technology called 
 you can do multi fingered gestures on it  and boy have we patented it
  earlier this is jeff han  and i mean that 's multi touch it 's the same animal at least let 's hear what jeff han has to say about this newfangled technology jeff han
 multi touch sensing isn 't anything isn 't completely new i mean people like bill buxton have been playing around with it in the ' 80s 
 the technology  you know isn 't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility
  so he 's pretty frank about it not being new  so it 's not multi touch as a whole that 's patented it 's the small parts of it that are and it 's in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent 
 to promote the progress of useful arts  
 here is the first ever
 that is all there is to it apple has patented this it 's a 28 page software patent but i will summarize what it covers spoiler alert 
 unlocking your phone by sliding an icon with your finger
 i 'm only exaggerating a little bit it 's a broad patent now can someone own this idea now
 back in the ' 80s there were no software patents  and it was xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface 
 what if they had patented pop up menus  scrollbars the desktop with icons that look like folders and sheets
  would a young and inexperienced apple have survived the legal assault from a much larger and more mature company like xerox now 
 this idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until you 're the one getting remixed 
 for example sj i mean picasso had a saying he said good artists copy  great artists steal and
  two thousand and ten i 'm going to destroy android because it 's a stolen product 
 i 'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this okay
 so in other words great artists steal  but not from me 
 now behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion we have a strong predisposition towards protecting what we feel is ours we have no such aversion towards copying what other people
  have because we do that nonstop 
 so here 's the sort of equation we 're looking at 
 we 've got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property  plus massive rewards or settlements in infringement cases  plus huge legal fees to protect yourself in court  plus cognitive 
  biases against perceived loss and the sum looks like this 
  is this promoting the progress of useful arts one thousand nine hundred
 bob dylan is forty two years old 
 and his time in the cultural spotlight is long since past  he records a song called blind willie mctell named after the blues singer and
 the song is a voyage through the past through a much darker time but a simpler one
  time when musicians like willie mctell had few illusions about what they did 
 i jump ' em from other writers but i arrange ' em my own way 
 i think this is mostly what we do our creativity comes from without not from within we are not self made we are dependent on one another 
 and admitting this to ourselves isn 't an embrace
  's a liberation from our misconceptions  and it 's an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves and to simply begin
