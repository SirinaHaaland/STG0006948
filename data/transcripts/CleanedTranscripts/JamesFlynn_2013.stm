  to take a quick voyage over the cognitive history of the 20th century 
 because during that century our minds have altered dramatically as you all know the cars
  nine hundred have altered because the roads are better and because of technology  
 and our minds have altered too we 've gone from people who confronted a concrete world
 and analyzed that world primarily in terms of how much it would benefit them
 to people who confront a very complex world 
 and it 's a world where we 've had to develop new mental habits new habits of mind  and these include things like
  clothing that concrete world with classification  
 introducing abstractions that we try to make logically consistent  
 and also taking the hypothetical seriously that is wondering about what might have been rather than what is 
 now this dramatic change was drawn to my attention
  gains over time 
 and these have been truly massive  
 that is we don 't just get a few more questions right on i q tests we get far more questions right on i q tests than each succeeding generation back to the time that they were invented 
 indeed if you score the people a century ago against modern
  they would have an average i q of seventy  if you score us against their norms  we would have an average i q of one hundred and thirty  
 now this has raised all sorts of questions were our immediate ancestors on the verge of mental retardation  
 because seventy is normally the score for mental retardation  or are we on the verge of all being gifted because one hundred and thirty is the cutting line for giftedness
  now i 'm going to try and argue for a third alternative that 's much more illuminating than either of those 
 and to put this into perspective let 's imagine that a martian came down to earth and found a ruined civilization 
 and this martian was an archaeologist and they found scores target scores that people had used for shooting  and first they looked
  and they found that in a minute people had only put one bullet in the bullseye  
 and then they found in one thousand eight hundred and ninety eight that they 'd put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute  
 and then about one thousand nine hundred and eighteen they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye  
 and initially  that archaeologist would be baffled  they would say look these tests were designed
  to find out how much people were steady of hand  
 how keen their eyesight was whether they had control of their weapon  
 how could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree 
 well we now know of course the answer if that martian looked at battlefields  
 they would find that people had only muskets at the time of the civil war
 and that they had repeating
  rifles at the time of the 
  war and then they had machine guns by the time of world war i 
 and in other words it was the equipment that was in the hands of the average soldier that was responsible not greater keenness of eye or steadiness of hand  
 now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery that we have picked up over those hundred years
  and i think again
 that another thinker will help us here and that 's luria 
 luria looked at people just before they entered the scientific age  
 and he found that these people were resistant to classifying the concrete world they wanted to break it up into little bits that they could use 
 he found that they were resistant to
  deducing the hypothetical to speculating about what might be  
 and he found finally that they didn 't deal well with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions  now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews 
 he talked to the head man of a person in rural russia  they 'd only
  about four years of schooling  and he asked that particular person what do crows and fish have in common  
 and the fellow said absolutely nothing you
 know i can eat a fish i can 't eat a crow 
 a crow can peck at a fish a fish can 't do anything to a crow and luria said but aren 't they both animals and he said of course
  the other is a bird and he was interested effectively in what he could do with those concrete objects  
 and then luria went to another person  
 and he said to them 
 there are no camels in germany  hamburg is a city in germany are there camels in hamburg 
 and the fellow said well if it 's large enough there ought to be camels there 
 and luria said
 what do my words imply and he said well maybe it 's a small village and there 's no room for camels 
 in other words he was unwilling to treat this as anything but a concrete problem  
 and he was used to camels being in villages and he was quite unable to use the hypothetical to ask himself what
  there were no camels in germany 
 a third interview was conducted with someone about the north pole 
 and luria said at the north pole there is always snow  
 wherever there is always snow the bears are white 
 what color are the bears at the north pole and the response was such a thing is to be settled by testimony 
  if a wise person came from the north pole and told me the bears were white i might believe him  but every bear that i have seen is a brown bear 
 now you see again this person has rejected going beyond the concrete world and analyzing it through everyday experience  and it was important 
  to that person what color bears were that is they had to hunt bears 
  that aren 't real problems none of these problems are real how can we address them 
 now these three categories classification  
 using logic on abstractions taking the hypothetical seriously
 how much difference do they make in the real world beyond the testing room and let me give you a few illustrations first
  all of us today get a high school diploma  that is we 've gone from four to eight years of education to twelve years of formal education and fifty two percent of americans have actually experienced some type of tertiary education 
 now not only do we have much more education and much of that education is scientific 
 and you can 't do science without classifying the world
  you can 't do science without proposing hypotheses  you can 't do science without making it logically consistent 
 and even down in grade school things have changed in one thousand 
 nine hundred and ten they looked at the examinations that the state of ohio gave to 
 and they found that they were all for socially valued concrete information they were things like
  what are the capitals of the 
  states that existed at that time 
 when they looked at the exams that the state of ohio gave in one thousand nine hundred and ninety ninety they were all about abstractions  they were things like  why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital 
 and you were supposed to
  the state legislature was 
 and they hated the big city  so rather than putting the capital in a big city they put it in a county seat they put it in albany rather than new york  
 they put it in harrisburg rather than philadelphia and so forth  
 so the tenor of education has changed we are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously to use abstractions and to link them logically 
 what about employment
  well in one thousand nine hundred three percent of americans practiced professions that were cognitively demanding 
 only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers  
 today thirty five percent of americans practice cognitively demanding professions 
 not only to the professions proper like lawyer or doctor or scientist or lecturer  but many many
  having to do with being a technician a computer programmer a whole range of professions now make cognitive demands  
 and we can only meet the terms of employment in the modern world by being cognitively far more flexible  
 and it 's not just that we have many more people in cognitively demanding professions the professions have been upgraded  compare the
  doctor in one thousand nine hundred who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve with the modern general practitioner or specialist with years of scientific training  
 compare the banker in one thousand nine hundred who really just needed a good accountant and to know who was trustworthy in the local community for paying back their mortgage 
  the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees may have been morally remiss but they were cognitively very agile
  they went far beyond that one thousand nine hundred banker they had to look at computer projections for the housing market  
 they had to get complicated
  cdo squared in order to bundle debt together and make debt look as if it
 were actually a profitable asset 
 they had to prepare a case to get rating agencies to give it a aaa though in many cases they had virtually bribed the rating agencies  
 and they also of course had to get people to accept these so called assets and pay money for them even though they were highly vulnerable 
 or take a farmer today i take the farm manager of today as very different from the farmer of
  so it hasn 't just been the spread of cognitively demanding professions it 's also been the upgrading of tasks like lawyer and doctor and what have you that have made demands on our cognitive faculties  
 but i 've talked about education and employment  some of the habits of mind that we have developed over the 20th century
 have paid off in unexpected areas i 'm primarily a moral philosopher i merely
  have a holiday in psychology and what interests me in general is moral debate 
 now over the last century in developed nations like america moral debate has escalated because we take the hypothetical seriously 
 and we also take universals seriously
  from university at the time of martin luther king 
 a lot of people came home at that time and started having arguments with their parents and grandparents my father was born in one thousand eight hundred and eighty five 
 and he was mildly racially biased as an irishman he hated the english so much he didn 't have much emotion for anyone
  he did have a sense that black people were inferior  
 and when we said to our parents and grandparents how would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black 
 they said that is the dumbest thing you 've ever said  
 who have you ever known who woke up in the morning 
 that turned
  they were fixed in the concrete mores and attitudes they had inherited  they would not take the hypothetical seriously 
 and without the hypothetical it 's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground
  you have to say imagine you were
 in
 iran and imagine that your relatives all suffered from collateral damage even though they had done no wrong how would you feel about
 and if someone of the older generation says well our government takes care of us and it 's up to their government to take care of them they 're just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously 
 or take an islamic father whose daughter has been raped  and he feels he 's honor bound to kill her 
 well he 's treating his mores as if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited
  and they 're unmovable in any way by logic they 're just inherited mores 
 today we would say something like well imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized would you deserve to be killed and he would say well that 's not in the koran 
 that 's not one of the principles i 've got well you today universalize your principles you state them as abstractions and you use
  logic on them  if you have a principle such as people shouldn 't suffer unless they 're guilty of something 
 then to exclude black people you 've got to make exceptions don 't you you have to say well blackness of skin  
 you couldn 't suffer just for that it must be that blacks are somehow tainted
  and then we can bring empirical evidence to bear can 't we and say well how can you consider all blacks tainted when st augustine was black and thomas sowell is black and you can get moral argument off the ground then 
 because you 're not treating moral principles as concrete entities you 're treating them as universals to be rendered consistent by logic  
 now how did all of this arise
  that 's what initially got me going on cognitive history  
 if you look at the i q test you find the gains have been greatest in certain areas  
 the similarities subtest of the wechsler is about classification  
 and we have made enormous gains on that classification subtest 
 there are other parts of the i q test battery that are about using logic on abstractions  some of you may have taken raven 's progressive
  matrices  and it 's all about analogies 
 and in one thousand nine hundred people could do simple analogies  that is  if you said to them  cats are like wildcats what are dogs like they would say wolves  
 but by one thousand nine hundred and sixty people could attack raven 's on a much more
  we 've got two squares followed by a triangle what follows two circles they could say a semicircle 
 just as a triangle is half of a square a semicircle is half of a circle 
 by two thousand and ten college graduates if you said two circles followed by a semicircle two sixteens followed by what
  they would say eight because eight is half of sixteen 
 that is they had moved so far from the concrete world that they could even ignore the appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question  
 now i should say one thing that 's very disheartening we haven 't made progress on all fronts 
 one of the ways in which we would like to deal with the sophistication of the modern world is through
  and sadly you can have humane moral principles you can classify  you can use logic on abstractions and if you 're ignorant of history and of other countries you can 't do politics 
 we 've noticed in a trend among young americans that they read less history and less literature and less material about foreign lands and they 're essentially ahistorical
  they live in the bubble of the present  they don 't know the korean war from the war in vietnam they don 't know who was an ally of america in world war ii 
 think how different america would be if every american knew that this is the fifth time western armies have gone to afghanistan to put its house in order  
 and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four previous occasions
  and that is  they had barely left and there wasn 't a trace in the sand 
 or imagine how different things would be if most americans knew that we had been lied into four of our last six wars  
 you know the spanish didn 't sink the battleship maine the lusitania was not an innocent vessel but was loaded with munitions 
 the north vietnamese did not attack the
  saddam hussein hated al qaeda and had nothing to do with it 
 and yet the administration convinced forty five percent of the people that they were brothers in arms when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost 
 but i don 't want to end on a pessimistic note the 20th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves in ordinary
 people that we have now realized 
 and the aristocracy was convinced that the average person couldn 't make it that they could never share their mindset or their cognitive abilities  lord 
  curzon once said he saw people bathing in the north sea and he said why did no one tell me what white bodies the lower orders
  the colonel 's lady and judy o 'grady are sisters underneath the skin
