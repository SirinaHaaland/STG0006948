  going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option  which would you  choose grilled or fried chicken 
 now most people would answer grilled and it 's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories  however grilled chicken poses a hidden danger 
 the hidden danger is heterocyclic amines specifically phenomethylimidazopyridine or
 laughter which is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound 
 a carcinogen is any substance or agent that causes abnormal growth of cells which can also cause them to metastasize or spread  
 they are also organic compounds in which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia is replaced with a more complex group 
 studies show that antioxidants are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines
  exist yet that show how or why 
 these here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens and as you can see  none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet now you might wonder 
  how a thirteen year old girl could come up with this idea and i was led to it through a series of events i first learned about it through a lawsuit i read about in my doctor 's office
  the physician 's committee for responsible medicine and seven different fast food restaurants they weren 't sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken  but they were sued because of california 's proposition sixty five
 which stated that if there 's anything dangerous in the products then the companies had to give a clear warning  
  and i noticed that the edges of the chicken  which had been marinated in lemon juice  turned white 
 and later in biology class i learned that it 's due to a process called denaturing  which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemically function 
 so i combined these two ideas and i formulated a hypothesis  saying that could possibly the carcinogens be
  and could it be due to the differences in ph 
 so my idea was born and i had the project set up and a hypothesis  so what was my next step well
 obviously i had to find a lab to work at because i didn 't have the equipment in my school   
 i thought this would be easy  but i emailed about two hundred different people within a five hour radius of where i lived  and i got one positive response that said that they could work with me 
 most of the others either never responded back  said they didn 't have the time or didn 't have the equipment and couldn 't help me
 it was a big commitment to drive
 to the lab to work multiple times however it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab so i could finally start my project 
 the first stage was completed at home  which consisted of marinating the chicken  grilling the chicken  amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab 
 the second stage was completed at the penn state university main campus lab  which is where i extracted the chemicals changed the ph so i could
  run it through the equipment and separated the compounds i needed from the rest of the chicken  
 the final stages when i ran the samples through a  high pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometer 
 which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals and told me exactly how much carcinogens i had in my chicken  
 so
  had very surprising results because i found that four out of the five marinating ingredients actually inhibited the carcinogen formation  when compared with the unmarinated chicken which is what i used as my control 
 i found that lemon juice worked by far the best  which decreased the carcinogens by about ninety eight percent 
 the saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade also worked very well decreasing the carcinogens by about sixty percent 
  but it was nearly negligible and the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens 
 another important factor that i didn 't take into account initially was the time cooked  and i found that if you increase the time cooked the amount of carcinogens
 rapidly increases so the best way to marinate chicken  based on this is to
  but definitely don 't over cook and char the chicken  and marinate in either lemon juice brown sugar or saltwater 
 based on these findings i have a question for you 
 would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet that could potentially save your life now i 'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that 's not marinated you 're definitely going to catch
  anything you can do to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle is it worth it to you how will you cook your chicken
 17 18 year old age category winner and then the grand prize winner and i want all of you to imagine a little girl holding a dead
 blue spinach plant and she 's standing in front of you and she 's explaining to you that little kids will eat their vegetables if they 're different colors
  sounds ridiculous
  but that was me years ago  and that was my first science fair
 project it got a bit more complicated from there my older brother panaki bose spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me when i barely understood basic algebra 
 my parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects including a remote controlled garbage can 
 and then came the summer after my freshman year when my grandfather passed away due to cancer and i
  remember watching my family go through that and thinking that i never wanted another family to feel that kind of loss 
 so armed with all the wisdom of freshman year biology  i decided
 i wanted to do cancer research
 at fifteen good plan  so i started emailing all of these professors in my area asking to work under their supervision in a lab got rejected
 by all except one and then went on my next summer to work under dr basu at the unt health center at fort worth texas  
 and that is where the research began 
 so ovarian cancer is one of those cancers that most people don 't know about or at least don 't pay that much attention to 
 but yet it 's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the united states
 in fact one in seventy women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer one in one hundred
 will die from it 
 chemotherapy one of the most effective ways used to treat cancer today  involves giving patients really high doses of chemicals to try and kill off cancer cells
  a relatively common ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug a relatively simple molecule made in
  lab that messes with the dna of cancer cells and causes them to kill themselves  sounds great right 
 but here 's the problem  sometimes patients become resistant to the drug  and then years after they 've been declared to be cancer free they come back  
 and this time they no longer respond to the drug  it 's a huge
  it 's one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today  
 so we wanted to figure out how these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant to this drug called cisplatin 
 and we wanted to figure this out because if we could figure that out then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening  
 so that 's what we set out to do and we thought it had something to do with this protein called amp kinase an energy protein 
  we ran all of these tests blocking the protein and we saw this huge shift i mean on the slide you can see that on our sensitive side these cells that are responding to the drug  
 when we start blocking the protein 
 the number of dying cells those colored dots they 're going down  
 but then on this side 
 with the same treatment they 're going up
 interesting but those are dots on a screen for you what exactly does that mean well basically that means that
  protein is changing from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell and in fact
 it might be changing the cells themselves to make the cells resistant  
 and that 's
 huge 
 in fact it means that if a patient comes in and they 're resistant to this drug  then if we give them a chemical to block this protein then we can treat them again
 with the same drug
  and that 's huge for chemotherapy effectiveness possibly for many different types of cancer  
 so that was my work and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research with figuring out exactly what this protein does 
 but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness so maybe all grandfathers
  with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren  but my work
 wasn 't just about the research it was about finding my passion 
 that 's why being the grand prize winner of the google global science fair
 cute picture right
 it was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor  
 and ever since then i 've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff from getting to meet the president to getting to be on this stage to talk to all of you guys
  but like i said my journey wasn 't just about the research it was about finding my passion  and
 it was about making my own opportunities when i didn 't even know what i was doing  it was about inspiration and determination and
 never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing after all my story
 begins with a dried  withered spinach plant and
  it 's only getting better from there thank you naomi
 hi everyone  i 'm naomi shah and today i 'll be talking to you about my research involving indoor air quality and asthmatic patients
  point six million deaths worldwide 
 one death every twenty seconds 
 people spend over ninety percent of their lives indoors  
 and the economic burden of asthma exceeds that of hiv and tuberculosis combined now these statistics had a huge impact on me 
 but what really sparked my interest in my research was watching both my dad and my brother suffer from chronic allergies
 it confused me why did these allergy symptoms persist well past the pollen season 
 with this question in mind i started researching and i soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit 
 as soon as i realized this i investigated the underlying relationship between four prevalent air pollutants
 and their affect on the lung health of asthmatic
  at first i just wanted to figure out which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients  
 but soon after i developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients 
 and it surprises me that no model currently exists that quantifies the effect of environmental factors on human lung health  because that relationship seems so important
 so with that in mind  i started researching more i started investigating more
 and i became very passionate because i i realized that if we could find a way to target remediation we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively 
 for example volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants
  that are found in our schools homes and workplaces they 're everywhere 
 these chemical pollutants are currently not a criteria air pollutant as defined by the u s clean air act  which is surprising to me 
 because these chemical pollutants through my research  i show that they had a very large negative impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients and thus should be regulated  
 so today i want to show you my interactive software model that i created
  in the audience today julie and
 all of julie 's data has been pre entered into my interactive software model and this can be used by anyone 
 so i want you to imagine that you 're in julie 's shoes or someone who 's really close to you who suffers from asthma or another lung disorder 
 so julie 's going to her doctor 's office to get treated for her asthma  
 and the doctor has her sit down and he takes her peak expiratory flow rate
 which is essentially her exhalation rate or the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath  
 so that peak expiratory flow rate i 've entered it up into the interactive software model i 've also entered in her age her gender and her height  i 've assumed that she lives in an average household with average air pollutant levels 
 so any user can come in here and click on lung function
  and it 'll take them to this report that i created  and this report really drives home the crux of my research  
 so what it shows if you want to focus on that top graph in the  right hand corner it shows julie 's actual peak expiratory flow rate in the yellow bar
 this is the measurement that she took in her doctor 's office 
 in the blue bar at the bottom of the graph it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate what her exhalation rate or lung health should be based on her age gender and height  
 so the doctor sees this difference between the yellow
  bar and the blue bar and he says wow we need to give her steroids medication and inhalers 
 but i want everyone here to reimagine a world where instead of prescribing steroids
 inhalers and medication the doctor turns to julie and says why don 't you go home and clean out your air filters clean out the air ducts in your home 
  in your workplace in your school  stop the use of incense and candles and if you 're remodeling your house take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring 
 because these solutions are natural these solutions are sustainable and these solutions are long term investments long term investments that we 're making for our generation 
  and for future generations  because these environmental solutions that julie can make in
  her workplace and her school are impacting everyone that lives around her  
 so i 'm very passionate about this research and i really want to continue it and expand it to more disorders besides asthma more respiratory disorders as well as more pollutants  
 but before i end my talk today i want to leave you with one saying and
 that saying is
 that genetics loads the gun but the environment pulls the trigger  
 and that made a huge impact on me when i was doing this research  because what i feel is a lot of us think that
  the environment is at a macro level that we can 't do anything to change our air quality or to change the climate or anything 
 but if each one of us takes initiative in our own home in our own school and in our own workplace we can make a huge difference in air quality because remember we spend ninety percent of our lives indoors  
 and air quality and air air pollutants have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic
  patients  anyone with a respiratory respiratory disorder and really all of us in general  
 so i want you to reimagine a world with better air quality better quality of life
 and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations  thank you
  lauren come up really quickly
