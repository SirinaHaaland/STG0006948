  that is hidden
 from us at least in modern
 cultures it would be to reveal something that we 've forgotten that we used to know
 as well as we knew our own names
  names  
 and that is that we live in a competent universe 
 that we are part of a brilliant planet and that we are surrounded
 by genius  biomimicry is a new discipline
 that tries to learn from those geniuses and take advice from them design advice that 's where i live
  and it 's my university as well i 'm surrounded by genius i cannot help but remember
 the organisms and the ecosystems that know how to live here gracefully on this planet  
 this is what i would tell you to remember if you ever forget this again remember this  this is what
  happens
 every year  this is what keeps its promise 
 while we 're doing bailouts  this is what happened spring  
 imagine designing spring  
 imagine that orchestration you think ted is hard to organize
  and if you haven 't done this in a while do imagine
 the timing the coordination all without top down laws or policies or climate change protocols  
 this happens every year  
 there is lots of
 showing off  there is lots of love in the air
  there 's lots of grand openings  
 and the organisms i promise you have all of their priorities in order 
 i have this neighbor that keeps me in touch with this because he 's living usually on his back looking up
 at those grasses  and one time he came up to me he was about seven or eight years old he came up to me and there was
  a wasp 's nest that i had let grow in my yard right outside my door 
 and most people knock them down when they 're small but it was fascinating to me because i was looking at this sort of fine italian end papers and
 he came up to me and he knocked he would come every day with something to show me and like knock like a woodpecker on my door until i opened it up and
 he asked me
  how i had made
 the house for those wasps 
 because he had never seen one this big  
 and i told him you know cody the wasps actually made that and we looked at it together  
 and i could see why he
  you know it was so beautifully done it was so architectural it was so precise  but it occurred to me how in his small life
 had he already
 believed the myth that if something was that
 well done that we must have done it how did he not know
 it 's what we 've all forgotten
  that we 're not the first ones to build
 we 're not the first ones to process cellulose we 're not the first ones to make paper we 're not the first ones to try to optimize packing space or to waterproof or to try to heat and cool
 a structure we 're not
 the first ones to build houses for our young what 's happening now in this field called
  is that people are beginning to remember
 that organisms  
 other organisms the rest of the natural world are doing things very similar to what we need to do 
 but in fact they are doing them in a way that have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet for billions
 of years  so
 these people biomimics are nature 's apprentices 
  and they 're focusing on function what i 'd like to do is show you a few of the things
 that they 're learning  
 they have asked themselves what if every time i started to invent something i asked ' how would nature solve this ' 
 and here is what they 're learning  this is an amazing picture from a czech photographer named jack hedley  this is a story about an engineer at j r west
  the people who make the bullet train it was called the bullet train because it was rounded in front  
 but every time it went into a tunnel it would build up a pressure wave and then it would create like a sonic boom when it exited  
 so the engineer 's boss said find a way to quiet this train 
 he happened to be a birder 
 he went to the equivalent of an audubon society meeting  and he studied there was a film about king fishers  and he thought to himself they go from one density of medium the air
  into another density of medium water  without a splash  look at this picture without a splash  so they can see the fish  and he thought what if
 we do this quieted the train made it go ten percent faster on fifteen percent less electricity  
 how does nature repel
  we 're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves
 from some bacteria  turns out that
 this is a galapagos shark  
 it has no bacteria on its surface no fouling on its surface no barnacles 
 and it 's not because it goes fast  it actually basks  it 's a slow moving shark so how does it keep its body free of bacteria build up 
 it doesn 't do it with a chemical it does it it turns out with the same denticles that you had
  bathing suits that broke all those records in the olympics but it 's a particular kind of pattern  
 and that pattern the architecture of that pattern on its skin denticles
 keep bacteria from being able to land and adhere  
 there is a company called sharklet technologies that 's now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals to keep bacteria from landing which is
 better than dousing
  it with   anti bacterials or harsh cleansers
 that many many organisms are now becoming drug resistant hospital acquired infections are now killing more people every year in the united states than
 die from aids or cancer or car accidents combined about one hundred thousand  
 this is a little critter that 's in the namibian desert it has no fresh water
  that it 's able to drink  but it drinks water out of fog it 's got bumps on the back of its wing covers  
 and those bumps act like a magnet for water they have water loving tips and waxy sides 
 and the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips  and it goes down the sides and goes into the critter 's mouth  
 there is actually a scientist here at oxford
 who studied this andrew parker
  now kinetic and architectural firms like grimshaw are starting to look at this as a way of coating buildings so that they gather water from the fog  
 ten times better than our fog catching nets
 co2 as a building block organisms don 't think of co2 as a poison  plants and organisms that make shells coral think of it as a building block  
  now a cement manufacturing
 company starting in the united states called calera  they 've borrowed the recipe from the coral reef  
 and they 're using co2 as a building block in
 cement in concrete instead of cement usually emits a ton of co2 for every ton of cement now it
 's reversing that equation and actually sequestering half a ton of co2 thanks to the recipe from the coral none of these are using the organisms they 're really only using the blueprints or the recipes from the organisms  
 how does nature gather the sun 's energy  this is a new kind of solar cell that 's based on how a leaf works
 it can be put down on any substrate whatsoever it 's
  a company that i 'm involved in called onesun with paul hawken there are
 many many ways that nature filters water that takes salt
 out of water  we take water and push it against a membrane and then we wonder why the membrane clogs and why it takes so much electricity nature does something much more
  every cell every red blood cell of your body right now has these
 pores called aquaporins  
 they actually export water molecules through it 's kind of a forward osmosis they export water molecules through and leave solutes on the other side 
 a company called aquaporin is starting to make desalination membranes mimicking this technology  
 trees and bones are constantly reforming
  themselves along lines of stress  this algorithm has been put into a software program
 that 's now being used to make bridges lightweight to make building beams lightweight actually  g m opel used it to create
 that that skeleton you see in what 's called their bionic
  lightweighted that skeleton using a minimum amount of material as an organism must for the maximum amount of strength  
 this beetle  
 unlike this chip bag here this beetle uses one material chitin 
 and it finds many many ways to put many functions into it it 's waterproof  
 it 's strong and resilient it 's breathable it creates color through structure
 whereas that chip bag has about seven layers to do all of those things 
 one of our major inventions that we need to be able to do to come even close to what these organisms can do
 is to find a way to minimize the amount of material the kind of material we use and to add design to it
  we use five polymers in the natural world to do everything that you see 
 in our world we use about three hundred and fifty polymers to make all this 
 nature is nano 
 nanotechnology nanoparticles you hear a lot of worry about this  loose nanoparticles what is really interesting to me
 is that
 not many people have been asking how can we consult nature about how to
  make nanotechnology safe 
 nature has been doing that for a long time embedding nanoparticles in a material for instance  always in fact sulfur reducing bacteria 
 as part of their synthesis  they will emit as a byproduct nanoparticles into the water 
 but then right after that they emit a protein that
  actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles so that they fall out of solution 
 energy use organisms sip energy  
 because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get  
 and one of the largest fields right now in the world of energy grids you hear about the smart grid 
 one of the largest consultants are the social insects swarm technology
 there is a company called regen they are looking at how
 ants and bees find their food and their flowers in the most effective way
 as a whole hive  and they 're having appliances in your home talk to one another through that algorithm and determine
 how to minimize
  there 's a group of scientists in cornell that are making what they call a synthetic tree because they are saying there is no pump at the bottom of a tree 
 it 's capillary action and transpiration pulls water up a drop at a time pulling it 
 releasing it from a leaf and pulling it up through the roots  and they 're creating
 you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper they 're thinking about putting it on the insides
  of buildings to move water up without pumps  
 amazon electric eel incredibly endangered  some of these species
 create six hundred volts of electricity
 with the chemicals that are in your body even more interesting to me is that
 six hundred volts doesn 't fry it 
 you know we use pvc and we we sheath wires with pvc for insulation 
 these organisms how are they insulating against their own electric charge  
 these are some questions that we 've yet to ask 
 here 's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale humpback whale has
 scalloped edges on its flippers  and those scalloped edges play with flow in such a way that is reduces drag
  by thirty two percent these wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow
 windspeeds as a result  mit just has a new radio chip
 that uses far less power than our chips  and it 's based on the cochlear of your ear able to pick up
  television signals and radio signals in the same chip finally on an ecosystem scale 
 at biomimicry guild  which is my consulting company we work with hok architects we 're looking at
 building whole cities in their in their planning department and what we 're saying is that shouldn 't our cities
  do at least as well in terms of ecosystem services as the native systems that they replace 
 so we 're creating something called ecological performance standards that hold cities to this higher bar 
 the question is biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate the
 question i would ask is what 's worth solving if you haven 't seen this it 's pretty amazing
  this is a depiction of all of the water on earth
 in relation to the volume of the earth all the ice all the fresh water all the sea water and all the atmosphere that we can breathe in relation to the volume of the earth  
 and inside those balls
 life over three point eight billion years has made a lush livable place
  and we are in a long long line of organisms
 to come to this planet and ask ourselves 
 how can we live here gracefully over the long haul how can we do what life
 has learned to do  which is to create conditions conducive to life now in order to do
  the design challenge of our century i think  we need a way
 to remind ourselves
 of those geniuses  and to somehow meet them again 
 one of the big ideas one of the big projects i 've been honored to work on is a new website  and i would encourage you all to please go to it it 's called
 and what we 're trying to do in a tedesque
  is to organize all biological information by design and engineering function  
 and we 're working with eol encyclopedia of life ed wilson 's ted wish  and he 's gathering all biological information on one website  
 and the scientists who are contributing to eol are answering a question what can we learn from this organism 
 and that information will go into
 will be able in the moment of creation to type in how does nature
 remove salt from water and up will come mangroves  and sea turtles and your own kidneys
