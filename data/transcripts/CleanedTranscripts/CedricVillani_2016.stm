  is it
 that french people do better than all the others 
 if you would take polls  the top three answers might be love  wine
  but let me suggest a fourth one 
 mathematics 
 did you know that paris has more mathematicians than any other city in the world and more streets with mathematicians ' names too 
 and if you look at the statistics of the fields medal 
 often called the nobel prize for mathematics and always awarded to mathematicians below the age of forty 
 you will find that france has more fields medalists
  per inhabitant than any other country  
 what is it that we find so sexy in math
  after all it seems to be dull and abstract  just numbers and computations and rules to apply 
 mathematics may be abstract  but it 's not dull and it 's not about
  is about reasoning
 and proving our core activity  it is about imagination the talent which we most praise  it is about finding the truth 
 there 's nothing like the feeling which invades you when after months of hard thinking you finally understand the right reasoning to solve your problem
 that this feeling can last for hours or even days  
 the reward may be big  
 hidden mathematical truths permeate our whole physical world 
 they are inaccessible to our senses but can be seen through mathematical lenses  
 close your eyes for moment and think of what is occurring right now around you
  invisible particles from the air around are bumping on you by the billions and billions at each second 
 all in complete chaos  and still  their statistics can be accurately predicted by mathematical physics  
 and open your eyes now to the statistics of the
  the law of errors of deviations with respect to the mean behavior 
 this curve tells about the statistics of velocities of particles in the same way as a demographic curve would tell about the statistics of ages of individuals  
 it 's one of the most important curves
  keeps on occurring again and again from many theories and many experiments as a great example of the universality
 which is so dear to us mathematicians 
 of this curve  the famous scientist francis galton said it would have been deified by the greeks if they had known it
 it is the supreme law of unreason
  better way to materialize that supreme goddess than galton 's board inside this board
 are narrow tunnels through which tiny balls will fall down randomly going
 right or left  or left  etc all in complete randomness and chaos
  let 's see what happens when we look at all these random trajectories together
  trapped here inside this transparent box as dream in the sandman comics for you
 i have shown it  but to my students i explain why it could not be any other curve  
 and this is touching the mystery of that goddess replacing a beautiful coincidence by a beautiful explanation 
 all of science is like this 
 and beautiful mathematical explanations
 are not only for our pleasure  they also
  they used the mathematical analysis of random trajectories
 and the gauss curve
 to explain and prove that our world is made of atoms  
 it was not the first time that mathematics was revolutionizing our view of the world 
 more than two thousand years ago at the time of the ancient greeks
 it already occurred 
 in those days only a small fraction of the world had been explored and the earth might have seemed infinite  
 but clever eratosthenes  using mathematics was able to measure the earth with an amazing accuracy of two percent
  a pendulum swings slightly slower in cayenne than in paris 
 from this observation alone  and clever mathematics  newton rightly deduced that the earth is a wee bit flattened at the poles 
 like zero point three percent
 so tiny that you wouldn 't even notice it on the real view of the earth 
 these stories show that mathematics is able to make us go out of our intuition
 measure the earth which seems infinite see atoms which are invisible or detect an imperceptible variation of shape and
  if there is just one thing that you should take home from this talk  it is this mathematics allows us to go beyond the intuition
 and explore territories which do not fit within our grasp  
 here 's a modern example you will all relate to searching the internet
  the world wide web more than one billion web pages do you want to go through them all 
 computing power helps  but it would be useless without the mathematical modeling to find the information hidden in the data
 let 's work out a baby problem  
 imagine that you 're a detective working on a crime case  and there are many people who have their version of the facts 
 who do you want to interview first
  answer prime witnesses you see suppose that
 there is person number seven 
 tells you a story but when you ask where he got if from he points to person number three as a source  
 and maybe person number three in turn points at person number one
 as the primary source now number one is a prime witness so i definitely want to interview
  him priority  
 and from the graph we also see that person number four is a prime witness  and maybe i even want to interview him first because there are more people who refer to him  
 ok that was easy  but now what about if you have a big bunch of people who will testify
  and this graph i may think of it as
 all people who testify in a complicated crime case  
 but it may just as well be web pages pointing to each other referring to each other for contents 
 which ones are the most authoritative not so clear  
 enter pagerank one of the early cornerstones of google 
 this algorithm uses the laws of mathematical randomness to
  determine automatically the most relevant web pages in the same way as we used randomness in the galton board experiment 
 so let 's send into this graph a bunch of tiny digital marbles
 and let them go randomly through the graph 
 each time they arrive at some site they will go out through some link chosen at random to the next one  and again
  again and again and with small growing piles we 'll keep the record of how many times each site has been visited by these digital marbles 
 here we go randomness randomness 
 and from time to time also let 's make jumps completely randomly to increase the fun  
 and look at this from the chaos will emerge the solution the
  highest piles correspond to those sites which somehow are better connected than the others  more pointed at than the others  and here we see clearly which are the web pages we want to first try  
 once again  the solution emerges from the randomness 
 of course  since that time  google has come up with much more sophisticated algorithms
  was beautiful  
 and still  just one problem in a million 
 with the advent of digital area  more and more problems lend themselves to mathematical analysis  
 making the job of mathematician a more and more useful one 
 to the extent that a
 few years ago  it was ranked number one among hundreds of jobs in a study
 about the best and worst jobs published by the wall street journal in two thousand and nine mathematician
 best job in the world
  analysis  and why not stochastic processes linear programming or fluid simulation 
 each of these fields have monster industrial applications  and through them there is big money in mathematics 
 and let me concede that when it comes to making money from
  the americans are by a long shot the world champions 
 with clever  emblematic billionaires and amazing giant companies all resting  ultimately on good algorithm 
 now with all this beauty  usefulness and wealth mathematics does look more sexy  
 but don 't you think that the life a mathematical researcher is an easy one  it is filled with perplexity
 frustration a desperate fight for understanding 
 let me evoke for you one of the most striking days in my mathematician 's life 
 or should i say one of the most striking nights 
 at that time i was staying at the institute for advanced studies in princeton for many years the home of albert einstein and
  the most holy place for mathematical research in the world
  and that night i was working and working on an elusive proof which was incomplete  
 it was all about understanding the paradoxical stability property of plasmas which are a crowd of electrons in
 the perfect world of plasma there are no collisions
  and no friction to provide the stability like we are used to  
 but still if you slightly perturb a plasma equilibrium you will find that the resulting electric field spontaneously vanishes  or damps out as if
 by some mysterious friction force this paradoxical effect  called the landau damping is one of the most important in
  physics and it was discovered through mathematical ideas
 but still  a full mathematical understanding of this phenomenon was missing  and together with my former student and main collaborator
 in paris at the time we had been working for months and months on such a
  i had already announced by mistake that we could solve it  but the truth is the proof was just not working 
 in spite of more than one hundred pages of complicated mathematical arguments and a bunch discoveries and huge calculation it was not working 
 and that night in princeton a certain gap in the chain of arguments was driving me crazy  i was putting in there all my energy
 and experience and tricks  and still nothing was working one
  my head i swear take the second term to the other side fourier transform and invert in l2 damn
 it that was the start of the solution 
 you see i thought i had taken some rest  but really my brain had continued to work on it in
 those moments you don 't think of your career or your colleagues
  complete battle between the problem and you 
 that being said  it does not harm when you do get a promotion in reward for your hard work and after we completed
 our huge analysis of the landau damping i was lucky enough to get the most coveted fields medal from the
  hands of the president of india in hyderabad on nineteen august two thousand and ten
 an honor that mathematicians never dare to dream a day that i will remember until i live  
 what do you think on such an occasion  
 pride yes  and gratitude to the many collaborators who made this possible  
 and because it was a collective adventure you need to share it not just with your collaborators
  collaborators 
 i believe that everybody can appreciate the thrill of mathematical research and share the passionate stories of humans and ideas behind it
 and i 've been working with my staff at institut
 together with partners and artists of mathematical communication worldwide so that we can found our own very special
 museum of mathematics there 
 so in a few years 
 when you come to paris  after tasting the great crispy baguette and macaroon  
 please come and visit us at institut henri poincar and share the mathematical dream with us thank you
