  what 's happening to the climate it is unbelievably bad this is obviously that famous view now of the arctic  which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five 
  years  very very very scary so we all look at what we can do  and when you look at the worldwide sources of
  buildings only nine percent is passenger cars interestingly enough so we ran off to a sushi bar and at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea  and it was something called ecorock and we said we could redesign 
  the 115 year old gypsum drywall process that generates twenty billion pounds of co2 a year so it was a big idea  we wanted to reduce that by eighty percent which is exactly what we 've done we started r & d in two thousand and six decided to use recycled content
  from cement and steel manufacturing there is the inside of our lab we haven 't shown this before but our people had to do some five thousand different mixes to get this 
  right to hit our targets  and they worked absolutely very very very hard  so then we went forward and and built our production line in china we don 't build this production equipment any longer in
  we did the line install over the summer  we started right there with absolutely nothing you 're seeing for the first time a brand new drywall production line not made using gypsum at all that 's the finished 
  production line there  we got our first panel out on december third that is the slurry being poured onto paper basically that 's the line running the exciting thing is look at the faces of the people 
 these are people who worked this project for two to three years  and they are so excited that 's the first board off the line our vice president of operation kissing the board 
  excited  but this has a huge huge impact on the environment we signed the first panel just a few weeks after that had a great signing ceremony  leading to people hopefully using
 these products across the world and we 've got cradle to cradle gold on this thing we happened to win just recently the green product of the year for the re invention of drywall from popular science
  thank you thank you so here is what we learned  eight thousand gallons of gas equivalent to build one house
  probably had no idea it 's like driving around the world six times we must change everything look around the room  chairs  wood everything around us has to change or we 're not going to lick this problem don 
  't listen to the people who say you can 't do this because anyone can and these job losses  we can fix them with green collar jobs we 've got four plants we 're building this stuff around the country we 're going as fast as we can two and a half million cars worth of gypsum
  so what will you do i 'll tell you what i did and why i did it and i know my time 's up those are my kids natalie and david when they have their kids two thousand and fifty they 'd better look back at grandpa and say hey you gave it a 
  good shot you did the best you could with the team that you had so my hope is that when you leave ted you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it and if you don 't know how  please find me i will help you
