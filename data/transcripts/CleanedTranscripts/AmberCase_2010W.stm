  like to tell you all that you are all actually cyborgs 
 but not the cyborgs that you think you 're not robocop and you 're not terminator  but you 're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices  so what 's a good definition for cyborg
 traditional definition is an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments 
 that came from a one thousand nine hundred and sixty paper on space travel because if you think about it space is pretty awkward people aren 't supposed to be there  but humans are curious and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next  
 so let 's look at the concept of traditional anthropology  somebody goes to another country
  says how fascinating these people are how interesting their tools are how curious their culture is and then they write a paper and maybe a few other anthropologists read it and we think it 's very exotic  
 well  what 's happening is that
 we 've suddenly found a new species i as a cyborg anthropologist have suddenly said oh wow now suddenly we 're a new
  of homo sapiens and look at these fascinating cultures and look at these curious rituals that everybody 's doing around around this technology they 're clicking on things and staring at screens 
 now there 's a reason why i study this versus traditional anthropology and the reason is that tool use  in the beginning for thousands and thousands of years everything has been a physical modification of self it has helped us to extend our physical selves go faster
  hit things harder  and there 's been a limit on that but now what we 're looking at is not an extension of the physical self but an extension of the mental self  
 and because of that we 're able to travel faster  communicate differently  and the other thing that happens is that we 're all carrying around little mary poppins technology we can put anything we want 
  into it and it doesn 't get heavier  and then we can take anything out what does the inside of your computer actually look like well if you print it out it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you 're carrying around all the time and if you
  actually lose that information  it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind that you suddenly feel like something 's missing except you aren 't able to see it so it feels like a very strange emotion 
 the other thing that happens is that you have a second self  whether you like it or not you 're starting to show up online and people are interacting with your second self when you 're not
  and so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open which is basically your facebook wall so that people don 't write on it in the middle of the night because it 's very much the equivalent and suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self 
 you have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life so in the same way that you wake up take a shower and get dressed you have to learn to do that for your digital self 
 and the problem is that a lot of people now especially adolescents have to go through two adolescences they have
  go through their primary one that 's already awkward and then they go through their second self 's adolescence  and that 's even more awkward because there 's an actual
 history of what they 've gone through online  and anybody coming in new to technology is an adolescent online right now  and so it 's very awkward and it 's very difficult for them to do those things 
 so when i was little my dad would sit me down at night and he would say i 'm going to teach you about time and space in the future
 and i said great and he said one day what 's the shortest distance between two points and i said well that 's a straight line you told me that yesterday i thought i was very clever 
 he said no no  no here 's a better way he took a piece of paper drew a and b on one side and the other and folded them together so where a and b touched  and he said that is the shortest distance between two points and i said
  time and space it takes an awful lot of energy  and that 's just how you do it and i said i want to do that and he said well okay and so when i went to sleep for the next 
 ten or twenty years  i was thinking at night i want to be the first person to create a wormhole to make things accelerate faster and i want to make a time machine i was always sending messages to my future self
  but then what i realized when i went to college is that technology doesn 't just get adopted because
 it works it gets adopted because people use it and it 's made for humans so i started studying anthropology  and when i was writing my thesis on cell phones i realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets  
 they weren 't physically transporting
  they were mentally transporting themselves they would click on a button  and they would be connected as a to b immediately  and i thought oh wow i found it this is great 
 so over time time and space have have compressed
 because of this you can stand on one side of the world whisper something and be heard on the other 
 one of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use every single browser tab gives you a different type of
  and because of that you start to dig around for your external memories where did you leave them so now we 're all these paleontologists that are that are digging for things that we 've lost on our external brains that we 're carrying around in our pockets  
 and that incites a sort of panic architecture oh no where 's this thing 
 i love lucy on a great assembly line of information and we we can 't keep up  
 and so what happens is when we bring all that into the social space we end up checking our phones all the time so we have this thing called ambient intimacy it 's not that we 're always
  connected to everybody but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want  
 and if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone the room would be very crowded these are the people that you have access to right now in general all of these people all of your friends and family that you can connect to 
 and so there are some psychological effects that happen with this one i 'm really worried about is that people aren 't taking time for mental reflection anymore  
 and that they aren 't slowing down and stopping
  all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces paleontology and panic architecture  
 they 're not just sitting there  and really when you have no external input 
 that is a time when there is a creation of self when you can do  long term planning when you can try and figure out who you really are and then once you do that you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way  instead of just dealing with everything
  as it comes in and oh i have to do this and i have to do this and i have to do this  and so this is very important i 'm really worried that especially kids today they 're not going to be
 dealing with this down time that they have an instantaneous button clicking culture  and that everything comes to them  and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it so if you think about it the world hasn 't stopped
  it has its own external prosthetic devices  and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other  
 but when you actually visualize it all the connections that we 're doing right now this is an image of the mapping of the internet
 it doesn 't look technological it actually looks very organic this is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we 've connected in this way and 
 it 's not that machines are taking over it 's that they 're helping us to be more human helping us to connect with each other
 the most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives  
 and really  it ends up being more human than technology because we 're co creating each other all the time 
 and so this is this is the important point that i like to study that things are beautiful that it 's still a human connection
 it 's just done in a different way we 're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other regardless of geography  so that 's why i study cyborg anthropology  thank you
