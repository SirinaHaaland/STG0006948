  that 's me with the funny gloves  
 i was seventeen and going on a peace walk what i didn 't know though was most of those people standing there with me were moonies
  and
 within a week i had come to believe
 that the second coming of christ had occurred that it was sun myung moon and that i had been specially chosen and prepared by god
 to be his disciple  now as cool as that sounds my family was not that thrilled with this
  they could to get me out of there there was an underground railroad of sorts that was going on during those years maybe some of you remember it they were called deprogrammers  
 and
 after
 about five long years my family had me deprogrammed  and i
 then became a deprogrammer i started going out on cases and after
 about five years
 of doing this  i was arrested
 for kidnapping most of the cases i went out on
 were called involuntary  what happened was that the family had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow  and so they took them
 to some safe place and we would come in and talk to them usually for about a week  and so after
 this happened i decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work  and
 about twenty years went by
 there was a burning question though that would not leave me and that was how did this happen to me and in fact what did happen to my brain  
  and so i decided to write a book a memoir about this decade of my life 
 and toward the end of writing that book there was a documentary that came out it was on jonestown  
 and it had a chilling effect on me
  these are the dead in jonestown  about nine hundred people died that day most of them taking their own lives  
 women gave poison to their babies
  babies  and watched foam come from their mouths as they died 
 the top picture is
 a group of moonies that have been blessed by their messiah their mates were chosen for them 
 the bottom picture is hitler youth 
 this is the leg of a suicide bomber the thing i had to admit to myself
  with great repulsion 
 was that i get it i understand how this could happen i understand
 how someone 's brain how someone 's mind can come to the place
 where it makes sense in fact it would be wrong  when your brain is working like that not to try to save the world through genocide
  and so what is this how does this work  and how i 've come to view what happened to me is a viral memetic infection 
 for those of you who aren 't familiar with memetics a meme has been defined
 as an idea that replicates in the human brain and moves
 from brain to brain like a virus  much like a virus the way a virus works is
 it can infect and do the most damage to someone
 who has a compromised immune system in one thousand nine hundred and seventy four i was young  i was naive 
 and  i was pretty lost in my world i was really idealistic 
 these easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing
 when you are emotionally vulnerable what happens
 is that
 circular logic takes over 
 moon is one with god 
 god is going to fix all the problems in the world 
 all i have to do is humbly follow  because god is going to stop war and hunger all these things i wanted to do all i have to do is humbly follow  because after all god
  and it makes anything possible makes anything rationalizable  
 and the thing is though if you looked at my
  brain
 during those years in the moonies neuroscience is expanding exponentially as ray kurzweil said yesterday science is expanding we 're beginning to look inside the brain 
 and so if you looked at my brain or any brain that 's infected with a viral memetic infection like this and compared it to anyone in this room or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular
  i am convinced it would look very very different
