  why do so many people reach success and then fail one
 of the big reasons is we think success is a one way street so we do everything that leads up to success  but then we get there we figure we 've made
  we sit back in our comfort zone and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful  and it doesn 't take long to go downhill 
 and i can tell you this happens  because it happened to me 
 reaching success i worked hard i pushed myself  but then i stopped because i figured oh you know i made it i can just sit back and relax 
 reaching success i always tried to improve and do good work  
 but then i stopped
  i 'm good enough i don 't need to improve any more reaching success i was
 was pretty good at coming up with good ideas because i did all these simple things that led to ideas but then i stopped because i figured i was this hot shot guy and i shouldn 't have to work at ideas they should 
  just come like magic and the only thing that came was creative block  i couldn 't come up with any ideas
 and suddenly i was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent when i should have been talking to my clients 
 and reaching success i always did what i loved  but then i got into stuff that i didn 't love 
 like management i am the world 's worst manager  but i figured i should be doing it because i was after all the president of the company  
 well  soon a black cloud formed over my head and here i was outwardly very successful but inwardly very depressed
  but i 'm a guy i knew how to fix it i bought a fast car 
 it didn 't help i was
 faster but just as depressed so i went to my doctor i said doc  i can buy anything i want but i 'm not happy i 'm depressed
  's true what they say and i didn 't believe it until it happened to me but money can 't buy happiness he said no but it can buy prozac and he put me on 
 and yeah the black cloud faded a little bit but so did all the work  because i was just floating along  i couldn 't care less if clients ever called 
 and clients didn 't call because they could see i was no longer serving them i was only serving myself  so they took their money and their projects
  to others who would serve them better  well it didn 't take long for business to drop like a rock 
 my partner and i thom we had to let all our all our employees go it was down to just the two of us and we were about to go under  
 and that was great  because with no employees there was nobody for me to manage 
 so i went back to doing the projects i
  i had fun again  i worked harder and to cut a long story short did all the things that took me back up to success  
 but it wasn 't a quick trip it took seven years  but in the end 
 business grew bigger than ever and when i went back to following these eight principles the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether  and i woke up one day and
 and i said i don 't need prozac anymore and
  threw it away and haven 't needed it since
