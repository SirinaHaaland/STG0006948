  i will always remember
 the first time i met the girl in the blue uniform
  i was eight at the time  living in the village with my grandmother who was raising me and other children
 famine had hit my country of zimbabwe  
 and we just didn 't have enough to eat  we were hungry  
 and that 's when the girl in the blue uniform
 came to my village with the united nations to feed the children  as she handed me my
  porridge  i asked her why she was there  and without hesitation she said 
 as africans  we must uplift
 all the people of africa i had absolutely no idea what she meant 
 but her words stuck with me
  two years later  famine hit my country for the second time 
 my grandmother had no choice but to send me to the city to live with an aunt i had never met before
  so at the age of ten  i found myself in school
 for the very
  at the city school i would experience what it was to be unequal 
 you see in the village  we were all equal  
 but in the eyes and the minds of the other kids  i was not their equal  
 i couldn 't speak english and i was way behind in terms of reading and writing 
 but this
  feeling of inequality would get even more complex 
 every school holiday spent back in the village with my grandmother made me consciously aware
 of the inequalities this incredible opportunity had created within my own family  
 suddenly i had much more than the rest of my village
 and in their eyes  i was no longer their equal  i felt guilty  
 but i thought about the girl in the blue uniform  
 and i remember thinking that 's who i want to be
 someone like her
  this childhood experience
 led me to the united nations  and to my current role with un women where we are addressing one of the greatest inequalities
 that affects more than half of the world 's population
 women and girls  today i want to share with you a simple idea
 that seeks to uplift
 all of us together  eight months ago  under the visionary leadership of phumzile 
 head of un women  we launched a groundbreaking initiative called 
 inviting men and boys from around the
  to stand in solidarity with each other and with women to create a shared vision for gender equality 
 this is an invitation for those who believe in equality for women and men 
 and those who don 't yet know that they believe 
 the initiative is based on a simple idea that what we share is much more powerful than what
  divides us  
 we all feel the same things  we all want the same things  
 even when those things sometimes remain unspoken
 heforshe is about uplifting all of us women and men together  it 's moving us towards an
  inflection point for gender equality imagine a blank page
 with one horizontal line splitting it in half  
 now imagine that women are represented here and men are represented here  
 in our current population
 is about moving the three point two billion
  one man at a time  across that line so that ultimately men can stand alongside women
 and be on the right side of history  making gender equality a reality in the 21st century  
 however engaging men in the movement would prove quite controversial why invite men they are the problem
  men don 't care  we were told  
 but something incredible happened when we launched heforshe 
 in just three days more than one hundred thousand men had signed up
 and committed to be agents of change for equality within that first week at least one man in every single
  country in the world stood up to be counted  
 and within that same week  heforshe created more than one point two billion conversations on social media  
 and that 's when the emails started pouring in 
 sometimes as many as a thousand a day 
  from a man out of zimbabwe  who after hearing about 
 created a husband school 
 he literally went around his village hand picking all of the men that were abusive to their partners 
 and committed to turn them into better husbands and fathers  
 in pune india a youth
  advocate organized an innovative bicycle rally  mobilizing seven hundred cyclists
 to share the heforshe messages within their own community  in another impact story 
 a man sent a very personal note of something that had happened in his own
  i have lived all of my life next door to a man who continuously beats up his wife 
 two weeks ago  i was listening to my radio  and your voice came on and you spoke about something called the 
 and the need for men to play their role
  within a few hours  i heard the woman cry again next door 
 but for the first time i didn 't just sit there  i felt compelled to do something 
 so i went over
 and i confronted the husband  madam  it has been two weeks and the woman has not cried since
  thank you for giving me a voice personal
 impact stories such as these show that we are tapping into something within men  
 but getting to a world where women and men are equal is not just a matter of bringing men to the cause
  want
 concrete  systematic  structural change that can equalize the political  economic and social realities for women and men  
 we are asking men to make concrete actions  calling them to intervene at a personal level to change their behavior  
 we are calling upon governments businesses
  universities to change their policies  
 we want male leaders to become role models and change agents within their own institutions  
 already a number of prominent men and leaders have stepped up and made some concrete
 leading french hospitality company accor has committed to eliminate the pay gap for all of its one hundred and eighty thousand employees by two thousand and twenty 
 the government of sweden  under its current feminist
  has committed to close both the employment and the
 pay gap for all of its citizens within the current electoral term  
 in japan the university of nagoya is building as part of their heforshe commitments what will become one of japan 's leading
 we are seeing men sign up from every single walk of life and from every single corner in the world 
 from the united nations 
 of nato and the eu council from the prime minister of bhutan to the president of sierra leone
  in europe alone all the male eu commissioners and the members of parliament of the swedish and iceland governments have signed up to be 
 in fact  one in twenty men in iceland has joined the movement 
 the rallying call of our passionate goodwill ambassador emma watson has garnered more than five
  billion media impressions  mobilizing hundreds and thousands of students around the world to create more than a hundred heforshe student associations  
 now this is the beginning of the vision that heforshe has for the world that we want to see
  a human being
 is part of the whole  
 but he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest 
 this delusion is a kind of prison for us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison
 by widening our circle of compassion
 if women and men are part of a greater whole  as einstein suggests it is my hope that 
 can help free us to realize that it is not our gender that defines us  but ultimately  our shared
  is tapping into women 's and men 's dreams 
 the dreams that we have for ourselves and the dreams that we have for our families our children
