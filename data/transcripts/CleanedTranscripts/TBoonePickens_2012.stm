  i 'm a believer  
 i 'm a believer in global warming  and my record is good on the subject  
 but my subject is national security  
 we have to get off of oil purchased from the enemy
  about opec oil and let me take you back one hundred years
 to one thousand nine hundred and twelve  you 're probably thinking that was my birth year
 it 's the same energy question that you 're looking at today  but it 's different sources of fuel  
 a hundred years ago we were looking at coal of course and we were looking at whale oil and we were looking at crude oil 
 at that point  we were looking for a fuel
 that was cleaner  it was cheaper
  and it wasn 't ours though  
 it was theirs  so at that point one thousand nine hundred and twelve  we selected crude oil over whale oil and
 some
 more coal  
 but as we moved on to the period now one hundred years later we 're back really at another decision point 
 what is the decision point it
  what we 're going to use in the future  so
 from here  it 's pretty clear to me
  we would prefer to have cleaner cheaper  domestic ours
 and we have that we have that which is natural gas  
  million barrels of oil  give or take a few barrels every day and the cost annually is three trillion dollars 
 and one trillion of that goes to opec  
 that has got to be stopped now if you look at the cost of opec
  it cost seven trillion dollars on the milken institute study last year seven trillion dollars since 
  is what we paid for oil from opec now that includes the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both  
 but it 's the greatest transfer of wealth
 from one group to another in the history of mankind  and it continues now when you look
 where is the transfer of wealth  you can see here that we have the arrows going into the mid east and away from us  
 and with that we have found ourselves to be the world 's policemen 
 we are policing the world  and how are we
  i know the response to this 
 i would bet there aren 't ten percent of you in the room that know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world 
 raise your hand if you think you know 
 there are twelve  one is under construction by the chinese and the other eleven belong to us  
 why do we have eleven aircraft carriers
  do we have a corner on the market 
 are we smarter than anybody else  
 i 'm not sure if you look at where they 're located and on this slide it 's the red blobs on there there are five that are operating in the mid east and the rest of them are in the united states 
 they just move back to the mid east and those come
  of the eleven we have are tied up in the mid east why why are they in the mid east they
 're there to control keep the shipping lanes open and make oil available and the united states uses about twenty million barrels a day 
 which is about twenty five percent of all the oil used everyday in the
  doing it with four percent of the population  
 somehow that doesn 't seem right  
 that 's not sustainable  so where do we go from here  does that continue  
 yes it 's going to continue  the slide you 're looking at here is one thousand nine hundred and ninety to two thousand and forty 
 over that period you are going to double your demand 
 and when you look at what we 're using the oil for seventy percent of it is used for
  transportation fuel  
 so when somebody says let 's go more nuclear  let 's go wind  let 's go solar fine  i 'm for anything american 
 anything american  but if you 're going to do anything about the dependency on foreign oil  you have to address
  so here we are using twenty million barrels a day producing eight importing twelve  and from the twelve five 
 comes from opec 
 when you look at the biggest user and the second largest user  we use twenty million barrels and the chinese use ten the chinese have
 a little bit better plan or they have a plan  we have no
  in the history of america we 've never had an energy plan  we don 't even realize the resources that we have available to us  if you take the last ten years
 and bring forward  you 've transferred
 to opec a trillion dollars  if you go forward the next ten years and cap the price of oil at one hundred dollars a barrel  
 you will pay two point two trillion
 that 's not sustainable either  but the days of cheap oil are over 
 they 're over they make it very clear to you
  the
 saudis do they have to have ninety four dollars a barrel to make their social commitments now i had people
  the oil for five dollars a barrel  
 that has nothing to do with it  
 it 's what they have to pay for is what we are going to pay for oil 
 there is no free market for oil the oil is priced off the margin and the opec nations are the ones that price the oil 
 so where are we headed from here we 're headed
 to natural gas  natural gas will do
 everything we want it to do it 's one hundred and thirty octane fuel 
 it 's twenty five percent cleaner than oil  it 's ours we have an abundance of it 
 and it does not require a refinery it
 comes out of the ground at one hundred and thirty octane run it through the separator and you 're ready to use it it 's going to be very simple for us to use it 's going to be simple to accomplish this
 're going to find and i 'll tell you in just a minute what you 're looking for
 to make it happen  but here you can look at the list natural gas will fit all of those it will replace or be able to be used for that 
 it 's for power generation transportation it 's peaking fuel  it 's all those do we have enough natural gas  look at the bar on the left
  trillion it 's what we use a year
 go forward and the estimates that you have from the eia and onto the industry estimates the industry knows what they 're talking about
 we 've got four thousand trillion cubic feet of natural gas that 's available to us how does that translate to
 barrels of oil equivalent it would be three times what the saudis claim they have 
 and they claim they have two hundred and fifty billion barrels of oil which i do not believe i think it 's probably
 billion barrels  but anyway  whether they say they 're right or whatever we have plenty of natural gas  
 so i have tried to target on where we use the natural gas and where i 've targeted is on
  of them you take eight million trucks
 these are 18 wheelers and take them to natural gas  reduce carbon by thirty percent it is cheaper
 and it will cut our our imports three million barrels  so you will cut sixty percent off of opec
 with eight million trucks there are two hundred and fifty million vehicles in america
  so what you have is natural gas is the bridge fuel is the way i see it  i don 't have to worry about the bridge to where
 at my age 
 that 's your concern  
 but when you look at the natural gas we have it could very well be the bridge to natural gas  because you have plenty of natural gas
 but as i said i 'm for anything american now let me take you i 've been a realist i went from theorist early to realist i 'm back to theorist 
  again  if you look at the world you have methane hydrates in the ocean around every continent  
  if that 's the way you 're going to go 
 that there 's plenty of methane natural gas is methane methane and natural gas are interchangeable but if you decide that you 're going to use some methane and i 'm gone  so it 's up to you
 but we do have plenty of methane hydrates so
 i think i 've made my point that 
 that we have to get on our own resources in america  if we do
 it 's costing us a billion dollars a day for oil 
 and yet we have no energy plan so there 's nothing going on that
 impresses me in washington on that plan other than i 'm trying to focus on that eight
  if we could do that i think we would take our first step to an energy plan  
 if we did we could see that our own resources are easier to use than anybody can imagine  thank you
  plan that was based on wind energy and you abandoned it basically because the economics changed
  what happened tbp i lost one hundred and fifty
 and so the margin is natural gas and at the time i went into the wind business natural gas was nine dollars  today it 's two dollars and forty cents 
 you cannot do a wind deal under six dollars an mcf ca 
 so what happened was that through
 increased
  ability to use fracking technology  the calculated reserves of natural gas kind of exploded and the price plummeted  
 which made wind uncompetitive 
 in a nutshell that 's what happened tbp that 's what happened we found out that we could go to the source rock  which were the carboniferous shales in the basins the first one was barnett shale
 in texas and then the marcellus up in the northeast across
 new york pennsylvania west virginia and haynesville in louisiana
  louisiana this stuff is everywhere we are overwhelmed with natural gas ca and now you 're a big investor in in that and bringing that to market tbp well you say a big investor
  it 's my life i 'm a geologist got out of school in ' fifty one and i 've been in the industry my entire life now
 i do own stocks
  i 'm not a big natural gas producer somebody the other day said i was the second largest natural gas producer in the united states don 't i wish
 but no i 'm not 
 i own stocks  but i also am in the fueling business ca but natural gas is a fossil fuel  you burn it you release
  you 're going to have to use something  what do you have to replace it
 no no the argument that it 's a bridge fuel makes sense because
 the amount of co2 per unit of energy is lower than
  oil and coal correct and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas 
 but if that if that 's it and and that becomes the reason that renewables don 't get invested in 
  screwed anyway right tbp well i 'm not ready to give up but jim and i talked there as he left and i said how do you feel
  you 're a person who believes in your legacy  you 've made the money you need you 're one of the few people in a position to
 really swing the debate  do you support the idea of of some kind of
  don 't like that because it ends up the government is going to run the program i can tell you it will be a failure the government is not successful
 on these things they just aren 't it 's a bad deal look at
 solyndra or whatever it was i mean that was told to be a bad idea ten times they went ahead and did it anyway
  i think it 's closer to a 
 but chris  i think where we 're headed 
 i don 't mind going back to nuclear  and i can tell you what the last page of the report that will take them five years to write will be 
 one don 't build a reformer on a fault
  of methane leaking from that methane being a worse global warming gas than
  age was i got out of school in ' fifty one i witnessed my first frack job at border texas in one thousand 
 nine hundred and fifty three fracking came out in ' forty seven and don 't believe for a minute when when our president gets up there and says the department of energy thirty years ago developed fracking  i don 't know what in the hell he 's talking about 
  i mean seriously the department of energy did not have anything to do with fracking  the first frack job was in ' forty seven i saw my first one in ' fifty three i 
  've fracked over three thousand wells in my life  never had a problem with messing up an aquifer or anything else  now
  hundred thousand wells fracked in oklahoma texas kansas in that aquifer
 there 's no problems  i don 't understand why the media is focused on eastern pennsylvania ca all
 right so you don 't support a carbon tax of any kind or a
  it 's a bridge fuel
  to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution are you ready to invest in those technologies  even if they aren 't maximized for profits they might be maximized for the future health of the planet tbp i lost one hundred and fifty million on the wind
 and
 anything american will work for me ca boone
 i really really appreciate you coming here  engaging in this conversation i think there 's a lot of people who will want to engage with you and that that was a real gift you gave this audience  thank you so much
