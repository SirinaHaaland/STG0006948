  when i was six years old  i received my gifts 
 my first grade teacher had this brilliant idea  
 she wanted us to experience receiving gifts but also learning the virtue of
 complimenting each other  so she had all of us come to the front of
  classroom  and she bought all of us gifts and stacked them in the corner  and she said why don 't we just stand here and compliment each other 
 if you hear your name called  go and pick up your gift and sit down 
 what a wonderful idea right what could go wrong 
 well there were forty of us to start with and every time i heard someone 's name called  i would give out the heartiest cheer
 and then there were twenty people left  and ten people left  and five left  
 and three left and i was one of them  and the compliments stopped  
 well  at that moment i was crying and the teacher was freaking out she was like hey  would anyone say anything
  why don 't you go get your gift and sit down so behave next year someone might say something nice about you 
 well as i 'm describing this you you probably know i remember this really well 
 but i don 't know who felt worse that day was it me or the teacher she must have realized that she turned a team building event
  when you see people get roasted on tv it was funny there was nothing funny about that day
  so that that was one version of me and i would die to avoid being in that situation again to get rejected in public again that
 's one version then fast forward eight years bill gates
  i know what i want to do now 
 that night i wrote a letter to my family telling them by age twenty five i will build the biggest company in the world
  and that company will buy microsoft 
 i totally embraced this idea of conquering the world domination right and i didn 't make this up i did write that letter
 you don 't have to read this through  
 this is also bad handwriting but i did highlight some key words you get the idea 
 so 
 that was another version of me one who will conquer the world  well then two years later i was presented
 the united states  i jumped on it because that was where bill gates lived right 
 i thought that was the start of my entrepreneur journey 
 then fast forward another fourteen years i was thirty 
 nope i didn 't build that company i didn
 't even start i was actually a marketing manager for a fortune five hundred company and i felt i was stuck i was stagnant
  why is that where is that 14 year old who wrote that letter it
 's not because he didn 't try it
 's because every time i had a new idea every time i wanted to try something new even at work i wanted to make a proposal i wanted to speak up in front of people in a group i felt there was this constant battle
  one wanted to conquer the world make a difference another was afraid of rejection  and every time that 
 and this fear even persisted after i started my own company  i mean i started my own company when i was thirty
 if you want to be bill gates you 've got to start sooner or later right when i was
 an entrepreneur i was presented with an investment opportunity  and then
  then i was turned down  and that rejection hurt me  it hurt me so bad that i wanted to quit right there  
 but then i thought hey  would bill gates quit after a simple investment rejection 
 would any successful entrepreneur quit like that no way  
 and this is where it clicked for me  
  i can build a better company i can build a better team or better product but one thing for sure i 've got to be a better leader i 've got to be a better person  
 i cannot let that six year old keep dictating my life anymore i have to put him back in his place  
 so this is where i went online and looked for help google was my friend i searched how do i overcome the fear of rejection 
 i came up with a bunch of
 psychology articles about where the fear and pain are coming from
  i came up with a bunch of rah rah inspirational articles about don 't take it personally just overcome it who doesn 't know that but
 why was i still so scared then i found this website by luck it 's called rejectiontherapy com 
 rejection therapy was this game invented by this canadian entrepreneur his name is jason comely and
 basically the idea is for thirty days you go out and look for rejection  
 and every day get rejected at something and then by the end you desensitize yourself from the pain  
 and i loved that idea i said you know what i 'm going to do this and i 'll feel myself getting rejected one hundred days and i
 came up with my own rejection ideas  and i made a video blog
 out of it and so here 's what i did this is what the blog looked like  day one 
 laughter borrow one hundred dollars from a stranger  
 so this is where i went to where i was working i
 came downstairs and i saw this big guy sitting behind a desk he looked like a security guard  so i just approached him and
  the longest walk of my life
 hair on the back of my neck standing up i was sweating and my heart was pounding  and i got there and said hey  sir can i borrow one hundred dollars from you
  because i filmed myself so that night i was watching myself getting rejected i just saw how scared i was i looked like this kid in the sixth sense i saw dead people 
 but then i saw this guy you know he
  things i could 've explained i could 've negotiated  i didn 't do any of that all i did was run 
 i felt wow this is like a microcosm of my life 
 every time i felt the slightest rejection i would just run as fast as i could and you know what the next day no matter what happens  i 'm not going to run 
  went to a burger joint i finished lunch  and i went to the cashier and said
  tell my manager about it and maybe we 'll do it but sorry we can 't do this today then i left  and by the way  i don 't think they 've ever done burger refill
  i think they 're still there  but
 the life and death feeling i was feeling the first time was no longer there just because i stayed engaged because i didn 't run i said 
 wow great i 'm already learning things  
 great and then day three getting olympic doughnuts 
 this is where my life was turned upside down  i went to a krispy kreme it 's a doughnut shop in
  mainly the southeastern part of the united states  
 i 'm sure they have some here too and i went in i said can you make me doughnuts that look like olympic symbols  basically you interlink five doughnuts together 
 i mean there 's no way they could say yes right 
 the doughnut maker took me so seriously 
 so she put out paper started jotting down
 the colors and the rings and is like how can i make this and then fifteen minutes later she came out with a box that looked like olympic rings
  touched  i just couldn 't believe it and that video got over five million views on youtube 
 the world couldn 't believe that either you know 
 because of that i was in newspapers in talk shows in everything and i became famous a lot of people started writing emails
  fame and notoriety did not do anything to me  what i really wanted to do was learn and to change myself 
 so i turned the rest of my one hundred days of rejection into this playground into this research project i wanted to see what i could learn  
 and then i learned a lot of things  i discovered so many secrets for example i found if i just don 't
  i have this dog that would
  do this go across the street and talk to connie she loves flowers 
 so that 's what i did i went across and knocked on connie 's door and she was so happy to see me 
 and then half an hour later  there was this flower in connie 's backyard i 'm sure it looks better now 
 but had i left after the initial rejection i would 've thought well it 's because the guy didn 't trust me it 's because i was crazy because i didn 't dress up well
  it was none of those  it was because what i offered did not fit what he wanted and he trusted me enough to offer me a referral  using a sales term
  i converted a referral
  then one day and i also learned that i can actually say certain things and maximize my chance to get a yes  so for example one day i went to a starbucks
  you know those walmart greeters  you know those
 people who say ' hi ' to you before you walk in the store and make sure you don 't steal stuff basically  i want to give a walmart experience to starbucks customers
  as soon as he said that his whole demeanor changed it 's as if he 's putting all the doubt on the floor  and he said yeah you can do this just don 't get too weird 
 so for the next hour i was the
  every customer that walked in and gave them holiday cheers  by the way i don 't know what your career trajectory is don 't be a greeter 
 it was really boring  
 but then
 i found i could do this because i mentioned is that weird 
 i mentioned the doubt that he was having and because i mentioned is that weird that means i wasn 't weird that means i was actually thinking just like
  i learned that if i mention some doubt people might have before i ask the question i gained their trust people were more likely to say yes to me  
 and then i learned i could fulfill my life dream by asking you know
 i came from four generations of teachers and my grandma has
 always told me hey jia you can do anything
  has always been my dream to actually teach something  
 so i said what if i just ask and teach a college class  
 i lived in austin at the time so i went to university of texas at austin and knocked on professors ' doors and said can i teach your class 
 i didn 't get anywhere the first
 couple of times  but because i didn 't run i kept doing it and on the third try the professor was very impressed
  like no one has done this before and i came in prepared with powerpoints and and my lesson he said wow i can use this
 why don 't you come back in two months i 'll fit you in my curriculum and two months later i was teaching a class  this is me you probably can 't see this is a bad picture you
 know sometimes you get rejected by lighting
  crying  because i thought i could fulfill my life dream just by simply asking i used to think i have to accomplish all these things have to be a great entrepreneur 
 get a phd to teach but no i just asked and i could teach and in that picture which you can 't see  i quoted martin luther
  my research i found
 that people who really change the world who change the way we live and the way we think are the people who were met with initial and often violent rejections people like 
 martin luther king jr like mahatma gandhi nelson mandela or even jesus christ 
  have to be those people to learn about rejection and in my case rejection was my curse was my boogeyman it has bothered me my whole life
 because i was running away from it then i started embracing it i turned that into the biggest gift in my life 
 i started teaching people how to turn rejections into opportunities  i use my blog i use my talk i use the book i
  just published  and i 'm even building technology to help people overcome their fear of rejection 
 when you get rejected in life when you are facing the next obstacle or next
 failure consider the possibilities don 't run  if you just embrace them  they might become your gifts as well  thank you
