  live and work from tokyo japan  and
 i specialize in human behavioral research  and
 applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways and to design for that future  and you know
  be honest  i 've been doing this for seven years and i haven 't got a clue what the future is going to be like  but i 've got a pretty good idea how people will behave when they get there
  this is my office it 's out there  it 's not in in the lab  and it 's increasingly in places like india china
 six point three billion people about three billion people by the end of this year will have cellular
 connectivity  and it 'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that 
 and i mention this because if we want to design for that future we need to figure out what those people are about 
 and that 's kind of where i see what my job is and what our team 's job is  
 our research often starts with
 very simple question so i 'll give you an example what do you carry  if you think of everything in your life that you own 
 when you walk out that door what do you consider to take with you 
 when you 're looking around what do you consider of that stuff  what do you carry  and of that stuff what do you actually use 
 so this is interesting to us because
 the conscious and subconscious
 decision process
 implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual emotional or functional value 
 and to put it really bluntly you know people are willing to pay for stuff that has value right  
 so i 've probably done about five years ' research looking at what people carry  i go in people 's bags i look in people 's pockets
  purses  i go in their homes and we do this worldwide  and
 we follow them around town with video cameras it 's kind of like stalking with permission  and we do all this
 and to go back to the original question what do people carry  and it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff ok that 's fair
  but if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are
 across cultures and across gender and across contexts most people will say
 keys money and if they own one a mobile phone 
 and i 'm not saying this is a good thing but this is a thing right  i mean i couldn 't take your phones off you if i wanted to you 'd probably
 kick me out or something 
  it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask but really the question is why right  
 so why are these things so important in our lives  and it turns out 
 from our research that it boils down to survival survival for us and survival for our loved ones  
 so  keys provide an access to shelter and warmth transport as well
  money is useful for buying food  sustenance among all its other uses  and a mobile phone it turns out is a great recovery tool  
 if you prefer this kind of maslow 's hierarchy of needs those three objects
 are very good at supporting the lowest rungs in maslow 's hierarchy of needs  yes they do a whole bunch of other stuff  but they 're very good
  in particular it 's the mobile phone 's ability to allow people to transcend space and time and what i mean by that is you know 
 you can transcend space by simply making a voice call right  
 and you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience and someone else can pick it up at their convenience  
 and this is fairly universally appreciated it turns out  which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected and they value that connectivity
  but actually you can do this kind of stuff with pcs and you can do them with phone kiosks  
 and the mobile phone in addition 
 is both personal and so it also gives you a degree of privacy and it 's convenient you don 't need to ask permission from anyone you can just go ahead and do it right
 however for these things to help us survive it depends on them being carried
  and it 's a pretty big but
 we forget we 're human that 's what we do it 's one of our features i think quite a nice feature 
 so we forget  but we 're also adaptable  
 and we adapt to situations around us pretty well  and so we have these strategies to remember and one of them was mentioned yesterday  and
  the point of reflection and that 's that moment when you 're walking out of a space 
 and you turn around and quite often you tap your pockets  even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets  and you turn around and you look back into the space 
 and some people talk aloud and pretty much everyone does it at some point  
 ok  the next thing is most of you if you have a stable home life and what i mean is that you don 't travel all the time and always
  but most people have what we call a center of gravity  and a center of gravity is where
 you keep these objects and these things don 't stay in the center of gravity but over time they gravitate there it
 's where you expect to find stuff  and in fact when you 're turning around and you 're looking inside the house  and you 're looking for for this stuff  this is where you look first right  
 ok  
 so when we did this research we found the absolutely one hundred percent guaranteed way
 to never forget anything ever ever
  again  
 and that is quite simply 
 to have nothing to remember laughter
 ok now that sounds like something you get on a chinese fortune cookie right  but is in fact about the art of delegation 
 and from a design perspective  it 's about understanding what you can delegate to technology
 and what you can delegate to other people and
  turns out delegation if you want it to be can be the solution for pretty much everything 
 apart from things like bodily functions going to the toilet you can 't ask someone to do that on your behalf  and apart from things like entertainment  
 you wouldn 't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf  or at least not yet maybe sometime in the future we
  let me give you an example of delegation in practice right  so
 this is probably the thing i 'm most passionate about is the research that we 've been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate 
 so the u n estimated this is two thousand and four figures
 that there are almost eight hundred million people who can 't read and write worldwide so we 've been conducting a lot of research  and
 one of the things we were looking at is if you can 't read and write
  if you want to communicate over distances  you need to be
 able to identify the person that you want to communicate with it
 could be a phone number it could be an e mail address it could be a postal address simple question if you can 't read and write how do you manage your contact information 
 and the fact is that millions of people do it 
 just from a design perspective we didn 't really understand how they did it and so that 's just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing
 and it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation  so they delegate that part of the task process
 to other people the stuff that they can 't do themselves
 let me give you another example of delegation this one 's a little bit more sophisticated  and this is from a study that we did in uganda about how people who are sharing devices  use those
  sente is a word in uganda that means money  it has a second meaning which is to send money as airtime  
 ok  and it works like this  so let 's say june you 're in a village rural village  i 'm in kampala
 and i 'm the wage earner  i 'm sending money back  
 and it works like this so in your village there 's one person in the village with a phone and that 's the phone kiosk operator  and it 's quite likely that they 'd have a quite simple mobile phone as as a phone kiosk
 so what i do is i buy a prepaid card like this 
 and instead of using that that money to top up my own phone i call up the local village operator  
 and i read out that number to them  and they use it to top up their phone so they 're topping up the value from kampala and it 's now being topped up in the village  
 you take a ten or twenty percent commission  and then you the kiosk operator takes ten or twenty percent commission and
  passes the rest over to you in cash ok there 's two things i like about this  so the first is  it turns anyone
 who has access to a mobile phone anyone who has a mobile phone essentially into an atm machine it brings rudimentary banking services to places where there 's no banking infrastructure  
 and even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure they wouldn 't necessarily be considered viable customers
 they 're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts 
 there 's a second thing i like about this 
 and that is that despite all the resources at my disposal  and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication i know i could never have designed something as elegant and as
 totally in tune with the local conditions as this 
  but the difference between this and that is  there 's no central authority trying to control this  this is just street up innovation 
 so it turns out the street is a never ending source of inspiration for us 
 and ok if you break one of these things here you return it to the carrier they 'll give you
  give you three new ones right i mean that 's buy three get one free that kind of thing  
 if you go on the streets of india and china  
 you see this kind of stuff  and this is where they take the stuff that breaks and they fix it and they put it back into circulation 
 this is from a workbench in jilin city in china  and you can see people taking down a phone and putting it back together
  and it 's written in chinese and english they also write them in hindi you can subscribe to these 
 there are training institutes where they 're churning out people for fixing these things as well  
 but what i like about this is  it boils down to someone on the street with a small flat surface 
 a screwdriver
  toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads
 because they often get dust on the contact heads
 and knowledge  and it 's all about the social network of the knowledge floating around and
 i like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff  and build stuff and potentially distribute stuff it challenges the norms  
  for me the street just raises so many different questions like this is viagra that i bought from a backstreet sex shop in china  
 and china is a country where you get a lot of fakes  and i know what you 're asking did i test it i 'm not going to answer that
  ok but i look at something like this and i consider the the implications of trust and confidence in the purchase process 
 and we look at this and we think well how does that apply for example for the design of the
  lessons from this apply to the design of
 online services 
 future services in these markets  this is a pair of underpants from 
 from tibet  and i look at something like this and honestly  you know why would someone design underpants with a pocket
  and i look at something like this and it makes me question  
 if we were to to take all the functionality in things like this 
 and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network how would we prioritize where to put stuff and yes this is quite trivial but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of
 personal area networks  
 and what you see here is a couple of phone numbers written above the shack in rural uganda this doesn 't have
 house numbers  this has
 phone numbers  so what does it mean when
 people 's identity is mobile 
 when those extra three billion people 's identity is mobile  it isn 't fixed your notion of identity
 is out of date already  ok  for those extra three billion people  this is how
  and then i go to this this picture here which is the one that i started with and this is 
 this is from delhi  it 's from a study we did into illiteracy 
 and it 's a guy in a teashop you can see the chai being poured in the background 
 and he 's a you know incredibly poor teashop worker on the lowest rungs in the society  
 and he somehow has the appreciation
 of the values of livestrong  and it 's not necessarily the same
  values but some kind of values of livestrong to actually go out and purchase them 
 and actually display them for me this kind of personifies this connected world where everything
 is intertwined  and the dots are it 's all about the dots joining together  ok  the title of this presentation is connections and consequences 
  and it 's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out what it 's going to be like when everyone on the planet
 has the ability to transcend space and time
 in a personal and convenient manner right  when everyone 's connected  and
 there are four things so the first thing is the immediacy of ideas the speed at which ideas go around  
  i know ted is about big ideas but
 actually the benchmark for a big idea is changing  
 if you want a big idea you need to embrace everyone on the planet that 's the first thing 
 the second thing is the immediacy of objects 
 and what i mean by that is  as these become smaller as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater things like banking identity
 these things quite simply move very quickly around the
  world  
 and so the speed of the adoption of things is just going to become that much more rapid 
 in a way that we just totally cannot conceive when you get it to six point three billion and the growth in the world 's population 
 the next thing is that 
 however we design this stuff carefully design this stuff the street will take it and will figure out ways to innovate as long as it meets base needs
 the ability to
  transcend space and time for example  
 and it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate 
 in ways that despite our resources they can do it better than us that 's my feeling  and if we 're smart we 'll look at this stuff
 that 's going on and we 'll figure out a way  to enable it to inform and
  both what we design and how we design
