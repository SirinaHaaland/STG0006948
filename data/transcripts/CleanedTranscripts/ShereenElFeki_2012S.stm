  once upon a time
 well actually less than two years ago in a kingdom not so very far away  
 there was a man who traveled many miles to come to work at the jewel in
  the kingdom 's crown an internationally famous company  
 let 's call it island networks  now this kingdom had many resources and mighty ambitions  but the one thing it lacked was people 
 and so it invited workers from around the world to come and help it build the
  but in order to enter and to stay these migrants had to pass a few tests  and so it was our man presented himself to authorities in the kingdom 
 looking forward to settling into his new life  but then something unexpected happened 
  he wasn 't offered counseling before or after the test which is best medical practice
  he was never informed of the results of the test and yet a couple of weeks later  he was picked up and taken to prison
 where he was subjected to a medical exam  including a 
  search in full view of the others in the cell  he was
  but then a day or two later  he was taken to the airport and he was deported 
 what on earth did this man do to merit this treatment what was his terrible crime 
 he was infected with hiv  
 now the kingdom is one of about fifty countries that imposes restrictions on the entry or stay of people living with hiv
  kingdom argues that
 its laws allow it to detain or deport foreigners who pose a risk to the economy
 or the security or the public health or the morals of the state  
 but these laws when applied to people living with hiv are a violation of international human rights agreements to which these countries are signatories
 but you know what matters of principle aside  practically speaking these laws drive hiv underground 
 people are less likely to come forth to be tested or treated or to disclose their condition  
 none of which helps these individuals or the communities these laws purport
  we can prevent the transmission of hiv and with treatment it is a manageable condition  
 we are very far from the days when the only practical response to dread disease was to have banished the afflicted like this the exile of the leper 
 so you tell me why in our age of science  we still have laws and policies which come from an age of superstition
  time for a quick show of hands who here has been touched by hiv
 either because you yourself have the virus or you have a family member or a friend or a colleague who is living with hiv  hands up  
 wow
 that 's a significant number of
  you know better than anyone that hiv brings out the best and the worst in humanity  
 and the laws reflect these attitudes i 'm not just talking about laws on the books but laws as they are enforced on the streets and laws as they are decided in the courts  
 and i 'm not just talking about laws as they relate to people living with
  but people who are at greatest risk of infection
 people such as those who inject drugs or sex workers or men who have sex with men or transgendered persons or migrants or prisoners 
  and in many parts of the world that includes women and children who are especially vulnerable 
  these laws treat people touched by hiv with compassion
 and acceptance 
 these laws respect universal human rights and they are grounded in evidence 
 these laws ensure that people living with hiv and those at greatest risk are protected from violence and discrimination and that they get access to prevention and to treatment
 counter balanced by a mass of really bad law
 law which is grounded in moral judgement and in fear and in misinformation 
 laws which specifically punish people living with hiv or those at greatest risk  
 these laws fly in the face of science  and they are grounded in prejudice and in ignorance
  and in a rewriting of tradition and a selective reading of religion  
 but you know what you don 't have to take my word for it we
 're going to hear from two people who are on the sharp end of the law the first is nick rhoades he 's an american and he was convicted under the u s state of iowa 's law on hiv transmission
  something is against the law then that is telling society that is
 unacceptable that 's bad behavior  and i think the severity of that punishment tells you
 how bad you are as a person you 're a class b felon 
 lifetime sex offender you are a very very very bad person and you did a very very very bad
  thing  and so that 's just programmed into you and 
 you go through the correctional system and everyone 's telling you the same thing and you 're just like i 'm a very bad person shereen
 el feki it 's not just a question of unfair or ineffective laws some countries have good
  laws which could stem the tide of hiv  the problem is that these laws are flouted 
 because stigma gives unofficial license to treat people living with hiv or those at greatest risk
 unlike other citizens  and this is exactly what happened to helma and dongo from namibia
  our man in the kingdom are among
  hiv according to recent estimates they
 're the lucky ones because they 're still alive 
 according to those same estimates in two thousand and ten one point eight million people died of aids related causes 
 these are terrible and and tragic figures
 but if
 we look a little more broadly into the statistics we actually see some reason for hope  
 looking globally the number of new infections of hiv is declining  
 and looking globally as well deaths are also starting to fall there are many reasons for these positive developments  but one of the most remarkable is in the increase in the number of people around the world on
  check  
 now there are still many problems  only about half of the people who need treatment are currently receiving it 
 in some parts of the world like here in the middle east and north africa new infections are rising and so are deaths 
 and the money the money we need for the global response to hiv that is shrinking 
 for the first time
 in three decades into this epidemic we have a real chance to come to grips with hiv  
 but in order to do that we need to tackle an epidemic of really bad law 
 it 's for this reason that the global commission on hiv and the law of which i 'm a member was established by the agencies of the united nations to look at the ways that legal
  environments are affecting people living with hiv and those at greatest risk 
 and to recommend what should be done to make the law an ally not an enemy of the global response to hiv  
 let me give you just one example of the way a legal environment can make a positive difference 
 people who inject drugs are one of those groups i mentioned
  at high risk of hiv through contaminated injection equipment and other risk related behaviors 
 in fact  one in every ten new infections of hiv is among people who inject drugs
  now drug use or possession is illegal in almost every country  but some countries take a harder line
  on this than others 
 in thailand people who use drugs or are merely suspected of using drugs are placed in detention centers like the one you see here where they are supposed to clean up 
 there is absolutely no evidence to show that throwing people into detention cures their drug dependence  
 there is however  ample evidence to show that incarcerating people increases their risk of hiv and other infections
 we know how to reduce hiv transmission and other risks in people who inject drugs it 's called harm reduction 
 and it involves among other things  providing clean needles and syringes  
  and education and condoms to reduce hiv transmission 
 and also providing hiv testing and counseling and treatment should people become infected 
 where the legal environment allows for harm reduction the results are striking  
 australia and switzerland were two countries which introduced harm reduction very early on in their hiv epidemics and they
  have a very low rate of hiv among injecting drug users 
 the u s and malaysia came to to harm reduction a little later  and they have higher rates of hiv in these populations  
 thailand and russia however have resisted harm reduction and have stringent laws which punish drug use 
  very high rates of hiv among people who are injecting drugs 
 at the global commission we have studied the evidence  and we 've heard the experiences of over seven hundred people from one hundred and forty countries 
 and the trend well the trend is clear  where you criminalize people living with hiv or those at greatest risk you fuel the epidemic
  now coming up with a vaccine for hiv or a cure for aids now that 's rocket science  
 but changing the law isn 't and in fact a number of countries are starting to make progress on a number of points 
 to begin countries need to review their legislation as it touches hiv and vulnerable groups on the back of those reviews  governments
  should repeal laws that punish or discriminate against people living with hiv or those at greatest risk  
 repealing a law isn 't easy  and it 's particularly difficult when it relates to touchy subjects like drugs and sex 
 but there 's plenty you can do while that process is underway 
 one of the key points is to reform the police so that they have better practices on the ground so for example outreach workers who are distributing condoms to vulnerable
  populations are not themselves subject to police harassment or abuse or arbitrary arrest 
 we can also train judges so that they find flexibilities in the law and so that they rule on the side of tolerance rather than prejudice 
 we can retool prisons so that hiv prevention and harm reduction is available to prisoners
  to all this is reinforcing civil society because civil society is key to raising awareness among vulnerable groups of their legal rights 
 but awareness needs action and so we need to ensure that these people who are living with hiv or at greatest risk of hiv have access to legal services and they have equal access to the courts  
 and also important is talking to communities
  so that we change interpretations of religious or customary law which is too often used to justify punishment and fuel stigma 
 for many of us here
 hiv is not an abstract threat it hits very close to home the law on the other hand can
  because for those of us who live in democracies or in aspiring democracies  the law begins with us 
 laws that treat people living with hiv or those at greatest risk with respect
 start with the way that we treat them ourselves as equals  if we are going to stop the spread of hiv in our lifetime
  then that is the change we need to spread thank you
