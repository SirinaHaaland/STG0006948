  i grew up to study the brain because i have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder schizophrenia  
 and as a sister and later as a scientist 
 i wanted to understand why is it that i can take my dreams i can connect them to my reality
 and i can make my dreams come true 
 what is it about my brother 's brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality  so they instead become delusion  
 so i dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses  
 and i moved from my home state of indiana to boston where i was working in the lab of dr francine benes
 in the harvard department of psychiatry  
 and in the lab 
 we were asking the question what are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia
 of the brain which cells are communicating with which cells with which chemicals and then in what quantities of those chemicals  
 so there was a lot of meaning in my life because i was performing this type of research during the day  but then in the evenings and and on the weekends i traveled as an advocate for nami
  the national alliance on mental illness 
 but on the morning of december ten one thousand nine hundred and ninety six i woke up to discover that i had a brain disorder of my own 
 a blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain 
 and in the course of four hours i watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information 
 on the morning of the hemorrhage i could not walk
  recall any of my life  i essentially became an infant in a woman 's body  
 if you 've ever seen a human brain it 's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another  and i have brought for you a real human brain
  this is a real human brain 
 this is the front of the brain the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down 
 and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head  
 and when you look at the brain  it 's obvious that the two cerebral cortices
 are completely separate from one another for those of you who understand computers
 our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor  while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor 
 the two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum which is made up of some three hundred million axonal fibers 
 but other than that the two hemispheres are completely
  because they process information differently  each of our hemispheres think about different things they care about different things and dare i say they have very different personalities  
 excuse me  thank you  it 's been a joy
 it 's all about right here  right now 
 our right hemisphere it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies 
 information in the form of energy streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like
  what this present moment smells like and tastes like what it feels like and what it sounds like  i am an 
 connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere we are 
 connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human
 family  
 and right here right now we are brothers and sisters on this planet here to make the world a better place  
 and in this moment we are perfect 
 we are whole
 and we are beautiful my left hemisphere our left hemisphere is a very different
  our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically our left hemisphere is all about the past
 and it 's all about the future 
 our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details and more details about those details  
 it then categorizes and organizes all that
  associates it with everything in the past we 've ever learned and projects into the future all of our possibilities 
 and our left hemisphere thinks in language  it 's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world  
 it 's that little voice that says to me hey  you 've got to remember to pick up
  on your way home i need them in the morning it 's that calculating intelligence that reminds me when i have to do my laundry 
 but perhaps most important  it 's that little voice that says to me 
 i am  i
 am and as soon as my left hemisphere says to me i am i become separate i become a single solid individual
  separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you 
 and this was the portion of my brain that i lost on the morning of my stroke on the morning of the stroke  
 i woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye  
 and it was the kind of caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream  and it just gripped me
 and then it released me
  and then it just gripped me
 and then it released me 
 and it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of of pain so i thought ok i 'll just start my normal routine 
 so i got up and i jumped onto my cardio glider which is a
  machine  and i 'm jamming away on this thing  and i 'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws
  and it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality  where i 'm the person on the machine having the experience to some esoteric space where i 'm witnessing myself having this experience  
 and it was all very peculiar
  and my headache was just getting worse so i get off the machine  
 and i 'm walking across my living room floor and i realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down 
 and every step is very rigid and very deliberate there 's no fluidity to my pace and there 's this constriction in my area of perception so i 'm just focused on internal systems 
 and i 'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower and i could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body i heard a little
  voice saying ok you muscles you 've got to contract you muscles you relax and then i lost my balance and i 'm propped up against the wall  
 and i look down at my arm and i realize that i can no longer define the boundaries of my body  
 i can 't define where i begin and where i end because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of
  the wall  and all i could detect was this energy
 energy  and i 'm asking myself what is wrong with me what is going on and in that moment 
  my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent 
 just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button  total silence 
 and at first i was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind
 but then i was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me and because i could no longer identify the boundaries 
  of my body i felt enormous and expansive  i felt at one with all the energy that was and it was beautiful there
  i 've got a problem but then i immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness and i affectionately refer to this space as la la land
  but it was beautiful there imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world
  so here i am in this space and my job and any stress related to my my job it was gone and i felt lighter in my body 
 and imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those they were gone
 and i felt this sense of peacefulness  and imagine what it would feel like to lose
  baggage oh 
 i felt euphoria
 euphoria it
 was beautiful and again my left hemisphere comes online and it says hey you 've got to pay attention we 've got to get help and i 'm thinking i 've got to get help i 've got to focus so i get out of the shower and i mechanically dress and i 'm walking around my apartment  and i 'm thinking i 've got to get to work
  i drive and in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side then i realized oh my gosh i 'm having a stroke
  the next thing my brain says to me is wow this is so cool this is so cool how many brain
  can 't stop the stroke from happening so i 'll do this for a week or two and then i 'll get back to my routine ok  so i 've got to call help i 've got to call work i couldn 't remember the number at work so i remembered in my office i had a business card with my number 
 so i go into my business room
  pull out a three inch stack of business cards  and i 'm looking at the card on top and even though i could see clearly in my mind 's eye what my business card looked like i couldn 't tell if this was my card or not because all i could see were pixels 
 and the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols and i just
 couldn 't tell and then i would wait for what i call a wave of clarity  and in that moment i would be able to reattach to normal reality and i could tell that 's not the card that 's not the card it took me 
  forty five minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards in the meantime for forty five minutes the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere  i do not understand numbers 
 i do not understand the telephone but it 's the only plan i have so i take the phone pad and i put it right here i take the business card i put it right here  and i 'm matching the shape of 
  the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad but then i would drift back out into la la land and not remember when i came back if i 
  'd already dialed those numbers  so i had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as i went along and pushed them
  so that as i would come back to normal reality i 'd be able to tell yes i 've already dialed that number eventually the whole number gets dialed
 and i 'm listening to the phone and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me
 and so i say to him clear in my mind i say to him this is jill i need help and what comes out of my voice is woo woo woo woo woo i 'm thinking 
 oh my gosh i sound like a golden retriever so i couldn 't know i didn 't know that i couldn 't speak or understand language until i tried 
 so he recognizes that i need help and he gets me help and a little while later i am
  ambulance from one hospital across boston to [ massachusetts ] general hospital
 and i curl up into a little fetal ball and just like a balloon with the last last
 bit of air just right out of the balloon i just felt my energy lift and just i
 felt my spirit surrender  and
 in that moment i knew that i was no longer the choreographer of my life  
 and either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life or this was perhaps my
 moment of transition 
 when i woke later that afternoon i was shocked to discover that i was still alive
  i felt my spirit surrender i said goodbye to my life  and my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality 
  stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain  
  out from the background noise and i just wanted to escape 
 because i could not identify the position of my body in space i felt enormous and expansive 
 like a genie just liberated from her bottle 
 and my spirit soared free like a great whale gliding through the sea
 of silent euphoria  nirvana  i found nirvana 
 and i remember thinking there 's no way i would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body  
 but then i realized but i 'm still alive  i 'm still
  alive  and i have found nirvana and if i have found nirvana and i 'm still alive  then everyone who is alive can
 find nirvana 
 and i pictured a world filled with beautiful peaceful compassionate loving people who
  that they could come to this space at any time and that they could purposely choose
 to step to the right of their left hemispheres
 and find this peace  and then i realized what a tremendous gift
 this experience could be what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives  
 and it motivated me to recover
 two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage 
 the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers here i am with my mama who is a true angel in my life
  it took me eight years
 to completely recover 
  of the universe with manual dexterity
 and two cognitive minds 
 and we have the power to choose moment by moment who and how we want to be in the world 
 right here right now i can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere 
  power of the universe i am the  life force power of the fifty trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form at one with all that is 
 or 
 i can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere  
 where i become a single individual a solid separate from the flow separate
  inside of me  
 which would you choose  which do you choose  
 and when 
 i believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep
  of our right hemispheres the more peace we will project into the world and the more peaceful our planet will be  
 and i thought that was an idea worth spreading
