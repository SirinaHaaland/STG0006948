  delighted to be here and
 to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart which is beauty  
 i do the philosophy of art  aesthetics actually for a living  
 i try to figure out intellectually philosophically psychologically what
  the experience of beauty is what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it  
 now this is an extremely complicated subject 
 in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different i mean just think of the sheer variety
 a baby 's face
  the wizard of oz or the plays of chekhov a central california landscape a hokusai view of mt fuji der rosenkavalier 
 a stunning match winning goal in a world cup soccer match  van gogh 's starry night 
 a jane austen novel  
 fred astaire dancing across the screen this brief list includes human beings natural landforms works of
  art and skilled human actions 
 an account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy 
 i can however give you at least a taste of what i regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have 
 and we get it not from a philosopher of art not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic
 this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding 
 and you know who i mean  charles darwin 
 of course  a lot of people think they already know
 the proper answer to the question what
  it 's in the eye of the beholder  it 's whatever moves you personally 
 or as some people especially academics prefer beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder  
 people agree that paintings or movies or music
 are are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures
  with great ease  
 beethoven is adored in japan  peruvians love japanese woodblock prints  inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in british museums 
 while shakespeare is translated into every major language of the earth 
 or just think about american jazz or american movies they go everywhere 
 there are many differences among the
  arts but there are also universal
 aesthetic pleasures and values how can we explain
 this universality  
 the best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes 
  our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds
 by the actions of both our prehistoric largely pleistocene environments where we became fully human but also by the social situations in which we evolved 
 this reverse engineering can also
  human record preserved in prehistory i mean fossils cave paintings and so forth 
 and it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter gatherer bands that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries  
 now  i personally have no doubt whatsoever
 that the experience of beauty
  with its emotional intensity and pleasure  belongs to our evolved human psychology 
 the experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of darwinian adaptations 
 beauty is an adaptive effect which we extend
 and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment
  as many of you will know evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms  the first of these is natural selection that 's random mutation and selective retention
 along with our basic anatomy and physiology the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails 
 natural selection also explains many basic revulsions  such as the horrid smell of rotting
  or fears such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff  natural selection also explains pleasures
 sexual pleasure 
 our liking for sweet fat and proteins which in turn explains a lot of popular foods from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs  
 the other great principle of evolution is sexual selection and it operates very differently
  peacock 's magnificent tail
 is the most famous example of this it did not evolve for natural survival in fact it goes against natural survival no
 the peacock 's tail results from the mating choices made by peahens it 's quite a familiar story it 's women who actually push history forward
  darwin himself by the way
  no doubts that the peacock 's
 tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen he actually used that word  
 now  keeping these ideas firmly in mind we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has
 of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination
  order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction 
 beauty is nature 's way of acting at a distance  so to speak i mean 
 you can 't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape it would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover 
 so evolution 's trick is to make them beautiful
  to have them exert a kind of magnetism
 to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them 
 consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes 
 people in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape 
 a landscape that just happens to be similar to the
  pleistocene savannas where we evolved this landscape shows up today on calendars on postcards  in the design of golf courses and public parks
 and in gold framed pictures that hang in in living rooms from new york
 to new zealand  it 's a kind of hudson river school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with
  copses of trees  
 the trees by the way are often preferred if they fork near the ground that is to say  if they 're trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix  
 the landscape shows the presence of water directly in view or evidence of water in a bluish distance  
 indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery
  and finally get this
 a path
 or a road  perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline that extends into the distance  
 almost inviting you to follow it  
 this landscape type is regarded as beautiful even by people in countries that don 't have it
  the ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience 
 but someone might argue that 's natural beauty how about artistic beauty 
 isn 't that exhaustively cultural no i don 't think it is and once again  i 'd like to look back to prehistory to say
  something about it 
 it is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from lascaux and chauvet 
 chauvet caves are about thirty two thousand years old along with a few small realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period
  but artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that 
 beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you 'd see at an arts and crafts fair as well as ochre body paint 
 have been found from around one hundred thousand years ago 
  the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this i have in mind the  so called acheulian hand axes 
 the oldest stone tools are choppers from the olduvai gorge in east africa they go back about two and a half million years 
 these crude tools were around for thousands of centuries until around one point four
  million years ago when homo erectus started shaping single thin stone blades sometimes rounded ovals  but often 
 in what are to our eyes an arresting  symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form 
  africa  almost everywhere homo erectus and homo ergaster roamed  now the sheer numbers of these hand axes
 shows that they can 't have been made for butchering animals 
 and the plot really thickens when you realize that  unlike other pleistocene tools the hand axes
 often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges
 and some in any event are too big to use for butchery 
 their symmetry their attractive materials and above all their meticulous workmanship
 are are simply quite beautiful to our eyes even today so what were these ancient
  somehow familiar what were these artifacts for 
 the best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art  
 practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso
  hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history tools fashioned to function as what darwinians call fitness signals that is to say  
  displays that are performances like the peacock 's tail  except that  unlike hair and feathers the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted 
 intelligence  fine motor control planning ability  conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials 
 over tens of thousands of generations  
 such skills increased the status of those who displayed them and gained a reproductive advantage over the less capable 
 you know it 's an old line but it has been shown to work
  why don 't you come up to my cave so i can show you my hand axes 
 except of course what 's interesting about this is that we can 't be sure how that idea was conveyed 
 because the homo erectus that made these objects did not have language  
 it 's hard to grasp  but it 's an incredible fact  
 this object was made
 by a hominid ancestor homo erectus or or homo ergaster  
 between fifty thousand and one hundred thousand years before language  
 stretching over a million years the hand axe tradition
 is the longest artistic tradition
  by the end of the hand axe epic homo sapiens as they were then called finally were doubtless
 finding new ways to amuse and amaze
 each other
 by who knows telling jokes storytelling  dancing or hairstyling  yes hairstyling i insist on that 
 for us moderns virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies to
  express intense emotions with music  painting and dance  
 but still one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings 
 the beauty we find in skilled performances 
 from lascaux to the louvre to carnegie hall human beings have a permanent
  taste for virtuoso displays in the arts we find beauty in something done well 
 so the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop shaped stone don 't be so sure it 's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful 
 your distant ancestors loved that
  shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it  even before they could put their love into words 
 is beauty in the eye of the beholder  no  it 's deep in our minds it 's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient
  our powerful reaction to images 
 to the expression of emotion in art to the beauty of music to the night sky  will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists 
 thank you
