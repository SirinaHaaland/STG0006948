  is more than belief it 's power and it 's influence 
 and that influence affects all of us every day  regardless of your own belief  
 despite the enormous influence of religion on the world today  we hold them to a different standard of scrutiny and accountability
 than any other sector of our society for example  if there were a multinational organization government
 or corporation today
 that said no female could be on a leadership board not one woman could have a
  not one woman could handle any financial matter 
 we would have outrage  there would be sanctions  and yet this is a common practice in almost every world religion today  
 we accept things in our religious lives that we do not accept in our secular lives  
 and i know this because i 've been doing it for three decades  
 i was the type of girl that fought every form of gender discrimination growing up i played pickup
  basketball games with the boys and inserted myself  i said i was going to be the first female president of the united states 
 i have been fighting for the equal rights amendment which has been dead for forty years
 i 'm the first woman in both sides of my family
 to ever work outside the home and ever receive a higher education  i never accepted being excluded because i was a woman 
 except in my religion
 throughout all of that time i was a part of a very patriarchal
 orthodox mormon religion 
 i grew up in an enormously traditional family i have eight siblings a stay at home mother my father 's actually a religious leader in the community  
 and i grew up in a world believing that my worth and my standing
 was in keeping these rules that i 'd known my whole life you get married a
  virgin you never drink alcohol you don 't smoke you always do service you 're a good kid  some of the rules we had
 were strict  but you followed the rules because you loved the people and you loved the religion and you believed
 everything about mormonism determined what you wore who you dated who you married it determined what underwear we wore
  i was the kind of religious
  where everyone i know donated ten percent of everything they earned to the church including myself from paper routes and babysitting  i donated ten percent 
 i was the kind of religious where i heard parents tell children when they 're leaving on a two year proselytizing mission mission
 that they would rather have them die
 than return home without
  having sinned i was the type and the kind of religious where kids kill themselves every single year
 because they 're terrified of coming out to our community as gay  
 but i was also the kind of religious where it didn 't matter where in the world i lived  
 i had friendship  instantaneous mutual aid this was where i felt safe this is certainty and clarity about life
  i had help raising my little daughter  
 so that 's why i accepted without question that only men can lead  
 and i accepted without question that women can 't have the spiritual authority of god on the earth which we call the priesthood  
 and i allowed discrepancies between men and women in operating budgets  disciplinary councils in decision making capacities and i gave my religion a free pass
 because i loved it until i stopped  and i realized
 that i had been allowing myself to be treated as the support staff
 to the real work of men 
 and i faced this contradiction in myself and i joined with other activists in my community  we 've been working very very very hard for the last decade and more 
 the first thing we did was raise consciousness you can 't
  change what you can 't see 
 we started podcasting blogging writing articles  i created lists of hundreds of ways that men and women are unequal in our community 
 the next thing we did was build advocacy organizations  we tried to do things that were
 like wearing pants to church
 and trying to attend all male meetings  these seem like simple things but to us the organizers  they were enormously costly
 we lost relationships  we lost jobs we got hate mail on a daily basis we were attacked in social media and national press 
 we received death threats  we lost standing in our community some of us got excommunicated most of us got put in front of a disciplinary council and were rejected 
  from the communities that we loved because we wanted to make them better because we believed that they could be
 and i began to expect this reaction from my own people i know what it feels like when you feel like someone 's trying to change you or or criticize you 
 but what utterly shocked me
 was throughout all of this work
 i received equal measures of vitriol from the secular left the same vehemence
 as the religious right  and what my secular
  friends didn 't realize was that this religious hostility these phrases of oh all religious people are crazy or stupid don 't pay attention to religion 
 they 're going to be homophobic and sexist 
 what they didn 't understand
 was that that type of hostility did not fight religious extremism  it bred religious extremism 
 those arguments don 't work  and i know
  because i remember someone telling me that i was stupid for being mormon 
 and what it caused me to do was defend myself and my people and everything we believe in because we 're not stupid  
 so criticism and hostility doesn 't work  and i didn 't listen to these arguments when i hear these arguments i still continue to bristle because i have family and friends
  these are my people and i 'm the first to defend them but the struggle is real  how do we respect someone 's religious beliefs
 while still holding them accountable for the harm or damage that those beliefs may cause others it 's a tough question 
 i still don 't have a perfect answer my parents and i have been walking on this tightrope for the last
  they 're intelligent people they 're lovely people and let me try to help you understand their perspective 
 in mormonism we believe that after you die if you keep all the rules and you follow all the rituals you can be together as a family again  
 and to my parents me doing something as simple as having a sleeveless top right now  showing my shoulders 
 that makes me unworthy  i won 't be with my family in the eternities 
 but even more
  die in a tragic accident at fifteen and something as simple as this
 means we won 't be together as a family and to my parents they cannot understand
 why something as simple as fashion or women 's rights would prevent me from seeing my brother again 
 and that 's the mindset that we 're dealing with and criticism does not change that and so my parents and i have been walking this tightrope
  explaining our sides respecting one another  but actually invalidating each other 's
 very basic beliefs by the way we live our lives and it 's been difficult 
 the way that we 've been able to do that is to get past those defensive shells and really see the soft inside of unbelief and belief
 and try to respect each other while still holding boundaries clear the other thing that the
  secular left and the atheists and the orthodox and the religious right what they all don 't understand
 was why even care about religious activism  i cannot tell you the hundreds of people who have said if you don 't like religion just leave 
 why would you try to change it 
 because what is taught on the sabbath leaks into our politics our health policy violence
  around the world it leaks into education military fiscal decision making these laws get legally and culturally codified 
 in fact my own religion has had an enormous effect on this nation for example  during prop eight my church raised over twenty two million dollars to fight same sex marriage
  forty years ago  political historians will say that if it wasn 't for the mormon opposition to the equal rights amendment we 'd have an equal rights amendment in our constitution today  
 how many lives did that affect  
 and we can spend time fighting every single one of these little tiny laws and rules or we can ask ourselves
  gender inequality the default
 around the world why is that the assumption 
 because religion doesn 't just create the roots of morality 
 it creates the seeds of normality 
 religions can liberate or subjugate 
 they can empower or exploit they can comfort or destroy and the people that tip the scales over to the ethical
  moral are often not those in charge 
 religions can 't be dismissed or ignored we need to take them seriously  
 but it 's not easy to influence a religion like we just talked about but i
 'll tell you what my people have done my groups are small there 's hundreds of us but we 've had huge
  right now women 's pictures are hanging in the halls next to men for the first time women are now allowed to pray in our church wide meetings and they never were before in the general conferences 
 as of last week in a historic move 
 three women were invited down to three leadership boards that oversee the entire church we 've seen perceptual shifts in the mormon community that allow for talk of gender inequality we 've opened up
  regardless of being despised for more conservative women to step in and make real changes and the words women 
 and the priesthood can now be uttered in the same sentence  
 i never had that 
 my daughter and my nieces are inheriting a religion that i never had that 's more equal we 've had an effect 
 it wasn 't easy standing in those
  lines trying to get into those male meetings there
 were hundreds of us  
 and one by one when we got to the door  we were told i 'm sorry this meeting is just for men and we had to step back
 and watch men
 get into the meeting as young as twelve years old  escorted and walked past us as we all stood in line 
 but not one woman in that line will forget that day  and not one little boy that walked past us will forget that day
 if we were a multinational corporation or a government and that had happened 
 there would be outrage  but we 're just a religion we 're all just part of religions 
 we can 't keep looking at religion that way 
 because it doesn 't only affect me it affects my daughter and all of your daughters and what opportunities they have what they can wear who they
  can love and marry if they have access to reproductive healthcare  
 we need to reclaim morality in a secular context that creates ethical scrutiny and accountability for religions all around the world  
 but we need to do it in a respectful way
 that breeds cooperation and not extremism  and we can do it through
 it 's time that half of the world 's population had voice and equality within our world 's religions churches synagogues mosques
 and shrines around the world i 'm working on my people what are you doing for yours
