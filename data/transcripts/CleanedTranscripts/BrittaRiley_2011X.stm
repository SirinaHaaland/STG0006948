  like many of you  am one of the two billion people on earth
 who live in cities  and there are days i don 't know about the rest of you but there are days
  palpably feel
 how much i rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life  and some days that can even be a little scary  
 but what i 'm here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness
 to help heal some
  a couple of years ago i read an article by new york times writer michael pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment 
 now at the time that i was reading this it was the middle of the winter and i definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my new york city apartment 
 so i was basically
  just willing to settle for just reading the next wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future  
 but that was actually exactly the point that michael pollan was making in this article it 's precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists
 that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system
  happen to know a little bit from my own work about how nasa has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space  
 and that you can actually get optimal nutritional yield
 by running a kind of  high quality liquid soil over plants ' root systems 
 now to a vegetable plant my apartment has got to be about as
  foreign as outer space  but i can offer some natural light and year round climate control
 fast forward two years later we now have window farms which are vertical hydroponic platforms for food growing indoors  
 and the way it works is that there 's a pump at the bottom which periodically sends this liquid
  nutrient solution up to the top which then trickles down through plants ' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets so there 's no dirt involved 
 now light and temperature vary with each window 's microclimate so a window farm requires a farmer  
 and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm and whether she is going to feed her
  back at the time a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing 
 and i really wanted it to be an open project because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the united states right now and could possibly become another area like monsanto where we have a lot of corporate
 intellectual property in the way of
  people 's food 
 so i decided that instead of creating a product what i was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of codevelopers 
 the first few systems that we created they kind of worked we were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical new york city apartment window  
 and we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers all kinds of stuff but the first few systems were these
  that martha stewart would definitely never have approved 
 so to bring on more codevelopers what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs we explained how they worked  
 and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems  and then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us  
 so actually now on this
  website we have eighteen thousand people  and we have window farms all over the world 
 what we 're doing is what nasa or a large corporation would call r & d  or research and development but what we call it is r
  that we use air pumps instead of water pumps it took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right but once we did we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half  
 tony in chicago has been taking on growing experiments like lots of other window farmers and he 's been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients 
 and window
  farmers in finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the finnish winters by outfitting them with led grow lights that they 're now making open source and part of the project  
 so window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software  and with every open source project
  the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns  and the universal concerns  
 so my core team and i are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone 
 and we 're able to look out for the needs of newcomers  so for 
 we provide free  very
  so that anyone anywhere around the world can build one of these systems for free  and there 's a patent pending on these systems as well that 's held by the community  
 and to fund the project we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who don 't have time to build their own systems 
 now within our community a certain culture has appeared in our culture
  it is better to be a tester who supports someone else 's idea than it is to be just the idea guy 
 what we get out of this project is support for our own work as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs  
 but i think that eleen expresses best what we really get out of this which is the actual joy of collaboration
  expresses here what it 's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea  built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing  
 if we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we 're all talking about as environmentalists and and food people maybe we just need to ditch the term consumer and get behind the people who are doing stuff 
 open source projects tend to have a momentum of their
  own and what we 're seeing is that r & d i y has moved beyond just window farms and leds into solar panels and aquaponic systems  
 and we 're building upon innovations of generations who went before us  and we 're looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now 
 so we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united 
 and to declare that we are all still pioneers
