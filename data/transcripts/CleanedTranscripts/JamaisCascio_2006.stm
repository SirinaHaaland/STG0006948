  the future that we will create
 can be a future that we 'll be proud of i think about this every day  it 's quite literally my job i 'm co founder and senior columnist at 
 alex steffen and i founded worldchanging in late two thousand and three
  and since then we and our growing global team of contributors
 have documented the  ever expanding variety of solutions that are out there right now and on the near horizon 
 in a little over two years we 've written up about four thousand items
 replicable models  
  emerging ideas all providing a path to a future that 's more sustainable more equitable
 and more desirable 
 our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional 
 there are tons of places to go  online and off if what you want to find is the latest bit of news about just how quickly our
 hell bound handbasket is moving 
 we want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it we focus primarily on the planet 's environment
 but we also address issues of global development  international conflict
  responsible use of emerging technologies even the rise of the so called second superpower
 and much much more the scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad but that reflects both the
 range of challenges that need to be met and the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so
 a quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface but to give you a sense of what we cover 
 tools for rapid disaster relief such as this inflatable concrete shelter
  innovative uses of bioscience such as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines  
 ultra high efficiency designs for homes and offices  distributed power generation using solar power  wind
  vehicles you can get right now and better urban design so you don 't need to drive as much in the first place
 bio mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings  distributed computing projects that will help us model the future of the climate 
 also a number of the topics that we 've been talking about this week at ted are things that we 've addressed in the past on worldchanging
 cradle to cradle design mit 's fab labs the consequences of extreme longevity  
 the one laptop per child project  even gapminder  as a 
 hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday  i 'm naturally inclined to pessimism  but
 working at worldchanging has convinced me much to my own surprise that successful
  responses to the world 's problems
 are nonetheless possible 
 moreover i 've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success 
 as norwegian social scientist evelin lindner has observed pessimism
 is a luxury of good times 
  the truth is we can build a better world and we can do so right now  we have the tools  we saw a hint of that a moment ago and we 're coming up with new ones all the time  
 we have the knowledge and our understanding of the planet improves every day 
 most importantly we have the motive  we have a world that needs fixing and nobody 's going to do it for us 
 many of the solutions that i
  and my colleagues seek out and write up every day
 have some important aspects in common 
 transparency collaboration a willingness to experiment and an appreciation of science or more appropriately science 
 the majority of models tools and ideas on worldchanging encompass combinations of these
  so i want to give you a few concrete examples of how these principles combine in world changing ways  
 we can see world changing values in the emergence of tools to make the invisible visible that is 
 to make apparent the conditions of the world around us that would otherwise be largely imperceptible  
 we know that people often change their behavior when they can see and understand
 the impact of their actions as a small example  many of us have experienced the change in driving
 that comes from having a real time display of mileage showing precisely how one 's driving habits affect the vehicle 's efficiency the last few years have all seen the rise of innovations
 in how we measure and display aspects of the world that can be too big or too intangible or too slippery to grasp easily 
 simple technologies like
  devices that display how much power your household is using  and what kind of results you 'll get if you turn off a few lights
 these can actually have a direct positive impact on your energy footprint  
 community tools like text messaging that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding 
 can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion
 data rich displays like maps of campaign contributions or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps
 allow us to better understand the context and the flow of processes that affect us all 
 we can see world changing values in research projects that seek to meet the world 's medical needs through open access to data and collaborative action 
 now  some people emphasize the risks of knowledge enabled dangers  but i 'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge enabled solutions are far more
  important for example
 open access journals like the public library of science 
 make cutting edge scientific research free to all everyone in the world and actually a growing number of science publishers are adopting this model 
 last year  hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers around the world
 worked together to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible for
  some of the developing world 's worst diseases  african sleeping sickness  leishmaniasis and chagas disease 
 that genome data can now be found on open access genetic data banks around the world  and it 's an enormous boon to researchers trying to come up with treatments  
 but my favorite example has to be the global response to the sars epidemic in two thousand and three two thousand and four 
 which relied on worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the sars virus
  the u s national research council in its follow up report on the outbreak
 specifically cited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason why the treatment for sars could be developed so quickly  and we can see world changing values in something as humble
 as a cell phone i can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this
  for many of us cell phones have really become almost an extension of ourselves  and we 're really now beginning to see the social changes that mobile phones can bring about 
 you may already know some of the big picture aspects globally more camera phones were sold last year than any other kind of camera 
 and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens  and over the network
 and sometimes enter history books
  developing world mobile phones have become economic drivers a study last year showed a direct correlation between the growth of mobile phone use and subsequent gdp increases across africa 
 in kenya mobile phone minutes have actually become an alternative currency  
 the political aspects of mobile phones can 't be ignored either  from text message swarms in korea helping to bring down a government 
 to the blairwatch project in the uk  keeping tabs on
  politicians who try to avoid the press and
 it 's just going to get more wild pervasive always on networks high quality sound and video  even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate it
 's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone
 may be among the world 's most important technologies
  and in this rapidly evolving context it 's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes something far more than a medium for social interaction 
 i 've long admired the witness project and peter gabriel
 told us more details about it on wednesday in his profoundly moving presentation  and i 'm just incredibly happy to see the news that
 witness is going to be opening up a web portal to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones
 to send in their recordings over the internet
  than just hand carrying the videotape not only does this add a new and potentially safer
 avenue for documenting abuses  it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation now  
 imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists imagine a web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what 's happening to the planet 
 putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds
  from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures  
 it would highlight the changes that are underway  but would more importantly give voice to the people who are willing to work to see a new world a better world come about 
 it would give everyday citizens a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet  it would be in essence an
  just to be clear 
 in this talk i 'm using the name earth witness as part of the scenario simply as a shorthand for what this imaginary project could aspire to not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the witness organization 
 it could just as easily be called 
 environmental transparency project smart mobs for natural security but earth witness is a lot easier to say 
 now many of the people who participate in earth witness would focus on ecological
  problems human caused or otherwise  especially environmental crimes and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions that 's understandable and important  
 we need better documentation of what 's happening to the planet if we 're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage  
 but the earth witness project wouldn 't need to be limited to problems in the best worldchanging tradition it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas successful
  projects
 and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility earth witness would show us two worlds the world we 're leaving behind 
 and the world we 're building for generations to come 
 and what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is we could do it today  
 the key components are already widely available camera phones of course would be fundamental to the project and
 for a lot of us they 're as close as we have yet to
 always on widely available information tools  we may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us wherever we go  but very few of us forget our phones 
 you could even imagine a version of this scenario in which people actually build their own phones over the course of last year open source hardware hackers
 have come up with multiple models for
  and the earth phone could spin off from from this kind of project 
 at the other end of the network there 'd be a server for people to send photos and messages to accessible over the web combining a photo sharing service 
 social networking platforms
 and a collaborative
 filtering system 
 now  you web two point zero folks in the audience know what i 'm talking about but for those of you for whom that last sentence was in a crazy moon language  i mean simply this
 the online part of the earth witness project would be created by the users working together
 and working openly 
 that 's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle of what 's now happening to our planet but we could do more 
 an earth witness site could also serve as a collection spot for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet
  environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone now
 you don 't see these devices as add ons for phones yet  but students and engineers around the world have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers and cheap robots
 and the backs of pigeons that being a project that 's actually underway right now  at u c irvine using bird mounted sensors as a way of of measuring
  it 's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing on a phone carried by a person 
 now the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new
 phone makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure  
 swedish firm uppsala biomedical
 more seriously makes a mobile phone add on that can process blood tests in the field  uploading the data displaying the results 
 even the lawrence livermore national labs have
  gotten into the act designing a prototype phone that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs  
 now  there 's an enormous variety of tiny  inexpensive sensors on the market
  and you can easily imagine someone putting together a phone that could measure temperature co2 or methane levels the presence of some biotoxins
 potentially in a
  see that some kind of system like this would actually be a really good fit with larry brilliant 's instedd
 project now all of this data could be tagged with geographic information and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis
 and that 's worth noting in particular
 the impact of open access online maps over the last year or two has been simply phenomenal 
 developers around the world have come up with an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps from
  bus routes and crime statistics to the global progress of avian flu earth witness would take this further linking what you see
 with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world it 's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished
 if something like this ever existed  we 'd have a far better far better knowledge of what 's happening on our planet environmentally than could be gathered with satellites
 and a handful of
  government sensor nets alone  
 it would be a collaborative bottom up approach to environmental awareness and protection 
 able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way and if you need greater sensor density just have more people show up 
 and most important you can 't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth
  this is a system that could put the next generation at the front lines of gathering environmental data 
 and as we work to figure out ways to mitigate the worst effects of climate disruption every little bit of information matters 
 a system like earth witness
 would be a tool for all of us to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and ultimately the improvement of the planet itself
  nobody 's going to do it for us
