  let me tell you a story it goes back two hundred million years it 's a story of the neocortex  which means new rind so in these
 early mammals because only mammals have a
  it was the size of a postage stamp and just as thin and was a thin covering around their walnut sized brain  
 but it was capable of a new type of thinking  
 rather than the fixed behaviors that non mammalian animals have it could invent new behaviors  
 so a mouse is escaping a predator its path is blocked it 'll try to invent
 a new solution that may work it may not but if it does it will remember that and have a new
  behavior and that can actually spread virally through the rest of the community 
 another mouse watching this could say hey that was pretty clever going around that rock and it could adopt a new behavior as well
 non mammalian animals couldn 't do any of those things they had fixed behaviors now they could learn a new behavior but not in the course
  in the course of maybe a thousand lifetimes it could evolve
 a new fixed behavior 
 that was perfectly okay two hundred million years ago the environment changed very slowly it could take ten thousand years for there to be a significant environmental change  
 and during that period of time it would evolve a new behavior now
 that went along fine but then something happened
 sixty five million years ago there was a sudden violent change to the environment we call it the cretaceous extinction event
 that 's when the dinosaurs went extinct  that 's when seventy five percent of the
 animal and plant species went extinct  and that 's when mammals overtook their ecological niche and to 
 biological evolution said hmm 
 this neocortex is pretty good stuff and it began to grow it and mammals got bigger their brains got bigger at an even faster pace
  and the neocortex got bigger even faster than that and developed these distinctive ridges and folds basically to increase its surface area 
 if you took the human neocortex and stretched it out it 's about the size of a table napkin and it 's still a thin structure it 's about the thickness of a table napkin  
 but it has so many convolutions and ridges it 's now eighty percent of our brain 
 and that 's where we do our thinking
 and it 's the great sublimator we still have that old brain that provides our basic drives and motivations but i may have a drive for conquest and that 'll be sublimated
 by the neocortex into writing a poem or inventing an app or giving a ted talk  and
 it 's really the neocortex that 's where the action is fifty years ago i wrote a paper describing how i thought the brain
  worked and i described it as a
 series of modules  
 each module could do things with a pattern it could learn a pattern  it could remember a pattern it could implement a pattern  
 and these modules were organized in hierarchies  and we created that hierarchy with our own thinking  
 and there was actually very little to go on
 fifty years ago
  me to meet president johnson i 've been thinking about this for fifty years  and a
 year and a half ago i came out with the book how to create a mind which has the same thesis but now there 's a plethora of evidence the amount of data we 're getting about the brain from neuroscience 
 is doubling every year  spatial resolution of brainscanning of all types is doubling every year  
  connections connecting in real time firing in real time we can see your brain create your thoughts we can see your thoughts create your brain which is really key to how it works  so let me describe briefly how it works  i 've actually counted
 these modules we have about three hundred million of them  and we create them in these hierarchies i 'll give you a simple example  
 i 've got a bunch of modules
 that can recognize the crossbar to a capital a  and that 's all they care about a beautiful song
  can play a pretty girl could walk by they don 't care but they see a crossbar to a capital a they get very excited and they say crossbar and they put out a high
 probability on their output axon  that goes to the next level and these layers are organized in conceptual levels each is more abstract than the next one so the next one might say capital a that goes up to a higher level that might say
  if the apple recognizer has seen
 it 'll think to itself hmm i think an e is probably likely and it 'll send a signal down to all the e recognizers saying be on the lookout for an e i think one might be coming the e recognizers
  will lower their threshold and they see some sloppy thing could be an e ordinarily you wouldn 't think so but we 're expecting an e it 's good
  've seen an apple 
 go up another five levels and you 're now at a pretty high level of this hierarchy and stretch down into the different senses  and you may have a module that sees a certain fabric hears a certain voice quality smells a certain perfume 
 and will say my wife has entered the room 
 go up another ten levels and now you 're at a very high level you 're probably in the frontal cortex  
 and you 'll have modules that say that was ironic that 's funny  she 's pretty
  might think that those are more sophisticated but actually what 's more complicated is the hierarchy beneath them 
 there was a 16 year old girl she had brain surgery and she was conscious because the surgeons wanted to talk to her you can do that because there 's no pain receptors in the brain 
 and whenever they stimulated particular very small points on her neocortex shown here in red she would laugh so at first they thought they were triggering some kind of laugh reflex
  but no they quickly realized they had found the points in her neocortex that detect humor  and she just found everything hilarious whenever they stimulated these points 
 you guys are so funny just standing around was the typical comment
  and they weren 't funny  not while doing surgery  
  actually beginning to master human language with techniques that are similar to the neocortex i actually described the algorithm which is similar
 to something called a hierarchical hidden markov model something i 've worked on since the ' 90s jeopardy is a very broad
 natural language game and watson got a higher score than the best two players combined it got this query
 a long  tiresome speech delivered by a frothy pie topping and it quickly responded what is a meringue harangue 
 and jennings and the other guy didn 't get that it 's a pretty sophisticated example of computers actually understanding human language and it actually got its knowledge by reading wikipedia and several other
 encyclopedias five to ten years from now search engines will actually be based on not just
 looking for combinations of words and links but actually understanding reading for understanding the billions of pages on the web
 and in books so you 'll be walking along and google will pop up and say  you know mary you expressed concern to me a month ago that your 
  wasn 't getting past the blood brain barrier
  new research just came out thirteen seconds ago that shows a whole new approach to that and a new way to take glutathione let me summarize it for you 
 twenty years from now we
 'll have nanobots because another exponential trend is the shrinking of technology they 'll go into our brain
 through the capillaries and basically connect our neocortex to a
 synthetic neocortex in the
  providing an extension of our neocortex 
 now today  i mean you have a computer in your phone but if you need ten thousand computers for a few seconds to do a complex search you can access that for a second or two
 in the cloud in the 
 you need some extra neocortex you 'll be able to connect to that in the cloud directly from your brain so i 'm walking along and i say oh there 's chris anderson
  's coming my way i 'd better think of something clever to say  i 've got three seconds 
 my three hundred million modules  in my neocortex isn 't going to cut it i need a billion more i 'll be able to access that in the cloud 
 and our thinking then will be a hybrid of biological and non biological thinking  
 but the non biological portion is subject to my law of accelerating returns  it will grow exponentially  
 and remember what happens the last
  time we expanded our neocortex that was two million years ago when we became humanoids and developed these large foreheads 
 other primates have a slanted brow they don 't have the frontal cortex  but the frontal cortex is not really qualitatively different  
 it 's a quantitative expansion of neocortex but that additional quantity of thinking was the enabling factor for us to take a qualitative leap
 and invent language
  and art and science and technology and ted conferences no other species has done that 
 and so over the next few decades we 're going to do it again we 're going to again expand our neocortex only this time we won 't be limited by a
 fixed architecture of of
 enclosure
  it 'll be expanded without limit 
 that additional quantity will again be the enabling factor for another qualitative leap in culture and technology  thank you very much
