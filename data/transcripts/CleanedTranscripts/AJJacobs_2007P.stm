  i thought i 'd tell you a little about
 what i like to write  and
 i like to
 immerse myself in my topics i just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig  
 and
 i see my life as a series of experiments
 so i work for esquire magazine and a couple of years ago i wrote an article called my outsourced life 
 where i hired a team of people in bangalore india to live my life for me  so  
 they answered my emails they answered my phone they argued with my wife for me
 and
  read my son bedtime stories it was the best month of my life  because i just sat back and i
 i read books and watched movies it was a wonderful experience more recently i wrote an article for esquire called
 about radical honesty  and this is a movement where this is started by a psychologist in virginia who says that
  you should never ever lie  except maybe during poker and golf his only exceptions 
 and more than that whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth
  so i decided i would try this for a month this was the worst month of my life 
 i do not recommend this at all to give you a sense of the of the experience  the article was called i
  and it was about the year i spent reading the encyclopedia britannica from a to z in my quest to learn everything in the world 
 or more precisely from aak which is a type of east asian music all the way to
  i don 't want to ruin the ending it 's a very
 exciting twist ending like an o henry novel  so i won 't ruin it but i love that one because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb
  although listening to kevin kelly you don 't have to remember anything you can just
 google it so i wasted some time there
  i love those experiments but i think that the most profound and life changing
 experiment that i 've done is my most recent experiment 
 where i spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the bible the year of living biblically 
 and
 i undertook this for two reasons the first was that i grew up with no religion at all as
  in my book i 'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian so 
 not very 
 but i 've become increasingly interested in religion i do think it 's the defining issue of our time or
 one of the main ones and i have a son i want to know what to teach him  so i decided to dive in head first and try to live the bible  
  the second reason i undertook this is because i 'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism religious fundamentalism
 and people who say they take the bible literally  which is according to some polls as high as forty five or fifty percent of america  
 so
 i decided what if you really did take the bible literally  i decided to take it to its logical conclusion
 and and take everything in the bible literally  without picking and choosing the first thing i did was i
  got a stack of bibles  i had christian bibles i had
 jewish bibles a friend of mine sent me something called a hip hop bible 
 where the twenty third psalm is rendered as the lord is all that as opposed to what i knew it as the lord is my shepherd 
 then i went down and i read
  and i wrote down every single law
 that i could find and this was a very long list over seven hundred
 rules
  and they range from the famous ones that i had heard of the ten commandments 
 love your neighbor be fruitful and multiply  so i wanted to follow those and actually i take my projects very seriously because i had twins during my year so i
 i definitely take my projects seriously  but i
 i also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the bible
  there is the law in leviticus you cannot shave the corners of your beard i didn 't know where my corners were so i decided to let the whole thing grow  and this is what i looked like by the end 
 as you can imagine i spent a lot of time at airport security 
 my wife wouldn 't kiss me
 for the last two months  
 so  certainly the challenge was there the bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers  so i thought sounds strange but i 'll try it you only know if you try it 
 i got rid of all my 
 the bible says that if two men are in a fight and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the
  then her hand shall be cut off  so i wanted to follow that rule 
 that one i followed by default by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby  
 looking like she had a strong grip so
 oh there 's another shot of my
 my beard  i will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing and incredibly challenging and there were two types of laws that were particularly
  challenging  the first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day you know 
 i could spend a year not killing but spending a year not gossiping not coveting not lying you know i live in new york  and i work as a journalist so this was seventy five eighty percent of my day i had to do it
  but it was really interesting because i was able to
 to make some progress because
 i couldn 't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts this was one of the huge lessons of the year is that i almost pretended to be a better person  and i became a little bit of a better person so
 i had always thought you know you change your mind and you change your behavior but it 's
  often the other way around you change your behavior
  and you change your mind so you
 know if you want to become more compassionate  you visit sick people in the hospital  and you will become more compassionate  
 you donate money to a cause  and you become emotionally involved in that cause 
 so it really was cognitive psychology
 you know cognitive dissonance that i was experiencing the bible actually talks about cognitive psychology very primitive cognitive psychology in the proverbs it says
  that if you smile you will become happier which as we know is actually true  the second type of
 of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty first century america  and
 perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning
  it 's a big part of the bible so
 i figured i had to address it so i was able to stone one adulterer it happened
 i was in the park  and i was dressed in my biblical clothing so sandals and sort of a white robe  you know because again the outer affects the inner i wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind
  and this man came up to me and he said why are you dressed like that and i explained my project
  and he said well i am an adulterer  are you going to stone me and i said well that would be great and
 i actually
 took out a handful of of stones from my pocket that i had been carrying around for weeks  hoping for just this
  he grabbed them out of my hand he was actually an elderly man mid 70s just so you know  but he 's still an adulterer  and still quite angry he grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face
  and i felt that i could eye for an eye i could retaliate and throw one back at him 
 so that was my experience stoning  and it did allow me to
  in a more serious way these big issues how can the bible be so barbaric in some places and yet so incredibly wise in others 
 how should we view the bible should we view it you know as original intent like a sort of a scalia version
 of the bible  how was the bible written and actually since this is a tech crowd i talk in the book about
 how the bible actually reminds me of the wikipedia because it has all of these authors and
  editors over hundreds of years and it 's sort of evolved it 's not a book that was written and came down from on high  so
 i thought i would i would end by telling you just a couple of the the take aways the bigger
 lessons that i learned from my year  the first is 
  this became very very clear early on because if you do  then you end up acting like a crazy person and stoning adulterers  or here 's another example 
 well that 's another i did spend some time shepherding  it 's a very relaxing
 vocation i recommend it  but this one is
 the bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month and more than that you cannot sit on
  a seat where a menstruating woman has sat and my wife thought this was very offensive so she sat in every seat in our apartment  
 and i had to spend much of the year standing until
 i i bought my own seat
 and
 and carried it around  so you know i met with creationists i went to
  and these are the ultimate literalists 
 and it was fascinating because they were not stupid people at all i would wager that their iq is exactly the same as the average evolutionist it 's just that their faith is so strong
 in this literal interpretation of the bible that they distort all the data to to fit their model  and they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this 
  i will say though the museum is gorgeous they really did a fantastic job if you 're ever in kentucky  there 's you can see a movie of the flood and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will
 sprinkle on you during the the flood scenes  so  whatever you think of creationism and i think it 's crazy
 they did a great job 
 another lesson is that that thou shalt give thanks and this one was a big
  lesson because i was praying giving these prayers of thanksgiving which was odd for an agnostic  but
 i was saying thanks all the time every day and i started to change my perspective  and i started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day 
 that i didn i didn 't even notice that i
  as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong
  so this is actually a key to happiness for me is to just remember when i came over here the car didn 't flip over and i didn 't trip coming up the stairs it 's
 a remarkable thing  third  that thou shall have reverence this one was
 unexpected because i started the year as an agnostic  and by the end of the year i became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic
 which i love and i 'm trying to start it as a movement so if anyone wants to join  
 the basic idea is whether or not there is a god there 's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness  and that our rituals can be sacred 
 the sabbath can be sacred  this was one of the great things about my year doing the sabbath because i am a
 workaholic so having this one day where you cannot work
  it really that changed my life  so this idea of sacredness whether or not there is a god
 thou shall not stereotype this one happened because i
 i spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout america because i wanted it to be more than about my
 journey i wanted it to be about religion in america  so i spent time with evangelical christians and hasidic
  jews and the amish i 'm very proud because i think i i 'm the only person in america to out bible talk a jehovah 's witness 
 after three and a half hours  he looked at his watch he 's like i gotta go
  interesting because i had some very preconceived notions about for instance evangelical christianity and i found that it 's such a wide
 and varied movement that that it is difficult to make
 generalizations about it  there 's a group i met with called the red letter christians  and they focus on the red words in the bible  which are the ones that jesus spoke that 's how they printed them in the old bibles
  and their argument is that jesus never talked about homosexuality  they have a pamphlet that says here 's what jesus said about homosexuality 
 and you open it up and there 's nothing in it  so
 they say jesus did talk a lot about
 helping the outcasts helping
  this was very inspiring to me 
 i recommend jim wallis and tony campolo
  they 're very inspiring leaders even though i disagree with much of what they say  also thou shalt not disregard the irrational this one was was very
 unexpected because you know i grew up
 with the scientific worldview and
  how much of my my life is governed by irrational forces  and
 the thing is if they 're not harmful  they 're not to be completely dismissed because i learned that
 i was thinking i was doing all these rituals these biblical rituals  separating my wool and linen  
 and i would ask these religious people why would the bible possibly
 tell us to do this why would god care and they said we don 't know but it 's just rituals
 that give us meaning and i would say  but that 's crazy and they would say well what about you you  
 you blow out candles on top of a birthday cake
  if a guy from mars came down and saw  
 here 's one guy
 blowing out the fire on top of a cake
  versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics would the martians say '
 well that guy he makes sense but that guy 's crazy ' so no i think that rituals are 
 by nature irrational so the key is to choose the right rituals the ones that
 that are not
  but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed  and finally
 i learned that thou shall pick and choose  and this one i learned because
 i tried to follow everything in the bible  and i failed miserably because you can 't you have to pick and choose and anyone who follows the bible
 is going to be picking and choosing the key is
 to pick and choose the right parts there 's the phrase
  called cafeteria religion  and the fundamentalists will use it
 in a denigrating way and they 'll say oh it 's just cafeteria religion you 're just picking and choosing but my argument is 
 what 's wrong with cafeterias i 've had some great meals at cafeterias  i 've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave 
  it 's about choosing the parts of the bible about compassion about tolerance about loving your neighbor as opposed to the parts
 about
 homosexuality is a sin  or intolerance or violence  which are very much in the bible as well so if we are to find any meaning in this book  
 then we have to really engage it and wrestle with
