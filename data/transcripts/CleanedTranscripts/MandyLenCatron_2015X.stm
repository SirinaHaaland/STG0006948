  i published this article  in the new york times modern love column in january of this year to
 fall in love with anyone do this 
 and the article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory  and my own experience trying the study myself one
  last summer  
 so the procedure is fairly simple two strangers take turns asking each other thirty six increasingly personal questions
 and then they stare into each other 's eyes without speaking for four minutes so here are a couple of sample questions
  number twelve if you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability what would it be  number 
 when did you last cry in front of another person by yourself as you can see they really do get more personal as they go along  
 number thirty i really like this one tell your partner what you like about them be very honest this
  saying things you might not say to someone you just met  
 so when i first came across this study a few years earlier 
 one detail really stuck out to me and that was the rumor that two of the participants had gotten married six months later  and they 'd invited the entire lab to the ceremony
 so i was of course very skeptical
  about this process of just manufacturing romantic love  but of course i was intrigued  
 and when i got the chance to try this study myself with someone i knew but not particularly well  
 i wasn 't expecting to fall in love  
 but then we did and 
 laughter and i thought it made a good story  so i sent it to the modern
  love column a few months later now this was published in january  
 and now it is august  so i 'm guessing that some of you are probably wondering are we still together  
 and the reason i think you might be wondering this is because i have been asked this question
 again and again and again for the past seven months and this question is really what i want to talk about today but let 's come back to it
 so the week before the article came out i was very nervous  
 i had been working on a book about love stories for the past few years  
 so i had gotten used to writing about my own experiences with romantic love on my blog
 but a blog post might get a couple hundred views at the most and those were usually just my facebook friends  and i
  figured my article in the new york times would probably get a few thousand views  
 and that felt like a lot of attention on a relatively new relationship  
 but as it turned out i had no idea  
 so the article was published online on a friday evening  and by saturday this had happened to the traffic on my blog
  and by sunday  both the today show and good morning america had called  
 within a month the article would receive over eight million views  and i was 
 to say the least underprepared for this sort of attention 
 it 's one thing
 to work up the confidence to write honestly about your experiences with love  but it is another thing
 to discover that your love life has made international news and to realize
 that people across the world are genuinely invested in the status of your new relationship 
 and when people called or emailed which they did every day for weeks they always asked the same question first are you
  guys still together 
 in fact as i was preparing this talk i did a quick search of my email inbox for the phrase are you still together and several messages popped up immediately  they were from students
 and journalists and friendly strangers like this one 
 i did radio interviews and they asked  i even gave a talk and one woman shouted up to the stage
  where 's your boyfriend and i promptly turned bright red  
 i understand that this is part of the deal 
 if you write about your relationship in an international newspaper you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it  but
 i just wasn 't prepared for the scope of the response the thirty six questions seem to have taken on a life of their own in fact
  york times
 published a follow up article for valentine 's day  which featured readers ' experiences of trying the study themselves 
 with varying degrees of success 
 so my first impulse in the face of all of this attention was to become very protective of my own relationship 
  i said no to every request for the two of us to do a media appearance together  
 i turned down tv interviews and i said no to every request for photos of the two us 
 i think i was afraid that we would become inadvertent icons for the process of falling in love  
 a position i did not at all feel qualified for  
 and
  people didn 't just want to know if the study worked  they wanted to know if it really worked that is if it was capable of producing love that would last 
 not just a fling but real love  sustainable love  
 but this was a question i didn 't feel capable of answering 
 my own relationship was only a few months old  and i felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place
  what would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them  if the answer was no would it make the experience of doing these thirty six questions
 any less worthwhile dr arthur aron first wrote about these questions in this study here in 
  study did work the participants did feel closer after doing it  and several subsequent studies have also used aron 's fast
  friends protocol as a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers 
 they 've used it between members of the police and members of community  and they 've used it between people of opposing political ideologies  
 the original version of the story  the one that i tried last summer 
 that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact was referenced in this article but
  unfortunately it was never published 
 so a few months ago  i was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college 
 and a student came up to me afterwards and he said kind of shyly 
 so i tried your study  and it didn 't work 
 he seemed a little mystified by this you mean you didn 't fall in love with the person you did
  it with i asked well he paused i think she just wants to be friends 
 but did you become better friends i asked 
 did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study he nodded so then it worked 
  think this is the answer he was looking for 
 in fact  i don 't think this is the answer that any of us are looking for when it comes to love  
 i first came across this study when i was twenty nine and i was going through a really difficult breakup  
 i had been in the relationship since i was twenty  which was basically my entire adult life 
 and he was my first real love and i had no idea how or if i could make a life
  without him  so i turned to science  
 i researched everything i could find about the science of romantic love  
 and i think i was hoping that it might somehow inoculate me from heartache  
 i don 't know if i realized this at the time
 i thought i was just doing research for this book i was writing but it seems really obvious in retrospect  i hoped that if i
  armed myself with the knowledge of romantic love  i might never have to feel as terrible and lonely as i did then 
 and all this knowledge has been useful in some ways i
 am more patient with love i am more relaxed i am more confident about asking for what i want  
 but i can also see myself more clearly  and i can see
  see that what i want is sometimes more than can reasonably be asked for 
 what i want from love is a guarantee 
 not just that i am loved today and that i will be loved tomorrow  but that i will continue to be loved
 by the person i love
 indefinitely  maybe it 's this possibility of a guarantee that
  people were really asking about when they wanted to know if we were still together  
 so the story that the media told about the thirty six questions was that there might be a shortcut to falling in love  
 there might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved  and this is a very appealing story because falling in love feels amazing  but it 's also terrifying
  the moment you admit to loving someone you admit to having a lot to lose  
 and it 's true that these questions do provide a mechanism for getting to know someone quickly  
 which is also a mechanism for being known  and i think this is the thing
 that most of us really want from love to be known to be seen to be understood
  but i think when it comes to love  we are too willing to accept the short version of the story 
 the version of the story that asks are you still together and is content with a yes or no answer 
 so rather than that question i would propose we ask some more difficult questions questions like 
 how do you decide who deserves your love
 and who does not 
 how do you stay in love when things get difficult  and how do you know when to just cut and run 
 how do you live with the doubt that inevitably creeps into every relationship or even harder how do you live with your partner 's doubt 
  necessarily know the answers to these questions  but i think they 're an important start at having a more thoughtful conversation
 about what it means to love someone 
 so if you want it 
 the short version of the story of my relationship is this a year ago  an acquaintance and i did a study
 designed to create romantic love and we fell in love  and we are still together  and i am so glad
 but falling in love is not the same thing as staying in love  
 falling in love is the easy part  
 so at the end of my article i wrote love didn 't happen to us we 're in love because we each made the choice to be 
 and i cringe a little when i read that now 
 not because it isn 't true but
  because at the time i really hadn 't considered everything that was contained in that choice 
 i didn 't consider how many times we would each have to make that choice  
 and how many times i will continue to have to make that choice
 without knowing whether or not he will always choose me i want it to be enough to have asked and answered
  to have chosen to love someone so generous and kind and fun
 and to have broadcast that choice
 in the biggest newspaper in america  
 but what i have done instead is turn my relationship into the kind of myth i don 't quite believe in 
 and what i want what perhaps i will spend my life wanting is for that myth to be true
  i want the happy ending implied by the title to my article  which is incidentally  the only part of the article that i didn 't actually write 
 but what i have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone  
 and the hope that he will choose to love me back  and it is terrifying but
 that 's the deal with love
