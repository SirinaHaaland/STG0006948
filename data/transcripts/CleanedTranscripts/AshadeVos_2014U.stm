  there were so many right whales in cape cod bay off the east coast of the u s 
 that apparently you could walk across their backs from one end of the bay to the other 
 today they number in the hundreds and they 're endangered 
 like them
  species of whales saw their numbers drastically reduced by two hundred years of whaling where they were hunted and killed for their whale meat
  oil and whale bone 
 we only have whales in our waters today because of the save the whales movement of the 
 it was instrumental
  in stopping commercial whaling and was built on the idea that
 if we couldn 't save whales what could we save 
 it was ultimately a test of our political ability to halt environmental destruction  
 so in the early ' 80s there was a ban on commercial whaling that came into force as a result of this campaign 
 whales in our waters are still low in numbers however because they do face a range of other
  unfortunately  many people still think that whale conservationists like myself
 do what we do only because these creatures are charismatic and beautiful 
 this is actually a disservice because whales are ecosystem engineers
  they help maintain the stability and health of the oceans and even provide services to human society  
 so let 's talk about why saving whales is critical to the resiliency of the oceans  
 it boils down to two main things  
 whale poop
 and rotting carcasses as whales dive to the depths to feed and come up to the surface to breathe
  actually release these enormous fecal plumes 
 this whale pump as it 's called actually brings essential limiting nutrients from the depths to the surface waters where they stimulate the growth of phytoplankton which forms the base of all marine food chains 
 so really having more whales in the oceans pooping is really beneficial to the entire ecosystem 
 whales are also known to
  to undertake some of the longest migrations of all mammals  gray whales off america
 migrate sixteen thousand kilometers between productive feeding areas and less productive calving  or birthing areas and back
 every year  as they do so they transport
 fertilizer in the form of their feces from places that
  have it to places that need it 
 so clearly whales are really important in nutrient cycling  both horizontally and vertically  through the oceans  
 but what 's really cool is that they 're also really important after they 're dead  
 whale carcasses are some of the largest form of detritus to fall from the ocean 's surface and they 're called whale fall
 as these carcasses sink they provide a feast to some 400 odd species including the
 hagfish  
 so over the two hundred years of whaling  when we were busy killing and removing these carcasses from the oceans  
 we likely altered the rate and geographic distribution of these whale falls that would descend into deep oceans and as
  result probably led to a number of extinctions of species that were most specialized and dependent on these carcasses for their survival  
 whale carcasses are also known to
 transport about one hundred and ninety thousand tons of carbon which is the equivalent of that produced by eighty thousand cars
 per year from the atmosphere to the deep
  oceans  
 and the deep oceans are what we call carbon sinks because they trap and hold excess carbon from the atmosphere and therefore help to delay global warming 
 sometimes these carcasses also wash up on beaches and provide a meal to a number of predatory species on
  the two hundred years of whaling was clearly detrimental and caused a reduction in the populations of whales between sixty to ninety percent 
 clearly the save the whales movement was instrumental in preventing commercial whaling from going on but we need to revise this 
 we need to address the more modern pressing problems that these whales face in our waters today  amongst other things  we need to stop them from getting
  plowed down by container ships when they 're in their feeding areas and stop them from getting entangled in fishing nets as they float around in the ocean 
 we also need to learn to contextualize our conservation messages so people really understand the true ecosystem value of these creatures 
 so let 's save the whales again
  but this time  let 's not just do it for their sake let 's also do it for ours  thank you
