 the
  strength
  i 'm not a dancer i 'm not a choreographer i 'm actually a filmmaker a storyteller  i directed a movie two years ago
  during that movie i got to meet a ton of hip hop dancers amazing the best in the world and they brought me into a society the sort of underground street culture that blew my mind i mean this is literally 
 human beings with super human strength and abilities they could fly in the air they could bend their elbow all the way back they could spin on their heads for eighty times in a row i 'd never seen anything like that when i was growing up my heroes were people like
  jackson i grew up in a musical family 
 and those guys those were like  ultimate heroes  being a shy little skinny asian kid growing up in the silicon valley with low self esteem those guys made me believe in something bigger those guys made me want to 
 like i 'm going to do that moonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl 
 and it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared sort of relegated to the
  background of pop stars
 and music videos but after seeing what i 've seen 
 the truth is they have not disappeared at all they 're here  
 getting better and better every day and dance has progressed it is insane what dance is right now dance has never had a better friend than technology online videos and social networking 
 dancers have created a whole global laboratory online for dance where kids in japan are taking moves from a youtube video created in
  detroit  building on it within days and releasing a new video while teenagers in california are taking the japanese video and remixing it with a philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself and this is happening every day  
 and from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages with cheap webcams  
 lies the world 's great dancers of tomorrow our fred astaires our gene kellys our michael jacksons are right at our fingertips and may not have that opportunity  except for us
  we created the lxd  
 sort of a the legion of extraordinary dancers a justice league of dancers that believe that dance can have a transformative effect on the world 
 a living breathing comic book series  but unlike spiderman and iron man  
 these guys can actually do it and we 're going to show you some today so let me introduce to you some of our heroes right now we got madd chadd  lil ' c kid david
 and j smooth
  please be excited have fun yell scream ladies and gentlemen the lxd
  kind of get a kick out of that
 the
 the
  free styling it i actually visually kind of
 picture
 lines and moving them 
 i think of like transformers like how panels open and then they fold they fold in and then
 the
 the
  that point it 's just really like it 's my body and the music it 's not really a
  you can 't make choices anymore and it 's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music  i got my name just because i was so young i was young when i started i was younger than
 a lot of the people i was dancing with so it was always like  they called me kid david  because i was the kid
 that
  throw it out and you hold it  and you let it go and then right when you see the tail you grab it by the tail then you bring it back in and you just got this piece of energy and you just
  you create power then you tame it
