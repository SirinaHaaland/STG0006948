  i didn 't always love unintended consequences but i 've really learned to appreciate them 
 i 've learned that they 're really the essence of what makes for progress  even when they seem to be terrible  and i 'd like to review just how unintended consequences
 play the part
 that they do 
 let 's go to forty thousand years before the present 
 to the time of the cultural explosion when
 music art 
 technology  so many of the things that we 're enjoying today so many of the things that are being demonstrated at ted were born
  anthropologist randall white has made a very interesting observation  that if our ancestors forty thousand years ago
 had been able to see what they had done  they wouldn 't have really understood it  they were responding
 to immediate concerns  they were making it possible for us to do what they do and yet
  they didn 't really understand how they did it now let 's advance
 to ten thousand years before the present  
 and this is when it really gets interesting what about the domestication of grains  what about the origins of agriculture 
 what would our ancestors ten thousand years ago have said if they really had technology assessment  
 and i could just imagine the
  committees reporting back to them
 on where agriculture was going to take humanity at least in the next few hundred years  
 it was really bad news first of all worse nutrition  
 maybe shorter life spans  it was simply awful for women the skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were
 grinding grain morning noon and night
  was awful  it was the beginning of a much higher degree of inequality
 among people if there had been rational technology assessment then  i think they very well might have said let 's call the whole thing off 
 even now our choices are having unintended effects  historically
  according to one japanese anthropologist who wrote a dissertation about it at the university of michigan resulted in long term changes in the
 dentition in the teeth of the japanese public  
 and we are also changing our teeth right now there is evidence that the the human mouth and teeth
 are growing smaller all the time that 's not necessarily
  but i think from the point of view of a neanderthal there would have been a lot of disapproval of the wimpish choppers that we now have so these things are kind of relative to where you or your your ancestors happen to stand  
 in the ancient world
 there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences and there was a very healthy sense of caution  reflected in the tree of knowledge 
 in pandora 's box and especially in the myth of
  prometheus that 's been so important in recent metaphors about technology  and that 's all very true  the physicians of the ancient world especially the egyptians who started
 medicine as we know it were very conscious of what they could and couldn 't treat  and the translations of the surviving
  this i will not treat this i cannot treat they were very conscious so were the followers of hippocrates the hippocratic manuscripts also
 repeatedly according to recent studies show how important it is not to do harm 
 more recently  harvey cushing who really developed neurosurgery as we know it who changed it from a
 field of medicine that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery to one in
  which there was a a hopeful outlook he was very conscious
 that he was not always going to do the right thing but he did his best and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine  
 now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century we find a new style of technology 
 what we find is no longer simple
  tools  but systems we find more and more complex arrangements of machines
 that make it harder and harder to diagnose what 's going on  and the first people who saw that were the telegraphers of the  mid 19th century who were the original hackers 
 thomas edison would have been very very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today and
  hackers had a a word for those mysterious bugs in telegraph systems
 that they called bugs  that was the origin of the word bug 
 this consciousness though was a little slow to seep through the general population even people who were very very well informed  samuel
  mark twain was a big investor in the most complex machine of all times at least until one thousand nine hundred and eighteen registered with the u s patent office that was the paige typesetter 
 the paige typesetter had eighteen thousand parts  the patent
 had sixty four pages of text and two hundred and 
 figures  it was such a beautiful machine because it did everything that a human being did in setting type
  including returning the type to its place which was a very difficult thing and mark twain who knew all about typesetting 
 really was was smitten by this machine  unfortunately he was smitten in more ways than one because it made him bankrupt and he had to tour the world speaking to to recoup his his money  
 and this
  an important thing about 19th century technology that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea
 fall apart even when judged by the most expert people now there is something else  though in the early 20th century that made things even more complicated  
 and that was that safety technology itself could be a source of danger  the lesson of the titanic for a lot of the contemporaries 
 was that you must have enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship
  and this was the result of of the tragic loss of lives of people who could not get into them however 
 there was another case the eastland a ship that capsized in chicago harbor
 in one thousand nine hundred and fifteen and it killed eight hundred and forty one people that was fourteen more than the passenger toll of the
  the reason for it in part was the extra life boats that were added
 that made this already unstable ship
 even more unstable  
 and that again proves that when you 're talking about unintended consequences  it 's not that easy to know the right lessons to draw  it 's really a question of the system how the ship was loaded  the ballast and and
  how much more complex reality was but it also saw a positive side  it saw that invention
 could actually benefit from emergencies it could benefit
 from tragedies  
 and my favorite example of that which is not really widely known as a technological miracle but it may be one of the greatest of all times was
  the scaling up of penicillin in the second world war penicillin was discovered in one thousand nine hundred and twenty eight but even by one thousand nine hundred and forty  no commercially and medically 
  useful quantities of it were being produced a number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it  they were working on it independently and they weren 't getting anywhere  
  and told them that this is something that has to be done  and not only did they do it but within two years  they scaled up penicillin
 from preparation in one liter flasks to
 vats that was how quickly penicillin was produced and became one of the greatest medical advances of all time in the
  world war too the existence of
 solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of great britain so there were benefits
 in calamities benefits to pure science as well as to applied science
  when we come to the period after the second world war unintended consequences get even more interesting  
 and my favorite example of that occurred beginning in 
  when it was discovered that the bacteria causing legionnaires disease had always been present in natural waters  
 but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating ventilating and air conditioning systems
 raised the right temperature for the maximum reproduction
 of legionella bacillus well technology to the rescue  so chemists got to work  and they developed a bactericide that became widely used
 in those systems  but something else happened in the early
  and that was that there was a mysterious epidemic of failures of tape drives all over the united states  and ibm which made them 
 just didn 't know
 what to do they commissioned
 a group of their best scientists to investigate and what they found was that all these tape drives were located
 near ventilation ducts what happened was the bactericide was formulated with minute
  traces of tin  and these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads and were crashing the tape heads 
 so they reformulated the bactericide but what 's interesting to me is that this was the first case of a mechanical device suffering at least indirectly from a human disease so it shows
 that we 're really all in this together
  it also shows something interesting that although our capabilities and technology have been expanding geometrically  unfortunately our ability to model their long term behavior which has also been increasing 
 has been increasing only arithmetically  so one of the characteristic problems of our time is how to close this gap between capabilities and foresight 
 one
  very positive consequence of 20th century technology though was the way in which
 other kinds of calamities could lead to positive advances there are two
 historians of business at the university of maryland  brent goldfarb and david kirsch who have done some extremely interesting
  much of it still unpublished 
 on the history of major innovations they have combined the list of major innovations  and they 've discovered that the greatest number the greatest decade for fundamental 
  innovations  as reflected in all of the lists that others have made a number of lists that they have merged was the great depression  
  the xerox copier  which
 celebrated its 50th anniversary last year  and chester carlson  the inventor 
 was a
 patent attorney he really was not intending to to work in in patent research but he couldn 't really find an alternative
 technical job so this was the best job he could
  get he was upset by the low quality and high cost of existing patent reproductions and so he
 started to develop a system of dry photocopying  which he patented in the late 
 and which became the first dry photocopier that was commercially practical in one thousand nine hundred and sixty
  we see that sometimes as a result of these dislocations as a result of people leaving
 their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference 
 that depressions and and all kinds of other unfortunate events can have a paradoxically stimulating effect
 on creativity what does this mean it means i think
 're living in a time of unexpected possibilities 
 think of the financial world for example  the mentor of warren buffett  benjamin graham developed his system
 of
 value investing as a result of his own losses in the one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine crash  and he published that
  the book still exists in further editions and is still a fundamental textbook so many important creative things can happen
 when people learn from disasters now think of the large and small plagues that we have now
 bed bugs  killer bees  spam
 and it 's very possible that the solutions to those will really extend well beyond the immediate question
  if we think for example of louis pasteur  who in the 
 was asked to study the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry 
 and his discoveries were really the beginning of the germ theory of disease  
 so very often some kind of disaster sometimes the
  of silk worms which was a problem in europe at the time can be the key to something much bigger  so this means that we need to take a different view
 of unintended consequences we need to take a really positive view we need to see what they can do for us we need to learn from
 those figures that i mentioned we need to
  killed patients in the course of his early operations he had to have some errors he had to have some mistakes  and he learned meticulously from his mistakes  
 and as a result 
 when we say this isn 't brain surgery that pays tribute to how difficult it was for anyone to learn from their mistakes in a field of medicine that was considered
 so discouraging in its prospects  and we can also remember
 how the pharmaceutical companies were willing to pool their knowledge to share their knowledge in the face of an emergency  
 which they hadn 't really been for years and years they might have been able to do it earlier  
 the message then for me about unintended consequences is
 chaos happens  let 's make better use of it thank you very much
