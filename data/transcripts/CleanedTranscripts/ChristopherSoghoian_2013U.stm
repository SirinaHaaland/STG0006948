  the two thousand and eleven arab spring captured the attention of the world 
 it also captured the attention of authoritarian governments in other countries who were worried that revolution would spread 
 to respond they ramped up surveillance of activists journalists and dissidents who they feared would
  inspire revolution in their own countries 
 one prominent bahraini activist who was arrested and tortured by his government has said that the interrogators showed him transcripts of his telephone calls and text messages 
 of course it 's no secret that governments are able to intercept telephone calls and text messages  it 's for that reason that many activists specifically
  avoid using the telephone instead they use tools like skype  which they think are immune to interception they 're wrong 
 there have now been over the last few years
 an industry of companies who provide surveillance technology to governments specifically technology that allows those governments to hack into the computers of surveillance targets  rather than intercepting the communications as they go over the wire instead they now
  hack into your computer  enable your webcam enable your microphone and steal documents from your computer  
 when the government of egypt fell in two thousand and eleven activists raided the office of the secret police and among the many documents they found was this document by the gamma corporation by gamma international 
 gamma is a german company that manufactures surveillance software and sells it only to governments 
 it 's important to note that most governments don 't really have the in house capabilities to develop this software smaller ones don 't have
  the resources or or the expertise  and so there 's this market of western companies who are happy to supply them with the tools and techniques for a price gamma is just one of these companies 
 i should note also that gamma never actually sold their software to the egyptian government
 they 'd sent them an invoice for a sale but the egyptians
  never bought it instead apparently the egyptian government used a free demo version of gamma 's software 
 so this screenshot is from
 a sales video that gamma produced really they 're just emphasizing in
 a relatively slick presentation the fact that the police can sort of sit in an air conditioned office and remotely monitor someone without them having any idea that it 's going on you know your webcam light won 't turn on there 's nothing to indicate that the microphone is enabled
  is the managing director of gamma international his name is martin muench there are many photos
 of mr muench that exist this is perhaps my favorite i 'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam you can see there 's a little sticker that 's placed over his camera 
 he knows what kind of surveillance is possible and so clearly he doesn 't want it to be used against
  has said that he he intends for his software to be used to capture terrorists
 and locate pedophiles of course he 's also acknowledged that once the software has been sold to governments he has no way of knowing how it can be used 
 gamma 's software has been located on servers in countries around the world many with really atrocious track records and human rights violations  they really are selling their software around the world 
 gamma is not the only company in the business as i said
 industry one of the other
 big big guys in the industry is an italian company called hacking team now hacking team has what is probably the slickest presentation the video they 've produced
 is very sexy and so i 'm going to play you a clip just so you can get a feel both for the capabilities of the software but also how it 's marketed
  you want to look through your target 's eyes 
 you have to hack your target
  it would be funny if it wasn 't true but in fact hacking team 's software is being sold to governments around the world last year we learned for example that it 's been used to target moroccan journalists by the moroccan government  many many countries it 's been found in 
 so hacking team has also been actively courting the u s law enforcement market in the last year or so the company has
  opened a sales office
  in maryland the company has also hired a spokesperson they 've been attending surveillance industry conferences where law enforcement officials show up they 've spoken at the conferences 
 what i thought was most fascinating was they 've actually paid for the coffee break
 at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year  i can 't tell you for sure that hacking team has sold their technology in the
  i can tell you that if they haven 't sold it it isn 't because they haven 't been trying hard 
 so as i said before governments that don 't really have the resources to build their own tools will buy off the shelf surveillance software and so for that reason you see that 
  the government of say  tunisia might use the same software as the government of germany they 're all buying off the shelf stuff 
  technology and so for several years i 've been trying to figure out if and how the fbi is hacking into the computers of surveillance targets  
 my friends at an organization called the electronic frontier foundation they 're a civil society group
 obtained hundreds of documents from the fbi detailing their next generation of surveillance technologies most of these documents were heavily
  but what you can see from the slides  
 if i zoom in is this term  remote operations unit now when i first looked into this 
 i 'd never heard of this unit before i 've been studying surveillance for more than six years i 'd never heard of it
 and so i went online and i did some research and ultimately
 i hit the mother lode when i when i went to linkedin the social networking site for job seekers  there were lots of former
  government contractors who had at one point worked for the remote operating unit and were describing in in surprising detail on their cvs what they had done in their former job 
 laughter so i took this information
 and i gave it to a journalist that i know and trust at the wall street journal  and she was able to contact several other former law enforcement officials who spoke on background and confirmed that yes in fact 
 the fbi has a dedicated team that does nothing but hack into the computers of surveillance targets
  like gamma and hacking team the fbi also has the capability to remotely activate webcams microphones
 steal documents get web browsing information the works 
 there 's sort of a big problem with governments going into hacking and that 's that terrorists pedophiles drug dealers
  journalists and human rights activists all use the same kinds of computers there 's no drug dealer phone and there 's
  no journalist laptop we all use the same technology  and what that means then is that for governments to have the capability to hack into the computers of the real bad guys they also have to have the capability to hack into our devices too 
 so governments around the world have been embracing this technology they 've been embracing hacking as a law enforcement technique
  but without any real debate in the united states where i live there have been no congressional hearings there 's no law that 's been passed specifically authorizing this technique  and because 
  of its power and potential for abuse it 's vital that we have an informed public debate  thank you very much
