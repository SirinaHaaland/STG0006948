  a story 
 it 's an indian story about an indian woman and her journey  let me begin with my parents  
 i 'm a product of this visionary mother and father 
  didn 't belong to girls in india  they belonged to boys  they belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents and girls would be dolled up to get married 
 my family in my city and almost in the country was unique  we were four of us not one  and fortunately no boys  we were four girls and no boys  and my parents were part of a landed property family
  father defied his own grandfather almost to the point of disinheritance because he decided to educate all four of us 
 he sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education as i 've said when we 're born we don 't choose our parents  and when we go to school we don 't choose our school  children 
  don 't choose a school they just get the school which parents choose for them  so this is the foundation time which i got i grew up
  up like this and so did my other three sisters  and my father used to say at that time i 'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world i don 't know if he really meant [ that ] but it happened i
 'm the only one who 's left in india  one is a british another is an american and the third is a canadian  so we are four of us in four corners of the world  
 and since i said they 're my role models i followed two things which my father and mother gave me one
  said life is on an incline you either go up  or you come down 
 and the second thing which has stayed with me which became my philosophy of life which made all the difference is one hundred things happen in your life good or bad  
 out of one hundred ninety are your creation  they 're good they 're your creation  enjoy it 
 if they 're bad  they 're your creation  learn from it ten are
 you
 can 't do a thing it 's like a death of a relative or a cyclone or a hurricane or an earthquake you can 't do a thing about it you 've got to just respond to the situation but 
  that response comes out of those ninety points since i 'm a product of this philosophy 
  to be valuing what i got i 'm a product of opportunities rare opportunities in the ' 50s and the ' 60s which girls didn 't get and i was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving 
  me was something unique because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry and here i was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities i thought i must tell you this  why i said this is the background  
  service
 as a tough woman 
 a woman with indefatigable stamina because i used to run for my tennis titles etc but i joined the indian police service  
 and then it was a new pattern of policing for me the policing stood for power to correct 
 power to prevent and power to detect  this is something like a new definition
  ever given in policing in india the power to prevent because normally it was always said  power to detect  and that 's it  or power to punish but i decided no it 's a power to prevent 
 because that 's what i learned when i was growing up how do i prevent the ten and never make it more than ten so this was how it came into my service  and it was different from the men  i 
 didn 't want to make it different from the men  but it was different  because this was the way i was different  and i redefined policing concepts in india
  two journeys my policing journey and my prison journey what you see if you see the title called pm 's car held 
 this was the first time a prime minister of india
 was given a parking ticket 
 that 's the first time in india and i can tell you that 's the last time you 're hearing about it it 'll never happen again in india because now it was once and forever
  and the rule was because i was sensitive i was compassionate i was very sensitive to injustice  and i was very pro justice that 's the reason as a woman i joined the indian police service i had other options  but 
  i didn 't choose them  so i 'm going to move on this is about tough policing equal policing 
  postings which others would say no i now went to a prison assignment as a police officer normally police officers don 't want to do prison 
 they sent me to prison to lock me up thinking now there will be no cars and no vips to be given tickets to let 's lock her up 
 here i got a prison assignment this was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals  
 obviously it was  but ten thousand men of which only four hundred were women ten thousand nine thousand plus about six hundred
 were men  terrorists  
 rapists 
 burglars  gangsters some of them i 'd sent to jail as as a police officer outside and then how did i deal with them the first day when i went in i didn 't know how to look 
  at them  and i said do you pray when i looked at the group i said do you pray they saw me as a young short woman wearing
  all right let 's pray i prayed for them  and things started to change  this is a visual of education inside the prison friends this has never happened  where everybody in 
  the prison studies  i started this with community support government had no budget it was one of the finest  largest volunteerism in any prison in the world  this was initiated in delhi prison you see one sample
 of a prisoner
 teaching a class  these are hundreds of classes nine to eleven  every prisoner went into the education program the same den in which they thought they would put me behind 
  the bar and things would be forgotten we converted this into an ashram from a prison to an ashram through education 
  the beginning of a change  teachers were prisoners  
 teachers were volunteers  books came from donated schoolbooks  stationery was donated  everything was donated  because there was no budget of education for the prison 
 now if i 'd not done that it would have been a hellhole  that 's the second landmark i want to show you some moments of history in my journey which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in
  the numbers you 'll never get to see secondly this concept  this was a meditation program inside the prison of over one thousand prisoners 
 one thousand prisoners who sat in meditation this was one of the most courageous steps i took as a prison governor and this is what transformed you want to know more about 
  this go and see this film doing time doing vipassana you will hear about it  and you will love it  and write to me on
  let me show you the next slide  i took the same concept of mindfulness because why did i bring meditation into the indian prison  because crime is a product of a distorted mind 
 it was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control not by preaching not by telling not by reading  but by addressing your mind  i took the same thing to the police  because police equally were prisoners of their minds  and they felt as if it was
 this is a feedback box called a petition box  this is a concept which i introduced to listen to complaints  listen to grievances  this was a magic box  this was a sensitive box  
 this is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison if you see somebody in the blue
 yeah  this guy
 he was a
  and he was a teacher  and you see everybody 's busy there was no time to waste let me wrap it up  i 'm currently into movements 
 movements of education of
  the under served children which is thousands india is all about thousands 
 secondly is about the anti corruption movement in india that 's a big way we as a small group of activists have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of india 
  friends you will hear a lot about it that 's the movement at the moment i 'm driving and
  that 's the movement and ambition of my life
