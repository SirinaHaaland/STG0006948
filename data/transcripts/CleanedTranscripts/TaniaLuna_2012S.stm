  five years old and i am very proud my father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in ukraine
 inside it 's a smelly gaping hole in the ground but outside it 's pearly white
  formica and it literally gleams in the sun
 this makes me feel so proud so important that i appoint myself the leader of my little group of friends and i devise missions for us
 so we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs and we set them free
 four years earlier when i was one after the chernobyl accident
 the rain came down black and my sister 's hair fell out in clumps and i spent nine months in the hospital
 there were no visitors allowed so my mother
 bribed a hospital worker she acquired a nurse 's uniform and she snuck in every night to sit by my side
 five years later an unexpected silver lining thanks to chernobyl we get asylum
  asylum in the u s
 i am six years old and i don 't cry when we leave home and we come to america because i expect it to be
 a place filled with rare and wonderful things like bananas and chocolate and bazooka bubble gum
 bazooka bubble gum with the little cartoon wrappers inside bazooka that we 'd get once a year in ukraine
  and we 'd have to chew one piece for an entire week
 so the first day we get to new york my grandmother and i find a penny
 in the floor of the homeless shelter that my family 's staying in only we don 't know that it 's a homeless shelter we think that it 's a hotel a hotel with lots of rats
 so
 we find this penny kind of fossilized in the floor and we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there because regular
  don 't just lose money and i hold this penny in the palm of my hand and
 it 's sticky and rusty but it feels like i 'm holding a fortune i decide that i 'm going to get my very own piece of bazooka bubble gum
 and in that moment i feel like a millionaire
 about a year later i get to feel that way again when we find a bag full of stuffed animals in the trash and suddenly i have more toys
  than i 've ever had in my whole life
 and again i get that feeling when we get a knock on the door of our apartment in brooklyn and my sister and i find a deliveryman with a box of pizza that we didn 't order
 so we take the pizza
 our very first pizza
 and we devour slice after slice as the deliveryman stands there and stares at us from the doorway and he tells us to pay but we don 't speak english
 my mother
  comes out and he asks her for money but she doesn 't have enough she walks fifty blocks to and from work every day just to avoid spending money on bus fare
 then our neighbor pops her head in and she turns red with rage when she realizes that those immigrants from downstairs have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza
 everyone 's upset but the pizza is delicious
  it doesn 't hit me until years later just how little we had
 on our ten year anniversary of being in the u s we decided to celebrate by reserving a room at the hotel that we first stayed in when we got to the u s
 the man at the front desk laughs and he says you can 't reserve a room here this is a homeless shelter and we were shocked
 my husband brian was also homeless as a kid
  his family lost everything and at age eleven he had to live in motels with his dad
 motels that would round up all of their food and keep it hostage until they were able to pay the bill
 and one time when he finally got his box of frosted flakes back it was crawling with roaches
 but he did have one thing he had this shoebox that he carried with him everywhere containing nine comic books
 two g i joes painted to look like spider man
 and five gobots and this was his treasure
 this was his own assembly of heroes that kept him from drugs and gangs and from giving up on his dreams
 i 'm going to tell you about one more formerly homeless member of our family
 this is scarlett once upon a time scarlet was used as bait in dog fights she was tied up and thrown into
  the ring for other dogs to attack so they 'd get more aggressive before the fight and
 now these days she eats organic food and she sleeps on an orthopedic bed with her name on it but
 but when we pour water for her in her bowl she still looks up and she wags her tail in gratitude
 sometimes brian and i walk through the park with scarlett and she rolls through the grass
 and we just look at her and then we look at each other and we feel
 gratitude we forget about all of our new middle class frustrations and disappointments and we feel like millionaires
