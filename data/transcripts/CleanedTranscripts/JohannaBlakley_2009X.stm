  i heard this amazing story about miuccia prada she 's an italian fashion designer she goes to this vintage store in paris with a friend of hers she 's rooting around she finds this one jacket by balenciaga
 she loves it
 she 's turning it inside out she 's looking at the seams she 's looking at the construction her friend says buy it already she
 said i 'll buy it but i 'm also going to replicate it
 now the academics in this audience may think well that sounds like plagiarism
 but to a fashionista what it really is is a sign prada 's genius that she can root through the history of fashion and pick the one jacket
  that doesn 't need to be changed by one iota and to be current and to be now
 you might also be asking whether it 's possible
 that this is illegal for her to do this
 well it turns out that it 's actually not illegal in the fashion industry there 's very little intellectual property protection
 they have trademark protection but no copyright protection and no patent
  protection to speak of all they have really is trademark protection and so it means that anybody could copy any garment on any person in this room and sell 
  it as their own design the only thing that they can 't copy is the actual trademark label within that piece of apparel
 because they can 't knock off the logo but if you go to santee alley yeah well yeah
 canal street i know and sometimes these are fun right
 now the reason for this the reason that the fashion industry doesn 't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago
 that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection they didn
 't want a handful of designers owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing and then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve because joe blow owns it
 but too utilitarian i mean is that the way you think of fashion this is vivienne westwood no we think of it as maybe too silly too unnecessary
 now those of you who are familiar with the logic behind copyright protection
 which is that without ownership there is no incentive to innovate
 might be really surprised by both the critical success of the fashion industry and the economic success of this industry
 what i 'm going to argue today is that because there is no copyright protection in the fashion industry fashion designers have actually been able to elevate utilitarian design things to cover our naked bodies into something
 we consider art because there 's no copyright protection in this industry
 there 's a very open and creative ecology of creativity
 unlike their creative brothers and sisters who are sculptors or photographers or filmmakers or musicians
 fashion designers can sample from all their peers designs they can take any element from any garment from the history of fashion and
  incorporate it into their own design
 they 're also notorious for you know riffing off of the zeitgeist and here i suspect they were influenced by the costumes in avatar
 maybe just a little can 't copyright a costume either
 now fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry this wedding dress here is actually made of sporks
  and this dress is actually made of aluminum i 've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes as they walk through
 so one of the magical side effects of having a culture of copying which is really what it is is the establishment of trends people think this is a magical thing how does it happen well it 's because it 's legal for people to copy one another
 some people believe that there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain
  who sort of dictate to us what we 're all going to wear
 but if you talk to any designer at any level including these high end designers they always say their main inspiration comes from the street
 where people like you and me remix and match our own fashion looks
 and that 's where they really get a lot of their creative inspiration so it 's both a top down and a bottom up kind of industry
 now the
  fast fashion giants have probably benefited the most from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry
 they are notorious for knocking off high end designs and selling them at very low prices
 and they 've been faced with a lot of lawsuits
 but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers the courts have said over and over again you don 't need any more intellectual property protection
 when you look at copies like this
 's like you wonder how do the luxury high end brands remain in business if you can get it for two hundred bucks why pay a thousand
 well that 's one reason we had a conference here at u s c a few years ago we invited tom ford to come the conference was called ready to share
 fashion and the ownership of creativity
 and we asked him exactly this question here 's what he had to say he had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at gucci in case you
 case you didn 't know and we found after much research that actually not much research quite simple research that the counterfeit customer was not our customer
 imagine that the people on santee alley are not the ones who shop at gucci
 this is a very different demographic and you know a knock off is never
  the same as an original high end design at least in terms of the materials they 're always made of cheaper materials but even sometimes a cheaper version
 can actually have some
 charming aspects can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend
 there 's lots of virtues of copying
 one that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to is that we now have a much broader palette of design
  choices to choose from than we ever have before and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry actually
 and this is a good thing we need lots of options fashion whether you like it or not helps you project who you are to the world
 because of fast fashion global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to and this actually is good news to trend setters they want trends to be set so that they can move product
 for fashionistas they want to stay ahead of the curve they don 't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing and so they want to move on to the next trend as soon as possible
 i tell you there is no rest for the fashionable
 every season these designers have to struggle to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody 's going to love and this let me tell you is very good for the bottom line
 now of course there 's a bunch of effects that this culture of copying has on the creative process and
 stuart weitzman is a very successful shoe designer he has complained a lot about people copying him
 but in one interview i read he said you know it 's really forced him to up his game he had to come up with new ideas new things that would be hard to copy he came up with this bowden wedge heel that has
  to be made out of steel or titanium if you make it from some sort of cheaper material it 'll actually crack in two it forced him to be a little more innovative
 and that actually reminded me of jazz great charlie parker
 i don 't know if you 've heard this anecdote but i have
 he said that one of the reasons he invented bebop was that he was pretty sure that white musicians wouldn 't be able to replicate the sound
 he wanted to make it too difficult to copy
 and that 's what fashion designers are doing all the time they 're trying to put together a signature look an aesthetic that reflects who they are when people knock it off 
 everybody knows because they 've put that look out on the runway and it 's a coherent aesthetic
  move on
 this is not unlike the world of comedy i don 't know if you know that jokes also can 't be copyright protected
 so when one liners were really popular
 everybody stole them from one another but now we have a different kind of comic they develop a persona a signature style much like fashion designers and their jokes much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer really
  only work within that aesthetic if somebody steals a joke from larry david for instance it 's not as funny
 now the other thing that fashion designers have done to survive in this culture of copying is they 've learned how to copy themselves they knock themselves off they make deals 
  with the fast fashion giants and they come up with a way to sell their product to a whole new demographic the santee alley demographic
  fashion designers will say it 's only in the united states that we don 't have any respect
 in other countries there is protection for our artful designs but if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world it turns out that the protection that 's offered is really ineffectual
 in japan for instance which i think is the third largest market they have a design law it protects apparel but the novelty standard is so
  high you have to prove that your garment has never existed before it 's totally unique
 and that 's sort of like the novelty standard for a u s patent which fashion designers never get rarely get here in the states
 in the european union they went in the other direction very low novelty standard anybody can register anything but even though it 's the home of the fast fashion industry and you have a lot of luxury designers there
  they don 't register their garments generally and there 's not a lot of litigation it turns out it 's because the novelty standard is too low
 a person can come in and take somebody else 's gown cut off three inches from the bottom go to the e u and register it as a new original design
 so that does not stop the knock off artists if you look at the registry actually a lot of the registered things in the e u are nike t shirts that are
  almost identical to one another
 but this has not stopped diane von furstenberg she is the head of the council of fashion designers of america and she has told her constituency that she is going to get copyright protection
 for fashion designs
 the retailers have kind of quashed this notion though i don 't think the legislation is going anywhere because they realize it is so hard to tell the difference between a pirated
  design and something that 's just part of a global trend who owns a look
 that is a very difficult question to answer it takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive
 you know it 's not just the fashion industry that doesn 't have copyright protection
  there 's a bunch of other industries that don 't have copyright protection including the food industry
 you cannot copyright a recipe because it 's a set of instructions it 's fact
 and you cannot copyright the look and feel of even the most unique dish
 same with automobiles it doesn 't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look you cannot copyright the sculptural design it 's a utilitarian article that 's why
  it 's too utilitarian magic tricks i think they 're instructions sort of like recipes no copyright protection hairdos no copyright protection
 open source software these guys decided they didn 't want copyright protection
 they thought it 'd be more innovative without it
 it 's really hard to get copyright for databases tattoo artists they don 't want it it 's not cool they share their designs
 jokes no copyright
  protection fireworks displays the rules of games the smell of perfume no
 and some of these industries may seem sort of marginal to you but
 these are the gross sales for low i p industries industries with very little copyright protection and
  so you talk to people in the fashion industry and they 're like shhh don 't tell anybody we can actually steal from each other 's designs it 's embarrassing
 but you know what it 's revolutionary and it 's a model that a lot of other industries like the ones we just saw with the really small bars
 they might have to think about this because right
  now those industries with a lot of copyright protection are operating in an atmosphere where it 's as if they don 't have any protection
 and they don 't know what to do
 when i found out that there are a whole bunch of industries that didn 't have copyright protection
 i thought what exactly is the underlying logic i want a picture and the lawyers do not provide a picture so i made one
 these
  these are the two main sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law it is more complex than this but this will do
 first is something an artistic object then it deserves protection
 is it a utilitarian object then no it does not deserve protection this is a difficult unstable binary
 the other one is is it an idea is it something that needs to
  freely circulate in a free society
 no protection
 or is it a physically fixed expression of an idea something that somebody made and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it
 the problem is that digital technology has completely subverted the logic of this physically fixed expression versus idea concept
 nowadays we
  't really recognize a book as something that sits on our shelf
 or music as something that is a physical object that we can hold it 's a digital file
 it is barely tethered to any sort of physical reality in our minds and these things because we can copy and transmit them so easily actually circulate within our culture 
 a lot more like ideas than like physically instantiated objects
  conceptual issues are
 truly profound when you talk about creativity and ownership and let me tell you we don 't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out they 're smart i 'm with one he 's my boyfriend he 's okay
 he 's smart he 's smart
 but you want an interdisciplinary team of people hashing this out trying to figure out what is the kind of ownership model
 in a digital
  world that 's going to lead to the most innovation
 and my suggestion is that fashion might be a really good place to start looking for a model for creative industries in the future
