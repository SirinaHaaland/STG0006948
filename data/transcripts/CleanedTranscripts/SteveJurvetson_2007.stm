  'm a venture capitalist on weekends  i love rockets  i love photography i love rockets i 'm going to talk about a hobby that can scale and show you photos i 've taken over the years with kids like these that hopefully will grow up to love rocketry and eventually
  a richard branson or diamandis my son designed a rocket that became stable a golf ball rocket i thought it was quite an interesting experiment in
 the principles of rocket science and it flies straight as an arrow  baking soda and vinegar night shots are beautiful  piercing the
 big dipper and the milky way
 2 stage rockets with video cameras on them onboard computers logging their flights rocket gliders that fly back to earth i use rocksim to simulate flights before they go to see if they 'll break supersonic  then fly them with onboard computers to verify performance
 to launch the big stuff you go to the middle of nowhere black rock desert where dangerous things happen the boys and the rockets get bigger they use motors
 used on cruise missile boosters they rumble the belly and leave even photographers in awe  watching the spectacle 
 these rockets use experimental motors like nitrous oxide they use solid propellant most frequently  it 's a strange kind of love
  with my photos if you want to learn about this participate be a spectator we had to call it rocket mavericks this one was great went to one hundred thousand feet actually it went eleven feet into solid clay and became a 
  had to be dug out rockets often spiral out of control if you put too much propellant in them here was a drag race at night you can see what happened in a second in daytime we call them land sharks  
 sometimes they just explode before your eyes or come down
  to take this shot i did what i often do which is go way beyond the pads where none of the spectators are and if we can run the video i 'll show you what it took to get this dreamworks shot
  and that 's me over there taking photos the whole way 
 things often go wrong  some people watch this because of a nascar like fascination with things bumping and grinding burning the parachute as it fell that was last weekend this guy went up went supersonic ripped the fin can off the art sale in the sky
 a burning metal hunk coming back these things dropped down from above all through the weekend of rocket launch after rocket launch it 's a cadence
  you can 't quite imagine
 i try to capture the mishaps it 's a challenge in photography when these things take place in a fraction of a second  why do it for things like this gene from alabama drives out there
  with this rocket he 's built with x ray sensors video cameras festooned with electronics he succeeds getting to one hundred thousand feet leaving the atmosphere  seeing a thin blue line of space it is this breathtaking image success of course that motivates us
  understand rocket science understand the importance of physics and math and in many ways to have that awe at exploration of the frontiers of the unknown thank you
