  charles darwin was born a very lightly pigmented man in a
  pigmented world  over the course of his life darwin had great privilege he lived
  in a fairly wealthy home he was raised by very supportive and interested parents  
 and when he was in his 20s he embarked upon a remarkable voyage on the ship the beagle  and during the course of that voyage he saw remarkable things tremendous diversity of plants and animals  
  and the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book on the origin of species published one hundred and fifty years ago  
 now
 what is so interesting and to some the extent what 's
 a bit infamous about the origin of species is that there is only one line in it about human
  will be thrown on the origin of man and his history 
 it wasn 't until much longer much later that darwin actually spoke
 and wrote about humans  now in his years of
 traveling on the beagle  and from listening to the accounts or explorers and naturalists  he knew that skin color
 was one of the most important ways in which people
  varied  
 and he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color  he knew that darkly pigmented peoples were found close to the equator lightly pigmented peoples like himself were found closer to the poles  
 so what did he make of all this  well he didn 't write anything about it in the origin of species
  he did have something to say about it and it was quite curious 
 he said of all the differences between the races of men the color of the skin is the most conspicuous and one of the best marked 
 and he went on to say these differences do not coincide with corresponding differences in climate 
 so he had traveled all around he had seen
 people of different colors living in different places and yet he
 rejected the idea that human skin pigmentation was related to the climate  
 if only darwin lived today  if only darwin had nasa  
 now one of the wonderful things that nasa does is it puts up a variety of satellites that detect all sort of interesting things about our environment 
 and for many decades now
  there have been a series of toms satellites that have collected data about the radiation of the earth 's surface  
 the toms seven satellite data shown here 
 show the annual average ultraviolet radiation at the earth 's surface  
 now the really hot pink and red areas are those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts of uv during the year  the incrementally
 cooler colors blues greens yellows and finally grays indicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation what 's significant to the story 
  of human skin pigmentation is just how much of the northern hemisphere is in these cool gray zones this has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation
  and what darwin could not appreciate or didn 't perhaps want to appreciate at the time  
 is that there was a fundamental relationship between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and skin pigmentation  and that skin pigmentation itself
 was a product of evolution and so when we look at a map of skin color and predicted skin color
  as we know it today  what we see is a beautiful gradient from the darkest skin pigmentations toward the equator  and the lightest ones toward the poles 
 what 's very very important here is that
 the earliest humans evolved in
  earliest members of our lineage  the genus homo were darkly pigmented 
 and we all share this incredible heritage of having originally been darkly pigmented  two million to one and half million years ago  
 now what happened in our history  
 let 's first look at the relationship of ultraviolet radiation to the earth 's surface  in those early days
  of our evolution looking at the equator  we were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation the uvc the most energetic type was occluded 
  by the earth 's atmosphere but uvb and uva especially came in unimpeded uvb turns out to be incredibly important it
  but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin d in the skin 
 vitamin d being a molecule that we very much need for our strong bones  the health of our immune system and myriad other important functions in our bodies 
 so living at the equator  we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and
 the melanin this
  in our skin served as a superb natural sunscreen 
 this polymer is amazing because it 's present in so many different organisms melanin in various forms has probably been on the earth a billion years and 
  has been recruited over and over again by evolution as often happens
  change it if it works  
 so melanin was recruited in our lineage and specifically in our earliest ancestors evolving in africa 
 to be a natural sunscreen  where it protected the body against the degradations of ultraviolet radiation  the destruction or damage to dna  and the breakdown of a very important molecule
  which helps to fuel cell production and reproduction in the body 
 so it 's wonderful we evolved this very protective wonderful covering of melanin but then
 we moved  
 and humans dispersed not once but twice  major moves outside of our equatorial homeland from africa into other parts of the old world and most recently
  into the new world when humans dispersed into these latitudes 
 what did they face  conditions were significantly colder  but they were also less intense with respect to the ultraviolet regime so 
 if we 're somewhere in the northern hemisphere look at what 's happening to the ultraviolet radiation we 're still getting a dose of uva  but all of the
 uvb or nearly all of it is dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere  
 in the winter 
 when you are skiing in the alps you may experience ultraviolet radiation but it 's all uva 
 and significantly that uva has no ability to make vitamin d in your skin
  so people inhabiting northern hemispheric environments were bereft
 of the potential to make vitamin d in their skin for most of the year  this had tremendous consequences for the evolution of human skin pigmentation  because what happened in order to ensure health and well being 
 these lineages of people dispersing into the northern hemisphere
 lost their pigmentation
  there was natural selection for the evolution of lightly pigmented skin  
 here we begin to see the evolution of the beautiful sepia rainbow that now characterizes all of humanity lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once 
 not just twice but probably
 probably three times not just in modern humans but in one of our distant unrelated ancestors  
 the neanderthals 
 a remarkable remarkable testament to the power of evolution 
 humans have been on the move for a long time  and just in the last five thousand years in increasing rates over increasing distances here are just some of the biggest movements of people 
  in the last five thousand years look at some of the major latitudinal transgressions people from high uv areas going to low uv and vice versa  
 and not all these moves were voluntary between one thousand five hundred and twenty and 
 twelve million five hundred people were moved from high uv to low
  in the transatlantic slave trade 
 now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences but it also had deleterious health consequences to people 
 so what we 've been on the move we
 're so clever we can overcome all of these these seeming biological impediments well 
 often we 're unaware of the fact that we 're living in environments in which our skin is inherently poorly
  adapted some of us with lightly pigmented skin live in high uv areas some of us with darkly pigmented skin live in low uv areas these have tremendous consequences for our health 
 we have to if we 're lightly pigmented be careful about the the problems of
  and destruction of folate in our bodies by lots of sun  
 epidemiologists and doctors have been very good about telling us about protecting our skin 
 what they haven 't been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas  or working inside all the time
  because the problem there is just as severe  but it is more sinister  because vitamin d deficiency from a lack of ultraviolet b radiation 
 is a major problem vitamin d deficiency creeps up on people and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones 
 to their gradual decay of their immune systems or loss of immune function and probably some problems with their their mood and health their mental health
 so we have in skin pigmentation  one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today  
 and the social consequences  as we know are incredibly profound 
 we live in a world where we have lightly and darkly pigmented people living next to one another but often brought into proximity initially
  as a result of very invidious social interactions  
 so how can we overcome this how can we begin to understand it evolution helps us  
 two hundred years after darwin 's birthday we have the first moderately pigmented president of the united states 
 how wonderful is that
 this man is significant for a whole host of reasons  
 but we need to think about how he compares in terms of his pigmentation to other people on earth he as one of many urban admixed populations is very emblematic of a mixed parentage of a mixed pigmentation
  and he resembles very closely people with moderate levels of pigmentation who live in southern africa  or southeast asia  
 these people have a tremendous potential to tan to develop more pigment in their skin as a result of exposure to sun they also run the risk of vitamin d 
  deficiency  if they have desk jobs  like that guy
  the evolution of human skin pigmentation
  what is the evidence for evolution you don 't have to think about some exotic examples or fossils you just have to look at your skin 
 darwin i think would have appreciated this 
 even though he eschewed the importance of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life  i think were he
 able to look at the evidence we have today
 he would understand it  he would appreciate it  and most of all he would teach it
  products of evolution
