  computer science and engineering professor here at carnegie mellon and my research focuses on usable privacy and security  
 and so my friends like to give me examples of their frustrations with computing
  so passwords are something that i hear a lot about a lot of people are frustrated with passwords  and it 's bad enough when you have to have one really good password that you can remember but nobody else is going to be able to guess
 but what do you do when you have accounts on a hundred different systems and you 're supposed to have a unique password for each of these systems
 it 's tough 
 at carnegie mellon they used to make it actually pretty easy for us to remember our passwords the password requirement up through two thousand and nine was just that you had to have a password with at least one character 
 pretty easy  but then they changed things  and at the end of two thousand
  they announced that we were going to have a new policy  and this new policy required passwords that were at least eight characters long with an uppercase letter lowercase letter a digit a symbol 
 you couldn 't use the same character more than three times and it wasn 't allowed to be in a dictionary 
 i got curious  and i decided to go talk to the people in charge of our computer systems and find out what led them to introduce this new policy  
 and they said that the university had joined a consortium of universities and one of the requirements of membership was that we had to have stronger passwords that complied with some new requirements
  and these requirements were that our passwords had to have a lot of entropy  now entropy is a complicated term but basically it measures the strength of passwords  
 but the thing is there isn 't actually a standard measure of entropy  now the national institute of standards and technology has a set of guidelines which
 have some rules of thumb for measuring entropy  but they don 't have anything too specific  and the reason
  they only have rules of thumb is it turns out they don 't actually have any good data on passwords 
 in fact their report states unfortunately we do not have much data on the passwords users choose under particular rules nist would like to obtain 
  more data on the passwords users actually choose but system administrators are understandably reluctant to reveal password data to others 
  there 's a need for good password data  maybe we can collect some good password data and actually advance the state of the art here 
 so the first thing we did is we got a bag of candy bars and we walked around campus
 and talked to students faculty and staff and asked them for information about their passwords  now we didn 't say give us your password 
  we just asked them about their password  how long is it  does it have a digit does it have a symbol and
 were you annoyed at having to create a new one last week  
 so we got results from four hundred and seventy students faculty and staff
  and indeed we confirmed that the new policy was very annoying  but we also found that people said they felt more secure with these new passwords
  we found that most people knew they were not supposed to write their password down and only thirteen percent of them did
  but disturbingly  eighty percent of people said they were reusing their password  
 now this is actually more dangerous than writing your password down  because it makes makes you much more susceptible to attackers so if you have to write your passwords down but don 't reuse them 
 we also found some interesting things about the symbols people
  possible symbols but as you can see there 's only a small number that most people are using so we 're not actually getting very much strength from the symbols in our passwords
  so this was a really interesting study and now we had data from four hundred and seventy people but in the scheme of things that 's really not very much password data
 and so we looked around to see where could we find additional password data  so it turns out there are a lot of people going around
  stealing passwords
  and they often go and post these passwords on the internet  so we were able to get access to some of these stolen password sets 
 this is still not really ideal for research  though  because it 's not entirely clear where all of these passwords came from or exactly what policies were in effect when people created these passwords
 so we wanted to find some better source of data
 so we decided that one thing we could do is we could do a study and have people actually create passwords for our study  
 so we used a service called amazon mechanical turk  and this is a service where you can post a small job online that takes a minute a few minutes an hour  and pay people a penny ten cents a few dollars to do a task for
  and then you pay them through  amazon com 
 so we paid people about fifty cents to create a password following our rules and answering a survey  and then we paid them again to come back two days later and log 
  in using their password and answering another survey  so we did this and we collected five thousand passwords  
  password had to have at least eight characters 
 then some people had a much harder policy and this was very similar to the cmu policy that it had to have eight characters including uppercase lowercase digit symbol  and pass a dictionary check 
 and one of the other policies we tried and there were a whole bunch more but one of the ones we tried was called 
  and the only requirement here was that your password had to have at least sixteen characters all right
 so now we had five thousand passwords  and so we had
 much more detailed information again we see that there 's only a small number of symbols that people are actually using in their passwords  
 we also wanted to get an idea of how strong the passwords were that people were were creating  but as you may recall
  there isn 't a good measure of password strength 
 so what we decided to do was to see how long it would take to crack these passwords using the best cracking tools that the bad guys are using or that we could find information about in the research literature 
 so to give you an idea of how bad guys go about cracking passwords  they will steal a password file that will have all of the passwords in kind of a scrambled form
  and so what they 'll do is they 'll make a guess as to what a password is run it through a hashing function and see whether it matches the passwords they have on their stolen password list 
 so a dumb attacker will try every password in order they 'll start with
 and this is going to take a really long time before they get any passwords that people are really likely to actually have 
 a smart attacker on the other hand  does something much more clever
  they look at the passwords that are known to be popular from these stolen password sets and they guess those first so they 're going to start by guessing password and then they 'll guess i love you
  all of these five thousand passwords we collected through these tests to see how strong they were 
 we found that the the long passwords were actually pretty strong  and the complex passwords were pretty strong too  
 however when we looked at the survey data  we saw that people
 were really frustrated by the very complex passwords  and the long passwords were a lot more usable and in some cases
  actually even stronger than the complex passwords  so this suggests that instead of telling people that they need to put all these symbols and numbers and crazy things into their passwords we might be better off just telling people to have long passwords  
 now here 's the problem  though some people had long passwords that actually weren 't very
  you can make long passwords that are still the sort of thing that an attacker could easily guess  so we need to do more than just say long passwords there has to be some additional requirements 
 and some of our ongoing research is looking at what additional requirements we should add to make for stronger passwords that also are going to be easy for people to remember and type 
  these on the internet when you were creating passwords 
 we decided to do a study to find out whether these password meters actually work do they actually help people have stronger passwords  and if so 
 which ones are better  so we tested password meters that were different sizes shapes colors different words next to them and we even tested one that was a dancing bunny 
  the bunny dances faster and faster so this was pretty fun  what we found
 was that password meters do work 
 most of the password meters were actually
 effective  
 and the dancing bunny was very effective too  but the password meters that were the most effective were the ones that made you work harder before they gave you that thumbs up
  and said you were doing a good job and in fact we found that most of the password meters on the internet today are too soft  they tell you you 're doing a good job too early  and if they would just wait a little 
  bit before giving you that positive feedback you probably would have better passwords  
  years ago  and the cartoonist suggests that we should all use pass phrases and if you look at the second row of this cartoon you can see the cartoonist is suggesting that 
  the pass phrase correct horse battery staple would be a very strong pass phrase and something really easy to remember he says in fact you 've already remembered it
 everybody who i talk to who i mention i 'm doing password research they point out this cartoon oh have you seen it that xkcd  correct horse battery staple 
 so we did the research study to see
 what would actually happen  so in our study we used mechanical turk again and
 we had the computer pick the random words in the pass phrase now the reason we did this is that humans are not very good at picking random words
  if we asked a human to do it they would pick things that were not very random  
 so we tried a few different conditions in one condition the computer picked from a dictionary of the very common words in the english language  and so you 'd get pass phrases like try there three come 
 and we looked at that and we said well that doesn 't really seem very memorable 
 so then we tried picking words that came from specific parts of speech
 that comes up with something that 's sort of sentence like so you can get a pass phrase like plan builds sure power or end determines red drug 
 and these seemed a little bit more memorable and maybe  maybe people would like those a little bit better 
 we wanted to compare them with passwords and so we had the computer pick random passwords  and these were nice and short  but as you can see they don 't really
  very memorable
 and then we decided to try something called a pronounceable password so here the computer picks random syllables and puts them together so you have something
 sort of pronounceable like tufritvi and vadasabi that one kind of rolls off your tongue 
 so these were random passwords that were generated by our computer 
 so what we found in this study was that surprisingly pass phrases
 were not actually all that good 
 people were not really better at remembering the pass phrases than these random passwords  and because the pass phrases are longer  they took longer to type and people made more errors while typing them in 
 so it 's not really a clear win for pass phrases sorry all of you xkcd fans
  on the other hand  we did find that
  passwords worked surprisingly well  and so we actually are doing some more research to see if we can make that approach work even better 
 so one of the problems with some of the studies that we 've done is that because they 're all done using mechanical turk these are not people 's real passwords they 're the passwords that they created or the computer created for them for our
  and we wanted to know whether people would actually behave the same way with their real passwords
  so we talked to the information security office at carnegie mellon and asked them if we could have everybody 's real passwords
  not surprisingly they were a little bit reluctant to share them with us but we were actually able to work out a system with them where they put all of the real passwords for twenty five thousand cmu students faculty
  into a locked computer in a locked room not connected to the internet and they ran code on it that we wrote to analyze these passwords  they audited our code  they ran the code
  and so we never actually saw anybody 's password 
 we got some interesting results and those of you tepper students in the back will be very interested in this
  so we found that the the
 passwords created by people affiliated with the school of computer science were actually one point eight times stronger than those affiliated with the business school
  we have lots of other really interesting demographic information as well 
 the other interesting thing that we found is that when we compared the carnegie mellon passwords to the mechanical turk generated passwords  there was actually a lot of similarities
  and so this helped validate our research method and show that
  collecting passwords using these mechanical turk studies is actually a valid way to study passwords so that was good news 
 okay i want to close by talking about some insights i gained while on sabbatical last year in the carnegie mellon art school 
 one of the things that i did is i made a number of quilts  and i made this quilt here it 's called security blanket
  stolen from the rockyou website
  and the size of the passwords is proportional to how frequently they appeared in the stolen dataset
  and what i did is i created this word cloud and i went through all one thousand words and i categorized them into
 loose thematic categories  and it was in some cases it was kind of difficult to figure out what category they should be in
 color coded them so here are some examples of the difficulty so justin is that the name of the user their boyfriend their son maybe they 're a justin bieber fan 
 or princess is that a nickname are they disney princess fans or maybe that 's the name of their cat 
 iloveyou appears many times in many different languages there 's a lot of love in these
  passwords  if you look carefully you 'll see there 's also some profanity
  but it was really interesting to me to see that there 's a lot more love than hate in these passwords  
 and there are animals
 a lot of animals and monkey is the most common animal and the  14th most popular password overall
  this was really curious to me and i wondered why are monkeys so popular 
 and so in our last password study any time we detected somebody creating a password with the word monkey in it we asked them why they had a monkey in their password 
 and what we found out we found seventeen people so far i think  who have the word monkey we found out about a third of them said they have a pet named
  a friend whose nickname is monkey and about a third of them said that they just like monkeys and monkeys are really cute and
 that guy is really cute  so
 it seems that at the end of the day when we make passwords we either make something that 's really easy to type a common pattern 
 or things that remind us of the word password or the account that we 've created the password for or whatever 
 or we
  think about things that make us happy  and we create our password based on things that make us happy  
 and while this makes typing and remembering your password more fun 
 it also makes it a lot easier to guess your password so i know a lot of these ted talks are inspirational and they make you think about nice happy things 
 but when you 're creating your password  try to think about something else thank you
