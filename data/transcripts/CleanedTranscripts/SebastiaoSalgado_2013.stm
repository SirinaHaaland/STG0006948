  i 'm not sure that every person here is familiar with my pictures i want to start to show just a few pictures to you and after
  in brazil in the times that brazil was not yet a market economy i was born on a farm a farm that was more than fifty percent rainforest
  a marvelous place i lived with incredible birds incredible animals  i swam in our small rivers with our caimans it
 was about thirty five families that lived on this farm  
 and everything that we produced on this farm  we consumed very few things went to the market once
  the only thing that went to the market was the cattle that we produced and we made trips of about forty five days to reach the slaughterhouse  bringing thousands of head of cattle 
 and about twenty days traveling back to reach our farm again  
 when i was fifteen years old it
 was necessary for me to leave this place and go to a town a little bit bigger much bigger where i did the second part of secondary school
  learned different things brazil was starting to urbanize  industrialize  and
 i knew the politics  i became a little bit radical  i was a member of leftist parties  and
 i became an activist i [ went to ] university to become an economist i [ did ] a master 's degree in economics 
  my associate in everything that i have done till now my wife llia wanick salgado 
 brazil radicalized very strongly we fought very hard against the dictatorship in a moment it was necessary to
  we were too young  and
 our organization thought it was better for us
 to go out  and we went to france where i did a phd in economics lila became an architect 
 i worked after for an investment bank  we made a lot of trips financed development  economic projects in africa with the
  and one day photography made a total invasion in my life  i became a photographer  abandoned everything and became a photographer  and i started to do the photography
 that
 was important for me many people tell me that you are a photojournalist that you are an anthropologist photographer that you are
 an activist photographer  but
 i did much more than that i put photography as my life  i lived totally inside photography doing
  long term projects  and i want to show you just a few pictures of again  you 'll see
 inside the social projects that i went to i published many books on
  to two thousand  i photographed a story
  but during the time that i was photographing this  i lived through a very hard moment in my life  mostly in rwanda 
 i saw in rwanda
 total brutality  i saw deaths by thousands per day i lost my faith
 in our species  i didn 't believe that it was possible for us to live any longer  and i started to be attacked
 by my own staphylococcus  
 i started to have infection everywhere  when i made love with my wife i had no sperm that came out of me  
 i had blood  i went to see a friend 's doctor in paris told him that i was completely sick  he made a long examination 
  you are not sick your prostate is perfect what happened is you saw so many deaths
 that you are dying  you must stop
 stop  you must stop because on the contrary you will be dead and i made the
 decision to stop  i was really upset with photography with everything in the world and i made the decision
  to go back to where i was born it was a big coincidence it was the moment that my parents
 became very old  
 i have seven sisters i 'm one of the only men in my family  and they made together the decision to transfer this land to lila and myself  
 when we received this land this land
 was as dead as i was when i was a kid it was more than fifty percent rainforest
  when we received the land it was less than half a percent
 rainforest  as in all my region  to build development  brazilian development  
 we destroyed a lot of our forest as you did here in the united states or you did in india everywhere in this planet  
 to build our development we come to a huge contradiction that we destroy around us everything 
 this farm that had thousands of head of cattle had just a few hundreds
  and we didn 't know how to deal with these and lila came up with an incredible idea 
 a crazy idea she said why don 't you put back the rainforest that was here before you say that you were born in paradise let 's build the paradise again  
 and
 i went to see a good friend that was engineering forests to prepare a project for us  and we started we started to plant
 year we lost a lot of trees  second year less and slowly slowly this dead land started to be born again  
 we started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees  only local species  only native species  where we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed  
 and the life started to come back in an incredible way it
 was necessary
  transform our land into a national park  we transformed we gave this land back to nature it became a national park  we created an institution called instituto terra 
 and we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere here in los angeles in the bay area in san francisco it became tax deductible
  money in spain in italy a lot in brazil we worked with a lot of companies in brazil that put money into this project the government
 and the life started to come  and i had a big wish to come back to photography to photograph again  
 and this time my wish was not to photograph anymore just one animal that i had photographed all my life 
 us  i wished
 photograph the other animals  to photograph the landscapes to photograph us  but us from the beginning the time we lived in equilibrium with nature  
 and
 i went i started in the beginning of two thousand and four  and i finished at the end of two thousand and eleven 
 we created an incredible amount of pictures and the result llia did the design of all my books the design of all my shows
  is to create a discussion about what we have that is pristine on the planet and what we must hold on this planet if we want to live to have some equilibrium in our life  
 i wanted to see us when
 we used yes our instruments in stone we exist yet  i was last week at the brazilian national indian foundation
  and only in the amazon we have about one hundred and ten groups of indians that are not contacted yet we must protect the forest in this sense 
 and with these pictures i hope that we can create
 information a system of information  we tried to do a new presentation of the planet and i want to show
  you now just a few pictures of this project
  to build our societies  our modern family of societies  we are at a point where we cannot go back  
 but we create an incredible contradiction to build all this we destroy a lot our forest
  destroyed your forest around here no the redwood forests are gone gone very fast disappeared  
 coming the other day from atlanta here two days ago i was flying over deserts that we made we provoked with our own hands india has no more trees spain has no more
  of our life these forests we need to breathe  the only
 factory capable to transform co2 into oxygen 
 are the forests the only machine capable to capture the carbon that we are producing
 i put the question
 three or four weeks ago  we saw in the newspapers
 millions of fish that die in norway 
 a lack of oxygen in the water  i put to myself the question if for a moment  
 we will not lack oxygen for all animal species  ours included that would be very complicated for us 
 for the water system the trees
 are essential i 'll give you a small example that you 'll understand very easily  you happy people that have a lot of hair on your head 
 if you take a shower it takes you
 two or three hours
 to dry your hair if you don 't use a dryer machine me one minute it 's dry 
 the same with the trees  the trees are the hair of our planet
  when you have rain
 in a place that has no trees in just a few minutes the water arrives in the stream brings soil  destroying our water source  destroying the rivers  
 and no humidity to retain  when you have trees  the root system holds the water all the branches of the trees the leaves that come down
  a humid area and they take months and months under the water go to the the rivers  and maintain our source maintain our rivers this is the 
  most important thing  when we imagine that we need water for every activity in life  
  that was the farm land completely destroyed  the erosion there the land had dried  but you can see in this picture  
 we were starting to construct an educational center that became
 quite a large environmental center in brazil  in brazil  but you see a lot of small spots in this picture 
 in each point of those spots
 we had planted a tree  there are thousands of trees now i 'll show you the pictures made exactly in the same point two months ago i told
 you in the beginning
  us to plant about two point five million trees
 of about two hundred different species in order
 to rebuild the ecosystem and i 'll show you the last picture  
 we are with two million trees in the ground now  
 we are doing the sequestration of about one hundred thousand tons of carbon with these trees  my friends it 's very easy
  by an accident that happened to me we went back we built an ecosystem  we here inside the room
  i believe that we have the same concern  
 and the model that we created in brazil  we can transplant it here we can apply it everywhere around the world no  and
 i believe that we can do it together  thank you very much
