  if you 're in the audience today or maybe you 're watching this talk in some other time or place you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem
 whether you 're an artist a technologist a lawyer or a fan the handling of copyright directly impacts your life 
 rights management is no longer simply a
  question of ownership it 's a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape
 youtube cares deeply about the rights of content owners  
 but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies mashups and and more 
 we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site  
  let 's look at a specific video so you can see how it works  two years ago recording artist chris brown released the official video of his single forever 
 a fan saw it on tv  recorded it with her camera phone and uploaded it to youtube 
 because sony music had registered chris brown 's video in our content id system  
 within seconds of attempting to upload the video the copy was detected giving sony the choice of what to do next but how do we know that the user 's video was a copy
  well  it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database  along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match  
 we compare each upload against all of the reference files in our database 
 this heat map is going to show you how the brain of the system works here we can see the original reference file being compared to the user generated content
  the system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there 's a match  this means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file plays it in slow motion and has degraded audio and video quality  
 and we do this every time that a video is uploaded to youtube and that 's over twenty hours of video every minute 
 when we find a match we apply the policy that the rights
  owner has set down 
 and the scale and the speed of this system is truly breathtaking 
 we 're not just talking about a few videos we 're talking about over one hundred years of video every day  between new uploads and the legacy scans we regularly do across all of the content on the site
  when we compare those hundred years of video we 're comparing it against millions of reference files in our database  it would be like thirty six thousand people staring at 
  thirty six thousand monitors each and every day without so much as a coffee break  now what do we do when we find a match  
 well  most rights owners instead of blocking  will allow the copy to be published and then they benefit through the exposure advertising and linked sales  
 remember chris brown 's video
  had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts  and that looked like the end of the story  but sometime last year a young couple got married 
 this is their wedding video you may have seen it what
 's amazing about this is if the processional of the wedding was this much fun can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been i mean
  who are these people i totally want to go to that wedding 
 so their little wedding video went on to get over forty million views  
 and instead of sony blocking they allowed the upload to occur  and they put advertising against it and linked from it to itunes and the song  eighteen months old went back to number four on the itunes charts  
 so sony is generating revenue from both of these 
 and jill and kevin the happy couple they came back from their honeymoon and found
  that their video had gone crazy viral
  and they 've ended up on a bunch of talk shows  and they 've used it as an opportunity to make a difference the video 's inspired over twenty six thousand dollars in donations to end domestic violence the
 jk wedding [ entrance ] dance became so popular that nbc parodied it on the season finale of the office which just goes to show
  it 's truly an ecosystem of culture because it 's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios  but sometimes big studios borrowing back  
 by empowering choice we can create a culture of opportunity and all it took to change things around was to allow for choice through rights identification so why has no one 
  ever solved this problem before it 's because it 's a big problem and it 's complicated and messy  
  labels there 's multiple music publishers and each of these can vary by country there 's lots of cases where we have more than one work mashed together so we have to manage many claims to the same video 
 youtube 's content id system addresses all of these cases but the system only works through the participation of rights owners  
 if you have content that others are uploading to youtube you should register in the content id system and then you
  'll have the choice about how your content is used 
 and think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content 
 by simply blocking all reuse you 'll miss out on new art forms new audiences new distribution channels and new revenue streams  
 but it 's not just about dollars and impressions 
 just look at all the joy that was spread through progressive rights management and new technology and i think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading
