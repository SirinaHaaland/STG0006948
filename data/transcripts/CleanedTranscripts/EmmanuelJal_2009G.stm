  say my name is emmanuel jal  and i come from a long way i 've been telling a story that has been
 so painful for me it 's been
 a tough journey for me traveling the world telling my story in form of a book
  also telling it like now  and also the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music so i have
 branded myself as a war child  
 i 'm doing this because of an old lady in my
  have lost her children 
 there is no newspaper to cover her pain and what she wants to change in this society  and i 'm doing it for a young man
 who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he can 't write  
 or there is no internet like facebook myspace youtube for them to
 to talk 
 also one thing that kept me
  pushing this story this painful stories out  the dreams i have sometimes is like
 the voices of the dead that i have seen
 would tell me don 't give up keep on going because sometime i feel like
 stopping and not doing it because i didn 't know what i was putting myself into  well
 i was born in the most difficult time
 when my country was at war 
 i saw my village burned down the world that meant a lot to me  i saw it vanish in my face  
 i saw my aunt in rape when i was only five 
 my mother was claimed by the war my brothers and sisters
 were scattered and up to now me and my father were
  detached and i still have issues with him 
 seeing people die every day my mother crying it 's like i was raised in a violence  
 and
 that made me call myself a war child  and not only that when i was eight
 i became a child soldier
  i didn 't know what was the war for 
 but one thing i knew was an image that i saw that stuck in my head
 when i went to the training camp i say i want to kill as many muslims  and as many arabs  as possible 
 the training wasn 't easy  but that was the driving force because i wanted to revenge for my family i wanted to revenge for my village
 luckily now things have changed because
 i came to discover the truth 
 what was actually killing us wasn 't the muslims wasn 't the arabs it
 was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system  
 and using religion to get what they want to get out of us which is the oil
  oil the diamond  the gold and the land 
 so realizing the truth gave me
 a position to choose should i continue to hate or let it go so i happened to forgive now i sing
 music with the muslims  i dance with them i even had
  funded by muslim people so
 that pain has gone out  but my story is huge so i 'm just going to go into a different step now  
 which is easier for me i 'm going to give you poem
 called forced to sin which is from my album war child i talk about my story
  one of the journey that i tread when i was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around four hundred and only sixteen people survived that journey  
 so i hope you 're going to hear this my dreams are like torment  
 my every moment 
 voices in my brain of friends that was slain friends like lual who died by my side of starvation 
 in the burning jungle
 and the desert plain 
 next was i but jesus heard my cry as i was tempted to eat the rotten flesh
 of my comrade  he gave me comfort we used to raid villages stealing chickens goats and sheeps anything we could
  i knew it was rude  but we needed food and therefore i was forced to sin forced to sin to make a living  
 forced to sin to make a living  
 sometimes you gotta lose to win 
 never give up never give in left home at the age of seven one year later live with an 
 by my side  slept with one eye open wide
  dead and hide i 've seen my people die like flies  
 but i 've never seen a dead body at least one that i 've killed  
 but still as i wonder  i won 't go under guns barking like lightning and thunder as a child so young and tender  words i can 't forget i still remember  i saw sergeant command raising his
  retreat no surrender 
 i carry the banner of the trauma war child child without a mama still fighting in the saga  yet as i wage this new war i 'm not alone in this 
  drama  no sit or stop as i reach for the top i 'm fully dedicated like a patriotic
 's like i 'm living a dream  first time i 'm feeling like a human being ah the children of 
 your empty bellies on the telly and now it 's you that i 'm fighting for  
 left home don 't even know the day i 'll ever return
  music i used to hear was bombs and fire of guns so many people die that i don 't even cry no more  
 ask god question what am i here for  and why are my people poor  and why why
 when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write i was learning how to fight  i ate snails
  was ready to eat i know it 's a shame but who is to be blamed that 's my story shared in the form of a lesson
  is the music i do i never saw anybody
 to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy so the music had been my therapy for me it 's been
 where i actually see heaven where i can
 be happy where i can be a child again in dances
  so one thing i know about music music is the only thing that has power
 to enter your cell system your mind your heart  influence your soul and your spirit  and can even
 influence the way you live without even you knowing music is the only thing that can
 make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg without even wanting to do it
 the power music has i normally compare to the power love when love doesn 't see a color you know if you fall in love with a frog that 's it one testimony about how i find music is powerful is when
 i was still a soldier back then  i hated the people in the north  but i don 't know
 why i don 't hate their music so
 we party and dance to their music and one thing that shocked me is one day they brought
 an arab musician
 to come and entertain the soldiers and i almost broke my leg dancing to his music  
 but i had this question so now i 'm doing music so i know what the power of music is 
 so what 's happening here i 've been in a painful journey  today is day number two hundred and
 and thirty three in which i only eat dinner i don 't eat breakfast  no lunch  and i 've done a campaign called
 lose to win where i 'm losing
 so that i could win the battle that i 'm fighting now  so my breakfast my lunch  
 i donate it to a charity that i founded because we want to build a school in sudan  and i 'm doing this because also
 it 's a normal thing in my home people eat one meal a day here i am in the west  i choose not to 
 so in my village now kids there they normally listen to bbc  or any radio and they are waiting to know the day emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school  
 and so i made a
  i 'm gonna not eat my breakfast i thought i was famous enough that i would raise the money within one month  but i 've been humbled so
 it 's taken me two hundred and thirty two days and i said no stop until we get it 
 and like it 's been done on facebook myspace the people are giving three dollars  
 the lowest amount we ever got was twenty cents somebody donated twenty cents online i don 't know how they did it
 that moved me and so 
 the importance of education to me
 is what i 'm willing to die for i 'm willing to die for this because i know what it can do
 to my people education enlighten your brain give you so many
  and you 're able to survive  as a nation we have been crippled for so many years we have fed on aid you see a 
  families in a refugee camps they only
 get the food that drops from the sky from the u n so these people 
 you 're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid 
 if anybody want to help us this is what we need give us tools  give the farmers
  tools it 's rain africa is fertile  they can grow the crops 
 invest
 in education 
 education so that we have strong institution that can create a revolution to change everything because we have
 all those
  old men that are creating wars in africa they will die soon but if you invest in education then
 we 'll be able to change africa that 's what i 'm asking so
 in order to do that 
 i founded a charter called gua africa  where we put kids in school  
 and now we have a couple in university we have like forty kids
  that we feel like we want to support  and i said i 'm going to put it in practice 
 and with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things that 's what i want to do to change to make a difference in the world  
 well now my time is going so i want to sing a song  but i 'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a british aid worker
 called emma mccune
 that made it possible for me to be here
 i 'm gonna sing this song 
 just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference she came to my country and saw the importance
 of education she said the only way to help sudan is to invest in the women educating them  educating the
  so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society  so she even ended up marrying a commander from
 from the spla 
 and she rescued over one hundred and fifty child soldiers one of them happened to be me now  and so at this moment i want to ask to celebrate
 emma with me are you guys ready to celebrate emma
  to know the
  was somebody
