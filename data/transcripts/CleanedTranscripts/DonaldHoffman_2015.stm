  i love a great mystery  
 and i 'm fascinated by the greatest unsolved mystery in science  perhaps because it 's personal  
 it 's about who we are and i can 't help but be
  the mystery is this what is the relationship between your brain and your conscious experiences  such as your experience of the taste of chocolate
 or the feeling of velvet now this mystery is not new in 
 thomas huxley wrote how it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness
 comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue
 is just as unaccountable
 as the appearance of the genie when aladdin rubbed his lamp now 
 huxley knew that brain activity and conscious experiences are correlated  but he didn 't know why 
 to the science of his day  it was a mystery 
 in the years since huxley science has learned a lot about brain activity but the relationship between brain activity and
  conscious experiences is still a mystery  why  why have we made so little progress well  some experts think
 that we can 't solve this problem
 because we lack the necessary concepts and intelligence  
 we don 't expect monkeys to solve problems in quantum mechanics  and as it happens we can 't expect our species to solve this problem either 
 i disagree  i 'm more optimistic i think we 've simply made a false assumption once we fix it we just might solve this problem 
 today i 'd like tell you what that assumption is  why it 's false  and how to fix it let 's begin with a question 
 do we see reality as it is  i open my eyes
 and i have an experience that i describe
 as a red tomato
  tomato a meter away 
 as a result i come to believe that in reality  there 's a red tomato a meter away  
 i then close my eyes and my experience changes to a gray field 
 but is it still the case that in reality  there 's a red tomato a meter away  
  then we thought that the earth is the unmoving center of 
  that we were wrong  
 galileo then wondered if we might be misinterpreting our experiences in other ways he wrote 
 i think that tastes  odors colors  and so on
 reside in consciousness  hence if the living creature were removed all these qualities would be annihilated 
 now that 's a stunning claim could galileo be right
  we really be misinterpreting our experiences that badly  what does modern science have to say about this  
 well  neuroscientists tell us that about a third of the brain 's cortex is engaged in vision 
 when you simply open your eyes and look about this room 
 billions of neurons and trillions of synapses are engaged now this is a bit surprising because to the
  extent that we think about vision at all we think of it as like a camera it just takes a picture of objective reality as it is  
 now  there is a part of vision that 's like a camera 
 the eye has a lens that focuses an image on the back of the eye where there are one hundred and thirty million photoreceptors  so the eye is like a
  't explain the billions of neurons and trillions of synapses that are engaged in vision what are these neurons up to 
 well neuroscientists tell us that they are creating  in real time all the shapes objects colors and motions that we see 
 it feels like we 're just taking a snapshot of this room the way
  but in fact we 're constructing everything that we see  we don 't construct the whole world at once we construct what we need in the moment  
 now  there are many demonstrations that are quite compelling that we construct what we see i 'll just show you two  
 in this example you see some red discs with bits cut out of them 
 but if i just rotate the disks a little bit suddenly you see a 3d cube pop out of the
  screen now the screen of course is flat  so the three dimensional cube that you 're experiencing must be your construction  
 in this next example you see
 glowing blue bars with pretty sharp edges moving across a field of dots 
  no dots move 
 all i 'm doing from frame to frame is changing the colors of dots from blue to black or black to blue  
 but when i do this quickly your visual system creates the glowing blue bars with the sharp edges and the motion 
 there are many more examples but these are just two that you construct what you see 
 but neuroscientists go further 
 they say that
 we reconstruct
 reality  
 so when i have an experience that i describe as a red tomato 
 that experience is actually an accurate reconstruction of the properties of a real red tomato that would exist even if i weren 't looking now
 why would neuroscientists say that we don 't just construct we reconstruct well the
  standard argument given is usually an evolutionary one those of our ancestors who saw more accurately
 had a competitive advantage compared to those who saw less accurately  
 and therefore they were more likely to pass on their genes 
 we are the offspring of those who saw more accurately and so we can be confident that in the normal case our perceptions are accurate 
 you see this in the
  standard textbooks 
 one textbook says for example evolutionarily speaking vision is useful precisely because it is so accurate 
 so the idea is that accurate perceptions
 are fitter perceptions they give you a survival advantage now is this correct is this the right interpretation
  let 's first look at a couple of examples in nature the australian jewel beetle
 is dimpled  glossy and brown 
 the female is flightless  the male flies looking of course for a hot female 
 when he finds one  he alights and mates  
 there 's another species in the outback  homo sapiens
  the male of this species has a massive brain
 that he uses to hunt
 for cold beer 
 laughter and when he finds one he drains it and sometimes throws the bottle into the outback 
 now as it happens these bottles are dimpled  glossy and just the right shade of brown to tickle the fancy of these beetles  
 the males swarm all over the bottles
 trying to mate
  lose all interest in the real females classic case of the male leaving the female for the bottle 
 applause the species almost went extinct  
 australia had to change its bottles to save its beetles 
  the males had successfully found females for thousands  perhaps millions of years  
 it looked like they saw reality as it is  
 but apparently not evolution had given them a hack 
 a female is anything dimpled  glossy and brown  the bigger the better 
 even when crawling all over the bottle  the male couldn 't discover his mistake
  now you might say beetles  sure  
 they 're very simple creatures but surely not mammals mammals don 't rely on tricks  well  i won 't dwell on this  but you get the idea 
 so this raises an important technical question
  does natural selection really favor seeing reality as it is  
 fortunately  we don 't have
  to wave our hands and guess evolution is a mathematically precise theory 
 we can use the equations of evolution to check this out we can have various organisms in artificial worlds
 compete and see which survive and which thrive which sensory systems are more fit 
 a key notion in those equations is fitness  consider this steak
 what does this steak do for the fitness of an animal  well  for a hungry lion
 looking to eat it enhances fitness
 for a well fed lion looking to mate  it doesn 't enhance fitness  
 and for a rabbit in any state it doesn 't enhance fitness  so fitness does depend on reality as it is
  but also on the organism its state and its action 
 fitness is not the same thing as reality as it is  
 and it 's fitness  and not reality as it is  that figures centrally in the equations of evolution 
 so in my lab we have run hundreds of thousands of evolutionary game simulations with lots of different
 randomly chosen worlds
 and organisms that compete for resources in those worlds some of the organisms see all of the reality  
 others see just part of the reality and some see none of the reality  only fitness 
 who wins  
 well i hate to break it to you but perception of reality
 goes extinct  in almost every
  simulation organisms that see none of reality but are just tuned to fitness drive to extinction all the organisms that perceive reality as it is  
 so the bottom line is  evolution does not favor veridical or accurate perceptions  
 those perceptions of reality go extinct  
 now this is a bit stunning  how can it be that not seeing
  world accurately gives us a survival advantage that is a bit counterintuitive 
 but remember the jewel beetle 
 the jewel beetle survived for thousands perhaps millions of years  using simple tricks and hacks 
 what the equations of evolution are telling us is that all organisms including us are in the same boat as the jewel beetle 
 we do not see reality as it is  we 're shaped
 with tricks and hacks that keep us alive still 
 we need some help with our intuitions  how can not perceiving reality as it is be useful 
 well fortunately we have a very helpful metaphor the desktop interface on your computer  
 consider that blue icon for a ted talk that you 're writing  
 now  the icon is blue
 and rectangular and in the lower right corner of the desktop does that mean that the text file itself in the computer
 is blue 
 rectangular and in the lower right hand corner of the computer of course not 
 anyone who thought that misinterprets the purpose of the interface it 's not there to show you the reality of the computer  in fact  it 's there to hide that
  reality  you don 't want to know about the diodes and resistors and all the megabytes of software  if you had to deal with that you could never write your text file or edit your photo  
 so the idea is that evolution has given us an interface
 that hides reality
 and guides adaptive behavior  space and time as you perceive them right now are your desktop physical objects
  simply icons in that desktop  
 there 's an obvious objection 
 hoffman  if you think that train coming down the track at two hundred mph is just an icon of your desktop why don
 't you step in front of it and after you 're gone and your theory with you we 'll know that there 's more to that train than just an icon  
  i wouldn 't step in front of that train for the same reason that i wouldn 't carelessly drag that icon to the trash can 
 not because i take the icon literally
 the file is not literally blue or rectangular
 but i do take it seriously  i could lose weeks of work  similarly evolution has shaped us with
 perceptual symbols that are designed to keep us alive we 'd better take them seriously  if you see a snake
 don 't pick it up 
 if you see a cliff  don 't jump off 
 they 're designed to keep us safe and we should take them seriously  that does not mean that we should take them literally that 's a logical error 
 another objection 
 there 's nothing really new here physicists have told us for a long time that the metal of that train looks solid but really it 's mostly empty space with microscopic particles zipping around
  there 's nothing new here  well  not exactly it
 's like saying i know that that blue icon on the desktop is not the reality of the computer  
 but if i pull out my trusty magnifying glass and look really closely  
 i see little pixels  and that 's the reality of the computer  
 well  not really you 're still on the desktop  and that 's the point  those microscopic particles are still in space and time
  still in the user interface  so i 'm saying something far more radical than those physicists 
 finally you might object 
 look  we all see the train therefore none of us constructs the train  
 but remember this example  in this example  we all see a cube 
 but the screen is flat  so the cube that you see
 is the cube that you construct
 we all see a cube
 because we all each one of us constructs the cube that we see 
 the same is true of the train  we all see a train because we each see the train that we construct and
 the same is true of all physical objects  
 we 're inclined to think that perception is like a window on reality as it is  the theory of
  evolution is telling us that this is an incorrect interpretation
 of our perceptions  instead reality is more like a 3d desktop that 's designed to hide the complexity of the real world
 and guide adaptive behavior  space as you perceive it is your desktop  physical objects are just the icons in that desktop  
 we used to think that the earth is flat
 because it looks that way then we thought that the earth is the unmoving center of reality because it looks that way  
 we were wrong  we had misinterpreted our perceptions now we believe that 
 and objects are the nature of reality as it is  the theory of evolution is telling us
  're misinterpreting the content
 of our perceptual experiences  there 's something that exists when you don 't look but it 's not spacetime and physical objects it 's
 as hard for us to let go of spacetime and objects as it is for the jewel beetle to let go of its bottle  
 why because we 're blind to our own blindnesses 
 but we have an advantage over the jewel beetle our science and technology by peering
  through the lens of a telescope
 we discovered that the earth is not the unmoving center
 of reality 
 and by peering through the lens of the theory of evolution we discovered that spacetime and objects are not the nature of reality  
 when i have a perceptual experience that i describe as a red tomato  i am interacting with
  but that reality is not a red tomato
 and is nothing like a red tomato  similarly  when i have an experience that i describe as a lion
 or a steak  i 'm interacting with reality  but that reality is not a lion or a steak and here 's the kicker  
 when i have a perceptual experience that i describe as a brain or neurons  i am interacting with
  but that reality is not a brain or neurons and is nothing like a brain or neurons 
 and that reality  
 whatever it is  is the real source of cause and effect in the world
 not brains not neurons  brains and neurons have no causal powers  
 they cause none of our perceptual experiences  and none of our behavior  brains and neurons
  of symbols a hack 
 what does this mean for the mystery of consciousness  well  it opens up new possibilities 
 for instance  perhaps reality is some vast machine
 that causes our conscious experiences
 i doubt this but it 's
  reality is some vast interacting network of conscious agents simple and complex  that cause each other 's conscious experiences  
 actually this isn 't as crazy an idea as it seems and i 'm currently exploring it but here 's the point  
 once we let go of our massively intuitive but massively false
 false assumption about the nature of reality  it opens up new ways to think about life 's greatest mystery  
 i bet that reality will end up turning out to be more fascinating and unexpected than we 've ever imagined 
 the theory of evolution presents us with the ultimate dare 
 dare to recognize that perception is not about seeing truth  it 's about having kids
  by the way  even this ted
 is just in your head  
 thank you very much chris
 if that 's really you there thank you
  of all some people may just be profoundly depressed at the thought that 
 if evolution does not favor reality  i mean doesn 't that to some extent undermine all our endeavors here all our ability to think that we can think the truth  
 possibly even including your own theory if you go there donald hoffman well this does not stop us
 from a successful science what we have is one theory that turned out to be false
  perception is like
 reality and reality is like our perceptions that theory turns out to be false  
 okay  throw that theory away that doesn 't stop us from now postulating all sorts of other theories about the nature of reality  so it 's actually progress to recognize that one of our theories was false  so science continues as normal there 's no problem here ca 
 so you think it 's possible
  this is cool but what you 're saying i think is it 's possible that evolution can still get you to reason dh yes  now that 's a very very good point  the
 evolutionary game simulations that i showed were specifically about perception and they do show that our perceptions have been shaped not to show us reality as it is  but that does not mean
 the same thing about our logic or mathematics we haven 't done these simulations but my bet is that we 'll find that there are some selection pressures for our logic and our
 to be at least in the direction of truth i mean if you 're like me math and logic is not easy  we don 't get it all right  but at least the selection pressures are not uniformly away from true math and 
  logic so i think that we 'll find that we have to look at each cognitive faculty one at a time and see what evolution does to it 
  interpretation of the world consciousness causes matter not the other way around dh well it 's slightly different than berkeley berkeley thought that he was a deist and he thought that the ultimate nature of reality  is god and so forth  
 and i don 't need to go where berkeley 's going
 so it 's quite quite a bit different from from berkeley  i call this conscious realism it 's actually a very different approach ca 
 don i could literally talk with you for hours and i hope to
