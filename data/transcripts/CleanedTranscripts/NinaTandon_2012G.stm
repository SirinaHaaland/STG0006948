  a video of some of the models i work with they 're all the perfect size and they don 't have an ounce of fat 
 did i mention they 're gorgeous  and they 're scientific models
  as you might have guessed i 'm a tissue engineer  and this is a video of some of the beating heart that i 've engineered in the lab  
 and one day we hope that these tissues can serve as replacement parts for the human body  
 but what i 'm going to tell you about today is how these tissues make awesome models 
 well  let 's think about the drug screening process for a moment you go from drug formulation lab testing animal testing and then clinical trials which you might call human testing 
 before the drugs get to market
  a lot of money a lot of time  and sometimes even when a drug hits the market  it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people 
 and the later it fails the worse the consequences  
 it all boils down to two issues one humans are not rats  
 and two  despite our incredible similarities to one another actually those tiny differences between you and i have huge
  impacts with how we metabolize drugs and how those drugs affect us so what if we had better models in the lab that could not only mimic us better than rats
 but also reflect our diversity  
 let 's see how we can do it with tissue engineering 
 one of the key technologies that 's really important is what 's called induced pluripotent stem cells they were developed in japan pretty recently
 okay induced pluripotent stem cells they 're a lot like embryonic stem cells except without the controversy 
 we induce cells okay say skin cells  by adding a few genes to them  culturing them  and then harvesting them  
 so they 're skin cells that can be tricked  kind of like cellular amnesia  into an embryonic state
  so without the controversy that 's cool thing number one cool thing number two you can grow any type of tissue out of them  brain heart liver you get the picture  
 but out of your cells  so we can make a model of your heart your brain
 on a chip  
 generating tissues of predictable density and behavior is the second piece  and will be really key towards getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery
  and this is a schematic of a bioreactor we 're developing in our lab to help engineer tissues in a more modular scalable way 
 going forward imagine a massively parallel version of this with thousands of pieces of human tissue 
 it would be like having a clinical trial on a chip  
 but another thing about these induced pluripotent stem cells is that if we take some skin cells let 's say  from people with a genetic disease and we engineer tissues out of them  
 we can actually use
  models of those diseases in the lab here 's an example from kevin eggan 's lab at harvard he generated neurons
 from these induced pluripotent stem cells
 from patients who have lou gehrig 's disease and he differentiated them into neurons and what 's amazing is that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease 
 so with disease models like these we can fight back faster than ever before and understand the disease better than ever before
 and maybe discover drugs even faster 
 this is another example of patient specific stem cells that were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa  this is a degeneration of the retina it 's a disease that runs in my family  
 and we really hope that cells like these will help us find a cure  
 so some people think that these models sound well and
  are these really as good as the rat 
 the rat is an entire organism after all with interacting networks of organs a drug for the heart can get metabolized in the liver  
 and some of the byproducts may be stored in the fat  don 't you miss all that with these tissue engineered models 
 well  this is another trend in the field 
 by combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics the field is actually evolving towards just that a model of the entire ecosystem of the body  complete with multiple
  organ systems to be able to test how a drug you might take for your blood pressure might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart these systems are really hard to build  but we 're just starting to be able to get there  and so 
 watch out  
 but that 's not even all of it because once a drug is approved tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments
  this is an example
 that you might care about someday and i hope you never do  
 because imagine if you ever get that call that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer  
 wouldn 't you rather test to see if those cancer drugs you 're going to take are going to work on your cancer 
 this is an example from karen burg 's lab where they 're using inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells and study its progressions and treatments  
 and some of our colleagues at tufts are mixing models like these with tissue engineered bone to see
  how cancer might spread from one part of the body to the next and you can imagine those kinds of multi tissue chips to be the next generation of these kinds of studies
