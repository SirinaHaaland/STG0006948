  bobby riggs he was the former number one player he wasn 't just some hacker by the way he was one of my heroes
 and i admired him  and that 's the reason i beat him actually because i respected him
 's true my mom and especially my dad always said respect your opponent and never underestimate them  ever 
 and he was correct  he was absolutely correct  
 but i knew it was about social change 
 and i was really nervous whenever we announced it  and i felt like the whole world was on my
  's going to put women back fifty years at least title ix had just been passed the year before june 
 and women 's professional tennis
 there were nine of us who signed a  one dollar contract in one thousand nine hundred and seventy now remember the match is in ' seventy three 
 so we were only in our third year of having a tour where we could actually play have a place to compete and make a living  so there were nine of us that signed that
  our dream was for any girl born any place in the world
 if she was good enough there would be a place for her to compete
 and for us to make a living because before one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight we made fourteen dollars a day  and we were under the control of organizations so we really wanted to break away from that but we knew it wasn 't really
  our generation so much we knew it was about the future generations we do stand on the shoulders of the people that came before us there is no question 
 but every generation has the chance to make it better 
 that was really on my mind  
 i really wanted to start matching the hearts and minds to title ix title ix in case anybody doesn 't know which a lot of people probably don 't said that any federal funds
 given to a high school  college or
  either public or private had to finally give
 equal monies to boys and girls  and that changed everything so
 you can have a law but it 's changing the hearts and minds to match up with it  
 that 's when it really rocks  totally  so that was on my mind  i wanted to start that change in the hearts and minds but two things
  they actually had enough nerve to ask for a raise some women have waited
 ten fifteen years to ask i said more importantly did you get it and they did and for the men
 a lot of the men today don 't realize it but if you 're in your 50s 60s or
  come up to me
 and most times the men are the ones who have tears in their eyes it 's very interesting they go billie  i was very young when i saw that match  
 and now i have a daughter  and i am so happy i saw that as a young man
 and one of those young men at twelve years old was president obama
  and he actually told me that when i met him he said 
 you don 't realize it  but i saw that match at twelve  and now i have two daughters  and it has made a difference in how i raise them 
 so both men and women got a lot out of it but different things pm 
 and now there are generations at least one or two who have experienced the
  equality
 that title ix and other fights along the way made possible and for women there are generations who have also experienced teamwork  
 they got to play team sports in a way they hadn 't before 
 so you you had a legacy already built in terms of being an athlete
  a legacy of the work you did to lobby for equal pay for women athletes and the women 's sports foundation 
 what now are you looking to accomplish with
 the billie jean king leadership initiative bjk i think it goes back to an epiphany i had at twelve  at eleven i wanted to be the number one tennis player in the world 
 and a friend had asked me to play and i said what 's that 
 tennis was not in my family
 basketball was other sports fast forward to twelve years old
 and i 'm finally starting to play in tournaments where you get a ranking at the end of the year so i was daydreaming
 at the los angeles tennis club and i started thinking about my sport and how tiny it was but
 also
 that everybody who played wore white shoes white clothes played with white balls everybody who played was
  sticking in my brain  and that moment  i promised myself i 'd fight for equal rights and opportunities for boys and girls men and women the rest of my life  
 and that tennis if i was fortunate enough
 to become number one and i knew being a girl it would be harder to have influence already at that age
 i had this platform 
 and tennis is global 
 and i thought you know what 
 i 've been given an opportunity that very few people have had i didn 't know if i was going to make it this was only twelve  i sure wanted it  but making it is a whole other discussion
  i just remember i promised myself  and i really try to keep my word  that 's who i truly am
  fighting for people and  unfortunately women
 have had less  
 and we are considered less  and so my attentions where did they have to go it was just you have to
 and learn to stick up for yourself hear your own voice  you hear the same words keep coming out all the
  i got really lucky because i had an education  and i think if you can see it you can be it you know if you can see it you can
 be it you look at pat you look at other leaders you look at these speakers  look at yourself  because everyone everyone
 can do something extraordinary every single person pm and your story billie has inspired so many women everywhere now with
  the billie jean king leadership initiative you 're taking on
 an even bigger cause because one thing we hear a lot about is women taking their voice 
 working to find their way into leadership positions  but what you 're talking about is even bigger than that it 's inclusive leadership
 and this is a generation that has grown up thinking more
  of it  but the billie jean king leadership initiative is really about the workforce mostly and trying to change it so people can actually go to work
 and be their authentic selves because most of us
 have two jobs one to fit in i 'll give you a perfect example an african american woman gets up an hour earlier to go to work  
 straightens her hair in the bathroom goes to the bathroom
 probably four five six times a day to keep straightening her hair to keep making sure she fits in 
 so she 's working two jobs she 's got this other job  whatever that may be but she 's also trying to fit in 
 or this poor
 man who kept his diploma he went to
 university of michigan but he never would talk about his poverty as a youngster  ever just would not mention it so he made sure
  and then you see a gay guy who has an nfl which means american football for all of you out there it 's a big deal it 's very macho and he talked about football all the time because he was gay and 
 my wish
 for everyone is to be able to be their authentic self twenty four seven that would be the ultimate  
 and we catch ourselves i mean i catch myself to this day even being gay i catch myself
 like 
 a little uncomfortable a little surge in my gut  feeling not totally comfortable in my own skin 
 so i think you have to ask yourself
 i want people to be themselves  whatever that is just let it be pm  and the first research the leadership initiative did showed
  many of us have the problem of being authentic but what you 've just looked at is this millennial generation who have benefited from all these equal opportunities 
 which may not be equal but exist everywhere bjk first of all i 'm really lucky partnership with teneo a strategic company that 's amazing 
 i 'm able to do this  i 've had two times in my life where i 've actually had men really behind me with power  
 and that was in the old days with philip morris with virginia slims  and this is the second time in my entire life  and then deloitte 
 the one thing i wanted was data
 facts  so deloitte sent out a survey and
  going to get representation so if you walk into a room you see everybody represented that 's not good enough anymore 
 so the millennials are fantastic they want connection 
  just want you to tell us what you 're feeling what you 're thinking and get into the solution
  you 've got the information at your fingertips compared to
 when i was growing up pm 
 what did the research show you about millennials are they going to make a difference are they going to create a world where there is really an inclusive work force  bjk well in
  percent of the global workforce is going to be millennials i think they are going to help
  i think they have the wherewithal to do it i know they care a lot they have big ideas
 and they can make big things happen i want to stay in the now with the young people
 mini survey i 've been talking to the boomers who are their bosses and i go
  and they don 't really care i just heard a story the other night a woman owns a gallery and she has these workers  she gets a text from one of the workers
 just starting she goes oh by the way i 'm going to be late because i 'm at the hairdresser 's
  that 's what scares the boomers i 'm just telling you so i think it 's good for us to share no it
 is good for us to share because we 're our authentic selves and what we 're really feeling so we 've got to take it both ways you know 
 but i have great faith because if you 've been in sports like i have
 every generation gets better it 's a fact
 with the women 's sports foundation being the
 the advocates for title ix still because we 're trying to keep protecting the law because   it 's in a tenuous position always 
 so we really are concerned and we do a lot of research 
 and i want to hear from people  but we really have to protect what title
  stands for worldwide and you heard president carter
 talk about how title ix is protected and do you know that every single lawsuit
 that girls at least in sports have gone up against whatever
 institutions has won  
 title ix is there to protect us  and it is amazing  but we we still have to get the hearts and minds the
 hearts and minds to match the legislation is huge
  huge pm so what gets you up every morning 
 what keeps you sustaining your work sustaining the fight for equality  extending it always exploring new areas trying to find new ways bjk well i always drove my parents crazy because i was always the curious one i
 'm highly motivated my younger brother was a major league baseball player my poor parents did not care
 laughter and we drove them crazy because we pushed we pushed because we wanted to be the best and
 i think it 's because of of what i 'm hearing today in ted talks  i think
 to listen to these different women to listen to different people to listen to president carter ninety years old by the way and he
  these figures out that i would never i 'd have to go excuse me wait a minute i need to get a list out of these figures he was rattling off i mean  that 's amazing i 'm sorry
  these are things that for some people are very hard to hear but always remember every one of us is an individual a human being with a beating heart who cares
 and wants to live their authentic life  ok you don 't have to agree with somebody  but everyone has
  i think we all
 have an obligation to continue
 to keep moving the needle forward 
 always and these people have been so inspiring  everyone matters  and every one of you is an influencer  you out there listening out there in the world plus the people here
 every single person 's an influencer never ever forget that ok so don 't ever give up on yourself
