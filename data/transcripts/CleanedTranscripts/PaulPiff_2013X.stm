  i want you to for a moment think about playing a game of monopoly  
 except in this game that combination of skill  talent and luck
 that helped earn you success in games as in life has been rendered irrelevant because this game 's been rigged
 and you 've got the upper hand you 've got more money 
 more opportunities to move around the board  and more access to resources  and as you think about that experience i want you to ask yourself 
 how might that experience of being a privileged player in a rigged game
 change the way you think about yourself
 and regard that other player
  so we ran a study on the uc berkeley campus to look at exactly that question  we brought in more than one hundred pairs of strangers into the lab  
 and with the flip of a coin randomly assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged game they got two times as much money 
 when they passed go they collected twice the salary  and they got to roll both dice instead of one so they got to move around
  the board a lot more 
 and over the course of fifteen minutes we watched through hidden cameras what happened 
 what i want to do today for the first time is show you a little bit of what we saw 
 you 'll to have to pardon the sound quality because again these were hidden cameras  so we 've provided subtitles
  so it was quickly apparent to players that something was up 
 one person clearly has a lot more money than the other person  and yet 
 as the game unfolded we saw very notable differences dramatic differences begin to emerge between the two players 
 the rich player
 started to move around the board louder
 literally smacking the board with the piece as
  he went around we were more likely to see signs of dominance and nonverbal signs displays of power
 and celebration among the rich players
  we had a bowl of pretzels positioned off to the side it 's on the bottom right corner that allowed us to watch participants
  no surprises people are on to us  they wonder what that bowl of pretzels is doing there in the first place  one even asks like you just saw is that bowl of pretzels there as a trick 
 and yet  despite that the power of the situation seems to inevitably
  the game went on one of the really interesting and dramatic patterns that we observed begin to emerge was that the rich players actually started to
 become ruder toward the other person
 less and less sensitive to the plight of those poor poor players  and more and more demonstrative of their material success 
 more likely to showcase how well they 're doing
  and here 's what i think was really really interesting it 's that at the end of the fifteen minutes  we asked the players to talk about their experience during the game  
 and when the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won in this
  rigged game of monopoly 
 they talked about what they 'd done to buy those different properties and earn their success in the game 
 and they became far less attuned
 to all those different features of the situation including that flip of a coin
 that had randomly
  gotten them into that privileged position in the first place  
 and that 's a really really incredible insight into how the mind makes sense of advantage  
 now this game of monopoly can be used as a metaphor for understanding society
 and its hierarchical structure  wherein some
  have a lot of wealth and a lot of status and a lot of people don 't they have a lot less wealth and
 a lot less status and a lot less access to valued resources  
 and what my colleagues and i for the last seven years have been doing is studying the effects of these kinds of hierarchies 
 what we 've been finding
 across dozens of studies and thousands of participants across this country
 is that as a person 's levels of wealth increase their feelings of
  compassion and empathy go down  
 and their feelings of entitlement of deservingness and their ideology of 
 in surveys we 've found that it 's actually wealthier individuals who are more likely to moralize greed being good  and that the pursuit of
  now what i want to do today is talk about some of the implications of this ideology self interest 
 talk about why we should care about those implications and end with what might be done 
 some of the first studies that we ran in this area looked at helping behavior something social psychologists call pro social behavior 
 and we were really interested in who 's more likely to offer help to another person
 someone who 's rich or someone who 's poor  
 in one of the studies  we bring rich and poor members of the community into the lab  
 and give each of them the equivalent of ten dollars  
 we told the participants they could keep these ten dollars for themselves or they could share a portion of it if they wanted to with a stranger who 's totally anonymous they 'll never meet that stranger the stranger
  will never meet them  and we just monitor how much people give 
 individuals who made twenty five thousand sometimes under fifteen thousand dollars a year  gave forty four percent more of their money to the stranger than did individuals making one hundred and fifty thousand two hundred thousand dollars a year  
 we 've had people play games
  to see who 's more or less likely to cheat to increase their chances of winning a prize  in one of the games we actually rigged a computer so that die rolls over a certain score 
 were impossible you couldn 't get above twelve in this game  and yet  
 people would be inclined to take candy from a jar of candy that we explicitly identified as being reserved for children 
  not kidding i know it sounds like i 'm making a joke 
 we explicitly told participants this candy is for children participating in a developmental lab nearby they 're in studies this is for them
  and we just monitored how much candy participants took participants who felt rich took two times as much candy as participants who felt poor  
 we 've even studied cars not just any cars but whether drivers of different kinds of cars
 are more or less inclined to break the
  in one of these studies  we looked at whether drivers would stop for a pedestrian
 that we had posed waiting to cross at a crosswalk now in california as you all know because i 'm sure we all do this it 's the law to stop for a pedestrian who 's waiting to cross 
 so here 's an example of how we did it that 's our confederate off to the left posing as a pedestrian he approaches
 as the red truck successfully stops in typical california fashion
  it 's overtaken by the bus who almost runs our pedestrian over now here 's an example of a more expensive car a prius  driving through and a bmw
 doing the same 
 so we did this for hundreds of vehicles on several days 
 just tracking who stops and who doesn 't 
 what we found was as the
 of a car increased 
 the drivers ' tendencies to break the law increased as well  none of the cars none of the cars in our least expensive car category
 broke the law close to fifty percent of the cars in our most expensive vehicle category
  we 've run other studies finding that wealthier individuals are more likely to lie in negotiations to endorse unethical behavior at work like stealing cash from the cash register  
 taking bribes  lying to customers  
 now i don 't mean to suggest that it 's only wealthy people who show these patterns of behavior not at all in fact i think that
  struggle with these competing motivations
 of when or if to put our own interests above the interests of other people and that 's understandable because
 the american dream is an idea in which we all have an equal opportunity to succeed and prosper 
 as long as we apply ourselves and work hard 
 and a piece of that means that sometimes you need to put your own interests
 above the interests and well being of other people around you but what we 're finding is that
 the wealthier you are the more likely you are to pursue a vision of personal success of achievement and accomplishment to the detriment of others around you 
 here i 've plotted for you the mean household income received by each fifth and top five percent of the population over the last twenty years
  the differences between the different quintiles of the population in terms of income 
 are fairly egregious 
 it 's not difficult to discern that there are differences  
 but over the last twenty years that significant difference has become a grand canyon of sorts between those at the top and everyone else in fact
  the top twenty percent
 of our population own close to ninety percent of the total wealth in this country we 're at unprecedented levels of economic inequality 
 what that means is that wealth is not only becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a select group of individuals 
 but the american dream
 is becoming increasingly unattainable
 for an increasing majority of us and if it 's the case as we 've been finding that
  the wealthier you are the more entitled you feel to that wealth 
 and the more likely you are to prioritize your own interests above the interests of other people and be willing to do things to serve that 
  there 's no reason to think that those patterns will change 
 in fact there 's every reason to think that they 'll only get worse  and that 's what it would look like if things just stayed the same at the same linear rate 
  twenty years  now inequality economic inequality is something we should all be concerned about and not just because of those at the bottom
 of the social hierarchy but because individuals and groups with lots of economic inequality do worse  
 not just the people at the bottom 
  there 's a lot of really compelling research coming out from top labs all over the world showcasing the range of things that are undermined
 as economic inequality gets worse social mobility  things we really care about physical health social trust all go down as 
  inequality goes up  similarly  negative things in social collectives and societies 
  exacerbated
 as economic inequality increases again  these are outcomes not just experienced by a few  but that resound across all strata of society even people at the top experience these outcomes 
 so
 what do we do this cascade of
  spun out of control  and there 's nothing we can do about it  certainly nothing we as individuals could do 
 but in fact  we 've been finding
 in our own laboratory research
 that small small psychological interventions  
 small changes to people 's values  small nudges in certain directions
  can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy for instance reminding people of the benefits of cooperation
 or the advantages of community cause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian
 as poor people in one study we had people watch a brief
  seconds long about childhood poverty
 that served as a reminder of the needs of others in the world around them  
 and after watching that we looked at how willing people were to offer up their own time
 to a stranger presented to them in the lab who was in distress  
 after watching this video  an hour later rich people became just as generous of their own time to help out this other person a stranger
  someone who 's poor 
 suggesting that these differences are not innate or categorical but are so malleable to slight changes in people 's values and little nudges of compassion and bumps of empathy  
 and beyond the walls of our lab we 're even beginning to see signs of change in society  
 bill gates 
 one of our nation 's wealthiest individuals in his harvard commencement speech talked about the problem of inequality facing society as being the most daunting challenge and talked about what must be done to combat it saying 
 humanity 's greatest advances are not in its discoveries but in how those discoveries are applied
 to reduce inequity and there 's the giving pledge in which more than one hundred of our nation 's wealthiest individuals
  are pledging half of their fortunes to charity  and there 's the emergence
 of dozens of grassroots movements like we are the one percent 
 resource generation or wealth for common good in which
 the most privileged members of the population members of the one percent and elsewhere people who are wealthy are
  using their own economic resources  adults and youth alike that 's what 's most striking to me
 leveraging their own privilege their own economic resources to
 combat inequality by advocating for social policies changes in social values and changes in people 's behavior
 that work against their own economic interests but that may
  restore the american dream thank you
