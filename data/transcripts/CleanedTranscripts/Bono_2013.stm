  anderson asked me if i could put the last twenty five years of anti poverty campaigning into ten minutes for ted 
 that 's an englishman asking an irishman to be succinct
  that be a good use of your messianic complex 
 so yeah then i thought let 's go even further
  years let 's go back before christ  
 three millennia to a time when at least in my head  the journey for justice the march against inequality and poverty really began
 three thousand years ago  civilization just getting started on the banks of the nile  some slaves  jewish shepherds in this instance  
 smelling of sheep shit i guess 
 proclaimed to the pharaoh sitting high on his throne
  that 's what it says here in in our holy book 
 cut to our century  same country same pyramids another people spreading the same idea of equality with a different book 
 this time it 's called the facebook  
 crowds are gathered in tahrir square they turn a social network from virtual to actual and kind of
  rebooted the 21st century not to undersell how messy and ugly the aftermath of the arab spring has been neither
 to oversell the role of technology but these things have given a sense
 of what 's possible when the age old model of power  the pyramid 
 gets turned upside down putting the people on top and the pharaohs of today on the bottom as it were
  also shown us that something as powerful as information and the sharing of it
 can challenge inequality because facts 
 like people 
 want to be free and when they 're free  liberty is usually around the corner  even for the poorest of the poor facts that can challenge cynicism and the apathy
 that leads to inertia facts that tell us what 's working and more importantly what 's
  not so we can fix it  facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us meet the challenge that nelson mandela made
 back in two thousand and five when he asked us to be that great generation
 that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity extreme poverty facts that build
 a powerful momentum  so i thought  forget the rock opera
  forget the bombast my usual tricks  the only thing singing today
 would be the facts for i have truly embraced
 by inner nerd  so exit the rock star
  because what the facts are telling us
 is that the long  slow journey humanity 's long slow journey of equality is actually speeding up 
 look at what 's been achieved  look at the pictures these data sets print  
 since the year two thousand since the turn of the millennium
  there are eight million more aids patients getting life saving antiretroviral drugs 
 malaria  there are eight countries in sub saharan africa that have their death rates cut by seventy five percent 
 for kids under five  child mortality kids under five it 's down by two point six five million a year that 's a rate of seven
  let 's just stop for a second actually and think about that have you read anything anywhere in the last week that is remotely as important as that number wow 
 great news 
 it drives me nuts
 that most people don 't seem to know this news seven thousand kids a day here
 this is michael and benedicta  and they 're alive thanks in large part to dr patricia
 asamoah she 's amazing
 and the global fund which all of you financially support whether you know it or not and the global fund provides antiretroviral drugs that stop mothers from passing hiv to their
  this fantastic news didn 't happen by itself it was fought for it was campaigned for it was innovated for and this great news gives birth
 to even more great news  because the historic trend is this the number of people living in 
  extreme poverty has declined from forty three percent of the world 's population in
  the rate is still too high still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives there 's still work to do but it
  if you live
 on less than $ one point two five a day if you live in that kind of poverty this is not just data this
 is everything if you 're a parent who wants
 the best for your kids and i am
 this rapid transition is a route out of despair and into hope  and guess what if the trajectory continues look where the
  amount of people living on $ one point two five a day gets to by two thousand and thirty 
 can 't be true can it that 's what the data is telling us if the
 trajectory continues we get to wow  the zero zone for
  like us that is the erogenous zone  and it 's fair to say that i am by now  sexually aroused
 by the collating of data  
 so
 virtual elimination
 of extreme poverty as defined by people living on less than $ one point two five a day  adjusted of course for inflation from a one thousand nine hundred and
  we do love a good baseline 
 that 's amazing 
 now i know that some of you think this progress is all in asia or latin america or
 model countries like brazil and
 who doesn 't love a
 brazilian model but look at sub saharan africa there 's a collection of ten countries some call them the lions who in the
  last decade
 have had a combination of one hundred percent debt cancellation a tripling of aid a tenfold increase in fdi that 's foreign direct investment which has unlocked a quadrupling of domestic resources 
  that 's local money which when spent wisely that 's good governance cut childhood mortality by a third doubled education completion rates  and they too 
  so the pride of lions
 is the proof of concept there are all kinds of benefits to this for a start 
 you won 't have to listen to an insufferable little jumped up jesus like myself
  makes us look really young 
 so why aren 't we jumping up and down about this well 
 the opportunity is real but so is the jeopardy we can 't get this done
 until we really accept that we can get this done look at this graph
  called inertia  it 's how we screw it up and the next one is really beautiful  it 's called momentum  
 and it 's how we can bend
 the arc of history down towards zero just doing the things that we know work so inertia versus
  there is jeopardy  
 and of course the closer you get it gets harder 
 we know the obstacles that are in our way right now in difficult times in fact today in your capital 
 in difficult times  some who mind the nation 's purse want to cut life saving programs like the global fund  
 but you can do something about that you can tell politicians
 that these cuts [ can cost ] lives right now today in oslo as it happens
  oil companies are fighting to keep secret their payments to governments for extracting oil in developing
 countries  you can do something about that too  you can join the one campaign and leaders like mo ibrahim the telecom entrepreneur 
 we 're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some
 of the wealth under the ground ends up in the hands of the people living above it
 and right now  we know that the biggest disease
 of all is not a disease  
 it 's corruption  but there 's a vaccine for that too  it 's called transparency  open data sets 
 something the ted community is really
 on it  daylight you could call it
  technology is really turbocharging this  it 's getting harder to hide
 if you 're doing bad stuff  so let me tell you about the u report which i 'm really excited about it 's one hundred and fifty thousand millennials
 all across uganda young people armed with 2g phones an sms social network exposing government
 corruption and demanding to know what
  in the budget and how their money is being spent 
 this is exciting stuff  
 look 
 once you have these tools  you can 't not use them once you have this knowledge  you can 't un know it  
 you can 't delete this data from your brain  but you can delete
 the cliched image of supplicant impoverished peoples not taking control of their own lives  you can
  erase that you really can because it 's not true anymore it
 's transformational two
 thousand and thirty  by two thousand and thirty robots not just serving us guinness but drinking it  by the time we get there 
 every place with a rough semblance of governance
 might actually be
 on their way
  way  so i 'm here to i guess we 're here to try and infect you
 with this virtuous data based virus the one we call factivism it
 's not going to kill you in fact it could save countless lives  
 i guess we in the one campaign
 campaign would love you to
 be contagious  spread it share it pass it on by doing so you will join us
 and countless others in what i truly believe
 is the greatest adventure ever taken the
 journey of equality could we really be the great generation
 that mandela asked us to be might we answer that clarion call with science
  with reason with facts 
 and dare i say it  emotions  because as is obvious  
 factivists have feelings too 
 i 'm thinking of wael ghonim though some of you know him he set up one of the facebook groups behind the tahrir square
 in cairo  he got thrown in jail for it but i have his
  words tattooed on my brain we are going to win
 because we don 't understand politics  we are going to win because we don 't play their dirty games we are going to win because we don 't have a party political agenda  we are going to win 
 because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts  we are going to win because
  and we 're willing to stand up for those dreams wael is right we 're going to win
 if we work together as one because the power of the people is so much stronger than the people in power
