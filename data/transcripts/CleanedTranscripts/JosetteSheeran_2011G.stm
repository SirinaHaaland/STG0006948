  well after many years working in trade and economics four years ago i found myself working on the front lines of human vulnerability  
 and i found myself in the places where people are fighting every day to survive and can 't even obtain a meal
 this red cup comes from rwanda from a child named fabian  
 and i carry this around as a symbol really of the challenge and also the hope  
 because one cup of food a day changes fabian 's life completely  
 but what i 'd like to talk about today is the fact that this morning about a billion people on earth
 or one out
  of every seven woke up and didn 't even know how to fill this cup one out of every seven people 
 first i 'll ask you why should you care why should we care for most people 
 if they think about hunger they don 't have to go far back on their own family
  maybe in their own lives or their parents ' lives or their grandparents ' lives
 to remember an experience of hunger  
 i rarely find an audience where people can go back very far without that experience some are driven by compassion  feel it 's perhaps
 one of the fundamental acts of humanity as gandhi said to a hungry man a piece of bread is the face of god 
 others worry about peace and security  stability in the world
  the food riots in two thousand and eight after what i call the silent tsunami of hunger swept the globe when food prices doubled overnight  
 the destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history  one of the most fundamental
 acts of civilization is to ensure people can get enough food  others think about malthusian nightmares will we be able to feed
 a population that will be nine billion in just a few decades  
 this is not a negotiable thing hunger people have to eat there 's going to be a lot of people this is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain  
 but i actually came to this issue in a different way this
 is a picture
  i was a new mother with my first child and was holding her and feeding her
 when an image very similar to this came
 on the television  
 and this was yet another famine in ethiopia one two years earlier had killed more than a million people 
 but it never struck me as it did that moment because on that image was a woman trying to nurse
  nurse her baby and she had no
 milk
 to nurse  and the baby 's cry really penetrated me as a mother  
 and i thought there 's nothing more haunting than the cry of a child that cannot be returned
 with food the most fundamental expectation of every human being  and it was at that moment that i just was filled with
  with
 the challenge
 and the outrage that actually we know how to fix this problem this isn 't one of those rare diseases that we don 't have the solution for 
 we know how to fix hunger a hundred years ago we didn 't we actually have the technology and systems  
 and i was just struck
 that this is out of place at our time in history
  these images are out of place well guess what  this is last week in northern kenya  
 yet again the face of starvation
 at large scale with more than nine million people wondering if they can make it to the next day 
 in fact what we know now
 is that every ten seconds
  we lose a child to hunger  this is more
 than hiv aids  malaria and tuberculosis combined  and we know
 that the issue is not just production of food one of my mentors in life was norman borlaug my hero  
 but today i 'm going to talk about access to food because actually
 this year and
  last year and during the two thousand and eight food crisis there was enough food on earth for everyone to have two thousand seven hundred kilocalories so why is it
 that we have a billion people who can 't find food  
 and i also want to talk about what i call our new burden of knowledge in two thousand and eight  
  lancet compiled all the research
 and put forward the compelling evidence
 that if a child in its first thousand days from conception
 to two years old does not have adequate nutrition  
 the damage is irreversible their brains and bodies will be stunted  and here you see a brain scan
 of two children one who had adequate nutrition another neglected and who was deeply malnourished
  and we can see brain volumes up to forty percent less
 in these children and in this slide you see the neurons
 and the synapses of the brain don 't form  and what we know now is this has huge impact on economies which i 'll talk about later  but also the earning potential of these children is cut in half
 in their lifetime due
  to the stunting that happens in early years 
 so this burden of knowledge drives me because actually we know how to fix it very simply  
 and yet in many places a third of the children by the time they 're three
 already are facing a life of
  due to this i 'd like to talk about some of the things i 've seen on the front lines of hunger  some of the things i 've learned
 in bringing my economic and trade knowledge and my experience in the private sector i
 'd like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is well first i 'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on earth breastfeeding  
 you may be surprised to know that a child could be saved every
  if there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life  
 but in niger for example less than seven percent of the children are breastfed
 for the first six months of life exclusively in mauritania less than three percent  
 this is something that can be transformed with knowledge this message this word
  can come out that this is not an old fashioned way of doing business it 's a brilliant way
 of saving your child 's life  and so today we focus on not just passing out food but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment 
 and teaching them about breastfeeding  
 the second thing i 'd like to talk about if you were living in a remote
  your child was limp 
 and you were in a drought or you were in floods or you were in a situation where there wasn 't adequate diversity of diet what would you do do you think you could go to the store
 and get a choice of power bars like we can 
 and pick the right one to match  well i find parents out on the front lines very aware their children are going down for the count  and i go to those
  if there are any or out to the fields to see what they can get and they cannot obtain the nutrition 
 even if they know what they need to do it 's not available and i 'm very excited about this because one thing
 we 're working on is transforming the technologies that are very available in the food industry to be available for traditional crops  
 and this
 is made with chickpeas dried milk and a host of vitamins
  matched to exactly what the brain needs it costs seventeen cents for us to produce this
 as what i call food for humanity  we did this with food technologists in india and pakistan
 really about three of them but this is transforming ninety nine percent of the kids who get this one package seventeen cents a day
 their malnutrition is overcome
  so i am convinced that if we can unlock the technologies that are commonplace in the richer world to be able to transform foods 
 and this is climate proof it doesn 't need to be refrigerated it doesn 't need water which is often lacking  
  the next thing i want to talk about is school feeding eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net  when disaster strikes
 the economy gets blown people lose a job  floods war conflict bad governance all of those things there is nothing to fall back on and usually the
  other things do not have the resources to provide a safety net  
 what we have found working with the world bank is that the poor man 's safety net the best investment is school feeding  and if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers you have a transformative effect 
 many kids in the world can 't go to school because they have to go beg and find a meal but when that food is there it
 's transformative it costs less than
  day to change a kid 's life  but what is most amazing is the effect on girls in countries where girls don 't go to school
 and you offer a meal to girls in school  we see enrollment rates about fifty percent girls and boys  we see a transformation in attendance by girls and there was no argument  
 because it 's incentive 
 families need the help  and we find
  that if we keep girls in school later they 'll stay in school until they 're sixteen and won 't get married if there 's food in school 
 or if they get an extra ration of food at the end of the week it costs about fifty cents will keep a girl in school and they 'll give birth to a healthier child because the malnutrition is
 sent generation to generation we know that there 's boom and bust cycles of
  hunger we know this right now on the horn of africa we 've been through this before  so is this a hopeless cause  absolutely not i 'd
 like to talk about what i call our warehouses for hope  cameroon northern cameroon boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades food aid coming in
 every year when people are starving during the lean seasons
  well two years ago  
 we decided let 's transform the model of fighting hunger and instead of giving out the food aid we put it into food banks and we said listen during the lean season take the food out 
 you manage the village manages these warehouses 
 and during harvest put it back with interest food interest
  so add in five percent ten percent more food 
 for the past two years  five hundred of these villages where these are have not needed any food aid they 're self sufficient and the food banks are growing and they 're starting school 
  feeding programs for their children by the people in the village but they 've never had the ability to build even the basic infrastructure or the resources 
  and simple ideas can transform
 the face not of small areas of big areas of the world  
 i 'd like to talk about what i call digital food  
 technology is transforming the face of food vulnerability in places where you see classic famine amartya sen won his nobel prize for saying guess what famines happen in the presence of food
  because people have no ability to buy it we certainly saw that in two thousand and eight we 're seeing that now in the horn of africa where food prices are up two hundred and forty percent in some areas over last year 
 food can be there and people can 't buy it well this picture i was in hebron in a small shop this shop where instead of bringing in food 
  the women can go in and swipe and get nine food items they have to be nutritious  
 and they have to be locally produced  and what 's happened in the past year alone is the dairy industry where this card 's used
 for milk and yogurt and eggs and hummus
 the dairy industry has gone up thirty percent  the shopkeepers are hiring more people it is a
 win win win situation that starts
 the food economy moving  we now deliver food in over thirty countries over cell phones  
 transforming even the the presence of refugees refugees in countries and other ways 
 perhaps most exciting to me is an idea that bill
  howard buffett and others have supported boldly  
 which is to ask the question what if instead of looking at the hungry as victims and most of them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food
 or sell food to even support their own families what if
 we view them as the solution as the value chain to fight hunger what if
 from the women in africa who cannot sell any food there 's no roads there 's no warehouses there 's not
  even a tarp to pick the food up with what if we give the enabling environment for them to provide the food to feed the hungry children
 elsewhere  and purchasing for progress today is in twenty one countries and guess what 
 in virtually every case  when poor farmers are given a guaranteed market if you say we will buy three hundred metric tons of this we 'll pick it up we 'll make sure it 's stored properly
 their yields have gone up two three fourfold and they figure it out  
 because it 's the first guaranteed opportunity they 've had in their life and we 're seeing people transform their lives 
 today food aid our food aid
 huge engine eighty percent of it is bought in the developing world  total transformation that can actually transform the very lives that need the food
 now you 'd ask can this be done at scale these are great ideas village level ideas  
 well i 'd like to talk about brazil  because i 've taken a journey to brazil over the past couple of years when i read that brazil was defeating hunger faster than any nation on earth right now  
 and what i 've found is rather than investing their money in food subsidies and other things they invested in a school feeding program and they require that a third of that
  food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity 
 and they 're doing this at huge scale after president lula declared his goal of ensuring everyone had three meals a day  
 and this
 zero hunger program costs  5 percent of gdp
 and has lifted
 many millions of people out of hunger and poverty
  is transforming the face of hunger in brazil  and it 's at scale and it 's creating opportunities i 've gone out there i 've met with the small farmers
 who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this 
 now if we look at the economic imperative here this isn 't just
  the fact is studies show that the cost of malnutrition and hunger the cost to society the burden it has to bear
 is on average six percent  
 and in some countries up to eleven percent of gdp a year 
 and if you look at the thirty six countries with the highest burden of malnutrition that 's two hundred and sixty billion lost from a productive economy every year  
 well the world bank estimates it would take
  ten billion dollars 
 to address malnutrition in those countries you look at the cost benefit analysis and my dream is to take this issue 
 not just from the compassion argument but to the finance ministers of the world and say we cannot afford to not invest in the access to adequate affordable nutrition
 for all of humanity
 the amazing thing i 've found is nothing can change on a big scale without the determination of a leader when a leader says not under my watch everything begins to change 
 and the world can come in with enabling environments and opportunities to do this and the fact that france has put
 food at the center of the g20 is really important  because food
  is one issue that cannot be solved
 person by person nation by nation we have to stand together  and we 're seeing nations in africa wfp 's been able to leave thirty nations
 thirty nations because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations what i would like to offer here is a challenge 
  living at a time in human history where it 's just simply unacceptable
 that children wake up and don 't know where to find a cup of food not only that transforming hunger
 is an opportunity  but i think we have to change our mindsets 
 i am so honored to be here with some of the world 's top innovators and thinkers  
 and i would like you to join with
 all of
  humanity to draw a line in the sand and say no more 
 no more are we going to accept this and we want to tell our grandchildren that there was a terrible time in history where up to a third of the children had brains and bodies that were stunted  but that exists no more thank you
