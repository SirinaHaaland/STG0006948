  it 's often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what 's on their bookshelves 
 what do my bookshelves say about me  well when i asked myself this question a
 few years ago  i made an alarming discovery 
 i 'd always thought of myself as a fairly cultured  cosmopolitan sort of person  but my bookshelves told a rather different story 
 pretty much all the titles on them were by british or north american authors  and there was almost nothing in translation 
 discovering this massive  cultural blind spot in my reading came as quite a shock  and when i thought about it it seemed like a real shame
 i knew there had to be lots of amazing stories out there by writers working in languages other than english  
 and it seemed really sad to think that my reading habits meant i would probably never encounter them 
 so i decided to prescribe myself an intensive course of global reading two thousand and
 twelve was set to be a very international year for the uk it was the year of the london olympics
 and so i decided to use it as my time frame to try to read a novel short story collection or memoir from every country in the world  
 and so i did  
 and it was very exciting and i learned some remarkable things and made some wonderful connections that i want to share with you today  
 but it started with some practical problems
  after i 'd worked out which of the many different lists of countries in the world to use for my project  
 i ended up going with the list of un recognized nations to which i added taiwan which gave me a total of one hundred and ninety six countries 
 and after i 'd worked out how to fit reading and blogging about roughly four books a week around working five days a week 
 had to face up to the fact that i might even not be able to get books in english from every country 
 only around four point five percent of the literary works published each year in the uk are translations 
 and the figures are similar for much of the english speaking world  
 although the proportion of translated books published in many other countries is a lot higher  
 four point five percent is tiny
  enough to start with 
 but what that figure doesn 't tell you is that many of those books will come from countries with strong publishing networks and lots of industry professionals primed to go out and sell those titles to english language publishers 
 so for example although well over one hundred books are translated from french and published in the uk each year 
 most of them will come from countries like france or
  switzerland french speaking africa on the other hand will rarely ever get a look in 
 the upshot is that there are actually quite a lot of nations that may have little or even no commercially available literature in english 
 their books remain invisible to readers of the world 's most published
  but when it came to reading the world the biggest challenge of all for me was that fact that
 i didn 't know where to start  
 having spent my life reading almost exclusively british and north american books 
 i had no idea how to go about sourcing and finding stories and choosing them from much of the rest of the world  
 i couldn 't tell you how to source a story from swaziland  i wouldn 't know a good novel from namibia 
 there was no hiding it i was a clueless
 literary xenophobe  so how on earth was i going to read the world  
 i was going to have to ask for help so in october two thousand and eleven  i registered my blog
 and i posted a short appeal online  
 i explained who i was how narrow my reading had been and i asked anyone who cared to to leave a message suggesting what i might read from other parts of the planet
  now  i had no idea whether anyone would be interested  
 but within a few hours of me posting that appeal online  people started to get in touch at first it was friends and colleagues 
 then it was friends of friends 
 and pretty soon it was strangers 
 four days after i put that appeal online  i got a message from a woman called rafidah in kuala lumpur
 she said she loved the sound of my project could she go to her local english language bookshop and choose my malaysian book and post it to me  
 i accepted enthusiastically  and a few weeks later a package arrived containing not one  but two books
 's choice from malaysia  and a book from singapore that she had also picked out for me  
 now  at the time i was amazed that a stranger more than six thousand miles away
 would go to such lengths to help someone she would probably never meet  
 but rafidah 's kindness proved to be the pattern for that year time and again people went out of their way to help me  
 some took on research on my behalf
  others made detours on holidays and business trips to go to bookshops for me  
 it turns out if you want to read the world  if you want to encounter it with an open mind 
 the world will help you 
 when it came to countries with little or no commercially available literature in english  people went further still 
 books often came from surprising
  sources my panamanian read for example came through a conversation i had with the panama canal on twitter 
 yes the panama canal has a twitter account  
 and when i tweeted at it about my project  it suggested that i might like to try and get hold of the work of the panamanian author juan david morgan 
 i found morgan 's website and i sent him a message
  if any of his spanish language novels had been translated into english 
 and he said that nothing had been published but he did have an unpublished translation of his novel the golden horse 
 he emailed this to me  allowing me to become one of the first people ever to read that book in english
  morgan was by no means the only wordsmith to share his work with me in this way from sweden
 to palau writers and translators sent me self published books and unpublished manuscripts of books that hadn 't been picked up by anglophone publishers
 or that were no longer available giving me privileged glimpses of some remarkable imaginary worlds 
 i read for example about the southern african
  led the resistance against the portuguese in the  19th century  
 and about marriage rituals in a remote village on the shores of the caspian sea in turkmenistan  
 i met
 kuwait 's answer to bridget jones and i read about an orgy in a tree in angola
  but perhaps the most amazing example of the lengths that people were prepared to go to to help me read the world  
 came towards the end of my quest when i tried to get hold of a book from the tiny
 african island nation of so 
  having spent several months trying everything i could think of to find a book that had been translated into english from the nation 
 it seemed as though the only option left to me was to see if i could get something
  translated for me from scratch  now i was really dubious whether anyone was going to want to help with this and give up their time for something like that 
 but within a week of me putting a call out on twitter and facebook for portuguese speakers  
 i had more people than i could involve in the project  
 including
  a leader in her field who has translated the work of nobel prize winner jos 
  with my nine volunteers in place i managed to find a book by a so toman author that i could buy enough copies of online  here 's one of them  
 and i sent a copy out to each of my volunteers  they all took on a couple of short stories from this collection stuck to their word sent their translations back to me 
  six weeks i had the entire book to read 
 in that case as i found so often during my year of reading the world  
 my not knowing and being open about my limitations had become a big opportunity
  when it came to so 
 it was a chance not only to
  learn something new and discover a new collection of stories 
 but also to bring together a group of people and facilitate a joint creative endeavor 
 my weakness had become the project 's strength 
 the books i read that year opened my eyes to many things as those who enjoy reading will know 
 books have an extraordinary power to take you out of yourself and into someone else 's mindset 
 so that for a while at least you look at
  world through different eyes 
 that can be an uncomfortable experience particularly if you 're reading a book from a culture that may have quite different values to your own  
 but it can also be really enlightening  
 wrestling with unfamiliar ideas can help clarify your own thinking  
 and it can also show up blind spots in the way you might have been looking at the world  
 when i looked back at much of the
 english language literature i 'd grown up with for example  i began to see how narrow a lot of it was compared to the richness that the world has to offer  
 and as the pages turned something else started to happen too 
 little by little that long list of countries that i 'd started the year with changed from a rather dry  academic register of place names
  into living  breathing entities  
 now  i don 't want to suggest that it 's at all possible to get a rounded picture of a country simply by reading one book 
 but cumulatively the stories i read that year made me more alive than ever before to the richness diversity and complexity
 of our remarkable planet  it was
  as though the world 's stories and the people who 'd gone to such lengths to help me read them
 had made it real to me  
 these days when i look at my bookshelves or consider the works on my e reader they tell a rather different story
  it 's the story of the power books have to connect us across political
  divides it 's the tale of the potential human beings have to work together  
 and it 's testament to the extraordinary times we live in 
 where thanks to the internet  it 's easier than ever before for a stranger to share a story a worldview a book
 with someone she may never
  on the other side of the planet  
 i hope it 's a story i 'm reading for many years to come and i hope many more people will join me  
 if we all read more widely there 'd be more incentive for publishers to translate more books and we would all be richer for that
