  i listened to this scientist this morning  dr mullis was talking about his experiments and i
 realized that i almost became a scientist when i was fourteen my parents bought me a chemistry set
  and i decided to make water 
 so i made a hydrogen generator
 and i made an oxygen generator and i had the two pipes leading into a beaker and i threw a match in
  turned around i had it all in my back
 and i was about fifteen feet away the wall was covered with i had an explosion richard saul wurman really fg people on the street came and knocked on the door to see if i was okay
  to my left is the very famous perhaps overly famous frank gehry 
 and frank you 've come to a place in your life  which is astonishing  i mean it is astonishing
 for an artist for an architect to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time i mean you have become whether you can giggle at it because it 's a funny
  thought but your building is an icon you can draw a little picture of that building it can be used in ads
 and you 've had not rock star status but celebrity status
 in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life  and i know the road was extremely difficult  
  and it didn 't seem at least that your sell outs  whatever they were were very big
 you kept moving ahead
 in a life where you 're dependent on working for somebody  
 but that 's an interesting thing for a creative person a lot of us work for people we 're in the hands of other people and that 's one of the great dilemmas we 're in a creativity session it 's
 one of the great dilemmas in creativity
 how to do work that 's big enough and not
 sell  out and you 've achieved that and that makes your win
 doubly big  triply big it 's not quite a question but you can comment on it it 's a big issue fg 
 well i 've always just i 've never really gone out looking for work i always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head
 and
 when i started out i thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff and
 i realized when i 'd come into the meetings with these
 corrugated metal and chain link stuff and
 people would just look at me like i 'd just landed from mars  
 but i couldn 't do anything else that was my response to the people in the time and actually it was responding to to
 clients that i had who didn 't have very much money so they couldn 't afford very much i think it was circumstantial until i got to my house 
 where the client was my wife we bought this tiny little bungalow in santa monica and for like fifty grand i built a house around it and
 a
 few people got excited about it  i was visiting with an artist michael heizer out in the
 desert near las vegas somewhere he 's building this huge concrete place and
 it was late in the evening we 'd had a lot to drink we were standing out in the desert all alone and  thinking about my
  ever occur to you if
 you
 built stuff more permanent  somewhere in two thousand years somebody 's going to like it 
 so i thought yeah that 's probably a good idea 
 luckily i started to get some
 clients that had a little more money  so the stuff was a little more permanent
  but i just found out the world ain 't going to last that long this guy was telling us the other day  so
 where do we go now back to everything 's so temporary  i don 't see it the way you you characterized
 for me every day is a new thing i approach each project with a new insecurity
  almost like the first project i ever did and
 i get the sweats i go in and start working i 'm not sure where i 'm going if i
 knew where i was going i wouldn 't do it when i can predict or plan it i don 't
 do it i discard it so i approach it with the same trepidation  obviously 
 over time i have a lot more confidence
 that it 's going to be ok  i do
  run a kind of a business i 've got one hundred and twenty people
 and you 've got to pay them so there 's a lot of responsibility involved but the actual work on the project is
 with i think a healthy insecurity  and
 like the playwright
 said the other day i could relate to
  when bilbao was finished and i looked at it i saw all the mistakes i saw they weren 't mistakes i saw everything that i would have changed and 
 i was embarrassed by it  i felt an embarrassment how could i have done that how could i have
 made shapes like that or done stuff like that 
 it 's taken several years to now look at it detached and say
 as you walk around the
  corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street and it appears to have a relationship
 that i started to like it rsw 
 what 's the status of the new york project fg 
 i don 't really know  tom krens came to me with bilbao and explained it all to me and i thought he was nuts
 i didn 't think he knew what he was doing and he
 pulled it off so i think he 's icarus and phoenix all in one guy 
 he gets up there and then he comes back up they
 're still talking about it september eleven
 generated some interest in moving it over to
 and i 'm totally against that 
 i just feel uncomfortable
 talking about or building anything on ground zero i think for a long time  rsw the picture on the screen
  that will be finished in two thousand and three september october and i 'm hoping kyu and
 herbie and yo yo and all those guys come
 play with us at that place  luckily today most of the people i 'm working with are people
 i really like richard koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that disney hall came to me he 's been a cheerleader
 for quite a long time there aren 't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients if you
 think about the
 the world  and even just in this audience  most of
  nothing that you would call architecture  right  and so to find one a guy like that 
 you hang on to him   he 's become the head of art center  
 and there 's a building by craig ellwood there
 i knew craig and and respected him  they want to add to it and it 's hard to add to a building like that it 's a
 beautiful minimalist
  black steel building and richard wants to add a library and
 more student stuff
 and it 's a lot of acreage i convinced him to let me bring in another architect from portugal  alvaro siza rsw 
  alvaro siza
 grew up and lived in portugal and is probably considered the portuguese
 main guy in architecture  i visited with him a few years ago
 and he showed me his early work and his early work
 had a resemblance to my early work
 when i came out of college i started to
 try to do things contextually in southern california and you got into
 the logic of spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that i tried to understand that language as a beginning as a
  as a place to jump off  and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and and it was trivialized so much that it
 it wasn 't i just stopped i mean charlie moore did a bunch of it but
 it didn 't feel good to me siza on the other hand 
  continued in portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to
 that that historic language and
 i always felt that he should come to southern california and do a building i tried to get him
 a couple of jobs and they didn 't pan out i like the idea of collaboration with
 people like that because it pushes you 
 i 've done it with claes oldenburg
 and with richard serra who doesn 't think architecture is art did you see that thing
  it 's a richer experience it must be like that for kyu doing things with musicians it 's similar to that i would imagine where you
  each other  you make something they make something  and i think
 for me it 's a way of trying to understand the city and what might what might happen in the city rsw is it going to be near the current campus
  or is it going to be down near fg no it 's near the current campus  anyway  he 's that kind of patron it 's not his money of course
  interesting because it creates chaos right everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment and
 if you can figure out how to work off each other
 you can get a bunch of people who respect each other 's work and play
 play off each other you might be able to create models for for how to build sections of the city
 without resorting to the one architect like the rockefeller center model which is kind of from another
 era rsw i found the most remarkable thing my preconception of bilbao
 was this wonderful building you go inside
  seen drawings you had presented here at ted the surprise of bilbao
 was in its context to the city
  that was the surprise of going across the river of going on the highway around it of walking down the street and finding it  
 that was the real surprise of bilbao fg but you know  richard most architects when they present their work most of the people we know  
 you get up and you talk about your work and it 's almost like you
  you tell everybody you 're a good guy by saying look i 'm
 worried about the context i 'm worried about the city  
 i 'm worried about my client i worry about budget that i 'm on time blah blah blah and all that stuff and it 's like
 cleansing yourself so that you can by saying all that it means your
 it means your work is good somehow  and i think
 everybody
 i mean that should be a matter of fact like gravity you 're
 not going to defy gravity you 've got to work with the building department if you don 't meet the budgets  you 're not going to get much work if
  the mit
 project they were interviewing me for mit and they sent their their facilities people to bilbao  
 i met them in bilbao they came for for three days rsw this is the computer building fg yeah the computer building they were there three days and it rained every day
 and they kept walking around i noticed they were looking under
  things and looking for things and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden you know people put buckets out 
 i was clean there wasn 't a bloody leak in the place it was just fantastic  but
 you 've got to
 yeah well up until then every building leaked so this
  had a fame his fame was built on that in l a for a while 
 laughter fg you 've all heard the frank lloyd wright story when the woman called and said 
 sitting on the couch and the water
 no not now either 
 laughter but my point is that 
 and i call it the then what ok you solved all the problems you did all the stuff you made nice  you loved your clients you loved the
  what do you bring to it  and i think that 's what
 i 've always been interested in is that which is a personal kind of expression
  bilbao i think
  you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases
 that are necessary of
 fitting into the city  that 's what reminded me  of it 
 and i think that 's that 's the issue  you know it 's the then what that most clients
 who hire architects
 most clients aren 't hiring architects for that they 're hiring them to get it done get it on budget
  be polite  and they 're missing out on
 the real value of of
 an architect rsw at a certain point a number of years ago people when michael graves was a fashion
  people wanted a michael graves building 
  since bilbao opened which is now four five years 
 both krens and i have been called with at least one hundred opportunities china  
  other parts of spain
 to come in and do the bilbao effect and i 've met with some of some of these people usually i
 say no right away  but some of them come with pedigree and and
 they sound well intentioned and they
 they get you for at least one or two meetings in one case i flew all the way to malaga with a team
 because the thing was signed with seals and various
 very official
 seals from the city and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port i asked them what kind of building it was when you get here
 and they took us they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the
 the bay and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us
 all these sights in the harbor each one was more beautiful than the other  
 and then
 we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner
 with the
 most important people in malaga just before going to lunch with the mayor  
 we went to the harbor commissioner it was a table
 as long as this carpet
 and the harbor commissioner was here and i was here and my guys 
 we sat down and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet and the guy looked at me and said
  can i do for you mr gehry rsw oh 
 my god fg so i got up 
 i said to my team let 's get out of here we stood up we walked out they followed the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said you mean you 're not going to have lunch with the
  i 'm old enough that i can complain i can 't travel 
 i don 't have my own plane yet
 this up and wind up the meeting because it 's been very long but let me just say a couple words fg can i say something are you going to talk about
 me or you
