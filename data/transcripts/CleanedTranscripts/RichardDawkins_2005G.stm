  the famous biologist who said now my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose  but queerer than
  can suppose  i suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of or can be dreamed of in any philosophy 
 richard feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories experimental predictions to specifying the 
  width of north america to within one hair 's breadth of accuracy 
  that quantum theory has got to be in some sense true  
 yet the assumptions that quantum theory needs to make in order to deliver those predictions are so mysterious that even feynman himself was moved to remark 
 if you think you understand quantum theory you don 't understand quantum theory 
 interpretation of it  
 david deutsch  who 's talking here 
 in the fabric of reality embraces the many worlds interpretation of quantum theory  
 because the worst that you can say about it is that it 's preposterously wasteful 
 it postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes existing in parallel mutually undetectable
  through the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical experiments  and that 's richard feynman 
 the biologist lewis wolpert believes that the queerness of modern physics is just an extreme example  science as opposed to technology does violence to common sense 
 every time you drink a glass of water he points out
  odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule that passed through the bladder of oliver cromwell it 's
 just elementary probability theory 
 the number of molecules per glassful is hugely greater than the number of glassfuls or bladdersful in the world 
 and of course there 's nothing special about cromwell or bladders you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed
  through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree 
 queerer than we can suppose 
 what is it that makes us capable of supposing anything and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose  
 are there things about the universe that will be forever beyond our grasp
  but not beyond the grasp of some superior intelligence are there things about the universe that are in principle ungraspable
 by any mind  however superior 
 the history of science has been one long series of violent brainstorms as successive generations have come to terms with increasing levels of queerness in the universe  
 we 're now so
  used to the idea that the earth spins rather than the sun moves across the sky it 's hard for us to realize what a shattering mental revolution that must have been 
 after all it seems obvious that the earth is large and motionless the sun small and mobile 
 but it 's worth recalling wittgenstein 's remark on the subject 
 tell me
  he asked a friend 
 why do people always say it was natural for man to assume that the sun went ' round the earth  rather than that the earth was rotating 
 and his friend replied well obviously because it just looks as though the sun is going round the earth 
 wittgenstein replied well what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the earth was rotating
  us against all intuition that apparently solid things like crystals and rocks are really almost entirely composed of empty space 
 and the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium and the next atom is in the next sports stadium 
 so it would seem the hardest
 almost entirely empty space  broken only by tiny particles so widely spaced they shouldn 't count  
 why then do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable 
 as an evolutionary biologist i 'd say this our brains have evolved to help us survive
 within the orders of magnitude of size and speed which our bodies
  operate at 
 we never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms  if we had our brains probably would perceive rocks as full of empty space rocks feel hard and impenetrable to our hands  
 precisely because objects like rocks and hands cannot penetrate each other 
 it 's therefore useful
  because such notions help us to navigate our bodies through the middle sized world in which we have to navigate 
 moving to the other end of the scale our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos
 at speeds close to the speed of light  if they had our brains would be much better at understanding einstein  i want to give the name
 to the medium scaled environment in which we 've evolved the ability to take act nothing to do with middle earth middle world 
 we are evolved denizens of middle world and that limits what we are capable of imagining 
 we find it intuitively easy to grasp ideas like when a rabbit moves at the sort of medium velocity at which rabbits and other middle world objects move and hits another middle
  world object like a rock it knocks itself out 
 may i introduce major general albert stubblebine iii 
 commander of military intelligence in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three [
 he ] stared at his wall in arlington virginia and decided to do it as frightening as the prospect was he was going into the
  next office  he stood up
 and moved out from behind his desk '
 what is the atom mostly made of ' he thought ' space ' he started walking ' what am i mostly made of 
 atoms ' he quickened his pace almost to a jog now '
  all i have to do is merge the spaces  
 then  general stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office 
 stubblebine who commanded sixteen thousand soldiers 
 was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall he has no doubt that this ability will one day be a common tool in the military arsenal  who would screw around
  with an army that could do that that 's from an article in playboy which i was reading the other day 
 i have every reason to think it 's true  i was reading playboy because i myself had an article in it 
 unaided
  schooled in middle world  
 finds it hard to believe galileo when he tells us a heavy object and a light object air friction aside would hit the ground at the same instant  and that 's because in middle world  air friction is always there  
 if we 'd evolved in a vacuum we would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously  
 if we were bacteria  constantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules it would be different but we
  motion in the same way our lives are dominated by gravity  but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension 
 a small insect would reverse these priorities  
 steve grand he 's the one on the left  douglas adams is on the right steve grand in his book creation life and how to make it is positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter itself
 we have this tendency to think that only solid material things are really things at all 
 waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal  
 victorians thought the waves had to be waves in some material medium the ether  
 but we find real matter comforting only because we 've evolved to survive in middle world
 matter
 is a useful fiction  a whirlpool for steve grand is a thing with just as much reality as a rock 
 in a desert plain in tanzania 
 in the shadow of the volcano ol doinyo lengai there 's a dune made of volcanic ash  
 the beautiful thing is that it
  what 's technically known as a barchan and the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction at a speed of about seventeen meters per year  
 it retains its crescent shape and moves in the direction of the horns what happens is that the wind blows the sand up the shallow slope on the other side 
  and then as each sand grain hits the top of the ridge it cascades down on the inside of the crescent and so the whole
 steve grand points out that you and i are ourselves more like a wave than a permanent thing 
 he invites us the reader to think of an experience from your childhood something you remember clearly something you can see feel maybe even smell as if 
  you were really there  after all you really were there at the time weren 't you 
 but here is the bombshell you weren 't there not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place 
 matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you 
 whatever you are therefore you are not the stuff of which you are made 
 if that doesn 't make the hair stand up on the back of your neck read it again until it does because it is important
 so really isn 't a word that we should use with simple confidence if a neutrino had a brain which it evolved in neutrino sized
  ancestors it would say that rocks really do consist of empty space  
  for an animal is whatever its brain needs it to be in order to assist its survival  
 and because different species live in different worlds there will be
 a discomforting variety of reallys 
 what we see of the real world is not the unvarnished world but a model of the world  regulated and adjusted by sense data  but constructed so it 's useful for dealing with the real world
 the nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are a flying animal needs a different kind of model
 from a walking climbing or swimming animal a monkey 's brain must have software capable of simulating
 a three dimensional world of branches and trunks a mole 's software for constructing models of its world will be customized for underground use 
 strider 's brain doesn 't need 3d software at all since it lives on the surface of the pond in an edwin abbott flatland
 i 've speculated that bats may see color with their ears 
 the world model that a bat needs in order to navigate through three dimensions catching insects
 must be pretty similar to the world model that any flying bird a day flying bird like a swallow needs to
  perform the same kind of tasks  
 the fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model while the swallow uses light is incidental 
 bats  i 've even suggested use perceived hues such as red and blue as labels  internal labels  for
 some useful aspect of echoes
 perhaps the acoustic texture of
  surfaces furry or smooth and so on
 in the same way as swallows or indeed we use
 those perceived hues redness and blueness etc to label long and short wavelengths of light there 's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength 
 the point is that the nature of the model is governed by how it is to be used  rather than by the sensory modality involved
 j b s haldane himself had something to say about animals whose world is dominated by smell 
 dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids extremely diluted  caprylic acid and caproic acid  the only difference you see is that one has an extra pair of carbon atoms in the chain  
 haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular
  weights by their smells just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes now 
 there 's another fatty acid capric acid which is just like the other two except that it has two more carbon atoms  
 a dog that had never met capric acid would
  have no more trouble imagining its smell than we would have trouble imagining a trumpet say playing one note higher than we 've heard a trumpet play before  
 perhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell oriented animals smell in color 
 and the argument would be exactly the same as for the bats 
 middle world the range of sizes and speeds which we have evolved to
  feel intuitively comfortable with
 is a bit like the narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum that we see as light of various colors  we 're blind to all frequencies outside that unless we use instruments to to help us 
 middle world is the narrow range of reality which we judge to
  as opposed to the queerness of the very small the very large and the very fast
 we could make a similar scale of improbabilities  
 nothing is totally impossible miracles are just events that are extremely improbable 
 a marble statue could wave its hand at us the atoms that make up its crystalline structure are all vibrating back and forth anyway because there are so many of them  and because there 's no agreement among them in their preferred direction of movement
  the marble as we see it in middle world  stays rock steady but
 the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move the same way at the same time and again and again in this case the hand would move and we 'd see it waving at us in middle world 
 the odds against it of course are so great that if you set out writing zeros at the time of the origin of the universe  you still would not have written enough zeros to this day
 evolution in middle world has not equipped us to handle very improbable events we don 't live long enough 
 in the vastness of astronomical space and geological time 
 that which seems impossible in middle world might turn out to be inevitable 
 one way to think about that is by counting planets we don 't know how many planets there
  are in the universe but a good estimate is about ten to the twenty or one hundred billion billion  
 and that gives us a nice way to express our estimate of life 's improbability we
 could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just
 looked at 
  life could originate once per planet could be extremely common or it could originate once per star or once per galaxy
 or maybe only once in the entire universe in which case it would have to be here 
 and somewhere up there would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince and similar magical
  like that if life has arisen
 on only one planet in the entire universe that planet has to be our planet because here we are talking about it  and that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it we 're allowed 
  to postulate chemical events in the origin of life which have a probability as low as one in one hundred billion billion  
 no one island of life ever encounters another which is a sad thought  
 how shall we interpret queerer than we can suppose 
 queerer than can in principle be supposed or just queerer than we can suppose  given the limitations of our brain 's evolutionary apprenticeship in middle
  could we by training and practice  emancipate ourselves from middle world and achieve some sort of intuitive as well as mathematical
 understanding of the very small and the very large 
 i genuinely don 't know the answer  
 i wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand say quantum theory  if we brought up children to play computer games beginning in early childhood which had a
 make believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen a world in which the strange goings on of quantum mechanics were
  enlarged by the 
 so that they became familiar on the middle world scale of the stream 
 and similarly  a relativistic computer game in which objects on the screen manifest the lorentz contraction and so on
 to try to get ourselves to get children into the way of thinking about it  
 i want to end by applying the idea of middle world to our perceptions of each other
 most scientists today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind we 're the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are our hormones are the way they are we 'd be different our characters would be different if our 
 and our physiological chemistry were different  but we scientists are inconsistent  if we were
  our response to a misbehaving person like a  child murderer should be something like this unit has a faulty component it needs repairing 
 that 's not what we say what we say and i include
 the most austerely mechanistic among us which is probably me what we say is vile monster  prison is too good for you 
 or worse we seek revenge in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle
  which we see of course all over the world today 
 in short when we 're thinking like academics we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines like computers or cars  
 but when we revert to being human  we behave more like basil fawlty who 
 we remember  thrashed his car to teach it a lesson when it wouldn 't start on gourmet night 
 the reason we personify things like cars and computers is that just as
  monkeys live in an arboreal world and moles live in an underground world and water striders live in a surface 
  flatland we live in a social world  we swim through a sea of people
 a social version of middle world  we are evolved to second guess the behavior of others by becoming
  treating people as machines may be scientifically and philosophically accurate  but it 's a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next 
 the economically useful way to model a person is to treat him as a purposeful goal seeking agent with pleasures and pains desires and intentions  guilt
 personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such
  brilliantly successful way to model humans it 's hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control
 when we 're trying to think about entities for which it 's not appropriate like basil fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people with the universe as a whole 
  if the universe is queerer than we can suppose is it just because we 've been naturally selected to suppose only what we needed to suppose in order to survive in the pleistocene of africa 
 or are our brains so versatile and expandable
 that we can train ourselves to break out of the box of our evolution 
 or finally are there some things in the universe so queer that no philosophy
 of beings  however godlike could dream them  thank you very much
