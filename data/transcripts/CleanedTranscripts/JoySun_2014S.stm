  i suspect that every aid worker in africa comes to a time in her career when she wants to take
 all the money for her project maybe it 's a school or a training program
 pack it in a suitcase get on a plane flying over the poorest villages in the country
  and start throwing that money out the window  
 because to a veteran aid worker the idea of putting cold  hard cash into the hands of the poorest people on earth
 doesn 't sound crazy it sounds really satisfying  i had that moment right about the 10 year mark and
  that 's also when i learned that this idea actually exists  and it might be just what the aid system needs  
 economists call it an unconditional cash transfer and it 's exactly that it 's cash given with no strings attached  
 governments in developing countries have been doing this for decades  and it 's only now with more evidence and new technology that it
 's possible to make this a model for delivering
  's a pretty simple idea right  well  why did i spend a decade doing other stuff for the poor  
 honestly  
 i believed that i could do more good with money for the poor than the poor could do for themselves  
 i held two assumptions one that poor people are poor in part because they 're uneducated and don 't make good choices
 two is that we then need people like me to figure out what they need and get it to them 
 it turns out the evidence says otherwise 
 in recent years researchers have been studying what happens when we give poor people cash 
 dozens of studies show across the board that people use cash transfers to improve their own lives
  pregnant women in uruguay buy better food and give birth to healthier babies  
 sri lankan men invest in their businesses  researchers who studied our work in kenya found that people invested in a range of assets from
 livestock to equipment to home improvements  and they saw increases in income from business and farming
 one year after the cash was sent
  sent  
 none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people work less 
 in fact they work more 
 now  these are all material needs 
 in vietnam  elderly recipients used their cash transfers to pay for coffins 
 as someone who
  if maslow got it wrong  i find this choice to prioritize spiritual needs
 deeply humbling i don 't know if i would have chosen to give food or equipment or
 coffins  which begs the question how good are we at allocating resources on behalf of the poor 
 are we worth the cost
  again we can look at empirical evidence on what happens when we give people stuff of our choosing 
 one very telling study looked at a program in india that gives livestock to the 
 and they found that thirty percent of recipients had turned around and sold the livestock they had been given
 for cash
  the real irony is for every one hundred dollars worth of assets this program gave someone 
 they spent another ninety nine dollars to do it 
 what if instead  we use technology to put cash  whether from
 aid agencies or from any one of us
 directly into a poor person 's hands today three in
  use mobile money  which is basically a bank account that can run on any cell phone 
 a sender can pay a one point six percent fee and with the click of a button
 send money directly to a recipient 's account
 with no intermediaries like the technologies that are disrupting industries in
  payments technology in poor countries could disrupt aid it 's spreading so quickly that it 's possible to imagine reaching
 billions of the world 's poor this way 
 that 's what we 've started to do at givedirectly we 're the first organization dedicated to providing cash transfers to the poor 
 we 've sent cash to thirty five thousand people across rural kenya and uganda
 of one thousand dollars per family  
 so far we 've looked for the poorest people in the poorest villages and in this part of the world they
 're the ones living in homes made of mud and thatch not cement and iron  
 so let 's say that 's your family  
 we show up at your door with an android phone we 'll get your
  take your photo and a photo of your hut
 and grab the gps coordinates that night we send all the data to the cloud and each piece gets checked by an independent team
 using for one example  
 satellite images  then we 'll come back we 'll sell you a basic cell phone if you don 't have one already 
 and a few weeks later  we send money to it 
 something that five years ago would have seemed impossible we
  can now do efficiently
 and free of corruption 
 the more cash we give to the poor  and the more evidence we have that it works the more we have to reconsider
 everything else we give today the logic behind aid is too often well we do at least some good 
 when we 're complacent with that as our
  bar when we tell ourselves that
 giving aid is better than
 no aid at all 
 we tend to invest inefficiently in our own ideas that strike us as innovative 
 on writing reports on plane tickets and suvs 
 what if the logic was will we do better
 than cash given directly
 organizations would have to prove that they 're doing more good for the poor than the poor can do for themselves of
 course giving cash won 't create public goods like
 eradicating disease or building strong institutions  
 but it could set a higher bar for how we help individual families improve their lives
  in aid  i believe most aid is better than just throwing money out of a plane 
 i am also absolutely certain that a lot of aid today
 isn 't better than giving directly to the poor  i hope that one day it will be
