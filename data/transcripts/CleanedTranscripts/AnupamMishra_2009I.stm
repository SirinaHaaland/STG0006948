  should not move quickly to the desert  so  first a small housekeeping announcement  please switch off
  welcome to the golden desert  indian desert  it receives the least rainfall in the country lowest rainfall  
 if you are
  feet deep one
 hundred meters  and in most parts it is saline not fit for drinking 
 so you can 't install hand pumps or dig wells  
 though there is no electricity in most of the villages  but suppose you use the green technology solar pumps
 they are of no use
  welcome to the golden desert clouds seldom visit this area  but we find
 forty different names of clouds in this dialect
 used here there are a number of techniques to
 harvest rain this is a new work  it 's a new program  but for the desert society this is no
  this is their life and they
 harvest rain in many ways  so this is the first device they use in harvesting rain  it 's called kunds somewhere it is called [ unclear ] and you can notice
 they have created a kind of false catchment the desert is there sand dunes some small field  and this is all big
 raised platform you can
  notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment  and there is a slope sometimes our
 engineers and architects
 do not care about slopes in bathrooms but here they will care properly  
 and the water will go where it should go and then it is forty feet
  waterproofing is done perfectly better than our city
 contractors  because not a single drop should go waste in this they collect one
 hundred thousand liters in one season  and this is pure drinking water  below the surface
  but now you can have this for year round it 's
 two houses 
 we often use a term called bylaws  
 because we are used to get written things  but here it is unwritten by law  and people made their house  
 and the water storage
 tanks
  these raised up platforms just like this
 stage 
 in fact they go fifteen feet deep  and collect rain water from roof there is a small pipe  and from their courtyard  it can also harvest something like twenty five thousand in a
 good monsoon  another big one this is of course out of the
 hardcore desert area  this is near jaipur this is
  called the jaigarh fort  
 and it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season  the age is four hundred years  
 so  since four hundred years it has been giving you
 almost six million gallons of water per season you can calculate the price of that water  it draws water from
  fifteen kilometers of
 canals  you can see a modern road  hardly fifty years old 
 it can break sometimes  but this four hundred year old canal which draws water  it is maintained for so many generations 
 of course if you want to go inside the two doors are locked but they can be opened for ted people
  we request them  you can see
 person coming up with two canisters of water and the water level these are not empty canisters water level is right up to this 
 it can envy many municipalities
 the color  the taste the purity of this water and this is what they call zero b type of water
  because it comes from the clouds pure distilled water 
 we stop for a quick commercial break and then we come back to the traditional systems  the government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring
 dollar project to bring water from the himalayas that 's why i said that this is a commercial break
  but we will come back once again to the traditional thing  
 so water from three hundred four hundred kilometers away 
 soon it become like this in many portions water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything of course there are some areas where water is
  i 'm not saying that it is not reaching at all but the tail end the jaisalmer
 area  you will notice in bikaner things like this where the water hyacinth couldn 't grow  the
 sand is flowing in these canals  the bonus is that you can find wildlife around it
  canal came 
 they said that throw away your traditional systems  these new cement tanks will supply you piped water  it 's a dream  
 and it became a dream also because
 soon the water was not able to reach these areas  and people started renovating their own structures
 these are all traditional water structures which we won 't be able to explain in such a short time  but you can see that no woman is standing on those
 i 'm not sure by that time bombay was there or delhi was there or chennai was there or bangalore was there  so  this was the terminal point for silk route 
 well connected eight hundred years ago
  through
 europe  none of us were able to go to europe but jaisalmer
 was well connected to it and this is the
  sixteen centimeter area  such a limited rainfall  and highest
 colorful life flourished in these areas you won 't find water in this slide but it is invisible  
 somewhere
 a stream or a rivulet is running through here or if you want to paint
  can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and
 deposit
 in the rooms  but apart from this system they designed
 beautiful water bodies around this town and what we call private
  public partnership you can add estate also so estate public and
 private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful
 water body  and
 it 's a kind of water body for all seasons  you will admire it just behold the beauty throughout
  the year whether water level goes up or down the beauty is there throughout another water body  
 dried up of course during the summer period  but you can see how
 the traditional society combines
 engineering with aesthetics with the heart these statues  marvelous statues gives you an idea of water table 
 when this
 rain comes and the water starts
  filling this tank it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in english today mass communication this was for mass communication  everybody 
  in the town will know that this elephant has drowned  so water will be there for seven months or nine months or twelve months  and then they will come and worship
  another small water body called the [ unclear ] it is difficult to translate in english especially in my english but the nearest would be glory a reputation 
 the reputation in desert of this small water water body is that it never dries up 
 they
 they knew the
 future also it was designed some one hundred and fifty years ago  but perhaps they knew that on sixth november two thousand and nine there will be a ted green and blue session so they painted it like this
  children are standing on a very difficult device to explain  this is called kund we have in english 
 surface water and ground water  but this is not ground water  you can draw ground water from any well  but this is no ordinary well  it squeeze the moisture hidden in the
 dubbed this water as the third one called [ unclear ] and
 there is a gypsum belt running below it  and it was deposited by the great mother earth some
 three million years ago  and where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water  this is the same dry water body now you don 't find any
  are all submerged  but when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year this year they have received 
  only six centimeters  six centimeter of rainfall  and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your
  please come to our area of six centimeters  we can give you water 
 how they maintain them there are three things  concept  planning  making the actual thing  and also maintaining them 
  for maintain for centuries by generations  without any department  without any funding so the secret
  not personal property 
 my property every time so these stone pillars will remind you that you are entering into a water body area  don 't spit don 't do anything 
  wrong so that the clean water can be collected another pillar stone pillar on your right side
  if you climb these three six steps you will find something very nice  this was
 done in 11th century  and you have to go further down they say that a picture is worth a thousand words so we can say a
 thousand words right now an another thousand words  if the water table goes down  you will find new stairs if it comes up some of them will be submerged
  this beautiful system will give you some pleasure three sides such steps on the fourth side there is
 the best civil engineers we had  
 the best planners  the best architects 
 we can say that because of them  because of their forefathers india could get the first engineering college in 
 there were no english medium schools at that time
  but such people compelled to the east india company  which came here for business a very dirty kind of business 
 but not to create the engineering colleges  but because of them  first engineering college was created in a small village 
 not in the town 
 the last point we all know in our
 primary schools that that camel is a ship of desert
  so  you can find through your jeep a camel and a cart  
 this tire comes from the airplane  
 so look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater and also create something
 through a tire from
  they were using it on their body  tattoo was at one time a kind of a blacklisted or
 con thing but now it is in thing 
 applause you can copy this tattoo i have some posters of this
 of life is water  these are the beautiful waves  these are the beautiful stairs which we just
 saw in one of the slides  these are the trees  and these are the flowers
 which add fragrance
  do you believe that they
 can be used elsewhere that the world can learn from this or is this just right for this place 
  the basic idea is to utilize water that falls on our area  so the ponds  the open bodies are everywhere 
 right from sri lanka to
 kashmir  and in other parts also  and these [ unclear ] which stored water  there are two
  which uses the gypsum belt for that you have to go back to your calendar three million
 years ago if it is there it can be done right now  otherwise it can 't be done
