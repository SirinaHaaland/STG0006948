  mostly a coral reef ecologist  i started out in chesapeake bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight and
  it was really a lot of fun for about ten years  i mean  somebody pays you to go around and travel and
 look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet and that was what i did 
 and i ended up in jamaica in the west indies where the coral reefs
 were really among the most extraordinary structurally that i ever saw in my life and this picture here it 's really interesting it shows
  things first of all it 's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far and film was so slow in the 
  and early 70s you took pictures in black and white the other thing it shows you is that although there 's this beautiful forest of coral there are no fish  in that picture
  those reefs at
 discovery bay jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for twenty years  we were the best and the brightest people came to study our 
  reefs from australia which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs 
  hurricane hurricane allen
  i put half the lab up in my house  the wind blew very strong the waves were
 to fifty feet high  and the reefs disappeared and new islands formed and we thought well  we 're real smart we know that hurricanes have always happened in the past and we published a paper in science the first time
 that anybody ever described
 the destruction on a coral reef by
 a major hurricane and we predicted what would happen and we got it all wrong  and the reason
 was because of overfishing and the fact that a last common grazer a sea urchin died and within a few months after that sea urchin dying
 the seaweed started to grow and that is the same reef
 that 's the same reef fifteen years ago that 's the same reef today  the coral reefs of the north coast of jamaica have a few percent live coral cover 
 and a lot of seaweed and slime and that 's more or less the story of the coral reefs of the
  the coral reefs worldwide now that 's my little depressing story all of us in our 60s and 70s have comparable
 depressing stories there are tens of thousands of those stories out there  and it 's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well being 
  because it just keeps getting worse and the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe 
  a
 hurricane
 it used to be that there was some kind of successional sequence of recovery  
 but what 's going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that and so i 'm going to sort of go through and talk about those three
 kinds of things we
  hear a lot about the collapse of cod it 's difficult to imagine that two or some historians would say three world wars
 were fought during the colonial era for the control of cod cod fed most of the people of western europe it fed the slaves brought
 to the antilles
  rice salt fish are nice is an emblem of the importance of salt cod from northeastern canada  it all collapsed in the  80s and the 
  thousand people lost their jobs and that was the beginning of a kind of serial depletion from bigger and tastier species to smaller and not so tasty
  from species that were near to home to species that were all around the world
 and what have you it 's a little hard to understand that because you can go to
 a costco in the united states and buy cheap fish you ought to read the label to find out where it came from but it 's still cheap and everybody thinks it 's okay 
 it 's hard to communicate this and one way that i think is really interesting is to talk about sport fish
  like to go out and catch fish it 's one of those things this picture here shows the trophy fish the biggest fish caught by people who pay a lot of money to get on a boat 
 go to a place off of key west in florida  drink a lot of beer  throw a lot of hooks and lines into the
  come back with the biggest and the best fish  and the champion trophy fish are put on this board where people take a picture  and this guy is obviously really excited about that fish  
 well that 's what it 's like now but this is what it was like in the 
 from the same boat in the same place on the same board on the same dock the trophy fish were so big
 that you couldn 't put any of those small fish up on it
  and the average size trophy fish weighed two hundred and fifty to three hundred pounds  goliath grouper  and if you wanted to go out and kill something you could pretty much count on being able 
  to catch one of those fish  and they tasted really good  and people paid less in one thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those those little tiny fish
  it 's not just the fish though that are disappearing
  industrial fishing uses big stuff big machinery  we use nets that are twenty miles long we use
  that have one million or two million hooks 
 and we trawl which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds
 put it on a big chain and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish
 think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest because
 it it clears it away and the habitat destruction is unbelievable 
 this is a photograph a typical photograph of what the continental
  shelves of the world look like you can see the rows in the bottom the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed 
  to plant corn what that was was a forest of sponges and coral  which is a critical habitat for the development of fish what it is now
  the area of the ocean floor
 that has been transformed from forest
 to level mud to parking lot is equivalent to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all 
  of the earth in the history of humanity  we 've managed to do that in the last one hundred to one hundred and fifty years  
  mercury and we hear a lot about plastic these days and all of that stuff is really disgusting  but what 's really insidious is the biological pollution that happens
 because of the magnitude of the shifts that
 it causes to entire ecosystems and i 'm going to just talk very briefly about two kinds
 of biological pollution one is introduced species and the other
  is what comes from nutrients 
 so this is the infamous caulerpa taxifolia the so called killer algae a book was written about it  it 's a bit of an embarrassment 
  it was accidentally released from the aquarium in monaco it was bred to be cold tolerant
  it 's very pretty and it has rapidly started to overgrow
 the once very rich biodiversity of the northwestern
 mediterranean
 i don 't know how many of you remember the movie the little shop of horrors but this is the plant of the little shop of horrors but instead of devouring the people in the shop what 
  it 's doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the
 bottom dwelling life of the entire northwestern mediterranean sea we don 't know anything that eats it we 're trying to do all sorts of genetics 
 and figure out something that could be done but as it stands it 's the monster from hell 
  excess nutrients  the green revolution all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer we use too much of it  it 's subsidized which is one of the reasons we used too much of it it runs 
  down the rivers and it feeds the plankton the little microscopic plant cells
  so it dies of old age which is unheard of for plankton and when it dies it falls to the bottom and then
 it rots  which means that bacteria break it down and in the process they use up all the oxygen and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment utterly lethal for anything that can 't swim
  what we end up with is a microbial zoo dominated by bacteria and jellyfish as you see on the left
 in front of you  and the only fishery left and it is a commercial fishery is the jellyfish fishery you see on the right where there used to be prawns  even 
 in newfoundland where we used to catch cod we now have a jellyfish fishery 
  toxic blooms that picture on the left is just staggering to me i have talked about it a million times but it 's unbelievable in the upper right of that picture on the left 
  is almost the mississippi delta and the lower left of that picture is the 
  border you 're looking at the entire northwestern gulf of mexico you 're looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish made by
  that beautiful little creature on the lower right and in the upper right you see this black sort of cloud moving ashore  that 's the same species 
 and as it comes to shore and the wind blows and little droplets of the water get into the air  the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up with people with acute respiratory distress  and that 's retirement homes on the west
  coast of florida a friend and i did this thing in hollywood we called hollywood ocean night and i was trying to figure out how to explain to actors
 what 's going on and i said so imagine you 're in a movie called ' escape from malibu ' because all the beautiful people have moved to north dakota where it 's clean and safe  
  and the only people who are left there are the people who can 't afford to move away from the coast
  because the coast instead of being paradise is harmful to your health 
 and then this is amazing it was when i was on holiday last early autumn in france this is from the coast of brittany  which is being enveloped in this green 
 algal slime  the reason that it attracted so much attention
  besides the fact that it 's disgusting is that sea birds flying over it are asphyxiated by the smell and die  and a farmer died of it and 
  you can imagine the scandal that happened and so there 's this war between the farmers and the fishermen about it all and the net result is that the beaches of brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis
  and then of course there 's climate change and we all know about climate change i guess the iconic figure of it is the melting of the ice in the arctic sea 
 think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the northwest passage well the northwest passage is already there i think it 's sort of funny 
 it 's on the siberian coast maybe the russians will charge tolls
  the governments of the world are taking this really seriously  
 the military of the arctic nations is taking it really seriously for all the denial of climate change by government leaders  the cia and
 the navies of norway and and the u s and canada whatever are busily thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view
 and of course arctic communities are toast  
 the other kinds of effects of climate change this is coral bleaching it 's a beautiful picture right all that white coral except it 's
 supposed to be brown what happens is that the corals are a symbiosis and they have these little
 algal cells that live inside them
  and the algae give the corals sugar and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection but when it gets too hot the algae can 't make the sugar the corals say you cheated you didn 't pay your rent they kick them out and then they die 
 not all of them die some of them survive some more are surviving but it 's really bad news
 to try and give you a sense of this imagine you go camping
 in july somewhere in europe or in north america and you wake up the next
  morning and you look around you and you see that eighty percent of the trees as far as you can see have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked  
 and you come home and you discover that eighty percent of all the trees in north america and in europe have dropped their leaves and then you read in the paper a few weeks later oh by the way a quarter
  that 's what happened in the indian ocean during the one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight el nino an area vastly greater than the size of north america and europe when eighty percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them
 died  and then the really scary thing
 about all of this the overfishing the pollution and the climate change
 is that each thing doesn 't happen in a vacuum  but there are these what we call positive feedbacks the
  synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts  and the great scientific challenge
 for people like me in thinking about all this is do we know how to put humpty dumpty back together again i mean because we at this point we can protect it  but what does that mean
  what are the oceans
 going to be like in twenty or fifty years  well there won 't be any fish except for minnows and
 the water will be pretty dirty and all those kinds of things and
 full of mercury etc etc
  and dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they 'll start to merge and we can imagine something
 of the global coastal ocean then you sure won 't want to eat fish that were raised in it because it would be a kind of gastronomic russian roulette  sometimes you have a toxic bloom  sometimes you don
 't that doesn 't sell
  the really scary
  things though are the physical chemical oceanographic things that are happening as the surface of the ocean gets warmer 
 the water is lighter when it 's warmer it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over we say it becomes more strongly stratified 
  the consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta
  or whatever those slow down and those fisheries collapse and at the same time  
 water from the surface which is rich in oxygen doesn 't make it down
 and and
 the ocean turns into a desert so the question is how are we all going to respond
  we can do all sorts of things to fix it 
 but in the final analysis the thing thing we really need to fix is ourselves  it 's not about the fish  it 's not about the pollution  
  it 's not about the climate change it 's about us and our greed and our need for growth and our inability to imagine a world that is different from the selfish world we live in today  
  this or not i would say that the future of life and the dignity of human beings depends on our doing that
