  they are the things the victims of genocide in bosnia carried with them on their final journey we are all familiar
  everyday objects the fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush
 is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them usually they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war 
 these items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland 
 and as we speak forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves twenty years after the war 
 and it is quite possibly
  largest ever discovered 
 during the four years of conflict that devastated the bosnian nation in the early ' 90s approximately thirty thousand citizens  mainly civilians  went missing presumed killed 
 and another one hundred thousand were killed during combat operations  
 most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities  when u n safe zones like srebrenica fell
  the hands of the serb army the
 international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide genocide
 is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial  political  religious or ethnic group as much as genocide is about
  it is also about destroying their property their cultural heritage and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed  
 genocide is not only about the killing  it is about the denied identity 
 there are always traces no such thing as a perfect crime  there are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies
 and our selective and fading memory of them these items are recovered from numerous mass
  graves and the main goal of this collection of the items is a unique process of identifying those who disappeared in the killings 
 the first act of genocide on european soil since the holocaust 
 not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified  
 once recovered these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned
  analyzed  catalogued and stored  thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on csi 
 these objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims  but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials 
 survivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically  but physical
  browsing is extremely difficult  an ineffective and painful process
  once the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects they become orphans of the narrative  
 many of them get destroyed  believe it or not 
 or they get simply shelved out of sight and out of mind  
 i decided a few years ago
 to photograph every single exhumed item
 in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse 
 as a storyteller  i like to give back to the community i like to move beyond raising awareness 
 and in this case  someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a
 permanent unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened
  is about empathy and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy in this case  i am merely a tool a forensic if you like and the result
 is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document  
 once all the missing persons are identified 
 only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain in all their simplicity these items
  last testament to the identity of the victims the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed  thank you very much
