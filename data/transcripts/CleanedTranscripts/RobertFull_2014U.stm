  even nature 's most disgusting creatures have important secrets
 but who would want a swarm of cockroaches coming towards them yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates
  robust systems are stable in complex and new environments 
 remarkably cockroaches can self stabilize running over rough terrain when we put a jet pack on them or give them a perturbation like an earthquake  we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them 
 using any of their brainpower  they can go over complex terrain like grass  no problem and not
  we discovered a new behavior where because of their shape  they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test bit of grass  
 robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure  
 here 's a new behavior we 've discovered 
 the animals rapidly invert and disappear in less than one hundred and fifty milliseconds you never see them using the same structures that they use to run their legs  they can run upside down very rapidly on rods 
 branches and wires and if you perturb one of those branches they can do this
 they can perform gymnastic maneuvers like no robot
 we have yet  and they have nearly unlimited maneuverability with that same structure and unprecedented access
 to a variety of different areas 
 they have wings for flying when they get warm but they use those same wings to flip over if they get destabilized
 very effective  robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail safe 
 this is the foot of a cockroach it has spines gluey pads and claws  but if you take off those feet  they can still go over rough terrain like the bottom video that you see 
 without hardly slowing down 
 extraordinary  they can run up mesh without their feet  
 here 's an animal using a normal alternating
  tripod three legs three legs three legs but in nature the insects often have lost their legs  here 's one moving with two middle legs gone 
 it can even lose three legs in a tripod and adopt a new gait a hopping gait  
 and i point out that all of these videos are slowed down twenty times
  robust systems are also damage resistant  here 's an animal climbing up a wall it looks like a
 rapid smooth vertical climb but when you slow it down you see something very different  
 here 's what they do  they intentionally have a head on collision with the wall so they don 't slow down and can transition up it in seventy five milliseconds  
 and they can do this in part because they have
  and they 're really just made up of compliant
 joints that are tubes and plates connected to one another  here 's a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach  you see these plates and you see the compliant membrane  
 my engineering colleague at berkeley
 designed with his students a novel manufacturing technique where you essentially origami the exoskeleton you
  you laser cut it laminate it and you fold it up into a robot and you can do that now in less than fifteen minutes 
 these robots  called dash for dynamic autonomous sprawled hexapod are highly compliant robots  
 and they 're remarkably robust as a result of these features they 're certainly incredibly damage
  they even have some of the behaviors of the cockroaches so they can use their smart compliant body to transition up a wall in a very simple way
  they even have some of the beginnings of the rapid inversion behavior where they disappear 
 now we want to know why they can go anywhere we
  height of two pennies two stacked pennies and when they do this they can actually run through those confined spaces at high speeds  although you never see it 
 to understand it better we did a ct scan of the exoskeleton and showed that they can compress their body by over forty percent  
 we put them in a materials testing machine to look at the stress strain analysis
  and showed that they can withstand forces
 eight hundred times their body weight  and after this they can fly and run absolutely normally  so you never know where  curiosity based research will lead
  and someday you may want a swarm of  cockroach inspired robots
 to come at you
