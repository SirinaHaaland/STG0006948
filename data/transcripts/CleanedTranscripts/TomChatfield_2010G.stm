  i love video games 
 i 'm also slightly in awe of them  i 'm in awe of their power in terms of imagination in terms of technology in terms of concept  
 but i think  above
  their power to motivate to compel us  
 to transfix us  like really nothing else we 've ever invented has quite done before  and i think
 that we can learn some pretty amazing things by looking at how we do this  and in particular i think we can learn things about
 learning now the video games industry is is far and away the fastest growing of all modern media from about ten
  billion in one thousand nine hundred and ninety it 's worth fifty billion dollars globally today  and it shows no sign of of slowing down 
 in four years ' time  it 's estimated it 'll be worth over eighty billion dollars that 's about three times the recorded music industry 
 this is pretty stunning  
 but i don 't think it 's the most telling statistic of all the thing that really amazes me is that today people spend
 about eight billion real dollars a year buying virtual items that only exist
 inside video games  
 this is a screenshot from the virtual game world entropia universe earlier this year a virtual asteroid in it sold for
 three hundred
 and thirty
  and this is a
 titan class ship in the space game eve online  and this virtual object takes two hundred real people
 about fifty six days of real time to build plus
 countless thousands of hours of effort before that and yet many of these get built at the
  farmville that you may well have heard of has
 seventy million players around the world and most of these players are playing it almost every day  
 this may all sound really quite alarming to some people an index of something worrying or wrong
 in society  but we 're here for the good news  and the good news is that i think we can explore why
 this very real human effort this
  very intense generation of value is occurring  and by answering that question i think we can take something extremely powerful away  
 and i think the most interesting way to think about
 how all this is going on is in terms of rewards and
 specifically it 's in terms of the very intense emotional rewards that playing games offers to people both
 individually and
  collectively 
 now if we look at what 's going on in someone 's head when they are being engaged two quite different processes are occurring 
 on the one hand there 's the wanting processes this is a bit like ambition and drive i 'm going to do that i 'm going to work hard 
 on the other hand there 's the liking processes  fun and affection and delight
 and an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back it 's a really great image it 's pretty cool it 's from the game world of warcraft
  with more than ten million players globally one of whom is me another of whom is my wife  and
 this kind of a world this vast flying beast you can ride around  shows why games are so very good at doing both the wanting and the liking  because it 's very powerful  
 it 's pretty awesome it gives you great powers 
 your ambition is satisfied but it 's very beautiful  
 it 's a very great pleasure
 to fly around and so these
  combine to form a very intense emotional engagement  but this isn 't the really interesting stuff the really interesting stuff about virtuality
 is what you can measure with it because what you can measure in virtuality is
 everything every single thing that every single person who 's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured
  the biggest games in the world today are measuring more than one billion points of data
 about their players about what everybody does far more detail than you 'd ever get from any website
  and this allows something very special to happen in games it 's
 something called the reward schedule  and by this i mean looking at what millions upon millions of people have done and carefully calibrating the
  the nature the type the intensity of rewards in games to keep them
 engaged over staggering amounts of time and effort now to try and explain this in
 sort of real terms i
 want to talk about a kind of task that might fall to you in so many games go and get a certain amount of a certain little game y item  let 's say 
 for the sake of argument my mission is to get fifteen pies and i can get fifteen pies by killing these cute little monsters
 simple game quest 
 now you can think about this if you like as a problem about boxes  
 i 've got to keep opening boxes  i don 't know what 's inside them until i open them and i go around opening box after box until i 've got fifteen pies now if
 you take a game like warcraft  you can think about it if you like as a great
  the game 's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes  getting better and better stuff in them this sounds
 immensely boring
 but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling 
 and the way they do this is through a combination of probability and data 
 let 's think about probability if we want to engage someone in the process of opening boxes to try and find pies  we want to make sure it 's neither too easy  
 nor too difficult
  find a pie so what do you do well  you look at a million people no one hundred million people one hundred million box openers and you work out 
 if you make the pie rate about twenty five percent
 that 's neither too frustrating  nor too easy it keeps people engaged  
 but of course that 's not all you do there 's fifteen pies  now  i could make a game called piecraft where all you had to do was get a million pies
 or a thousand pies
 that would be very boring fifteen is a pretty optimal number you find that you know between five and twenty is about the right number for keeping people going  
 but we don 't just have pies in the boxes  there 's one hundred percent up here and what we do is make sure that every time a box is opened  there 's something in it some little reward that keeps people progressing and engaged in most
  little bit experience  
 but we don 't just do that either  
 we also say there 's going to be loads of other items of varying qualities and levels of excitement  there 's going to be a ten percent chance you get a pretty good item  there 's going to be a zero point one percent chance you get an absolutely awesome item  
 and
 each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item and also  we say well how many monsters should i have the entire world full of a
  we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time so i 'm drawn on it 's not too easy not too difficult so all this is is very powerful  
 but we 're in virtuality these aren 't real boxes so we can do
 some rather amazing things 
 we notice looking at all these people opening boxes  
 that when people get to about thirteen out of fifteen pies their perception shifts they start to get a bit bored a bit testy they 're not rational about probability they think this game is unfair it 's not giving me my
  last two pies i 'm going to give up if they 're real boxes there 's not much we can do but in a game we can just say right well  
 when you get to thirteen pies you 've got seventy five percent chance of getting a pie now keep you engaged look at what people do adjust the world to match their expectation  
 our games don 't always do this and one thing they certainly do at the moment is if you got a zero point one
  they make very sure another one doesn 't appear for a certain length of time to keep the value to keep it special and the point is really that
 we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways over tens and hundreds of thousands of years  we evolved to find certain things stimulating and as
 very intelligent civilized beings we 're enormously stimulated by problem solving and learning  
 but now we can reverse engineer that and build worlds that expressly tick our evolutionary boxes
  so what does all this mean in practice well  i 've come up with
 seven things that i think show how you can take
 these lessons from games and use them outside of games  the first one is very simple 
 experience bars measuring progress something that 's been talked about brilliantly by people like jesse schell earlier this year  
 it 's already been done at the university of indiana in the states among other places 
  idea that instead of grading people incrementally in little bits and pieces  you give them one
 profile character avatar which is constantly progressing in tiny tiny tiny little increments which they feel are their own and everything comes towards that and they watch it creeping up and they they own that as it goes along 
 second  multiple long and short term aims five thousand pies boring
  you give people lots and lots of different tasks  you say  it 's about
 doing ten of these questions  but another task is turning up to twenty classes on time  but another task is
 collaborating with other people another task is showing you 're working five times another task is
 hitting this particular target  you break things down into these calibrated slices that people can choose and do in parallel to keep them engaged and that
  can use to point them towards individually beneficial activities  
 third  you reward effort it 's your one hundred percent factor games are brilliant at this every time you do something you get credit you get a credit
 for trying you don 't punish failure you reward every little bit of effort a little bit of gold a little bit of credit you 've done twenty questions tick it all feeds in as minute reinforcement
  absolutely crucial and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this if you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world today that we 've been hearing
 amazing things about it 's very very hard for people to learn if they cannot link consequences to actions 
 pollution global warming these things the consequences are distant in time and space it 's very hard to learn to feel a lesson  but if you can model things for people if you can give things to people that they can manipulate and play with and
 comes then they can learn a lesson they can see they can move on they can understand  and fifth  the
 element of uncertainty  now this is the neurological
 goldmine if you like  because a known reward excites people but what what
  really gets them going is the uncertain reward the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty that they didn 't quite know whether they were going to get it or not the twenty five percent this
 lights the brain up  and if you think about using this in testing in just introducing control elements of randomness in all forms of testing and training you can transform 
 the levels of people 's engagement by tapping into this very powerful evolutionary mechanism
  quite predict something perfectly we get really excited about it we just want to go back and find out more 
 as you probably know  the neurotransmitter associated with learning is called dopamine it 's associated with reward seeking behavior  and something very exciting is just
 just beginning to happen in places like the university of bristol in the u k where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically dopamine levels in the brain 
 and what this means is we can predict learning we can predict
 enhanced engagement these windows
 these windows of time in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level 
 and two things really flow from this  the first has to do with memory 
 that we can find these moments  when someone is more likely to remember we can give them a nugget in a window and
 the second thing is confidence that we can see how game playing and reward structures make people braver make them more willing to take risks more willing to take on difficulty  harder to discourage
  this can all seem very sinister but you know sort of our brains have been manipulated we 're all addicts the word addiction is thrown around 
 there are real concerns there but the biggest neurological turn on for people
 is other people this is what really excites us in reward terms it 's not money  it 's not being given cash that 's nice
  it 's doing stuff with our peers watching us collaborating with us and i want to tell you a quick story about one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine a
 video game called everquest  and in this video game there were two really big dragons 
 and you had to team up to kill them forty two people up to forty two to kill these big dragons that
 's a problem
 because they dropped two or three decent items so
 players addressed this problem by spontaneously coming up with a system to motivate each other  fairly and transparently
 what happened was they paid each other
 a virtual currency they called dragon kill
 points and every time you turned up to go on a mission you got paid in dragon kill points 
 they tracked these on a separate website  so they tracked their own private currency  and then players could bid
 afterwards for cool items they wanted all organized by the players themselves  now the staggering system not just that this worked in everquest but that today a decade on
  every single video game in the world with this kind of task uses a version of this system
 tens of millions of people and the success rate is at close to one hundred percent this is
  in which these these principles could could fan out into the world let 's start with business i mean we 're beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business
 are recycling and energy conservation we 're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies like real time energy meters  
 and i just look at this  and i think yes we could take that so much further by allowing people to set targets by setting calibrated targets by using
 elements of uncertainty by using these multiple targets by using a grand underlying reward and incentive system by setting people up to collaborate in terms 
  of groups in terms of streets to collaborate and compete to use these very sophisticated group and motivational mechanics we see 
 the grand continuity of experience and personal investment we can break things down into highly calibrated small tasks  we can use calculated randomness we can 
 reward effort consistently as everything fields together  and we can use the
  government well one thing that comes to mind is the u s government  among others is
 literally starting to pay people to lose weight so we 're seeing financial reward being used to tackle
 the great issue of obesity  but again those rewards could be calibrated so precisely if we were able to use the vast expertise of gaming systems to just
 jack up that appeal to take
  the data to take the observations of millions of human hours and plow that feedback into increasing engagement 
 and in the end it 's this word engagement that i want to leave you with 
 it 's about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and the neurological lessons we can learn from watching people that are playing games  
 but it 's also about collective engagement
 about the unprecedented laboratory for observing what makes people tick and work and play and engage
 on a grand scale in games and if we can look at these things and learn from them and see how to turn them outwards  then
 i really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands  thank you very much
