  to start by telling you a little bit about my social life 
 which i know may not seem relevant but it is 
 when people meet me at parties and they find out that i 'm an english professor who specializes in language  they generally have one of two
  reactions one set of people look frightened 
 they often say something like oh i 'd better be careful what i say  i 'm sure you 'll hear every mistake i make 
 and then they stop talking 
 and they wait for me to go away and talk to someone else the other set of people
  people their eyes light up and they say you are just the person i want to talk to 
 and then they tell me about whatever it is they think is going wrong with the english language 
 a couple of weeks ago i was at a dinner party and the man to my right started telling me about all the ways that the internet is degrading the english language
 he brought up facebook  and he said to 
 i mean is that even a real word 
 i want to pause on that question what makes a word real 
 my dinner companion and i both know what the verb 
  who has the authority to make those kinds of official decisions about words anyway those are the questions i want to talk about today 
 i think most people when they say a word isn 't real  what they mean is it doesn 't appear in a standard dictionary 
 that of course raises a host of other questions including
 before i go any further  let me clarify my role in all of this i do not write dictionaries  
 i do however collect new words much the way dictionary editors do 
 and the great thing about being a historian of the english language is that i get to call this research 
 when i teach the history of the english language  i require that students
  teach me two new slang words before i will begin class over the years  i have learned some great new slang this way  
 including 
 which 
 which is when you are cranky or angry
  which is when you are adorable in kind of a dorky way  
 clearly  terrific words that fill important gaps in the english language 
 but how real are they if we use them primarily as slang and they don 't yet appear
  appear in a dictionary 
 with that let 's turn to dictionaries i
 'm going to do this as a show of hands how many of you still regularly refer to a dictionary either print or online  
 okay so that looks like most of you 
 now a second question again a show of hands how many of you have ever looked to see who edited the dictionary you are using
 okay  many fewer 
 at some level we know that there are human hands behind dictionaries  
 but we 're really not sure who those hands belong to 
 i 'm actually fascinated by this even the most critical people out there tend not to be very critical about dictionaries
  not distinguishing among them and not asking a whole lot of questions about who edited them 
 just think about the phrase look it up in the dictionary which suggests that all dictionaries are exactly the same  
 consider the library here on campus where you go into the reading room and there is a large  unabridged dictionary up on a pedestal in this place of honor and respect lying
  open so we can go stand before it to get answers 
 now don 't get me wrong dictionaries are fantastic resources  but they are human
 and they are not timeless  i 'm struck as a teacher that we tell students to critically question
 every text they read every website they visit  except dictionaries  which we tend to treat
 as un authored as if they came from nowhere to give us answers about what words really mean 
 here 's the thing  if you ask dictionary editors what they 'll tell you is they 're just trying to keep up with us
 as we change the language  they 're watching what we say and what we write and trying to figure out what 's going to stick and what 's not going to stick they have to gamble
  gamble because they want to appear cutting edge and catch the words that are going to make it such as lol 
 but they don 't want to appear faddish and include the words that aren 't going to make it and i think a word that they 're watching right now is yolo you only live once 
 i get to hang out with dictionary editors and you might be surprised by one of the places where we hang out 
 every january  we go to the american dialect society annual meeting  where among other things we vote on the word of the year  
 there are about two hundred or three hundred people who come some of the best known linguists in the united states to give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting it occurs right before happy
  anyone who comes can vote the most important rule is that you can vote with only one hand 
 in the past some of the winners have been tweet in two thousand and nine and hashtag in two thousand and twelve 
 chad was the word of the year in the year two thousand because who knew what a chad was before two thousand 
  in two thousand and two 
 now we have other categories in which we vote too and my favorite category is most creative word of the year 
 past winners in this category have included
  area which is at the milwaukee airport after security  where you can 
 can put your belt
  the act of having multiple windows up on your screen so it looks like you 're working when you 're actually goofing around on the web
 absolutely not 
 and we have made some questionable choices for example in two thousand and six when the word of the year was plutoed to mean demoted 
 but some of the past winners now seem completely
  as a verb 
 now a few weeks before our vote 
 lake superior state university issues its list of banished words for the year 
 what is striking about this is that there 's actually often quite a lot of overlap between their list and the list that we
 considering for words of the year
  and this is because we 're noticing the same thing  we 're noticing words that are coming into prominence 
 it 's really a question of attitude are you bothered by language fads and language change or do you find it fun interesting something worthy of study as part of a living language 
 the list by lake superior state university continues a fairly long tradition in english of complaints about new
  words so here is dean henry alford in
 who was very concerned that desirability is really a terrible word 
 in one thousand seven hundred and sixty  benjamin franklin wrote a letter to david hume giving up the word colonize as bad 
 over the years we 've also seen worries about new pronunciations  here is samuel rogers in
  who is concerned about some fashionable pronunciations that he finds offensive and he says as if contemplate were not bad enough balcony makes me sick 
 the word is borrowed in from italian and it was pronounced  bal coe nee 
 these complaints now strike us as quaint if not downright
 but
 here 's the thing  
 we still get quite worked up about language change  i have an entire file in my office of newspaper articles
 which express concern about illegitimate words that should not have been included in the dictionary  including
  when it got into the oxford english dictionary and 
 when it got into the oxford american dictionary  
 i also have articles expressing concern about invite as a noun 
 impact as a verb  because only teeth can be impacted 
 and incentivize is described as boorish  bureaucratic misspeak 
 now it 's not that dictionary editors ignore these kinds of attitudes about language  they try
  to provide us some guidance about words that are considered slang or informal or offensive often through usage labels  
 but they 're in something of a bind  because they 're trying to describe what we do 
 and they know that we often go to dictionaries to get information about how we should use a word well or appropriately 
 in response the american heritage dictionaries include usage notes
  usage notes tend to occur with words that are troublesome in one way  and one of the ways that they can be troublesome is that they 're changing meaning  
 now usage notes involve very human decisions and i think as dictionary users we 're often not as aware of those human decisions as we should be 
 to show you what i mean we 'll look at an example but before we do i want to explain what the dictionary editors are trying to deal with in this usage note
 think about the word peruse and how you use that word 
 i would guess many of you are thinking of skim  scan reading quickly 
 some of you may even have some walking involved because you 're perusing grocery store shelves or something
  you might be surprised to learn that if you look in most standard dictionaries  the first definition will be to read carefully or pore over 
 american heritage has that as the first definition they then have as the second definition  skim  and next to that they say usage problem 
 and then they include a usage note  which is worth looking at so here 's the usage note peruse has long meant ' to read
  thoroughly ' but the word is often used more loosely to mean simply ' to read ' 
 further extension of the word to mean ' to glance over skim ' has traditionally been considered an error  but our ballot results suggest that it is becoming somewhat more acceptable 
 when asked about the sentence ' i only had a moment to peruse the manual quickly ' sixty six percent of the [ usage
  the usage panel that trusted body of language authorities who is getting more lenient about this 
 now what i hope you 're thinking right now is wait who 's on the usage panel
  and what should i do with their pronouncements if you look in the front matter of american heritage dictionaries you can actually find the names of the
  people on the usage panel  but who looks at the front matter of dictionaries  
 there are about two hundred people on the usage panel they include academicians  journalists creative writers  there 's a supreme court justice on it and a few linguists 
 as of two thousand and five the list includes me
  's what we can do for you 
 we can give you a sense of the range of opinions about contested usage 
 that is and should be the extent of our authority we are not a language academy 
 about once a year i get a ballot that asks me about whether new uses
  new meanings are acceptable now here 's what i do to fill out the ballot 
 i listen to what other people are saying and writing  i do not listen to my own likes and dislikes about the english language  
 i will be honest with you 
 i do not like the word impactful 
 but that is neither here nor there in terms of whether impactful is becoming common usage and becoming more acceptable in written prose 
 so to be responsible what i do
 is go look at usage which often involves going to look at online databases such as google books  
 well if you look for impactful in google books here is what you find 
 well it sure looks like impactful is proving useful for a certain number of writers  and has become more and more useful over the
  there are going to be changes that all of us don 't like in the language  there are going to be changes where you think 
 really does the language have to change that way 
 what i 'm saying is we should be less quick to decide that that change is terrible 
 we should be less quick to impose our likes and dislikes about words on other
  and we should be entirely reluctant to think that the english language is in trouble 
 it 's not it is rich and vibrant and filled with the creativity of the speakers who speak it 
 in retrospect we think it 's fascinating that the word nice used to mean silly 
 and that the word decimate used to mean to kill one in every ten
  we think that ben franklin was being silly to worry about notice as a verb well
 you know what we 're going to look pretty silly in a hundred years for worrying about impact as a verb and invite as a noun 
 the language is not going to change so fast that we can 't keep
  language just doesn 't work that way  i hope that what you can do is find language change not worrisome
 but fun and fascinating just the way dictionary editors do 
 i hope you can enjoy being part of the creativity that is continually remaking our language and keeping it robust 
 so how does a word get into a dictionary
  it gets in because we use it and we keep using it 
 and dictionary editors are paying attention to us if you 're thinking but that lets all of us decide what words mean 
 i would say yes it does 
 and it always has 
 dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource but there is no objective dictionary authority out there that is the final arbiter about what
  words mean if a community of speakers is using a word and knows what it means it 's real 
 that word might be slangy that word might be informal that word might be a word that you think is illogical or unnecessary  but that word that we 're using 
 that word is real
