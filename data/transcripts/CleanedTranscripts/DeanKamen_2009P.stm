  it 's not about technology it 's about people and stories  
 i could show you what recently was on television as a high quality video sixty minutes many of you may have seen it  
 and it was the now director of the entire piece of the
  's administration who himself had lost an arm thirty nine years ago in vietnam
 who was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices that don 't work  
 and it turns out that with sixty minutes cameras rolling in the background after he pretty much made his position clear on this he had his hook and he had his
 he wore this arm for less than two hours and was able to pour
  himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact that quote his quote
 it 's the first time he 's felt like he 's had an arm in thirty nine years  but that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story  
 and i 'm not going to show you that polished video i 'm going to instead in a minute or two show you an early crude video because
  better way to tell a story a
 few years ago i was visited by the guy that runs darpa the people that fund all the advanced technologies that
 businesses and
 universities
 probably wouldn 't take the risk of doing they have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers  i get this sort of
 unrequested by me anyway visit and sitting in my conference room
  is a very senior surgeon from the military and the guy that runs darpa  
 they proceed to tell me a story which comes down to basically the following  we have used such advanced technologies now and made them available
 in the most remote places that we put soldiers  
  they were quite proud of the fact that you know before the dust clears  
 if some soldier has been hurt they will have collected him or her  they will have brought him back they will be getting world class triage emergency care faster than you and i would be getting it if we were
 hurt in a
 car accident in a major city in the united states that 's the good
  the bad news is if they 've collected this person and he or she is missing an arm
 or leg  part of the face it 's probably not coming back 
 so they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm  
 and then the surgeon pointed out with a lot of anger  he said why is it  at the end of the civil war they were shooting each other with muskets if somebody lost an arm 
  and if somebody loses an arm  we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it 
 and they basically said this is unacceptable 
 and then the punchline so dean we 're here because you make medical stuff you 're going to give us an arm and i was waiting for the five hundred pages
  going to bring a guy into this conference room  
 and wearing the arm you 're going to give us  he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape off this table  
 if it 's the grape they won 't break it great he needs efferent afferent haptic response sensors if it
  so he wants fine motor control  
 flex at the wrist flex at the elbow abduct and flex at the shoulder either way they were going to eat it 
 oh by the way dean  it 's going to fit on a  50th percentile female frame namely thirty two inches from the long finger
 and weigh less than nine pounds 50th percentile female frame and it 's going to be completely self contained including all its power
  so they finished that and i as you can tell am a bashful guy  i told them they 're nuts they 've
 been watching too much terminator 
 then the surgeon says to me dean  you need to know
 more than two dozen of these kids have come back bilateral
  imagine i 'm sorry you may have a better
 imagination than i do i can 't imagine losing my arm and
 typically at twenty two years old
  but compared to that losing two  seems like that would be an inconvenience  
 anyway i went
  i decided we 've got to do this 
 and trust me i 've got a day job i 've got a lot of day jobs most of my day job keeps me busy funding my fantasies like first and water and power and i 've got a lot of day jobs  
 but i figured
 i gotta do this did a little investigation went down
  to washington told them
 i still think they 're nuts
 but we 're going to do it and i
 told them i 'd build them an arm  i told them it would probably take five years to get through the fda and probably ten years to be reasonably functional
  look what it takes to make things like ipods
  you an arm that 's under nine pounds that has all that capability in one year it will take the other nine to make it functional and useful we
 sort of agreed to disagree i went back and i started putting a team together the best guys i could find with a passion to do this 
 at the end of exactly one year
 we had a device with fourteen degrees of
  all the sensors all the microprocessors all the stuff inside 
 i could show you it with a cosmesis on it that 's so real it 's eerie but then you wouldn 't see all this cool stuff 
 i then thought it would be years before we 'd be able to make it really really useful  
 it turned out as i think you could see in aimee 's capabilities and attitudes people with a
 desire to do something
 are quite remarkable and nature is quite
 adaptable  anyway with less than ten hours of use two guys one that 's
 bilateral he
 's literally he 's got no shoulder on one side and he 's high trans humeral on the other and that 's chuck and randy together
  after ten hours were playing in our office and we took some pretty cruddy home
  movies at the end of the one i 'm going to show it 's only about a minute and a couple of seconds long 
 chuck does something that to this day i 'm jealous of i can 't do it  
 he picks up a spoon picks it up  scoops out some shredded wheat and milk  
 holds the spoon level
 as he translates it moving all these joints simultaneously
  his mouth  and he doesn 't drop any milk i cannot do that 
 his wife was standing behind me she 's standing behind me at the time and she says dean  
 chuck hasn 't fed himself in nineteen years so you 've got a
  can we see that 
 this is chuck showing
 simultaneous control of all the joints he 's punching our controls guy the guy behind him is our engineer 
 convenient guy to have around there 's randy these guys are passing
  a rubber little puck between them  and just as in the spirit of
 first gracious professionalism they are quite proud of this so they decide to share a drink 
 this is a non trivial thing to do by the way imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it doing either of those 
  now chuck is doing something quite extraordinary at least for my limited physical skill 
 and now he 's going to do what darpa asked me for he 's going to pick up a grape he didn 't drop it he didn 't break it 
 and he 's going to eat it  so that 's where we were at the end of about fifteen
  as i 've learned from
 richard  the technology the processors the sensors the motors 
 is not the story  
 i hadn 't dealt with this kind of problem
  this whole segment of the medical world i 'll give you some astounding things that have happened
 as we started this  
 after we were pretty much convinced we had a good design  and we 'd have to make all the standard engineering trade offs you always make you can always get three out of four of anything you want  the weight the size the cost the functionality
 i put a bunch of guys
  my plane and i said we 're flying down to walter reed and we 're going talk to these kids because frankly it doesn 't matter whether we like this arm it doesn 't matter whether the department of defense likes this arm 
 when i told them that they weren 't entirely enthusiastic but
 i told them it really doesn 't matter what their opinion is there is only one opinion that matters  the kids that are either going to use it or not 
 i told a bunch of my engineers look we 're going to walk into walter reed
  and you 're going to see people lots of them missing major body parts 
 they 're probably going to be angry  depressed frustrated we 're
 probably going to have to give them support encouragement but we 've got to extract from them
 enough information to make sure we 're doing the right thing 
 we walked into walter reed and i could not have been more
  we did see a bunch of people a lot of them missing a lot of body parts 
 and parts they had left were burned half a face gone an ear burned off 
 they were sitting at a table they were brought together for us and we started asking them all questions 
 look i 'd say to them we 're not quite as good as nature yet  
 i could give you fine motor control or i could let you curl forty pounds i probably can 't do both  i can give you fast control with
 low reduction ratios in these gears or i can give you power i can 't give you both  and we were trying to get them to all help us
 know what to give them  not only were they enthusiastic they kept thinking they 're there to help us well would it help if i
  enough  we 're here to help you we need data  we need to know what you need 
 after a half an hour maybe there was one guy at the far end of the table who wasn 't saying much you could see he was missing an arm  
 he was leaning on his other arm  
 i called down to the end hey you haven 't said much if we needed this or this what would you
  the lucky guy at this table  i lost my right arm  but i 'm a lefty 
 so he wouldn 't say much he had a great spirit like all the rest of them had great spirits 
 and he made a few comments  and then the meeting ended we said goodbye to all these guys  and that guy pushed himself back from the table  he has no legs
 so we left  and i was thinking 
 we didn 't give them support and encouragement  they gave it to us  
 they 're not finished giving yet 
 it was astounding 
  went back and i started working harder faster
 then we went out to brooke army medical center  
 and we saw lots of these kids  lots of them  and it was astounding
 how positive they are 
 so we went back and we 've
  we 're in clinical trials we 've got five of them on people we 're screaming along  and i get a call and we go back
 to washington 
 we go back to walter reed and a kid literally  twenty some odd days before that
 was blown up  
  and they shipped him to germany and twenty four hours later they shipped him from germany to walter reed 
 and he was there and they said we needed to come and i went down
 and they rolled him into
 a room 
 he 's got no legs  he 's got no arms he 's got a small residual limb on one side  half of his face is gone
  but they said his
 vision is coming back  he had one good eye 
 his name is brandon  marrocco and he said 
 i need your arms  but i need two of them 
 you 'll get them this kid was from
  i had a truck before i went over there  and it had a stick 
 you think i 'll be able to drive it sure and i turned around and went how are we going to do this 
 anyway  he was just like all the rest of them  he doesn 't really want a lot he wants to help he told me that he wanted to go back
  i was on my way out here i was asked to stop at texas there
 were three thousand five hundred people the veteran 's administration u s just three thousand five hundred at this huge event
 to help the families
 of all the kids
  some that have died some that are like brandon
 and they wanted me to speak i said 
 what am i going to say this is not a happy thing look if this happens to you i can give you this stuff is still not as good at the original equipment 
 you need to come so i went and as i think you get the point
  there were a lot people there recovering some further along than others  but universally these people that
 had been through this had astounding attitudes  and just the fact that people
 care
 makes a huge difference to them
  i don 't think anybody does it intentionally 
 but there were people there literally talking about well how much will they get 
 you know this country is involved as we 've all heard in this great healthcare debate 
 who is entitled to what who is entitled to how much who is going to pay for it
  those are tough questions  
 i don 't have an answer to that not everybody can be entitled to everything simply because you were born here it 's not possible it would be nice but let 's be realistic they were tough questions there 's polarized groups down there i don 't know the answers there
 are other questions that are tough should we be
 be there how do we get out what do we need to do there 's very polarized answers to that question too and i don 't have any answers 
 to that those are political questions economic questions strategic questions  
 i don 't have the answer but let me give you a simple concern or maybe statement then 
 it is an easy
  i know what these kids
 deserve
 on the healthcare side  
 i was talking to one of them  and he was really liking this arm it 's way way way better than a plastic
 stick with a hook on it but there 's nobody in this room that would rather have that than the one you got  
 but i was saying to him you know the first airplane went one hundred
  feet in one thousand nine hundred and three wilbur and orville but
 you know what it wouldn 't have made an old pigeon jealous  
 but now we got eagles out there f15s even that bald eagle i 've
 never seen a bird flying around at mach two 
 i think eventually we 'll make these things extraordinary
  i said to that kid i 'll stop
 when your buddies are envious
 of your luke arm
 because of what it can do and how it does it and we 'll keep working  and i 'm not going to stop working until
 we do that
