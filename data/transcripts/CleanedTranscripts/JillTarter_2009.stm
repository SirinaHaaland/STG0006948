  my question are we alone the story of humans is the story of ideas
 scientific ideas that shine light into dark
  that we embrace rationally and irrationally ideas for which we 've
 lived and died and killed and been killed ideas that have vanished in history and ideas that have been set in dogma 
 it 's a story of nations 
 of ideologies of
  of conflicts among them 
 but every moment of human history 
 from the stone age to the information age from sumer and babylon to the ipod and celebrity gossip 
 they 've all been
 carried out every book that you 've read every poem
  laugh every tear they 've all happened here
  change perspectives can be altered 
 from my perspective we live on a fragile island of life 
 in a universe of possibilities 
 for many millennia humans have been on a journey to find
  answers to questions about naturalism and transcendence about who we are and why we are and of course  
 who else might be out there 
 is it really
 just us are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics 
 well  if we are it 's an awful waste of space
 but what if we 're not what if out there  others are
 asking and answering similar questions what if they look up at the night sky at the same stars  but from the opposite side 
 would the discovery of
  to find ways to survive our increasingly uncertain technological adolescence 
 might it be the discovery of a distant civilization and our common cosmic origins that finally drives home
  message of the bond
 among all humans 
 whether we 're born in san francisco or sudan or close to the heart of the milky way galaxy  we are the products of a billion year lineage of wandering stardust  
 we 
 all of us are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from
  fifty years ago  the journey to find answers
 took a different path and seti the search for extra terrestrial intelligence  began  
 so  what exactly is seti well seti uses the tools of astronomy to try and find evidence of someone else 's technology out there our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances
  and theirs might be as well  it might be that some massive network of communications or some shield against asteroidal impact or some 
  huge astro engineering project that we can 't even begin to conceive of could generate signals at radio or optical frequencies
  to the priests and the philosophers for guidance and instruction on this question of whether there 's intelligent life out there now we can use the tools
 of the 21st century
 to try and observe what is rather than ask what should be believed seti doesn 't presume the
  existence of extra terrestrial intelligence it merely
 notes the possibility if not the probability in this vast universe  which seems fairly uniform  
 the numbers suggest a universe of possibilities our sun
 is one of four hundred billion stars in our galaxy  
 and we know that many other stars have planetary systems we 've discovered over three hundred and fifty in the last fourteen years
 the small planet announced earlier this week which has a radius just twice the size of the earth 
 and 
 if even all of the planetary systems in our galaxy were devoid of life there are still one hundred billion other galaxies out there
  i 'm going to try a trick  
 and recreate an experiment from this morning  remember one billion but this time not one billion dollars one billion stars alright 
 one billion stars 
 now up there  twenty feet above the stage that 's ten trillion 
 well what about ten 
 where 's the line that marks that that line would have to be three point eight
  million miles above this stage sixteen times farther away than the moon or four percent of the distance to the sun 
 so there are many possibilities 
 and much of this vast universe much more may be habitable than we once thought as we study extremophiles on earth organisms that can live in conditions totally inhospitable
  for us in
 the hot  high pressure
 thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean frozen in ice in
 boiling battery acid in the cooling waters of nuclear reactors  
 these extremophiles tell us that life may exist in
  those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe even our nearest star the sun
 its emissions suffer the tyranny of light speed 
 it takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us and the nearest star is four point two light years away which means its light takes four point two years to get here  and the edge of our galaxy
  thousand light years away  and the nearest galaxy to us two point five million light years 
 that means any signal we detect would have started its journey a long time ago  
 and
 a signal would give us a glimpse
 of their past not their present which is why phil morrison calls seti the archaeology of the
  it tells us about their past but detection of a signal tells us it 's possible
 for us to have a long future i think this is what david deutsch meant
 in two thousand and five when he ended his oxford tedtalk by saying he had two principles he 'd like to share for
 living  and he would like to carve them on stone tablets the first is
 that problems are inevitable the second is that
 problems are soluble  
 so  ultimately what 's going to determine the success or failure of seti is the longevity of technologies  
 and the mean distance between
 technologies in the cosmos distance over space and distance over time
  technologies don 't last and persist  we will not succeed and we 're a very young technology
 in an old galaxy  
 and we don 't yet know whether it 's possible for technologies to persist  
 so  up until now i 've been talking to you about really large numbers let me talk
  relatively small number  and that 's the length of time that the earth was lifeless
 zircons that are mined in the jack hills of western australia  
 zircons taken from the jack hills of western australia tell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet there was abundant water and
  our planet has spent the vast majority of its
 four point five six billion year history
 developing life not anticipating its emergence life happened very quickly and that bodes well for the potential of life
 elsewhere in the cosmos  
 and the other thing that one should take away from this chart is the very narrow range of time
 over which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet it 's only the last few hundred thousand years modern humans have been pursuing technology and civilization 
 so one needs a very deep appreciation
 of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet as the first step in preparing
  to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos  we are not the pinnacle
 of evolution  we are not the determined product of
 billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning we are one outcome
  of a continuing adaptational process we are residents of one small planet
 in a corner of the milky way galaxy  and homo sapiens are one small leaf
 on a very extensive tree of life which is densely populated by organisms that have been honed for
 survival over millions of years  
 we misuse language 
 and talk about the ascent of man  we understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life but our ego hasn 't caught up yet 
 so
  has got to go it 's a sense of privilege that the natural universe
 doesn 't share  
 loren eiseley has said 
 one does not meet oneself until one catches the reflection from an eye other than human 
 one day that eye may be that of an intelligent
  and the sooner we eschew our narrow view of evolution
 the sooner we can
 truly explore our ultimate origins and destinations 
 we are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution  and
 we
  are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story and perhaps seti
 will help as well  occasionally throughout history this concept of this very large cosmic perspective
 comes to the surface and as a result we see transformative
 and profound discoveries so
  and by taking
 the earth out of the center and putting the sun in the center of the solar system he opened our eyes to a much larger universe 
 of which we are just a small part and that copernican revolution
 continues today to influence science
  giuseppe coccone and philip morrison published the first
 seti article in a refereed journal and brought seti into the scientific mainstream and in one thousand nine hundred and sixty  frank drake conducted the first 
 seti observation looking at two stars tau ceti and epsilon eridani for about one hundred and fifty hours 
  but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft and that 's that terrestrial technology can interfere with the search for extraterrestrial
 technology 
 we 've been searching ever since but it 's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains all of the concerted seti efforts over the
  are equivalent to scooping a single glass of water
 from the oceans  and no one would decide that the ocean was without fish on the basis of one glass of water
  the 21st century now allows us to build bigger glasses much bigger glasses 
 in northern california we 're beginning to take observations with the
  telescopes of the allen telescope array and i 've got to take a moment right now to publicly thank
 paul allen and nathan myhrvold and all the teamseti members in the ted community who have so generously supported this research 
  is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes and hooked together with computers it 's making silicon as important as aluminum 
 and we 'll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach three hundred and fifty for more sensitivity and leveraging moore 's law for more processing capability 
 today our signal detection algorithms can find very simple artifacts and noise 
 if you look very hard here you can see the signal from the
  voyager one spacecraft the most distant human object in the universe one hundred and six times as far away from us as the sun is 
 and
 over those long distances its signal is very faint when it reaches us it may be hard for your eye to see it but it 's easily found with our
  but this is a simple signal and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals this is a very good year 
 two thousand and nine is the 400th anniversary of galileo 's first use of the telescope darwin 's
  the incorporation of the seti institute as a non profit and of course 
 the 25th anniversary of ted and next month the kepler spacecraft will launch and will begin to tell us just how frequent earth like planets are the targets for seti 's searches 
 in two thousand and nine the u n has declared it to be the international year of astronomy a global festival to help
 us residents of earth rediscover our cosmic origins and our place in the universe  and in two thousand and nine change has come to washington with a promise
 to put science in its rightful position so what would change everything well this is the question the edge
  the discovery of intelligent life beyond earth would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism that has plagued our species since its inception and it wouldn 't simply change everything it would change everything all at once 
 so  if that 's right why did we only capture four out of those one hundred and fifty one minds i think it 's a problem
 of completion and delivery  because the fine print said 
  ideas and scientific developments would you expect to live to see 
 so we have a fulfillment problem we need bigger glasses and more hands in the water and then working together maybe we can all live to see
 the detection of the first extraterrestrial signal
 that brings me to my wish  
 i wish that you would empower earthlings everywhere
 to become active participants
 in the ultimate search for cosmic company 
 the first step would be to tap into the global brain trust to build an environment where raw data could be stored  and where
 it could be accessed and manipulated where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient 
 and this is a technically creative challenge and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it 
 and then we 'd like to augment
 the automated search
  we 'd like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye to find
 faint complex signals that our current algorithms miss  
 and of course  we 'd like to inspire and engage the next generation  
 we 'd like
 to take the materials that we have built for education and get them out to students everywhere
  students that can 't come and visit us at the ata we 'd like to tell our story better and engage young people and thereby change their perspective  
 i 'm sorry seth godin  but over the millennia  we 've seen where tribalism leads  
 we 've seen what happens when we divide an already small planet into smaller islands 
  all belong to only one tribe 
 to earthlings and seti is a mirror a mirror that can show us ourselves from an extraordinary perspective 
 and can help to trivialize the differences among us  if seti does nothing but change the perspective
 of humans on this planet then it will be one of the most profound endeavors
 in history 
 so in the opening days of two thousand and nine 
 a visionary president stood on the steps of the u s capitol and said 
 we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve 
 that as the world grows smaller our common humanity
 shall reveal itself
 so i look forward to working with the ted community to hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish  and
 in collaborating with you hasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality
