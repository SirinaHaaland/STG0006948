  as a software developer and technologist i 've worked on a number of civic technology projects over the years  
 civic tech is sometimes referred to as tech for good using technology to solve humanitarian problems this is in two thousand and ten in uganda working
  on a solution that allowed local populations to avoid government surveillance on their mobile phones
 for expressing dissent that same technology was deployed later in north africa for similar purposes to help activists
 stay connected when governments were deliberately shutting off connectivity as a means of population control
  but over the years as i have thought about these technologies and the things that i work on 
 a question kind of nags in the back of my mind which is 
 what if we 're wrong about the virtues of technology and if it sometimes actively hurts the communities that we 're intending to help 
 the tech industry around the world tends to operate under similar assumptions that
 if we build great things it will positively affect everyone  eventually these innovations will get out and find everyone
  but that 's not always the case i like to call this this blind championing of technology
 to borrow a phrase 
 laughter we tend to think that if we design things for the select few eventually those technologies will reach everyone  and that 's not always the case technology and innovation
 behaves a lot like wealth and capital they tend to consolidate in the hands of the few
  sometimes they find their way out into the hands of the many  and so most of you aren 't tackling
 oppressive regimes on the weekends so i wanted to think of a few examples that might be a little bit more relatable in the world of wearables and smartphones
 and apps 
 there 's a big movement to track people 's personal health with applications that track the number of calories that you burn or whether you 're sitting
  're sitting too much or
 walking enough 
 these technologies make patient intake in medical facilities much more efficient
  and in turn these medical facilities are starting to expect
 these types of efficiencies as these digital
 tools find their way into medical rooms and they become digitally
  what happens to the digitally invisible 
 what does the medical experience look like for someone who doesn 't have the $ four hundred phone or watch tracking their every movement do they now become a burden
 on the medical system is their experience changed 
 in the world of finance bitcoin and crypto currencies are revolutionizing the way we move money around the world 
 but the challenge with these technologies is the barrier to entry is incredibly high right you need access to the same
 phones devices
  connectivity  and even where you don 't where you can find a proxy agent usually they require a certain amount of capital to participate  
 and so the question that i ask myself is what happens to the last community using paper notes when the rest of the world moves to digital currency  
 another example from my hometown in philadelphia  i recently went to the public library
  there and they are facing an existential crisis public funding is dwindling they have to reduce their footprint to stay
 open and stay relevant  and so one of the ways they 're going about this is digitizing a number of the books and moving them to the cloud 
 this is great for most kids right you can check out books from home you can research on the way to school or from school but these are really two big assumptions that one
  you have access at home and two that you have access to a mobile phone 
 and in philadelphia  many kids do not so what does their education experience look like in the wake of
 a completely  cloud based library what used to be considered such a basic part of education how do they stay competitive 
 a final example from across the world in east africa there 's been a huge
  movement to digitize land ownership rights
 for a number of reasons migrant communities  older generations dying off and ultimately poor record keeping have led to conflicts over who owns what  and so there was a big movement to
 put all this information online to track all the ownership of of these plots of land put them in the cloud and give them to the communities
 but actually the unintended consequence of this has been that
 venture capitalists  investors  real estate developers have swooped in and they 've begun buying up these plots of land right out from under
 these communities because they have access to the technologies
 and the connectivity that makes that possible so that 's the common thread that connects these examples the unintended consequences of the tools and the technologies that we make
  as engineers as technologists we sometimes prefer efficiency over efficacy 
 we think more about doing things than the outcomes of what we are doing 
 this needs to change we have a responsibility to think about the outcomes of the technologies we build especially as they increasingly control the world in which we live in the late
  a big push for ethics in the world of investment and banking i think in two thousand and fourteen we 're long overdue for a similar movement in the area of tech
 and technology  
 so i just encourage you as you are all thinking about the next big thing as entrepreneurs as ceos  as
 engineers as makers that you think about the unintended consequences of the things that you 're building  
 because the real innovation is in finding ways to include everyone  thank you
