  in a small
  of lynwood california just a few miles southeast of los angeles a father came out of his house
 to tell his teenage son and his five friends that it was time for them to stop horsing around on the front lawn and on the sidewalk to get home  finish their schoolwork and prepare themselves for bed  
 and as the father was administering these instructions a car drove
  by  slowly  and just after it passed the father and the teenagers a hand went out from the front passenger window and 
 killing the father and the car sped off  
 the police investigating
  were amazingly efficient  
 they considered all the usual culprits  and in less than twenty four hours they had selected their suspect 
 francisco carrillo a  17 year old kid who lived about two or three blocks away from where the shooting occurred 
 they found photos of him  
 they prepared a photo array  and the day after the shooting  they showed it to one of the teenagers  and he said
  that 's the picture that 's the shooter i saw that killed the 
 that was all a preliminary hearing judge had to listen to to bind  mr carrillo over to stand trial for a first degree murder 
 in the investigation that followed before the
  each of the other five teenagers was shown
 photographs  the same photo array  
 the picture that we best can determine was probably the one that they were shown in the photo array is in your bottom left hand corner of these mug shots 
 the reason we 're not sure absolutely is because of
 the nature of evidence preservation
  but that 's another whole tedx talk for later 
 so at the actual trial  
 all six of the teenagers testified  and indicated the identifications they had made in the photo array  
 he was convicted he was sentenced to life imprisonment  and transported to folsom prison
  so what 's wrong straightforward  fair trial  full investigation oh yes  no gun was ever found 
 no vehicle was ever identified as being the one in which the shooter had extended his arm 
 and no person was ever charged with being the driver of the
 shooter 's vehicle
 mr carrillo 's alibi  which of those parents here in the room might not lie
 concerning the whereabouts of your son or daughter in an investigation of a killing sent
 to prison  adamantly insisting on his innocence which he has
  consistently for twenty one years  so what 's the problem  
 the problems actually for this kind of case come manyfold from decades of scientific research
 involving human memory  
 first of all we have all the statistical analyses from the innocence project work where we know that we
  have what two hundred and fifty two hundred and eighty documented cases now where people have been wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated some from death row 
 on the basis of later dna analysis  
 and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases of exoneration
 involved only eyewitness identification testimony
 during the trial that convicted them 
 we know that eyewitness identifications are fallible  the other comes from an interesting aspect of human memory
 that 's related to various brain functions but i can sum up for the sake of brevity here in a simple line  the brain
  under the best of observation conditions  the absolute best we only detect encode and store in our brains
 bits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us and they 're stored in different parts of the brain so now when it 's important
 for us to be able to recall what it was that we experienced
  we have an incomplete we have a partial store  and what happens 
 below awareness with no requirement for any kind of motivated processing  
 the brain fills in information that was not there 
 not originally stored from inference from speculation from sources of information that came to you as the observer after the observation
  but it happens without awareness such that
 you don 't aren 't even cognizant of it occurring  
 it 's called reconstructed memories it happens to us in all the aspects of our life all the time 
 it was those two considerations among others reconstructed memory  the fact about the eyewitness fallibility that was part of the instigation for a group of appeal
  attorneys
 led by an amazing lawyer named ellen eggers
 to pool their experience and their talents together and petition a superior court
 for a retrial for francisco carrillo  they retained me as a forensic neurophysiologist  
 because i had expertise in eyewitness memory identification which obviously makes sense for this case right 
 but also because i have expertise and testify about
 the nature
 of human night vision well what 's that got to do with this well
 when you read through the case materials in this carrillo case 
 one of the things that suddenly strikes you is that the investigating officers said the lighting was good
  good
 at the crime scene at the shooting 
 all the teenagers testified during the trial that they could see very well  
 but this occurred 
 in the northern hemisphere at seven p m at night  
  did the calculations for the lunar data and the solar data at that location on earth at the time of the incident of the shooting all right 
 it was well past the end of civil twilight and there was no moon up that night  
 so all the light in this area from the sun and the moon is what you see on the screen right here 
 the only lighting in that area had to come from artificial
  and that 's where i go out and i do the actual reconstruction of the scene with photometers with various measures of illumination and various other measures of of
 color perception along with special cameras and high speed film right  take all the measurements and record them right 
 and then take photographs and this is what the scene looked like at the time of the shooting from the position of the teenagers
 looking at the car going by and shooting this is looking directly across the street
 from where they were standing 
 remember the investigating officers ' report said the lighting was good the teenagers said they could see very well 
 this is looking down to the east where the shooting vehicle sped off  
 and this is the lighting directly behind the father and the teenagers as you can see it
  is at best poor no one 's going to call this
 good lighting  and in fact as nice as these pictures are and the reason we take them is i knew i was going to have to testify in court and a picture is worth
 more than a thousand words when you 're trying to communicate numbers  abstract concepts like lux the international measurement of illumination the ishihara color
  color perception test values  
 when you present those to people who are not  well versed in those aspects of science and that they become salamanders in the noonday sun it 's like talking about the tangent of the visual angle  all right  their eyes just glaze over all right a
 good forensic expert also has to be a good educator a good communicator  and that 's part of the reason why we take the pictures to
  show not only where the light sources are and what we call the spill the distribution but also so that it 's easier for the trier of fact to understand the circumstances  
 so these are some of the pictures that in fact  i used when i testified  
 but more importantly were to me as a scientist are those readings the photometer readings which i can then
 convert into actual predictions of the visual
  capability of the human eye
 under those circumstances  
 and from my readings that i recorded at the scene under the same solar and lunar conditions at the same time so on and so forth right 
 i could predict that there would be no reliable color perception which is crucial for face recognition  
 and that there would be only scotopic vision which means there would be very little resolution what we call boundary or edge
  detection  
 and that furthermore  because the eyes would have been totally dilated under this light the depth of field the distance at which you can focus and see details would have been 
  less than eighteen inches away  
 i testified to that to the court  and while the judge was very
  it had been a very very long hearing for this petition for a retrial  and as a result  i noticed out of the 
 that i thought that maybe the judge was going to need a little more of a nudge than just more numbers  
 and here i became a bit audacious and i turned and i asked the judge  
  i think you should go out and look at the scene yourself now i may have used a tone which was more like a dare than a request 
 but nonetheless it 's to this man 's credit and his courage
 that he said yes  i will a shocker
 in american jurisprudence  
 so in fact we found the same identical conditions we reconstructed the entire thing again he came out with an entire brigade of
  sheriff 's officers to protect him in this 
 we had him stand actually slightly in the street  so closer to the suspect vehicle the shooter vehicle than the actual teenagers were  
 so he stood a few feet from the curb
 toward the middle of the street  we had a car that came by
  same identical car as described by the teenagers right it had a driver and a passenger 
 and after the car had passed the judge by 
 the passenger extended his hand pointed it back to the judge
 as the car continued on just as the teenagers had described it
  he didn 't use a real gun in his hand so he had a black object in his hand that was similar to the gun that was described  
 he pointed by and this is what the judge saw 
 this is the car thirty feet away from the judge 
 there 's an arm sticking out of the passenger side and pointed back at you 
 that 's thirty feet away  some of the teenagers said that that in fact the car was fifteen feet away when it shot
  okay there 's fifteen feet 
 at this point i became a little concerned this judge is someone you 'd never want to play poker with
 he was totally stoic  i couldn 't see a twitch of his eyebrow i couldn 't see the slightest bend of his head
  i had no sense of how he was reacting to this 
 and after he looked at this reenactment  he turned to me and he says is there anything else you want me to look at 
 i said your honor and i don 't know whether i was emboldened by the scientific measurements that i had in my pocket
 and my knowledge that they are accurate or whether it was just sheer stupidity which is what the defense lawyers thought when they heard me say
  your honor i want you stand right there and i want the car to go around the block again
 and i want it to come and i want it to stop
 right in front of you three to four feet away  and i want
 the passenger to extend his hand with a black object and point it right at you  and you can look at
  which was also in my test report all the dominant lighting is coming from the north side which means that the shooter 's face would have been photo occluded it would have been backlit 
 furthermore the roof of the car is causing what we call a shadow cloud inside the car which is making it darker
  and this is three to four feet away  
 why did i take the risk  i knew that the depth of field was eighteen inches or less 
 three to four feet it might as well have been
 a football field away  
 this is what he saw he went back
  there was a few more days of evidence that was heard at the end of it he made the judgment that he was going to grant the petition for a retrial  
 and furthermore he released  mr carrillo so that he could aid in the preparation of his own defense if the prosecution decided
 to retry him  which they decided not to 
  his girlfriend was pregnant when he went to trial right and she had a little baby boy  he and his son are both attending cal state long
  what does this example
 what 's important to keep in mind for ourselves  
 first of all there 's a long history of antipathy between science and the law in american jurisprudence  
 i could regale you with horror stories of ignorance
 over decades of experience as a forensic expert
 of just trying to get science into the courtroom  the opposing council always fight it and oppose it 
 one suggestion is that all of us become much more attuned to the necessity  
 through policy  through procedures 
 to get more
  and i think one large step toward that is more requirements with all due respect to the law schools 
 of science technology engineering
  mathematics for anyone going into the law because they become the judges 
 think about how we select our judges in this country  it 's very different than most other cultures all right 
 the other one that i want to suggest  the caution that all of us have to have
  constantly have to remind myself about just how accurate are the memories that we know are true 
 that we believe in 
 there is decades of research 
 examples and examples of cases like this where individuals
  really believe none of those teenagers who identified him
 thought that they were picking the wrong person  none of them thought they couldn 't see the person 's face 
 we all have to be very careful  all our memories are reconstructed memories they are the product of what we originally experienced and
 everything that 's happened afterwards  they 're dynamic  they 're malleable  they 're volatile  and as a result  we all need to
  remember to be cautious that the accuracy of our memories is not measured in how vivid they are
 nor how certain you are that they 're correct
