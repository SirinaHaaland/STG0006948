  so in college  
 i was a government major  which means i had to write a lot of papers  now when a normal student writes a paper they might spread the work out a little like this so you know you
  get started maybe a little slowly but you get enough done in the first week that with some heavier days later on everything gets done things stay civil 
 and i would want to do that like that that would be the plan  
 i would have it all ready to go  but then then actually the paper would come along and then i would kind of do this 
 and that would happen every
  spend a year on and i knew for a paper like that my normal work flow was not an option it was way too big a project  so i planned things out and i decided i kind of
 had to go something like this this is how the year would go so i 'd start off light  
 and i 'd bump it up in the middle months  and then at the end i would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase how hard could it
  no big deal right  
 but then the funniest thing happened those first few months 
 they came and went and i couldn 't quite do stuff  so we had an awesome new revised plan 
 and then but
 then those middle months actually went by  and i didn 't really write
  and so we were here and then two months turned into one month which turned into two weeks and one day i woke up
 with three days until the deadline
  still not having written a word  and so i did the only thing i could i wrote ninety pages over seventy two hours pulling not one but
 humans are not supposed to pull two  all nighters sprinted across campus  dove in slow motion
  got it in just at the deadline  i thought that was the end of everything  but a week later i get a call and it 's the school  
 and they say is this tim urban and i say yeah and they say we need to talk about your thesis and i say ok 
 and they say it 's the best one we 've ever seen
  i just
 wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought this guy is amazing no no it was very very bad 
  i write the blog wait but why and a couple of years ago i decided to write about procrastination my behavior has always perplexed the 
  around me  and i wanted to explain to the 
  of the world
 what goes on in the heads of procrastinators and why we are the way we are now i had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people 
 and to test this i found an mri lab that actually let me scan
  both my brain and the brain of a proven 
  so i could compare them  i actually brought them here to show you today i want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference i know that if you 're not a trained brain expert it 's not that obvious but just take a look ok  
 so here 's the brain of a
  both brains have a rational decision maker in them but the procrastinator 's brain also has an instant gratification monkey now what does this mean for the procrastinator well it
 means everything 's fine until this happens
 to do something productive  but the monkey doesn 't like that plan  so he actually takes the wheel and he says actually let 's read the entire wikipedia page of the nancy kerrigan tonya harding scandal because i just remembered that that happened 
 then then
 we 're going to go over to the fridge to see if there 's anything new in there since ten minutes ago
  're going to go on a youtube spiral that starts with videos of richard feynman talking about magnets and ends much much later with us watching interviews with justin bieber 's mom 
 all of that 's going to take a while so we 're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today sorry
  does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel he lives entirely in the present moment he has no memory of the past no knowledge of the future and he only cares about two things easy and fun 
 now in the animal world  that works fine if you 're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things
  and propagating into the next generation
  which in tribal times might have worked ok  but if you haven 't noticed now we 're not in tribal times we 're in an advanced civilization and the monkey does not know what that is which is why we have another guy in our brain 
 who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do we can visualize
  the future we can see the big picture we can make long term plans and he wants to take all of that into account  
 and he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now  now sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun like when you 're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well earned leisure time 
  sometimes they agree  
 but other times it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant for the sake of the big picture  and that 's when we have a conflict 
 and for the procrastinator that conflict tends to end a certain way every time  leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone 
 an easy and fun place that 's entirely out of the makes sense circle  
  the dark playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well  
 it 's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening 
 the fun you have in the dark playground isn 't actually fun because it 's completely unearned and the air is filled with guilt  dread anxiety self hatred all of those good procrastinator feelings  
 and the question is in this situation with the monkey behind the wheel
  how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone a less pleasant place but where really important things happen  
 well  turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel someone who 's always looking down on him and watching over him
 in his darkest moments someone called the panic monster
  the panic monster is dormant most of the time  but he suddenly wakes up
 anytime a deadline gets too close or there 's danger of public embarrassment a career disaster or some other scary consequence and importantly  he 's the only thing the monkey is terrified of now  
 he became very relevant in my life
 pretty recently because the people of ted reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a ted talk 
 now of course i said yes it 's always been a dream of mine to have done a ted talk in the past
  excitement the rational decision maker seemed to have something else on his mind he was saying are we clear on what we just accepted do we get
 what 's going to be now happening one day in the future we need to sit down and work on this right now and the monkey said totally agree but let 's just open google earth and zoom in to the bottom of india like two hundred feet above 
  the ground and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country so we can get a better feel for india
 so that 's what we did that day 
 as six months turned into four and then two and then one the people of ted decided to release the speakers  and i opened up the website and there was my face staring right back at me and guess who woke up
 so the panic monster starts losing his mind  and a few seconds later the whole system 's in mayhem 
 and the monkey remember he 's terrified of the panic monster boom he 's up the tree  
 and finally  finally  the rational decision maker can take the wheel and i can start working on the talk  now  the panic monster explains all
  kinds of
 pretty insane procrastinator behavior like how someone like me could spend two weeks
 unable to start the opening sentence of a paper  
 and then miraculously find the unbelievable work work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages 
 and this entire situation with the three characters this is the procrastinator 's system it 's not pretty  but in the end
  works this is what i decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago  when i did  i was amazed by the response literally thousands of emails came in 
 from all different kinds of people from all over the world doing all different kinds of things these are people who were nurses  bankers painters engineers and lots and lots of phd students 
 and they were all writing saying the same thing i have this problem
  too but what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post
 and the heaviness of these emails 
 these people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives about what this monkey had done to them  
 and i thought about this  and i said
  if the procrastinator 's system works then what 's going on why are all of these people in such a dark place well it turns out that there 's two kinds of procrastination  
 everything i 've talked about today the examples i 've given they all have deadlines and when there 's deadlines the effects of procrastination are contained
 to the short term because the panic monster gets involved  but there 's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline  so
  something in the arts something
 entrepreneurial there 's no deadlines on those things at first because nothing 's happening not until you 've gone out and done the hard work to get momentum get things going there 's also all kinds of important 
  things outside of your career that don 't involve any deadlines like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health 
  panic monster that 's a problem because in all of these non deadline situations 
 the panic monster doesn 't show up he has nothing to wake up for so the effects of procrastination they 're not contained they just extend outward forever  
 and it 's this long term kind of procrastination
 that 's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier
  it 's usually suffered quietly and privately  
 and it can be the source of a huge amount of long term unhappiness and regrets  
 and i thought that 's why those people are emailing and that 's why they 're in such a bad place  it 's not that they 're cramming for some
 project it 's that long term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator at times in their own lives
  the frustration is not that they couldn 't achieve their dreams it 's that they weren 't even able to start chasing them  so
 i read these emails and i had a little bit of an epiphany
 that i don 't think 
 exist that 's right i think all of you are procrastinators now you might not all be a mess like some of us 
 and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines  but remember the monkey 's
 sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren 't there 
 now i want to show you one last thing i call this a life calendar  
 that 's one box for every week of a 90 year life that 's not
 that many boxes  especially since
 we 've already used a bunch of those so i think we need to all take a long hard look at that calendar
  we need to think about what we 're really procrastinating on because everyone is procrastinating on something in life 
 we need to stay aware of the instant gratification monkey 
 that 's a job for all of us and because there 's not that many boxes on there it 's a job that should probably start today
