  so historically
 there has been a huge divide between what people consider to be non living systems on one side  
 and living systems on the other side  so we go from say this beautiful and complex crystal
  this rather beautiful and complex cat on the other side 
 over the last hundred and fifty years or so science has kind of blurred this distinction between non living and living systems and now we consider that there may be a kind of continuum that exists 
  between the two we 'll just take one example here a virus is a natural system  
  have all the characteristics of living systems and is in fact a parasite on other living systems in order to say  reproduce and evolve  
 but what we 're going to be talking about here tonight are experiments done on this sort of non living end of this spectrum so actually doing chemical experiments in the laboratory
  mixing together nonliving ingredients to make new structures and that these new structures might have some of the characteristics of living
  really what i 'm talking about here is trying to create a kind of artificial life 
 so what are these characteristics that i 'm talking about these are them we consider first that life has a body now this is necessary to distinguish the self from the environment  
 life also has a metabolism now this is a process by which life can convert resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain and build itself 
 life also has a kind of inheritable information now we as humans we store our information as
  dna in our genomes and we pass this information on to our offspring 
 if we couple the first two the body and the metabolism we can come up with a system that could perhaps move and replicate and if we coupled these now to inheritable information we can come 
  up with a system that would be more lifelike and would perhaps evolve and so these are the things we will try to do in the lab 
  that have one or more of these characteristics of life 
 so how do we do this well we use a model system that we term a protocell you might think of this as kind of like a primitive cell 
 it is a simple chemical model of a living cell and if you consider for example a cell in your body may have on the order of millions of different types of molecules that need to come together play together in a complex network to produce something that we call
  in the laboratory what we want to do is much the same but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules so a drastic reduction in complexity  but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike  
 and so what we do is we start simple and we work our way up to living systems consider for a moment this quote by leduc a hundred years ago  
 considering a kind of synthetic biology the synthesis of life should it ever occur will not be the sensational discovery which we usually associate with the idea that 's his first statement so
  actually create life in the laboratories it 's probably not going to impact our lives at all 
 if we accept the theory of evolution then the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist in the production of forms intermediate between the inorganic and the organic world or between the non living and living world  
 forms which possess only some of the rudimentary attributes of life  
  to which other attributes will be slowly added in the course of development by the evolutionary actions of the environment so we start simple we make some structures that may have some of these characteristics of life  and then we try to develop that to become more more lifelike  
 this is how we can start to make a protocell  we use this idea called self assembly what that means is i can mix some chemicals together in a test tube in my lab 
 and these these chemicals will start to
  to form larger and larger structures  so say on the order of tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of molecules will come together to form a large structure that didn 't exist before  
 and in this particular example what i took is some membrane molecules mixed those together in the right environment and within seconds it forms these rather complex and beautiful structures here these 
  membranes are also quite similar morphologically and functionally to the membranes in your body and we can use these as they say to form the body of our protocell
  likewise we can work with oil and water systems as you know when you put oil and water together they don 't mix but through self assembly we can get a nice oil droplet to form and we can actually use this
 as a body for our artificial organism or for our protocell as you will see later  so that 's just forming some
 body stuff right some architectures what about the other aspects of living systems  so we came up with this protocell model here that i 'm showing
  started with a natural occurring clay called montmorillonite  this is natural from the environment this clay  it forms a surface that is say  chemically active it could run a metabolism on it 
 certain kind of molecules like to associate with the clay for example in this case rna shown in red
  it 's an informational molecule it can come along and it starts to associate
 with the surface of this clay  
 this structure then 
 can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself so it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself and that 's shown in green here on this micrograph 
 so just through self assembly mixing things together in the lab  we can come up with say a metabolic surface with some informational molecules attached inside of this membrane body  right  so we 're on a road towards
 towards living systems  but if you saw this protocell you would not confuse
  something that was actually alive it 's actually quite lifeless  once it forms it doesn 't really do anything so something is missing some things are missing 
 so some things that are missing is for example 
 if you had a flow of energy through a system  what we 'd want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself  much like living systems do  
 so we came up with a different protocell model and this is actually simpler than the previous one
  in this protocell model it 's just an oil droplet but a chemical metabolism inside that allows this protocell to use energy to do something to actually become dynamic as we 'll see here  
 you add the droplet to the system it 's a pool of water and the protocell starts moving itself around in the system  okay oil droplet forms through self assembly
  has a chemical metabolism inside so it can use energy and it uses that energy to move itself around in its environment as we heard earlier  movement is very important in these kinds of living systems  
 it is moving around exploring its environment and remodeling its environment as you see by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell so it 's acting in a sense like a living system trying to to preserve itself  
 we take this same moving protocell here  and we put it in another experiment get it moving then i 'm going to add some food
  to the system  and you 'll see that in blue here  
 right  so i add some food source to the system the protocell moves it encounters the food it reconfigures itself and actually then is able to climb to the highest concentration of food in that system and stop there 
 alright so not only do we have this system
 that has a body it has a metabolism it can use energy
  it moves around it can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to sustain itself now this doesn 't have a brain it doesn 't have
 a neural system this is just a sack of chemicals that is able to have this interesting and complex lifelike behavior 
 if we count the number of chemicals in that system actually including the water that 's in the dish we have five chemicals
 that can do this so then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do and depending on the conditions  we have some protocells on the
  left that are moving around and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment  
 on the other hand we have two moving protocells that like to circle each other and they form a kind of a dance a complex dance with each other right  
 so not only do individual protocells have behavior what we 've interpreted as behavior in this system  
 but we also have basically population level behavior similar to what organisms have 
 so now that you 're all experts
 on protocells  
 we 're going to play a game with these protocells we 're going to make two different kinds 
 protocell a has a certain kind of chemistry inside that when activated the protocell starts to vibrate around just dancing so remember these are primitive things so dancing protocells that 's very interesting to us 
 the second protocell has a different chemistry inside and when activated the protocells all come together and they fuse into one big one
  we just put these two together in the same system so there 's population a 
 there 's population b  and then we activate the system  
 and protocell bs they 're the blue ones they all come together they fuse together to form one big blob  and the other protocell just dances around and this just happens until
  all of the energy in the system is basically used up and then game over  so then i repeated this experiment a bunch of times and one time something very interesting happened  
 so i added these protocells together to the system  and protocell a and protocell b fused together to form a hybrid protocell ab that didn 't happen before there it goes there
 's a protocell ab now in this system  
 protocell ab likes to dance around for a bit while
  protocell b does the fusing  okay  but then something even more interesting happens watch when these two large protocells the hybrid ones fuse together 
 now we have a dancing protocell
  event  right 
 just with blobs of chemicals again so the
 way this works is you have a simple system of five chemicals here a simple system here  when they hybridize you then form something that 's different than before it 's more complex than before  and you get the emergence of another kind of lifelike behavior
  which in this case is replication 
 so since we can make some interesting protocells that we like  interesting colors and interesting behaviors 
 and they 're very easy to make and they have interesting lifelike properties perhaps these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the earth  perhaps these represent an easily accessible step one of the first steps by which life got started on the early earth
 there were molecules present on the early earth  
 but they wouldn 't have been these pure compounds that we worked with in the lab and and i showed in these experiments rather they 'd be a real complex mixture of all kinds of stuff 
 because uncontrolled chemical reactions produce a diverse mixture of organic compounds think of it like a primordial ooze  okay  
 and it 's a pool that 's too difficult to fully characterize even by modern methods and the product looks brown like this tar here on the left
  pure compound is shown on the right  for contrast 
 so this is similar to what happens when you take pure sugar crystals in your kitchen you put them in a pan and you apply energy you turn up the heat  
 you start making or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar forming a brownish caramel  right  
 if you let that go unregulated you 'll continue to make and break chemical bonds forming an even more diverse
  mixture of molecules that then forms this kind of black tarry stuff in your pan right that 's difficult to wash out  
 so that 's what the origin of life would have looked like you needed to get life out of this junk that is present on the early earth four four point five billion years ago  
 so the challenge then is throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab and try to make some protocells with lifelike properties from this kind of primordial ooze  so we 're able to then
  of these oil droplet bodies again that we 've seen previously  and the black spots inside of there represent this kind of black tar this diverse very complex  organic black tar and we put them into one of these
 experiments as you 've seen earlier and then we watch
 lively movement that comes out they look really good 
 very nice movement and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other 
 similar to what we 've seen before but again  working with just
 primordial
  conditions no pure chemicals these are also these tar fueled protocells are also able to locate
 resources in their environment i 'm going to add some resource from the left here that defuses into the system  and you can see 
 they really like that 
 they become very energetic and able to find the resource in the environment similar to what we saw before but again these are done in these primordial conditions really messy conditions not
 sort of sterile laboratory conditions
 these are very dirty little protocells as a matter of fact but they have lifelike properties is the point so 
 doing these artificial life experiments
 helps us define a potential path between non living and living systems and not only that but it helps us
 broaden our view of what life is and what possible life there could be out there life that could be very different from life
  that we find here on earth  and that leads me to the next
 term which is weird life this is a term by steve benner  
 this is used in reference to a report in two thousand and seven by the national research council in the united states wherein they tried to understand
 how we can look for life elsewhere in the universe  okay  especially if that life is very different from life on earth  if we went to another planet and we thought there might be
  there how could we even recognize it as life well they came up with three very general criteria first is and they 're listed here the first is the system has to be 
 that means the system cannot be dead in a matter of fact 
 basically what that means is you have an input of energy into the system that life can use and exploit to to maintain itself  
 this is similar to having the sun shining on the earth  driving photosynthesis driving the ecosystem
  without the sun there 's likely to be no life on this planet 
 secondly life needs to be in liquid form  so that means even if we had some interesting structures interesting molecules together but they were frozen solid  then this is not a good place for life 
 and thirdly  we need to be able to make and break chemical bonds and again this is important because life transforms resources
 from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain
  possible life there could be out there
