  last few years i 've been had the opportunity to do this closing conference 
  about eight years ago  billy graham
 opened for me and i thought that there was i thought that there was absolutely no way
 in hell to top that but i just wanted to say
 and i mean this without irony i think i can speak for everybody in the audience when
 i say that i wish to god that you were the president of the united states 
 ok  this is the title of my talk today 
 i just want to give you a quick overview  first of all please remember i 'm completely politically correct and i mean everything with
  if any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy  now is the time to check your blackberry 
 just to review this is my tedtalk 
 we 're going to do some jokes some gags
  some little skits
 and then we 're going to talk about the l1 point 
  one of the questions i ask myself is was this the most distressing ted ever  
 let 's try and sum things up shall we 
 images of limb regeneration and faces filled with smallpox twenty one percent of the conference 
 mentions of polar bears drowning four percent  images of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu
  this is the most distressing ted ever i 've been working with neil gershenfeld on next year 's ted bag  and if the if the conference is anywhere near this distressing then we 're going to have a scream bag next year 
 it 's going to be a  cradle to cradle scream bag of course so you 're going to be able to go like this
  back at ted university this wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop sun chips
 so robert wright i don 't know i felt like if there was anyone that helen needed to give antidepressants to it might have been him 
 i want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels 
 he was talking about
 morality economy class morality is  we want to bomb you back to the stone age  business class morality is
  don 't bomb japan they built my car and first class morality is don 't bomb mexico they clean my house yes it is politically incorrect
  i wanted to show you guys i wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface that lets you
 work with images just as easily as you as a completely natural user interface
 and you can
 you can use really natural hand gestures to like go like this 
 now we had a harvard professor here she was from harvard i just wanted to mention and and she was actually
  of course there 's the gravity brain there 's the weak brain  and then there 's my weak brain which is too too absolutely too weak to understand what the fuck she was talking about 
 now 
 one of the things that is very important to me is to try and figure out what on earth am i here
  for and that 's why i went out and i picked up a  best selling business book you know it basically uses as its central premise greek mythology  and
 it 's by a guy named pastor rick warren  and it 's called the porpoise driven life 
 and rick is as
  which i thought was kind of appropriate in a certain way and
 now we 're going to have kind of a little more visualization about rick warren 
 ok
  the scales here are religiosity religiosity from zero percent or atheist to one hundred percent bible literally true  
 and then this is books sold the logarithmic scale
  hundred thousand three million thirty million three hundred million  ok now they 're duking it out now they 're duking it out and rick warren 's kind of pulling ahead kind of pulling ahead  yup  and his
 installed base is getting a little bigger 
 but darwin 's dangerous idea is coming back 
  one of the things that 's very important is nicholas negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per i 'm sorry
  about one laptop per child  
 now let 's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device i 'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters and then i 'll show it to you in person first
 of all it needs to be small it needs to be flat so it 's transportable lightweight  
 portable uses very very little power  very very high resolution has to be visible in bright daylight will work anywhere and broadly applicable across
  many platforms now we 've actually
 done some research neil gershenfeld and the fab labs went out into the market 
 they did some research we came back and we think we have the perfect prototype of what the students in the field are actually actually asking for and here it is 
  i bought this device from clifford stoll for about nine hundred bucks 
 and he and his team of junior high school students were doing real science  so we 're trying to check and trying to douse here and see who uses marijuana 
 see who uses marijuana
  only if we open enough locker doors 
 laughter ok  
 now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness we had dr larry brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox 
 i wanted to show you the stages of smallpox  we start 
 this is day one
  day three she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder  day three  day four 
 day five
 and day six 
 now the good news is because i 'm a trained medical professional i know that even though she 'll be scarred for life she 's going to make a full recovery
  now the good news about architects for humanity is they 're really kind of the most amazing group  
 they 've been sponsoring a design competition to come up with innovative medical housing solutions clinic solutions 
 in africa  and they 've had a design competition 
 now the wonderful thing is larry brilliant was just appointed the head of the google foundation and so he decided that he would support
  he would support cameron 's work and the way he decided to support that work
 was by shipping over fifty thousand shipping containers of google snacks 
 laughter so i want to show you some prototypes 
 the u n you know they took twenty years just
  a flap to a tent  but i think we have some more exciting things 
 this is a home made entirely out of fruit roll ups 
  those roll up cookies coated with white chocolate and the really wonderful thing about this is when you 're done well
 but the thing that i 'm really really excited about is this incredible
  granola house 
 and the granola house has a special sun chip roof to collect water and recycle it and it
 's well on this side it has regular sour patch kids and gummy bears to let in the light 
 but on this side it has sugary gummy bears to diffuse the light more slightly and we we wanted
  to show you what this might look like in situ
  what 's your favorite singing group  
 could you say that again what 's your favorite singing group
 ok  one more time i 'm just going to give you a little help your favorite singing group it 's diana ross and the audience supremes tom
 exactly could
 we have the sound up on the laptop please
  now it 's a little hard to hear the whole message so i wanted to 
 so i wanted to help you a little bit
  we 've talked a lot about global warming but you know as jill said it sounds kind of nice good
  weather in the wintertime and new york city  
 and as jay walker pointed out that is just not scary enough   
 so al i actually think i 'm rather good at branding  so i 've tried to figure out a good design process to come up with a new term to replace global warming 
 so we started with babel fish 
 we put in global warming and then we decided that we 'd change it from english to dutch into het globale verwarmen
 from dutch to
  which is  we 're totally fucked 
 now i don 't know about you but michael shermer talked about the willingness for human beings evolutionarily they 're designed 
  to see patterns in things for example in cheese sandwiches now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the virgin mary
 i tried to make it a little bit clearer 
 is it the virgin mary  or is it mena trott  
 so i talked to josh prince ramus about the convention center and the conferences it 's getting awfully big it 's getting just a little bit too big it 's bursting at the seams here a little bit so we tried to come up with a program how we could remake this structure to better accommodate ted
  so first of all we decided 
 that we needed about one third bookstore one third google cafe about twenty percent registration eighty percent luxury hotel about five percent for restrooms 
 and then of course we wanted to have the simulcast lounge the lobby and the steinbeck forum now let me show you how that literally translated into the design program
  as you say the ocean level is going to rise twenty feet and flood the hell out of the convention center so we 're going to build this new building on stilts  so we build this building on stilts 
 then up here 
 is where we 're going to put the new steinbeck auditorium and the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is it 's going to be shaped in a spiral that 's
  're going to make an escalator that helps you get up there 
 and finally we 're going to put the marriott hotel and the portola plaza on the top 
 now i don 't know about you but sometimes i have these images in my head of separated at birth i don 't know about you but when i see aubrey de grey  i immediately go
  we 've heard of course that we 're all soldiers here so what i 'd really really like you to do now is  pick up your white piece of paper  does everybody have their white piece of paper  
 and i want you to get out a pen  and i want you to write a terrorist note if
 we put up the elmo for a moment if we put up the elmo then
  give you a model that you can work from ok 
 and then then i want you to fold that note into a paper airplane  
 and once you 've folded it into a paper airplane i want you to take some anthrax 
 and i want you to put that in the paper airplane  and then i want you to throw it on jim young
  luckily i was the recipient of the ted prize this year  and i wanted to see
 i want to dedicate this film to
 my father homer  ok  
 now this film isn 't really hard enough  so i wanted to
  going to try and do this while reciting pi
  we cue the music please
  now i wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit back 
  you can see that the mountain range of brokeback mountain was covered in one hundred and fifty one inches of snow pack
 parenthetically over there on the slopes i did want to show you that
 black men ski 
 but over the years 
 ten years later the snow packs eroded and if you notice the trees have started turning yellow  the water level of the lake has started drying up
 a few years later there 's no snow left at all and all the trees have turned brown 
 this year  unfortunately the lakebed 's turned into an absolute cracked dry bed 
 and i fear if we do nothing for our planet in twenty years it 's going to look like this
  vice president i wish i knew how to quit you
