  you about is what i call the greatest machine that never was it was a machine that was never built  and yet  it will be built it was a machine that was designed
 long before anyone thought about computers  if you know anything about the
  simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today and you would be correct except for you 'd have the wrong century the first computer was really designed in the
  not the 1930s and 1940s it was designed and parts of it were prototyped and the bits of it that were built are here in south kensington 
 that machine was built by this guy charles babbage  now i have a great affinity for charles babbage because his
  hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture 
 laughter he was a very wealthy man and a sort of part of the aristocracy of britain and on a saturday night in marylebone 
 were you part of the intelligentsia of that period you would have been invited round to his house for a soiree
 and and he invited everybody  kings  the duke of wellington many many famous people and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines
 miss that era you know where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you but babbage 
 babbage himself was born at the end of the  18th century and was a fairly famous mathematician he held the post that newton held at cambridge and that was recently held by stephen hawking
 he 's less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of
  the reason he never made any of them he 's a classic nerd  every time he had a good idea he 'd think that 's brilliant i 'm going to start building that one i 'll spend a fortune on it i 've got a better idea i 'm going to work on this one and i 'm going to do this one 
 he did this until sir robert peel then prime minister basically kicked him out of number ten downing street and kicking him out in those days that
  the thing he designed was this monstrosity here the analytical engine
  now  just to give you an idea of this this is a view from above  every one of these circles is a cog 
 a stack of cogs  and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive 
 so as i go through this talk i want you to imagine this gigantic machine we heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have sounded like and i 'm going to take you through the architecture
  and tell you about this
 this machine which is a computer  
 so let 's talk about the memory the memory is very like the memory of a computer today  except it was all made out of metal  
 stacks and stacks of cogs  thirty cogs high imagine a thing this high of cogs hundreds and hundreds of them 
 and they 've got numbers on them it
 's a decimal machine everything 's done
  he thought about using binary the problem with using binary is that the machine would have been so tall  it would have been ridiculous as it is it 's enormous  so he 's got memory 
 the memory is this bit over here  you see it all like this 
 this monstrosity over here is the cpu the chip if you like of course it 's this big 
 completely mechanical this whole machine is mechanical  this is a picture
 of a prototype for part of the cpu which is in the science museum
 the cpu could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic so addition multiplication subtraction  division
 which already is a bit of a feat
 in metal 
 but it could also do something that a computer does and a calculator doesn 't 
 this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision it could do the if then for basic programmers  and that fundamentally made it into a computer  it could compute it couldn 't just calculate it could do more
 now if we look at this  and we stop for a minute  and we think about chips today we can 't look inside a silicon chip it 's just so tiny 
  yet if you did you would see something very very similar to this there 's this incredible complexity in the cpu 
  bit over here which is incredibly complicated 
 all this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does but of course you need to program this thing and of course babbage used the technology of the day and the technology that would reappear in the ' 50s ' 60s and ' 70s which is punch cards  
 this thing over here is one of three punch card readers in here  and this is a program in the science museum just
 not far from here
 created by charles babbage that is sitting there you can go see it waiting for the machine to be built  
 and there 's not just one of these there 's many of them
 he prepared programs
 anticipating this would happen now the reason they used punch cards was that jacquard in france had created the jacquard loom which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards  so he was just repurposing the technology of the day and like everything else he did he 's using the technology of his
 cogs  steam mechanical devices ironically born the same year as charles babbage was michael faraday  who would completely revolutionize
 everything with the dynamo  transformers all these sorts of things babbage of course wanted to use proven technology so steam and things
  you 've got a computer now you 've got punch cards a cpu and memory you need accessories you 're going to come with you 're not just going to have that so first of all you had sound  
 you had a bell  so if anything went wrong or the machine needed the attendant to come to it there was a bell it could ring 
 and there 's actually an instruction on the punch card which says ring the bell
  and everyone needs a printer this is actually
 a picture of the printing mechanism for another machine of his called the difference engine no two which he never built but which the science museum did build in the ' 80s and ' 90s 
 it 's completely mechanical again a printer
 it prints just numbers because he was obsessed with numbers  but it does print onto paper and it even does word wrapping so
  to do anything with graphics so he said well i need a plotter i 've got a big piece of paper and an ink pen and i 'll make it plot so he designed a plotter as well and 
 you know at that point i think he got pretty much a pretty good machine
  along comes this woman ada lovelace now imagine these soirees all these great and good comes along this lady is the
  lord byron and
 her mother being a bit worried that she might have inherited some of lord byron 's madness and badness thought i know the solution mathematics is the solution we 'll teach her mathematics that 'll calm her down 
 because of course  
 there 's never been a mathematician mathematician that 's gone crazy so
  to one of these soirees with her mother  and charles babbage you know gets out his machine the duke of wellington is there you know get out the machine obviously demonstrates it and she gets it 
 she 's the only person in his lifetime really who said i understand what this does and i understand the future of this machine 
 and we owe to her an enormous amount because we know a lot about the machine that babbage was intending to build
 because of her now  some people call her the first
 programmer this is actually from one of the paper that she translated this is a program
 written in a particular style
  it 's not historically totally accurate that she 's the first programmer and actually she did something more amazing rather than just being a programmer  she saw something that babbage didn 't 
 babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics  
 he was building a machine to do mathematics  
 and lovelace
  said you could do more than mathematics on this machine 
 and just as you do everyone in this room already 's got a computer on them right now because they 've got a phone  
 if you go into that phone every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics it 's all numbers at the bottom  
 whether it 's video or text or music or voice it 's all numbers it 's all 
  underlying it mathematical functions happening and lovelace said just because you 're doing mathematical
 functions and symbols doesn 't mean these things can 't represent other things in the real world such as music 
 this was a huge leap  because babbage is there saying we could compute these amazing functions and print out tables of numbers and
 draw graphs and
 lovelace is there and she says look this thing could even compose music if you told it a representation of music numerically
 so this is what i call lovelace 's leap when you say she 's a programmer  
 she did do some but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be much much more than this 
 now a hundred years later this guy comes along alan turing and in 
  and invents the computer all over again now of course babbage 's machine was entirely mechanical turing 's machine was entirely theoretical both of these guys were
  from a mathematical perspective but turing told us something very important he
 laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science and said it doesn 't matter how you make a computer it doesn 't matter if your computer 's mechanical 
 like babbage 's was or electronic like computers are today  or perhaps in the future 
  mechanical again once we get into nanotechnology 
 we could go back to babbage 's machine and just make it tiny all those things are computers there is in a sense a computing essence this is called the  churchturing thesis 
 and so suddenly you get this link where you say this thing babbage had built really was a computer in fact it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers  
 only really slowly 
 to give you an idea of how slowly it had about 1k of memory
 it used punch cards which were being fed in and it ran about ten thousand times slower the first  zx81 
 it did have a ram pack you could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to 
 so where does that bring us today so there are plans over in swindon
  the science museum archives there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages of notes written by charles babbage about this analytical engine 
 one of those is a set of plans that we call plan twenty eight 
 and that is also the name of a charity that i started with doron swade  who was the curator of computing at the science museum  and also the person who drove the project to build a difference engine  and our plan is to build it 
 here in south kensington  we will build the analytical
  the project has a number of parts to it one was the scanning of babbage 's archive that 's been done the second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build 
 the third part is a computer simulation of that machine 
 and the last part is to physically build it at the science museum  when it 's built you 'll finally be able to understand how a computer works because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you you 've got to look at this
 humongous thing and say ah 
 i see the memory operating i see the cpu operating i hear it operating i probably smell it operating 
 laughter but in between that we 're going to do a simulation
  babbage himself wrote he said as soon as the analytical engine exists  it will surely guide the future course of science of course he never built it because he was always fiddling with new plans 
 but when it did get built of course in the 1940s 
 everything changed  now i 'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like in motion with a video which shows
 just one part of the
  cpu mechanism working so
 this is just three sets of cogs  
 and it 's going to add this is the adding mechanism in in action so you imagine this gigantic machine so give me five years before the
