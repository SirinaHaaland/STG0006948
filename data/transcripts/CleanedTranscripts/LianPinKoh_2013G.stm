  when we think of nepal  we tend to think of the snow capped mountains of the himalayas
 the crystal clear still waters of its alpine lakes or the huge expanse of its grasslands 
 what some of us may not realize is that in the himalayan foothills
  where the climate is much warmer and the landscape much greener  there lives a great diversity of wildlife  including the one horned rhinoceros the asian elephant and the bengal tiger  
 but unfortunately these animals are under constant threat from poachers who hunt and kill them for their body
  to stop the killing of these animals battalions of soldiers and rangers are sent to protect nepal 's national parks  
 but that is not an easy task because
 these soldiers have to patrol thousands of hectares of forests on foot or elephant backs 
 it is also risky for these soldiers when they get into gunfights with poachers 
 and therefore nepal is always looking for new ways to help with protecting the forests and wildlife
 nepal acquired a new tool in the fight against wildlife crime  and these are drones or more specifically conservation drones 
 for about a year now my colleagues and i have been building drones for nepal and training the park protection personnel on the use of these drones 
 not only does a drone give you a bird  's eye view of the landscape  but it also allows you
  to capture detailed
 images of objects on the ground this
 for example is a pair of rhinoceros taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day in the lowlands of nepal 
 now we believe that drones have tremendous potential not only for combating
  for monitoring the health of these wildlife populations  so what is a drone
 well the kind of drone i 'm talking about is simply a model aircraft fitted with an autopilot system  
 and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer 
 a gps a compass a barometric altimeter and a few other sensors
 now a drone like this is meant to carry a useful payload such as a video
  camera or a photographic camera it also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission to tell the drone where to go 
 now people i talk to are often surprised when they hear that these are the only four components that make a conservation drone  
 but they are even more surprised when i tell them how
  affordable these components are 
 the facts is 
 a conservation drone doesn 't cost very much more than a good laptop computer or a decent pair of binoculars 
 so now that you 've built your own conservation drone you probably want to go fly it but how does one fly a drone well
 actually you don 't  because the drone flies itself  
 all you have to do is to program a mission to tell the drone where to fly but you simply do that
  by clicking on a few way points on the google maps interface using the open source software 
 those missions could be as simple as just a few way points or they could be slightly longer and more complicated to fly along a river system  
 sometimes  we fly the drone in a lawnmower type pattern
  and take pictures of that area  and those pictures can be processed to produce a map of that forest 
 other researchers might want to fly the drone along the boundaries of a forest to watch out for poachers or people who might be trying to enter the forest illegally  
 now whatever your mission is 
 once you 've programmed it you simply upload it to the autopilot system bring your drone to the field  and launch it simply by tossing it in the air and often we 'll go about this mission
 taking pictures
 or videos along the way  and usually at that point  
 we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee sit back and relax for the next few minutes  although some of us sit back and panic for the next few minutes worrying that the drone will not return  
 usually it does  and when it does it even lands automatically  
 so what can we do with a conservation drone
  well when we built our first prototype drone our main objective was to fly it over a remote rainforest in north sumatra indonesia 
 to look for the nest of a species of great ape known as the orangutan 
 the reason we wanted to do that was because we needed to know how many individuals of
  now the traditional method of surveying for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot carrying heavy equipment and to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops
 where you might find an orangutan or its nest  now as you can imagine that is a very 
 and costly process so we were hoping that drones could significantly reduce the cost of surveying for orangutan
  populations in indonesia and elsewhere in southeast asia  so we were very excited when we
 captured our first pair of orangutan nests on camera  and this is it this is the first ever picture of orangutan nests taken with a drone  
 since then we have taken pictures of dozens of these nests from
  around various parts of southeast asia  
 and we 're now working with computer scientists to develop algorithms that can automatically count the number of nests from the thousands of photos we 've collected so far  
 but nests are not the only objects these drones can detect  this is a wild orangutan
 happily feeding on top of a palm tree  seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying
  not once but several times 
 we 've also taken pictures of other animals including forest buffalos in gabon  elephants  and even turtle nests 
 but besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves  we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats  
 sometimes
  zoom out a little and look at other things that might be happening in the landscape  
 this is an oil palm plantation in sumatra  now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation in that part of the world  so we wanted to use this 
  new drone technology to keep track of the spread of these plantations in southeast asia  
  a recently logged forest again in sumatra you could even still see the processed wooden planks left on the ground  
 but perhaps the most exciting part about taking pictures from the air is we could later stitch these pictures together using special software to create a map of the entire landscape  
 and this map gives us crucial
 crucial information for monitoring land use change to let us know where and when plantations might be expanding where forests might be contracting or where fires might be breaking out 
 aerial images could also be processed to produce
 computer models of forests now these models are not just visually appealing  but they are also geometrically accurate which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees
  surface area the volume of vegetation  and so on  all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests 
 recently  we 've also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras  now these cameras can detect  heat emitting objects from the ground  and therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night
  so i 've told you quite a lot about what conservation drones are how you might operate one of these drones  and what a drone could do for you i will now tell you where conservation drones are being used around the world  
 we built our first prototype drones in switzerland  we brought a few of these to indonesia for the first few test flights  
 since then we 've been building drones for our collaborators from around the world
 and these include fellow biologists and partners from major conservation organizations 
 perhaps the best and most rewarding part about working with these collaborators is the feedback they give us on how to improve our drones  
 building drones for us is a constant work in progress we are constantly trying to improve them in terms of their range their ruggedness
  and the amount of payload they can carry  
 we also work with collaborators to discover new ways of using these drones for example camera traps are a common tool used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals hiding in the forests 
  motion activated cameras so they snap a
 picture every time an animal crosses their path  
 but the problem with camera traps is that the researcher has to go back to the forest every so often to retrieve those images and that takes a lot 
  of time  especially if there are dozens or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest  
  radio collars are another tool that 's commonly used by biologists  now these collars are put onto animals they transmit a radio signal which allows the researcher to track the movements of these animals across the landscape  
 but the traditional way of tracking animals is
 pretty ridiculous
  because it requires the researcher to be walking on the ground carrying a huge and cumbersome radio antenna 
 not unlike those old tv antennae we used to have on our rooftops some of us still do 
 a drone could be used to do the same job much more efficiently  why not equip a drone with a scanning radio
  fly that over the forest canopy in a certain pattern which would allow the user or the operator to triangulate the location of these radio collared animals remotely without having to step foot in the forest 
 a third and perhaps most exciting way of using these drones
 is to fly them to a really remote
 rainforest somewhere hidden in the tropics and parachute down a tiny spy microphone
 that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls of mammals  birds  amphibians the yeti the sasquatch  bigfoot  whatever 
 that would give us biologists a pretty good idea of what animals might be living in those forests 
 and finally i would like to show you the latest version of our conservation drone the maja drone has a wingspan of about two meters
 it weighs only about two kilograms  but it can carry half its weight it is a fully autonomous system  
 during its mission it can even transmit a live video feed back to a ground station laptop 
 which allows the user to see what the drone is seeing in real time 
 it carries a variety of
  and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel 
 this drone can stay in the air for forty to sixty minutes which gives it a range of up to fifty kilometers that is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications  
 now conservation drones began as a crazy idea from two biologists who are just deeply passionate
  we believe strongly believe that drones
 can and will be a game changer for conservation research and applications  
 we 've had our fair share of skeptics and critics who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes 
 and in a way they are right  i mean let 's be honest drones are the ultimate toys for boys but
 at the same time  we 've also gotten to know many wonderful colleagues and collaborators who share our vision
  see the potential of conservation drones 
 to us it is obvious that conservation biologists and practitioners should make full use of every available tool including drones in our fight to save the last remaining forests and wildlife of this planet
