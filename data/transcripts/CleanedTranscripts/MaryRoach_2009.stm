  i 'm going to show you a couple of images from a very diverting paper in the
 the journal of ultrasound in medicine  i 'm going to go way out on a limb and say that it is the most diverting
  paper ever published in the journal of ultrasound in medicine  the title is observations of
 okay  now on the left you can see the hand that 's the big arrow and the penis on the right the hand hovering  
 and over here we have
  in the words of radiologist israel meisner the hand grasping the penis in a fashion resembling masturbation movements 
 bear in mind this was an ultrasound so it would have been moving images 
 orgasm is a reflex of the autonomic nervous system now this is the part of the nervous system that deals with the things that we don 't consciously control like digestion heart rate and sexual arousal  
 and the orgasm reflex can be triggered by a surprisingly broad range of input
 genital stimulation duh 
 but also kinsey interviewed a woman who could be brought to orgasm by having someone stroke her eyebrow  
 people with spinal cord injuries like paraplegias quadriplegias will often develop a very very sensitive area
 right above the level of
  wherever that is there is such a thing as a knee orgasm in the literature  i think the most
 the most curious one that i came across was a case report of a woman who had an orgasm every time she brushed her teeth
 he checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste but no it happened with
 any brand they stimulated her gums with a toothpick to see if that was doing it no it was the whole  you know  motion
 and the amazing thing to me is that you would think this woman would have excellent oral
  this is what it said in the journal paper she believed that she was possessed by demons and switched to mouthwash for her oral care it 's so sad 
 when i was working on the book i interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm she was part of a study at
  i interviewed her in oakland in a sushi restaurant and i said so could you do it right here and she said yeah but you know i 'd rather finish my meal if you don 't mind laughter
 but afterwards she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside it was remarkable it took about one minute
  and
 i said to her
  when i get home i 'm usually too tired 
 she said that the last time she had done it was on the disneyland tram 
 the headquarters for orgasm along the spinal nerve is something called the sacral
  which is back here  and if you trigger if you stimulate with an electrode the precise spot  you will trigger
 an orgasm  
 and it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people a certain kind of dead person a beating heart cadaver  now this is somebody who is brain dead legally dead definitely checked out 
 but is being kept alive on
  so that their organs will be oxygenated for transplantation now in one of these brain dead people 
 if you trigger the right spot  you will see something every now and then there is a reflex called the lazarus reflex and this is i
 'll demonstrate as best i can not being dead it 's
 like this you trigger the spot  the dead guy or gal goes like that very unsettling for people working in pathology labs
 now if
 you can trigger the lazarus reflex in a dead person  why not the orgasm reflex i asked this question to a
 a brain death expert stephanie mann who was foolish enough to return my emails 
 i said so could you conceivably trigger an orgasm in a dead person she said yes if the sacral nerve is being oxygenated
 you conceivably could obviously it wouldn 't be as much fun
 for the person  but it would be an orgasm nonetheless
 there is a researcher at the university of alabama who does
 orgasm research i said to her you should do an experiment you know you can get cadavers if you work at a university i said you should actually do this
  the human subjects review board approval for this one according to 1930s marriage manual author theodoor van de velde a
 slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman within about an hour after sexual intercourse  
 theodoor van de velde was something of a semen
  very heavy hetero guy  but he wrote in this book ideal marriage he said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man  
 which he said had a a fresh exhilarating smell
 and the semen of mature men whose semen smelled quote remarkably like that of the flowers of the spanish
  in the state of israel a man began hiccupping  and this was one of those cases that went on and on he tried everything his friends suggested nothing seemed to help  
 days went by at a certain point the man  still
  had sex with his wife and lo and behold the hiccups went away he told his doctor who
 published a case report in a canadian medical journal under the title sexual intercourse as a potential treatment for intractable hiccups 
 i love this article because
 at a certain point they suggested that unattached hiccuppers could try masturbation  i love that
  a lot of gynecologists believed that when a woman has an orgasm the contractions serve to suck the semen up through the cervix and sort of deliver it really
  if you go all the way back to hippocrates 
 physicians believed that orgasm in women was not just helpful for conception but necessary doctors back then were routinely telling men the importance of
 pleasuring their
  theodoor van de velde has
 a line in his book  i loved this guy  i got a lot of mileage out  of theodoor van de velde  
 he had this line in his book that supposedly comes from the the habsburg monarchy  where there was an
 empress maria theresa who was having trouble conceiving and apparently the royal court physician said to her i am of the opinion that the
  vulva of your most sacred majesty be titillated for some time prior to intercourse it 's apparently i don 't know on the record somewhere 
 masters and johnson now we 're moving forward to the 1950s masters and johnson were upsuck skeptics 
 which is also really fun to say  
 they didn 't buy it  and they decided being masters and johnson that they would get to the bottom of it
  brought women into the lab
 and outfitted them with cervical caps containing artificial semen and in the artificial semen was a 
 substance such that it would show up on an
 to see if the semen was being sucked up did not find any evidence of upsuck  you may be wondering how do you make artificial semen 
 i have an answer for you i have two answers you can use flour and water or cornstarch and water i actually found three separate recipes in the literature 
 my favorite being the
  one that says
 you know they have the ingredients listed and then
 in a recipe it will say for example yield  two dozen cupcakes this one said yield one ejaculate 
 there 's another way that orgasm might boost fertility this one involves men 
 sperm that sit around in the body for a week or more start to develop abnormalities that make them less effective at head banging their way into the egg
  british sexologist roy levin has speculated that
 this is perhaps why men evolved to be such enthusiastic and frequent masturbators  he said if i keep tossing myself off i get fresh sperm being made 
 which i thought was an interesting
 idea theory so now you have an evolutionary excuse
  all righty there is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom
 pigs for instance in denmark the danish national committee for pig production found out that 
  if you sexually stimulate a sow while you artificially inseminate
  you will see a six percent increase in the farrowing rate which is the number of piglets produced so they came up with this five point stimulation plan for 
  the sows there is posters they put in the barn and they
 have a dvd and i got a copy of this dvd this is my unveiling because i am going to show you a clip
 it all looks very innocent  he 's going to be doing things with his hands that the the boar would use his snout 
 lacking hands okay 
 this is it the boar has a very odd courtship repertoire this is
 to mimic the weight of the boar
  you should know  the clitoris of the pig is inside the vagina so this may be sort of titillating for her
  i love this video  there is a point in this video towards the beginning where they zoom in for a close up of his hand with his wedding ring as if to say it 's okay it 's just his job
  denmark my host was named anne marie and i said so
 why don 't you just stimulate the clitoris of the pig why don 't you have the farmers do that that 's not one of your five steps 
 i have to read you what she said because i love it she said it was a big hurdle just to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva so we thought let 's not mention the
  shy but ambitious pig farmers however can purchase a this is true a sow vibrator that hangs on the sperm feeder tube to vibrate 
 because as i mentioned  the clitoris is inside the vagina so possibly you know a little more arousing than it looks and
 i also said to her now these sows i mean you may have noticed
  the sow doesn 't look to be in the throes of ecstasy and she said  you can 't make that conclusion because
 animals don 't register pain or pleasure on their faces in the same way that we do pigs for example are more like dogs they use the upper half of the face 
 the ears are very expressive so you 're not really sure what 's going on with the pig primates on the other hand we use our mouths more
  this has been observed in female macaques  but only when mounting another female 
 masters and johnson in the 1950s they decided okay we 're going to
 figure out the entire human sexual response cycle from arousal all the way through orgasm in
  men and women everything that happens in the human body 
 okay with women a lot of this is happening inside this did not stop masters and johnson they developed
 an artificial coition machine this is
 basically a penis camera on a motor there is a phallus  clear acrylic phallus with a camera and a light source attached to a motor that is kind of going like this 
 and
 the woman would have sex with it that is what they would do pretty amazing
 this device has been dismantled this just kills me not because i wanted to use it i wanted to see
 one fine day  alfred kinsey decided
 to calculate the average distance traveled by ejaculated semen this was not idle curiosity doctor kinsey
  had heard and there was a theory going around at the time this being the  1940s
 that the force with which semen is thrown against the cervix was a factor in fertility
 kinsey thought it was bunk so he got to work he got together in
 his lab
 three hundred men a measuring
  in fact he found that
 in three quarters of the men the stuff
 just kind of slopped out it wasn 't spurted or thrown or ejected under great force  however 
 the record holder landed just shy of the eight foot mark which is impressive
  of this experiment in his book kinsey wrote two sheets were laid down to protect the oriental carpets 
 which is my second favorite line in the entire oeuvre of alfred kinsey my favorite being
  cheese crumbs spread before a pair of copulating rats will distract the female  but not the male
