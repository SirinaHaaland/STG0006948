  couple of years i have produced what i call the dead mall series thirty two short films and counting about dead malls now  
 for those of you who are not familiar with what a dead mall is it 's basically a
  shopping mall that has fallen into hard times so it either has few shops and fewer shoppers or
 it 's abandoned and crumbling into ruin no sale at penny 's 
 i started producing this series
 in early two thousand and fifteen
 after going through kind of a dark period in my life where i just didn 't want to
  i put my camera away
 and i just stopped 
 so in in two thousand and fifteen i decided to make a short film about the owings mills mall 
 owings mills mall opened in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six i should know because i was there on opening day
 i was there with my family along with every other family in baltimore
  and you had to drive around for for forty five minutes
 just to find a parking spot so if you can imagine  that 's not happening at the malls today  my first mall job
 that i had as a teenager was at a sporting goods store called herman 's
 world of sports  maybe you remember herman 's world of sports you guys remember that yeah  so
 i worked in a lady 's shoe store i worked in
  a leather goods store and i also worked in a
 video store and not being one who was very fond
 of the retail arts 
 i got fired from every single job
  i did what any normal teenager did in the 1990s i shoplifted
  i 'm just kidding i hung out with my friends at the mall 
 everyone 's like oh my god what kind of talk is this
  hanging out at the mall could be fun but it could be really lame too like sharing a cigarette with
 unemployed mall rat
 who has put on black lipstick for the night
 while you 're on your break from your crappy minimum wage job 
 as i stand here today  owings mills has been gutted and it 's ready for the wrecking ball
 the last time i was there it was in the evening and it was about three days before
 they closed the mall for good  and you kind of felt they never announced the mall was closing but you had this
 sort of feeling this ominous feeling that something big was going to happen like it was the end of the road it was a very
 creepy
  walk through the mall let me show you
  when i started producing the dead mall series i put the videos up onto youtube and while i thought they were interesting
 frankly i didn 't think others would share the enthusiasm for such a drab and depressing topic
  i was wrong because a lot of people started to comment and at first the comments were like
 basically like oh my god that 's the mall from my childhood what happened 
 and then i would get comments from people who were like 
 there 's a dead mall in my town you should come and film it so i started to travel
  these dead malls  some were open  some were abandoned  it was
 kind of always hard to get into the ones that were abandoned but i somehow always found a way in 
 the malls that are still open they always do this weird thing like the dead malls
  'll have three stores left  but they try to spruce it up
 to make it appear like things are on the up and up for example  you 'll have an empty store
 and they bring the gate down so at owings mills for example they put this tarp over the gate right  and it 's got
 a stock photo of a woman
 who is so happy and she 's holding a blouse and she 's like
 laughter and then there 's a guy standing next to her with like  an espresso cup and he 's like 
 laughter and it says what brings you today 
 laughter i wanted to be scared and depressed  thank you
  the comments just kept pouring in
 on the videos from all over the country and then all over the world 
 and i started to think this could really be something but i had to get creative because i 'm like  how long
 are people going to sit and watch me waddling through an empty mall
  i filmed with an iphone  so i 'd walk through the mall with an iphone and you know like
 that 
 and
 security because malls they don 't like photography so the security would come up and be like put that away and i 'm like ok so i had to get creative and sneaky  
 so i started using a hidden camera
 and different techniques to get the footage that i needed and basically what i
  to do was make the video like it was a first person experience like you are sitting
 put your headphones on watching the screen it 's like you 're there in the video like a video game basically 
 i also started to use music
  is a music genre that emerged in the early 
 among internet communities here 's an example
  from an album he did called hologram plaza so if you look that up
  is more than an art form it 's like a movement it 's nihilistic it 's angsty but it 's somehow comforting the whole aesthetic
 is a way of dealing with things you can 't do anything about like no jobs  or sitting in your parents ' basement eating ramen noodles
 vaporwave came out of this generation 's desire to express their hopelessness the same way
 that the
  did sitting around in the food court one of my favorite malls
 i 've been to
 is in corpus christi  and it 's called the sunrise mall when i was a kid 
 my favorite thing to do was watch movies and i used to watch movies over and over and over again and
 one of my favorite films was the legend of billie jean
 now for those of you who have seen the legend of billie jean you 'll know that 
 it 's a great film i love it  and helen slater and christian slater and if you didn 't know they are not related  many people thought that they were brother and sister they 're not but anyway  
 sunrise mall was used in the film as a filming location the mall
  and here 's billie jean running across
 the fountain  being chased by hubie pyatt 's friends 
 and she jumps over here  and you can see the shot right here is what it looks like today
  's pretty incredible i mean honestly
 it 's exactly the same  and there they are falling in the fountain and she runs up the stairs this is a nice shot of the the whole
 thing here dan bell 
 i love that so
 much i always think in my head if i owned a
  in the food court and invite millennials and hipsters
 to come and drink and eat  
 and i guarantee you within three weeks h & m and levi 's will be banging on the door trying to get space  i don 't know why they don 't do this but apparently 
 it 's only in my
 mind it goes all day
 anyway in closing 
 when they first asked me to do this talk i said do you have the right person 
  i put my camera down three or four years ago and it took
 going to these malls for me to be inspired again  
 and to see my audience and people from
  over the world writing me and saying god i love your videos is
 incredible  
 i don 't know how to even explain it as an artist how fulfilling that is if you would have told me a year ago
 that i would be standing on this stage
 talking to all of you wonderful people i would have never believed it i am humbled and so appreciative  thank you very much
