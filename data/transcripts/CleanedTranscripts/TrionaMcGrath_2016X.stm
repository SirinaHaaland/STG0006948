  do you ever think about how important the oceans are in our daily lives 
 the oceans cover two thirds of our planet  they provide half the oxygen we
  they moderate our climate  and they provide jobs and medicine and food
 including twenty percent of protein to feed the entire world population
 people used to think that the oceans were so vast that they wouldn 't be affected by human activities  
 well today i 'm going to tell you about a serious reality that is changing our oceans
 called ocean acidification or the evil twin of climate change
 did you know that the oceans have absorbed
  percent of all of the carbon dioxide that we have emitted to the atmosphere  
 now this is just another great service provided by the oceans since carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that 's causing climate change 
 but as we keep pumping more and more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
  more is dissolving into the oceans and this is what 's changing our ocean chemistry 
 when carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater it undergoes a number of chemical reactions 
 now lucky for you i don 't have time to get into the details of the chemistry for today  
 but i 'll tell you as more carbon dioxide enters the ocean the seawater ph goes down  
 and this basically means that there
  is an increase in ocean acidity  
 and this whole process is called ocean acidification and it 's happening alongside climate change  
 scientists have been monitoring ocean acidification for over two decades 
 this figure is an important time series in hawaii and the top line shows steadily increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide
  in the atmosphere  and this is directly as a result of human activities  
 the line underneath shows the increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide that is dissolved in the surface of the ocean
 which you can see is increasing at the same rate as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since measurements began  the line on the bottom
  shows the change in chemistry as more carbon dioxide has entered the ocean the seawater ph has gone down  
 which basically means there has been an increase in ocean acidity  
 now in ireland scientists are also monitoring ocean acidification scientists at the marine institute and and nui galway  
 and we too are seeing acidification at the same rate as these
  sites around the world so it 's happening right at our doorstep  
 now i 'd like to give you an example of just how we collect our data to to monitor a changing ocean firstly we collect a lot of our samples in the middle of winter so 
 as you can imagine in the north atlantic we get hit with some seriously stormy conditions so not for any of you who get a little motion sickness but
  so we lower this instrument over the side of the ship  and there are sensors that are mounted on the bottom that can tell us information about the surrounding water  such as temperature
 or dissolved oxygen 
 and then we can collect our seawater samples in these large bottles  so we start at the bottom which can be over four kilometers deep just off our continental shelf  
 and we take samples at regular intervals right up to the surface 
  take the seawater back on the deck  and then we can either analyze them on the ship or back in the laboratory for the different chemicals parameters  
 but why should we care how is ocean acidification going to affect all of us 
 well here are the worrying facts 
 there has already been an increase in ocean acidity of twenty six percent
  which is directly due to human activities  
 unless we can start slowing down our carbon dioxide emissions  
 we 're expecting an increase in ocean acidity of one hundred and seventy percent
 by the end of this century  i mean this is within our children 's lifetime this rate of
  so our marine life have never ever experienced such a fast rate of change before  
 so we literally could not know how they 're going to cope  
 now there was a natural acidification event millions of years ago  which was much slower
  what we 're seeing today  and this coincided with a mass extinction of many marine species 
 so is that what we 're headed for well maybe  
 studies are showing some species are actually doing quite well but many are showing a negative response 
 one of the big concerns is as ocean acidity increases the
  concentration of carbonate ions in seawater decrease  
 now these ions are basically the building blocks for many marine species to make their shells for example crabs
 or mussels  oysters  
 another example are corals  they also need these carbonate ions in seawater to make their coral structure in order to build coral reefs
 as ocean acidity increases
 and the concentration of carbonate ions decrease  
 these species first find it more difficult to make their shells  
 and at even even lower levels  they can actually begin to dissolve 
 this here is a pteropod it 's called a sea butterfly
  and it 's an important food source in the ocean for many species  from krill to salmon right up to whales 
 the shell of the pteropod was placed into seawater at a ph that we 're expecting by the end of this century  
 after only forty five days
 at this very realistic ph you can see the shell has almost completely
  ocean acidification could affect right up through the food chain
 and right onto our dinner plates i mean who here likes shellfish 
 or salmon or many other fish species whose food source in the ocean could be affected 
 these are cold water corals  and did you know we actually have cold water corals in irish waters just off our continental
  and they support rich biodiversity including some very important fisheries it
 's projected that by the end of this century  seventy percent of all known cold water corals in the entire ocean
 will be surrounded by seawater that is dissolving their coral structure 
 the last example i have are these healthy tropical corals they were placed in seawater at a ph
  we 're expecting by the year two thousand one hundred  
 after six months  the coral has almost completely dissolved  now coral reefs support
  percent of all marine life in the entire ocean all marine life so you can
 is a global threat  i have an eight month old baby boy  
 unless we start now to slow this down  i dread to think what our oceans will look like when he 's a grown man 
 we will see acidification we have already put too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere  
 but we can slow this
  down we can prevent the worst case scenario  
 the only way of doing that is by reducing our carbon dioxide emissions  
 this is important for both you and i for industry for governments we need to work together slow down global warming slow down ocean acidification and help to maintain a
  healthy ocean and a healthy planet for our generation and for generations to come
