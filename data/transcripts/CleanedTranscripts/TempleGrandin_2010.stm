  just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is  autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe the child remains nonverbal all the way up to brilliant scientists 
  and engineers and i actually feel at home here because there 's a lot of autism genetics here
  wouldn 't have any 
 it 's a continuum of traits when does a nerd turn into
  asperger which is just mild autism i mean einstein and mozart and tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today  
 and one of the things that is really going to concern me is getting these kids to be the
  ones that are going to invent the next energy things that bill gates talked about this morning  
 ok  now if you want to understand autism animals  i want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking you have to get away from verbal language i think in pictures i don 't think in language  
 now the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details
  this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters or the little letters and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly  
 and the thing is the normal brain ignores the details  well if you 're building a bridge details are pretty important because it 'll fall down if you ignore the details  
 and one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract people are getting away from doing
  stuff i 'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands on classes 
 because art and classes like that those are the classes where i excelled  in my work with cattle  
 i noticed a lot of little things that most people don 't notice would make the cattle balk for example this flag waving right in front of the veterinary facility  
 this feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility all they needed to do was move the flag rapid
  movement  contrast 
 in the early ' 70s when i started i got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing people thought that was crazy a coat on a fence would make them balk  shadows would make them balk a hose on the floor 
 people weren 't noticing these things a chain hanging down and that 's shown very very nicely in the movie in fact i loved the movie how they duplicated all my projects that 's the geek side my drawings got to star in the movie
 and actually it 's called temple grandin not thinking in pictures so what is thinking in pictures  it 's literally movies in your head  
 my mind works like google for images
 when i was a young kid i didn 't know my thinking was different i thought everybody thought in pictures  then when i did my book thinking in pictures i started interviewing people about how they think  
 and i was shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different like if i say
  church steeple most people get this sort of generalized generic one now maybe that 's not true in this room  but it 's going to be true
 in a lot of different places  
 i see only specific pictures  they flash up into my memory just like google for pictures  and in the movie they 've got a great scene in there where the word shoe is said and a whole bunch of '
  pop into my imagination  ok  there 's my childhood church that 's specific 
 there 's some more fort collins  ok how about famous ones  and they just kind of come up kind of like this just really quickly like google for pictures  
 and they come up one at a time and then i think ok well maybe we can have it snow or we can have a thunderstorm and i can hold it there and turn them into videos  
 now visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing
 cattle handling facilities  and i 've worked really hard on improving
 how cattle are treated at the slaughter plant i 'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides i 've got that stuff up on youtube if you want to look at it but
 one of the things that i was able to do in my design work is i could 
 a piece of equipment in my mind  just like a virtual reality computer system
  and this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie that was like just so super cool  
 and there were a lot of kind of asperger types and autism types working out there on the movie set too 
 but one of the things that really worries me is where 's the younger version of those kids going today 
 they 're not ending up in silicon valley where they belong
  one of the things i learned very early on because i wasn 't that social is i had to sell my work and not myself  
 and the way i sold livestock jobs is i showed off my drawings i showed off pictures of things  another thing that helped me as a little kid is  boy in the ' 50s you were taught manners you were taught you can 't pull the merchandise off the shelves in the store and throw it around
 when kids get to be in third or fourth grade
  you might see that this kid 's going to be a visual thinker  drawing in perspective now i want to emphasize that not every autistic kid is going to be a visual thinker  
 now  
 i had this brain scan done several years ago  and i used to joke around about having a gigantic internet trunk line going deep into my visual cortex this is tensor
  and my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the control 's the red lines there are me  and the blue lines are the sex and  age matched control 
 and there i got a gigantic one  and the control over there the blue one has got a really small one 
 and some of the research now is showing that people on the spectrum actually think with the primary visual cortex  now the thing is the visual thinker is just one kind of mind  you see the autistic mind tends to
  be a specialist mind good at one thing bad at something else  
 and where i was bad was algebra  and i was never allowed to take geometry or trig  gigantic mistake  i 'm finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra  go right to geometry and trig  
 now another kind of mind is the pattern thinker more abstract these are your engineers your computer
  this is pattern thinking that praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper no scotch tape  no cuts  and there in the background is the pattern for folding it 
 here are the types of thinking
 photo realistic visual thinkers like me 
 pattern thinkers  music and math minds some of these oftentimes have problems with reading  you also will see these kind of problems with
 kids that are
  see these different kinds of minds  and then there 's a verbal mind  they know every fact about everything  now another thing is the sensory issues i was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face  
 and i came in half an hour beforehand so i could have it put on and kind of get used to it and they got it bent so it 's not hitting my chin  
 but sensory is an issue some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights  others have problems with sound
  it 's going to be variable  now visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind because think about it an animal is 
  not verbal thinks in pictures  
 thinks in sounds  thinks in smells think about how much information there is on the local fire hydrant  he knows who 's been there 
 when they were there are they friend or foe is there anybody he can go mate with there 's a ton of information on that fire hydrant  it 's all very detailed information and looking at these kind of details
 gave me a lot of insight into animals  now  the animal mind  and also my mind  puts
 information into categories man on a horse
  and a man on the ground that is viewed as two totally different things you could have a horse that 's been abused by a rider  they 'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with the horseshoer but you can 't ride him 
 you have another horse where maybe the horseshoer beat him up and he 'll be terrible for anything on the ground with the veterinarian but
 a person can ride him cattle are the same way  man on a horse a man on foot
  want you to think about just how specific this is  
 now  
 this ability to put information into categories  i find a lot of people are not very good at this when i 'm out troubleshooting equipment or problems with something in a plant 
 they don 't seem to be able to figure out do i have a 
  issue  or do i have something wrong with the equipment in other words categorize equipment problem from a people problem  i find a lot of people have difficulty doing
  doing that now let 's say i figure out it 's an equipment problem 
 is it a minor problem with something simple i can fix  or is the whole design of the system wrong people have a hard time figuring that out 
 let 's just look at something like you know  solving problems with making airlines safer yeah i 'm a million mile flier i do lots and lots of flying  
 and
  if i was at the faa what would i be
 doing a lot of direct observation of 
 it would be their airplane tails you know five fatal wrecks in the last twenty years the tail either came off 
 or steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way  
 it 's tails  pure and simple  and when the pilots walk around the plane guess what they can 't see that stuff inside the tail  now as i think about that i 'm pulling
  i take all the little pieces and i put the pieces together like a puzzle  now here is a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats he
 'd been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat white cowboy hats  that was absolutely fine  
 now the thing is the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to
  we 've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds  and one of the things that is driving me really crazy as i travel around and i do autism meetings is i 'm seeing a lot of smart  geeky nerdy kids  
 and they just aren 't very social  and nobody 's working on developing their interest in something like science and
 this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher my science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie
  i was a goofball student when i was in high school i just didn 't care at all about studying  
 until i had mr carlock 's science class he was now dr carlock in the movie  and
 he he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room  this brings up the whole thing of you 've got to show kids interesting stuff you know 
 one of the things that i think maybe ted ought to do is
 tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on ted and there 's all kinds of great stuff on the internet to get these
  kids turned on because i 'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids  and the teachers out in the midwest and other parts of the country when you get away from these tech areas they don 't know what to do with these kids  
 and they 're not going down the right path  
 the thing is you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind  or your mind can be wired to be more social and what some of the research now has shown in autism is there may by extra wiring back
  here in the really brilliant mind and we lose a few social circuits here  it 's kind of a trade off between thinking and social  and then you can get to the point where it 's so severe you 're going to have a person that 's going to be non verbal 
 in the normal human mind  language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals  this is the work of dr bruce miller 
  he studied alzheimer 's patients that had frontal temporal lobe dementia 
 and the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain  and then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars  
 now  
 van gogh doesn 't know anything about physics  but i think it 's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this eddy pattern in this painting followed a statistical model
  brings up the whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical
 patterns is in our own head  
 and the wolfram stuff i was taking notes and writing down all the all the search words i could use  because i think that 's going to go on in my autism lectures we 've got to show 
  these kids interesting stuff  and they 've taken out the auto shop class and the drafting class and the art class i mean art was my best subject in
  we 've got to think about all these different kinds of minds  and we 've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds  because we absolutely are going to need these kinds of people in the future  
 and let 's talk about jobs
  ok  my science teacher got me studying because i was a goofball that didn 't want to study  but you know what i was getting work experience  i 'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven 't learned basic things like how to be on time i was taught that when i was eight years old
 how to have table manners at granny 's sunday party
  party  i was taught that when i was very very young  
 and when i was thirteen i had a job at a dressmaker 's shop sewing clothes i did internships in college 
 i was building things  and i also had to learn how to do assignments  you know all i wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when i
  they 've got to learn how to do something else  let 's say the kid is fixated on legos  let 's get him working on building different things the thing about the autistic mind is it tends to be fixated 
 like if the kid loves race cars  let 's use race cars for math let 's figure out how long it takes a race car to go a certain distance in other words  
 use that fixation in order to motivate that kid that 's one of the things we need to do i
 really get fed up
  when the teachers especially when you get away from this part of the country they don 't know what to do with these smart kids it just drives me crazy 
 what can visual thinkers do when they grow up they can do graphic design all kinds of stuff with computers photography 
 industrial design
 the pattern thinkers they 're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians your software engineers your computer programmers
  of those kinds of jobs  
 and then you 've got the word minds they make great journalists  
 and they also make really really good stage actors  because the thing about being autistic is i had to learn social skills like being in a play  
 you just kind of you just have to learn it  and we need to be working with these students and this brings up
  my science teacher was not an accredited teacher he was a nasa space scientist some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology or in chemistry you can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry 
 we need to be doing that  
 because what i 'm observing is the good teachers for a lot of these kids are out in the community colleges  but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools another thing that can be very very very successful
 is there 's a lot of people that may have retired
  from working in the software industry  
 and they can teach your kid and it doesn 't matter if what they teach them is old  because what you 're doing is you 're lighting the spark you 're getting that kid turned on 
 and you get him turned on then you 'll learn all the new stuff 
 mentors are just essential i cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me  
 and we 've got to mentor them hire them
  and if you bring them in for internships in your companies the thing about the autism asperger y kind of mind you 've got to give them a specific task don 't just say design new software 
 you 've got to tell them something more specific 
 we 're designing software for a phone and it has to do some specific thing and it can only use so much memory that 's the kind of specificity you need 
 well that 's
  the end of my talk  and i just want to thank everybody for
  from the face of the earth then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave temple grandin
 because who do you think made the first stone spear it was the asperger guy and if you were to get rid of all the autism genetics there 'd be no more silicon valley  and the energy crisis would not be
 but if there is someone here who has an autistic child or knows an autistic child and feels
 kind of cut off from them what advice would you give them tg well first of all
  degrees about half of the people on the spectrum are not going to learn to talk and they won 't be working in silicon valley 
 that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do  but then you get these smart geeky kids with a touch of autism  and that 's where you 've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things i got social interaction through shared interests i rode horses with
  onto a rubber membrane on a speaker to make a light show that was like we considered that super cool ca 
 is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them as some might as
 most wish tg well i tell you that child will be loyal and if your house is burning down they 're going to get you out of it ca 
  passionate about that the things i do are going to make the world a better place when i have a mother of an autistic child say my kid went to college because of your book or one of your lectures that makes me happy
 you know the slaughter plants i worked with in the ' 80s they were absolutely awful
  i developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes how many cattle fell down how many got poked with the prodder how many cattle are mooing their heads off 
 and it 's very very simple  you directly observe a few simple things  it 's worked really well  i get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world we need a lot more of that and a lot less abstract stuff
  one of the things you said that really
 astonished me was that one thing you were passionate about was server farms tell me about that tg
 well the reason why i got really excited when i read about that  it
 contains knowledge  it 's libraries and to me knowledge is something that is extremely valuable so maybe
  ten years ago now our library got flooded this is before the internet got really big and i was really upset about all the books being wrecked 
 because it was knowledge being destroyed  and server farms or data centers are great libraries of knowledge ca temple can i just say it 's an absolute delight to have you at ted
