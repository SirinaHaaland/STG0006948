  let 's start with some good news and the good news has to do with what do we know based on
 biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very
  most common cancer of children 
 when i was a student the mortality rate was about ninety five percent  
 today some twenty five thirty years later we 're talking about a mortality rate that 's reduced
 by eighty five percent  six thousand children each year who would have previously
  died of this disease are cured
 if you want the really big numbers look at these numbers for heart disease heart disease used to be the biggest killer particularly for men in their 40s today we 've seen a 
  reduction in mortality from heart disease
 remarkably one point one million deaths averted every year  aids incredibly has just been named in the past
  a chronic disease  meaning that a 20 year old who becomes infected with hiv is expected not to live weeks months or
 a couple of years as we said only a decade ago  but is thought to live decades probably to die in his 
  from other causes altogether these are just remarkable remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers 
 and one in particular that you probably wouldn 't know about stroke which has been along with heart disease one of the biggest
  in this country 
 is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within three hours of the onset 
 some thirty percent of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever 
 remarkable stories
 good news stories all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us
  detect early
 and intervene early early detection early intervention that 's the story
 for these successes  unfortunately the news is not all good  
 let 's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide  now this is of course not a disease per se it 's a condition or it 's a
  situation that leads to mortality 
 what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is there are thirty eight thousand suicides each year in the united states that means one about every fifteen minutes  
 third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of fifteen and twenty five it
 's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide
 and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatalities in this country
  we talk about suicide  there is also a medical contribution here because ninety percent of suicides are related to a mental illness  depression  bipolar disorder 
 schizophrenia  anorexia  borderline personality there 's a long list of disorders that contribute  
  it 's not just the mortality from these disorders  
 it 's also morbidity if you look at disability as measured by the world health organization with something they call the disability adjusted life years
 it 's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist  except it 's one way of trying to capture
 what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes and as you can see virtually thirty percent
 of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed
 to mental disorders neuropsychiatric syndromes you
 're probably thinking that doesn 't make any sense i mean  cancer seems far more serious heart disease seems far more serious  
 but you can see actually they are further down this list and that 's because we 're talking here about disability what drives the disability for these disorders like
 schizophrenia and bipolar and depression  why are they
  number one here well 
 there are probably three reasons one is that they 're highly prevalent about one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime 
 a second of course is that for some people these become truly disabling and it 's about four to five percent perhaps one in twenty  but what really drives these numbers this high morbidity and to some extent the high mortality
  is the fact that these start very early in life fifty percent will have onset by age fourteen seventy five percent by age twenty four 
 a picture that is very different than what one would see
 if you 're talking about cancer or heart disease  diabetes hypertension most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality 
 these are indeed the chronic
  disorders of young people 
 now i started by telling you that there were some good news stories this is obviously not one of them this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult and in a
 sense this is a kind of confession for me my job is to
 actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders i work for the federal government actually i work for you you pay my
  salary and maybe at this point when you know what i do or maybe what i 've failed to do you 'll
 think that i probably ought to be fired  and i could certainly understand that 
 but what i want to suggest and the reason i 'm here is to tell you that i think we 're about to
 be in a very different world as we think about these these illnesses what i 've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders  diseases of the mind
  actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days and people feel that for whatever reason it 's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior  
 fair enough they are disorders of behavior and they are disorders of the mind  but what i want to suggest to you
 is that both of those terms which have been in play for a century or more are actually now
  impediments to progress that what we need
 conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders  
 now for some of you you 're going to say oh my goodness 
 here we go again we 're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we 're going to hear about drugs or we 're going to hear about
 some very simplistic notion
 that
  will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules or maybe into some sort of
 very flat unidimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia  
 when we talk about the brain it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic it depends of course
 on what scale or what scope you want to think about but this is
 an organ of surreal complexity and we are just beginning to understand
 how to even study it  whether you 're thinking about the one hundred billion neurons that are in the cortex or the one hundred trillion synapses that make up all the connections  
 we have just begun
 to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine
 that does extraordinary kinds of information processing
 and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports that supports our own minds it 's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution
 that
 we simply don 't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough to understand itself in a sense it actually makes you
  feel that when you 're in the safe zone of studying behavior or cognition something you can observe  that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic
 than trying to engage this very complex mysterious organ that we 're beginning to try to understand 
 now already in the case of the brain disorders that i 've been talking to
  of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses we have been able to already identify some of the connectional differences or some of the ways in which
 the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders  we call this the human connectome  and you can think about the connectome
 sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain
  hear more about this in a few minutes the important piece here is that as you begin to look
 at people who have these disorders the one in five of us who struggle in some way you find that there 's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired 
 but there are some predictable patterns and those patterns
 are risk factors for developing one of these disorders  it 's a little different than the way we think about
  brain disorders like huntington 's or parkinson 's or alzheimer 's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex 
 here we 're talking about traffic jams or sometimes detours or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions you could if you want compare this to 
 on the one hand a myocardial infarction a heart attack where you have dead tissue in the heart versus an arrhythmia where the
 organ simply isn 't functioning because
  of the communication problems within it either one would kill you in only one of them will you find a major lesion 
 as we think about this probably it 's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder and that would be schizophrenia because i think that 's a good case
 for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters 
 these are scans from judy rapoport and her colleagues at the national institute of mental health in which they
  studied children with very early onset schizophrenia and you can see already in the top there 's areas that are red or orange  yellow are places where there 's less gray matter  and as they followed 
  them over five years comparing them to age match controls you can see that  particularly in areas like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
  loss of gray matter and it 's important if you try to model this you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical mass loss of cortical gray matter  
 and what 's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that mark and at some point when you overshoot you cross a threshold and it 's that threshold
 where we say this is a person who has this disease because they have the behavioral symptoms
 of hallucinations and delusions  that 's something we can
  but look at this closely and you can see that actually
 they 've crossed a different threshold they 've crossed a brain threshold much earlier  
 that perhaps not at age twenty two or twenty  but even by age fifteen or sixteen you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain not at the level of behavior  
 why does this matter well first because for brain disorders behavior is the last thing to change we know that for alzheimer 's for parkinson 's for huntington 's there are
  changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change 
 the tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier  
 long before the symptoms emerge  but most important go back to where we started 
 the good news stories in medicine
  if we waited until the heart attack  
 we would be sacrificing one point one million lives every year in this country to heart disease that is precisely what we do today
 when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders  brain circuit disorders  has a behavioral disorder we wait until
  the behavior becomes manifest 
 that 's not early detection  that 's not early intervention  now to be clear we 're not quite ready to do this we don 't have all the facts we don 't actually even know
 what the tools will be nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior
 emerges as different but this tells us how we need to think about it
  and where we need to go are we going to be there soon i think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years but i 'd like to finish
 with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who 's thought a lot about changes in concepts and changes in technology we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate
 the change that will occur in the next ten
