  america 's public energy conversation boils down to this question 
 would you rather die of a oil wars 
 or b  climate change  or c nuclear holocaust or d all of the above oh
 i missed one or e  none of the above
  's the one we 're not normally offered 
 what if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing could we have fuel without fear could we reinvent fire 
 you see fire made us human fossil fuels made us modern  but now we need a new fire that makes us safe  secure healthy and durable  
  of the world 's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles
 of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo those fossil fuels have
 built our civilization  they 've created our wealth  they 've enriched the lives of billions  but they also have rising costs
  health and environment that are starting to erode if not outweigh their benefits  so we need a new fire  
 and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity 
 each of which puts  two fifths of the fossil carbon in the air  but they 're really quite distinct 
 less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil
 although almost half is made from coal
 their uses are quite concentrated three fourths of our oil fuel is transportation three fourths of our electricity powers buildings and the rest of both runs factories  
 so very efficient
 vehicles buildings and factories save oil and coal and also natural gas that can displace both of them  
 but today 's energy system is not just inefficient it is also disconnected
  aging  dirty and insecure so it needs refurbishment by two thousand and fifty though it could become efficient connected
 and distributed with elegantly frugal autos factories and buildings all relying
 on a modern secure and resilient electricity system we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal
  fifty
 and use one third less natural gas while switching to efficient use
 and renewable supply 
 this could cost by two thousand and fifty  
 five trillion dollars less in net present value  that is expressed as a lump sum today 
 than business as usual assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero
 conservatively low estimate
  yet this cheaper energy system could support one hundred and fifty eight percent bigger u s economy
 all without needing oil or coal or for that matter nuclear energy 
 moreover this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of congress
 and no new federal taxes mandate subsidies
  or laws and running washington gridlock 
 let me say that again i 'm going to tell you how to get the united states completely off oil and coal five trillion dollars cheaper
 with no act of congress led by business for profit  in other words we 're going to use our most effective institutions
 private enterprise
  with civil society
 and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions  
 and whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security  or environmental stewardship and climate protection and public health  
 reinventing fire makes sense and makes money  
 general eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing
 more options and more synergies  so in reinventing fire we integrated all four sectors that use energy
 transportation  buildings industry and electricity
 and we integrated four kinds of innovation not just technology and policy  but also design and business strategy 
 those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts especially in creating deeply
  disruptive business opportunities 
 oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day
  plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs raising its total cost to over a sixth of gdp 
 our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles so let 's start by
  of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight
  and every unit of energy you save at the wheels by taking out weight or drag saves seven units in the tank because you don 't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels  
 unfortunately  over the past quarter century  epidemic obesity has made our two ton steel cars gain weight
 twice as fast as we have but today ultralight
 ultrastrong materials like carbon fiber composites can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars
 simpler and cheaper to build 
 lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them 
 so their engines get smaller indeed that sort of vehicle fitness
 then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries
  or fuel cells
 also get smaller and lighter and cheaper  so sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today  while the driving cost even from the start is very much lower 
 so these innovations together can transform
 automakers from wringing tiny savings out of victorian engine and
  steeply falling costs of three
 linked innovations that
 strongly reenforce each other
 namely ultralight materials making them into structures and electric propulsion the sales can grow
 and the
 prices fall even faster with temporary feebates that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on inefficient ones and
 just in the first two years
 the biggest of europe 's five feebate programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency  
 the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game changing as shifting
 from typewriters to the gains in computers of course computers and electronics are now america 's biggest industry while typewriter makers have
  vanished  so vehicle fitness
 opens a new automotive competitive strategy
 that can double the oil savings over the next forty years but then also make electrification affordable and that
 displaces the rest of the oil america could lead this next automotive revolution
  currently the leader is germany last year  volkswagen
 announced that by next year they 'll be producing this carbon fiber
 plugin hybrid getting two hundred and thirty miles a gallon 
 also last year  bmw announced this carbon fiber electric car they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries 
 and they said we do not intend to be a typewriter maker audi claimed it 's going to beat them both by a year  
 seven years ago
  and cheaper american manufacturing technology was used to
 make this little carbon fiber
 test part  which doubles as a carbon cap in one minute
 and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is 
  don 't worry about dropping it it 's tougher than titanium  tom friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it 
 but such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance  
 they can save four fifths of the capital needed to make autos  they can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to twelve times as much crash energy per pound as steel 
 if we made all of our autos
  it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half saudi arabias or half an opec by drilling in the detroit formation a very prospective play  
 and all those mega barrels under detroit
 cost an average of eighteen bucks a barrel  they are 
  carbon free and inexhaustible the same physics and the same business logic also apply to big vehicles in the five
  saved sixty percent of the fuel per ton mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design  but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two thirds 
 and combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes now on the drawing board can save close to a trillion dollars 
 also today 's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances
 in much the same
  way that military r & d
 has given us the internet the global positioning system and the jet engine and microchip industries as we design and build
 vehicles better we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving 
 instead of just seeing the the travel grow
  we can use innovative pricing charging for road infrastructure by the mile not by the gallon  we can use some smart it to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride sharing 
 we can
 allow smart and lucrative growth models
 that help people already be near where they want to be so they don 't need to go somewhere else and we can use smart
  those things can give us the same or better access
 with forty six to eighty four percent less driving 
 saving another zero point four trillion dollars  plus zero point three trillion dollars from using trucks more productively  
 so forty years hence when you add it all up a far more mobile u s economy
 can use no
  saving or displacing barrels for twenty five bucks rather than buying them for over a hundred adds up to a $ four trillion net saving
 counting all the hidden costs at zero 
 so to get mobility without oil to phase out the oil  
 we can get efficient and then switch fuels those one hundred and twenty five to two hundred and forty 
  autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells electricity
 and advanced biofuels  the trucks and planes can realistically use
 hydrogen or advanced biofuels the trucks could even use natural gas but no vehicles will need oil 
 and the most biofuel we might need just three million barrels a day 
 can be made two thirds from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate our team speeds up
  these kinds of oil savings by what we call institutional acupuncture we figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly we stick little needles in it to get it flowing working with partners like ford and walmart and the pentagon 
 and the long transition is already
 well under way in fact three years ago
 mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil
  but in demand and deutsche bank even said
 world oil use could peak around two thousand and sixteen  
 in other words oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices 
 but the electrified vehicles don 't need to burden the electricity grid rather when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids they 're adding to the grid
  valuable flexibility and storage that help the grid integrate
 varying solar solar and wind power 
 so the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately  
 and they also converge the oil story with our second big story 
 saving electricity and then
  and those twin revolutions in electricity
 will
 bring to that sector more numerous and profound and diverse disruptions than any other sector because we 've got 21st century technology and speed colliding
 head on with 20th and 19th century institutions  rules and cultures 
  keep improving faster than we 're installing them so the
 unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper  
 but as efficiency in buildings and industry starts to grow faster than the economy 
 america 's electricity use could actually shrink 
 even with the
 little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos and we can do this
  just by reasonably accelerating existing trends  
 over the next forty years  buildings which use three quarters of the electricity 
 can triple or quadruple their energy productivity saving one point four trillion dollars 
 net present value 
 with a thirty three percent internal rate of return
 or in
  the savings are worth four times what they cost 
 and industry can accelerate too doubling its energy productivity with a twenty one percent internal rate of return
 the key is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design
 that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings that is it can give you expanding returns  not diminishing returns  
 that is how our two thousand and ten retrofit is saving over
  of the energy in the empire state building
 remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site
 into super windows that pass light but reflect  heat plus better lights and office equipment and such
 cut the maximum cooling load by a third 
 and then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved seventeen million dollars of capital cost
  which helped pay for the other improvements
 and reduce the payback to just three years 
 integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry  dow 's billion dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars  
 but industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars
  of the world 's electricity runs motors half of that runs pumps and fans and those can all be made more efficient and the motors that turn them can
 have their system efficiency roughly doubled by
 integrating thirty five improvements paying back in about a year  but first we ought to be capturing bigger cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks 
 for example pumps the biggest use of motors move liquid through pipes
  but a standard industrial pumping loop
 was redesigned to use at least eighty six percent less energy 
 not by getting better pumps  but just by replacing long  thin crooked pipes with fat short straight pipes  
 this is not about new technology it 's just rearranging our metal furniture of course it also shrinks the pumping equipment and its capital costs 
 what do such savings mean for the electricity that is three fifths used in motors  well from the coal burned at the power plant
 through all these compounding losses  
 only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow  
 but now let 's turn those compounding losses around backwards  and every unit
 of flow
  or friction that we save in the pipe
 saves ten units of fuel cost pollution and what hunter lovins calls global weirding back at the power plant 
 and of course as you go back upstream the components get smaller and therefore cheaper 
 our team has
 lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than thirty billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns everything from data centers and
  chip fabs to mines and refineries  
 typically our retrofit designs save about thirty to sixty percent of the energy and pay back in a few years  
 while the new facility designs save forty to 90 odd percent
 with generally lower capital cost now needing less electricity would ease and speed
 the shift to new sources of electricity chiefly renewables china
 leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost in fact these
 solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart  and germany now has more solar workers than america has steel workers 
 already in about twenty states
 private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill
  such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility
 that
 bypasses your electric company just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company 
 and this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee jeebees and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams renewables are no longer a fringe
  for each of the past four years half of the world 's new generating capacity has been renewable mainly lately in developing countries 
 in two thousand and ten renewables
 other than big hydro  particularly wind and solar cells got one hundred and fifty one billion dollars of private investment 
 and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world
 by adding sixty billion watts in that one year  that happens to be the
  same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year
 a number that goes up sixty or seventy percent a year  in contrast  the
 net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity and the orders behind those
 keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk in fact in this country no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private
 construction capital despite seven years of 100 plus percent subsidies 
 so how else could we replace the coal fired power plants  
 well efficiency and gas can displace them all at just below their operating cost
 and combined with renewables can displace them more than twenty three times at less than their replacement cost but we only need to replace them once
  're often told though that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on because they 're twenty four seven whereas wind and solar power are variable and hence supposedly unreliable 
 actually no generator is twenty four seven they all break 
 and when a big plant goes down you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds
 often for weeks or months often without warning  that is exactly why we 've designed the grid
 to back up failed plants with working plants and in exactly the same way the grid
 can handle wind and wind and solar power 's forecastable variations
  hourly simulations show that
 largely or wholly renewable grids
 can deliver highly reliable power
 when they 're forecasted integrated and diversified by both type and location and that 's true both for continental areas like the u s or europe
 and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid that is how for example  four german states in two thousand and ten were forty three to fifty two percent wind powered  
 portugal was
  how all of europe
 can shift to renewable electricity 
 in america our aging  dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by two thousand and fifty and whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same about six trillion dollars at present value
 whether we buy more of what we 've got or new
  clean coal or renewables that are more or less centralized but
 those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks 
 around national security  fuel water  
 finance technology climate and health for example our over centralized grid
 is very vulnerable to cascading and
  caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or a terrorist attack  
 but that blackout risk disappears and all of the other risks are best managed with distributed renewables
 organized into local micro grids that normally interconnect  but can stand alone at need that is they can
 disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly that approach is exactly what the pentagon is adopting for its own power
  supply  they think they need that how about the rest of us that they 're defending we want our stuff to work too
 at about the same cost as business as usual this would maximize national security  
 customer choice  entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation together efficient use and diverse
 dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector
  traditionally utilities build a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables 
 and those utilities were rewarded as they still are in thirty four states 
 for selling you more electricity 
 however  especially where regulators are now instead rewarding
  the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency demand response cogeneration renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no
 bulk electricity storage so our energy future is not fate but choice and that choice is very flexible 
  for example government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of gdp could never go down and i
  suggested it could go down several fold well that 's what 's actually happened so far it 's fallen by half 
 but with today 's much better technologies more mature delivery channels and integrative design we can do
 far more and even cheaper  so to solve the energy problem we just needed to enlarge it and the results may at first
 seem incredible but
 as marshall mcluhan
  said only puny secrets need protection big discoveries are protected by
 public incredulity 
 now combine the electricity and oil revolutions both driven by modern efficiency and you get the really big story  
 reinventing fire 
 where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the united states completely off
  oil and coal by two thousand and fifty  saving five trillion dollars growing the economy 
 strengthening out national security  oh and by the way by getting rid of the oil and coal reducing the fossil carbon emissions by 
  percent now if you like any of those outcomes you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about
  which of them is most important  
 so focusing on outcomes not motives can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to america 's energy challenge this also turns out to be the best way to cope with global
 challenges climate change nuclear proliferation energy insecurity energy poverty all of which make us
  less safe  now our team at rmi helps smart companies to get unstuck and speed
 this journey via six sectoral initiatives with some more hatching 
 of course there 's still a lot of old thinking out there too  former oil man maurice strong said not all the fossils are in the fuel 
 but as edgar woolard who used to chair dupont reminds us
  hampered by old thinking won 't be a problem because he said they simply won 't be around long term 
 i 've described not just a once in a civilization business opportunity  
 but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species  
 we humans are inventing a new fire
  dug from below but flowing from above  
 not scarce  but bountiful  not local but everywhere  not transient but permanent 
 not costly  but free  
 and but for a little transitional tail of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure this new fire is flameless
  efficiently used it really can do our work without working our undoing  
 each of you owns a piece of that $ five trillion prize  and our new book reinventing fire 
 describes how you can capture it 
 so with the conversation just begun at
 let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other with everyone around you to help make the world richer
  fairer  cooler and safer by together reinventing fire
