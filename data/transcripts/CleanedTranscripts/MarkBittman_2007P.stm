  write about food i write about cooking i take it quite seriously  but i 'm here to talk about something that 's
 become very important to me in the last year or two it is about food but it 's not about
  start with this picture of a beautiful cow  i 'm not a vegetarian this is the old nixon line right but i still think that
 this 
 now  that is only a little bit hyperbolic and why do i say it  
 because only once before has the fate of individual people
 and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined  there was the bomb
  and there 's now 
 and where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives 
 but whether if we could see the earth a century from now we 'd recognize it it 's a holocaust of a different kind 
 and hiding under our desks isn 't going to help start with the notion that global warming is not only real but dangerous
  every scientist in the world now believes this and even president bush has seen the light or pretends to we can take this is a given 
 then hear this please  
 after energy production 
 livestock is the second highest contributor to  atmosphere altering gases nearly one fifth of all greenhouse gas
 is generated by livestock production more than transportation
  you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts but methane is twenty times more poisonous than co2 
 and it 's not just methane 
 livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation  air and water pollution  water shortages and loss of biodiversity there 's more 
  like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people but to animals  
 but lists like this become kind of numbing so let me just say this 
 if you 're a progressive if you 're driving a prius or you 're shopping green or you 're looking for organic  you should probably be a 
 now i 'm no more 
 than i am anti atom 
 but it 's all in the way we use these things there 's another piece of the puzzle which ann cooper talked about beautifully yesterday  and one you already know  
 there 's no question
  lifestyle diseases diabetes heart disease stroke  some cancers
 are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world and that 's the direct result of eating a western diet 
 our demand for meat dairy and refined carbohydrates the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of coke a day
 our demand for these things
  not our need our want 
 drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us  and those calories are in foods that cause not prevent disease  
 now global warming was unforeseen we didn 't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility maybe a few lung diseases here and there but you know 
 that 's not such a big deal  
 the current health crisis however is a little more
  the work of the evil empire we were told we were assured that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate  the healthier we 'd be no 
 overconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem  along with our paltry consumption of plants now  there 's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here  but the evidence is that plants and i want to make this clear it 's not the ingredients in plants
  the plants it 's not the 
 it 's the carrot the evidence is very clear
 that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point  you eat more plants  you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad 
 but back to animals and junk food  what do they have in common
  we don 't need either of them for health  we don 't need animal products and we certainly don 't need white bread or coke 
 two both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demand we 're not born craving whoppers or skittles  
 three their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more 
  diet now  let 's imagine a parallel let 's pretend that our government supported an
 while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy knowing all the while that the result would be pollution war and rising costs 
 incredible isn 't it  yet they do that and they do this here it 's the same deal  
 the sad thing is when it comes to diet is that even when well intentioned feds try to do right by us they fail  
 either they 're outvoted by puppets of
  agribusiness or they are puppets of agribusiness  
 so when the usda finally acknowledged that it was plants rather than animals that made people healthy  
 they encouraged us via their overly simplistic food pyramid 
 to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day  along with more carbs what they didn 't tell us is that some carbs are better than others and that plants and whole grains
  should be supplanting eating junk food  
 but industry lobbyists would never let that happen and guess what 
 half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness  
 so instead of substituting plants for animals our swollen appetites simply became larger 
 and the most dangerous aspects of them remained
  these are not solutions  but with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local 
 or whether we 're being nice to animals  the most important issues just aren 't being addressed now don 't get me wrong  
 i like animals and i don 't think it 's just fine to industrialize their production
 and to churn them out like they were wrenches  but there 's no way to treat animals
  well when you 're killing ten billion of them a year that 's our number 
 ten billion if you strung all of them chickens cows pigs and lambs to the moon 
 they 'd go there and back five times there and back now my math 's a little shaky but this is this is pretty good and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long but you get the idea 
 that 's just the united states  and with our
  of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease  kindness might just be a bit of a red herring let 's get the numbers
 of the animals we 're killing for eating down and then we 'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left 
 another red herring might be exemplified by the word locavore which was just named word of the year by the new oxford american dictionary seriously
  for those of you who don 't know is someone who eats only locally grown food which is fine if you live in california but for the rest of us it 's a bit of a sad joke  
 between the official story the food pyramid
 and the hip locavore vision you have two versions of how to improve our eating they both get it wrong though
  the first at least is populist and the second is elitist how we got to this place is the history of food in the united states  and i 'm going to go through that at least the last hundred years or so very quickly right now 
 a hundred years ago guess what everyone was a locavore 
 even new york had pig farms nearby  and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion 
 every family had a cook usually a mom 
 and those moms bought and prepared food it was like your
  romantic vision of europe  
 margarine didn 't exist in fact when margarine was invented  several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink so we 'd all know that it was a fake  
 there was no snack food and until the ' 20s until clarence birdseye came along  there was no frozen food  there were no restaurant
  there were neighborhood restaurants run by local people but none of them would think to open another one eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic 
 and fancy food was entirely french 
 as an aside those of you who remember dan aykroyd in 
 doing julia child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide 
 back in those days  before even julia back in those days there was no philosophy
  of food  you just ate you didn 't claim to be anything 
 there was no marketing there were no national brands  vitamins had not been invented  
 there were no health claims at least not federally sanctioned ones fats carbs proteins they weren 't bad or good  they were food  you ate
 food  hardly anything contained more than one ingredient  because it was an ingredient the
  cornflake hadn 't been invented the pop tart the pringle cheez whiz  none of that stuff  goldfish swam 
 it 's hard to imagine people grew food  and they ate food  
 and again everyone ate local in new york an orange was a common christmas present because it came all the way from florida 
 from the ' 30s on road systems expanded trucks took the
  place of railroads fresh food began to travel more oranges became common in new york  
 the south and west became agricultural hubs and in other parts of the country suburbs took over farmland  
 the effects of this are well known they are everywhere  and the death of family farms is part of this puzzle as is
 almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato even in summer
  eventually california produced too much food to ship fresh so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods 
 thus arrived convenience  it was sold to proto feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework now i know everybody over the age of like forty five their mouths are watering at this point 
 if we had a slide of salisbury steak even more so
  but this may have cut down on housework but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well  many of us
 grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd
 lettuce salad i for one and i 'm not kidding
 didn 't eat real spinach or broccoli till i was nineteen who needed it though meat was everywhere what could be easier more filling or healthier
  for your family than broiling a steak  
 but by then cattle were already raised unnaturally  
 rather than spending their lives eating grass for which their stomachs were designed  they were forced to eat soy and corn 
 they have trouble digesting those grains of course but that wasn 't a problem for producers 
 new drugs kept
  they kept them alive healthy was another story 
 thanks to farm subsidies the fine collaboration between agribusiness and congress soy corn and cattle became king and chicken soon joined them on the throne 
 it was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began the thing we 're only realizing just now  listen to
  fifty and two thousand the world 's population doubled meat consumption increased five fold 
 now  someone had to eat all that stuff so we got fast food  
 and this took care of the situation resoundingly  home cooking remained the norm  but its quality was down the tubes  there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts
  because all of them could be bought at any store not that they were any good but they were there 
 most moms cooked like mine a piece of broiled meat a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup  canned fruit salad  
 maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever  minute rice 
 for dessert store bought ice cream or cookies  my mom is not here so i can say this now this kind of cooking
  drove me to learn how to cook for myself it wasn 't all bad by the 
  people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians  we weren 't all hippies either  
 some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook
  food production had become industrial  industrial 
 perhaps because it was being produced rationally as if it were plastic food gained magical or poisonous powers or both 
 many people became fat phobic others worshiped broccoli as if it were god like 
 but mostly they didn 't eat broccoli  
 instead they were sold on yogurt yogurt being almost as good as broccoli except in reality the way the industry sold yogurt was to
  convert it to something much more akin to ice cream similarly let 's look at a granola bar you think that that might be healthy food but in fact if you look at the ingredient list it 's closer in form to a snickers than it is to oatmeal  
 sadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed the
 beginning of the heyday of value added food which contained as many soy
  corn products as could be crammed into it think
 of the frozen chicken nugget  the chicken is fed corn and then its meat is ground up and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder  
 and then it 's fried in corn oil 
 all you do is nuke it what could be better and zapped horribly 
  home cooking was in such a sad state
 that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually
 made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home 
 at the same time masses of women were entering the workforce  and cooking simply wasn 't important enough for men to share the burden
  you 've got your pizza nights you 've got your microwave nights you 've got your grazing nights you 've got your fend for yourself nights and so on 
 leading the way what 's leading the way meat junk food  cheese the very stuff that will kill you 
 so now we clamor for organic food that 's good  
 and as evidence that things can actually change you can now find organic food in supermarkets and even in fast food outlets  but organic food isn 't the answer either at least not the way it 's currently defined
 me pose you a question can farm raised salmon be organic  
 when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet even if the feed itself is supposedly organic and the fish themselves
 are packed tightly in pens swimming in their own filth  and if that salmon 's from chile
  and it 's killed down there and then flown
 five thousand miles  whatever dumping
 how much carbon into the atmosphere i don 't know packed in styrofoam of course  before landing somewhere in the united states  and then being trucked a few hundred 
  more miles this may be organic in letter  but it 's surely not organic in spirit  
  the locavores the organivores the vegetarians the vegans the gourmets
 and those of us who are just plain interested in good food 
 even though we 've come to this from different points we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food 
 we need to start acting  and this is not only an issue of social justice as ann cooper said and of course she 's completely right
 but it 's also one of global survival which bring me full
  circle and points directly to the core issue 
 the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food as i said eighteen percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production 
 how much livestock do you need to produce this 
 seventy percent of the agricultural land on earth thirty percent of the earth 's land surface is directly or indirectly
  devoted to raising the animals we 'll eat 
 and this amount is predicted to double in the next forty years or so  and if the numbers coming in from china are anything like
 what they look like now it 's not going to be forty years  there is no good reason
 for eating as much meat as we do and i say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life the most common argument is that we need nutrients
 even though we eat on average twice as much protein as even
 the industry obsessed usda recommends  but listen  experts who are serious about disease reduction
 recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week what do you think we eat per
  half a pound  
 but don 't we need meat to be big and strong isn 't meat eating essential to health won 't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into
 godless sissy liberals 
 some of us might think that would be a good thing but no 
 even if we were all steroid filled football players the answer is no in fact
  there 's no diet on earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won 't promote growth  
 and many will make you much healthier than ours does  we don 't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition 
 we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition  and it 's killing us 
 to suggest that in the interests of personal and human health americans eat fifty percent less meat it 's not enough of a cut  
 but it 's a start it would seem absurd
 but that 's exactly what should happen 
 and what progressive people forward thinking people should be doing and advocating  
 along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants 
 i 've been writing about food more or less omnivorously one might say indiscriminately for about thirty years 
 during that time i 've eaten and recommended eating just about everything
  'll never stop eating animals i 'm sure  but i do think that for the benefit of everyone the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly
