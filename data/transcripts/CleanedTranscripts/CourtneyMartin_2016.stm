  i 'm a journalist  so i like to look for the untold stories the lives that quietly play out under the scream of headlines  
 i 've also been going about the business of putting down roots  choosing a
  making babies so for the last few years  i 've been trying to understand what constitutes the 
  good life both because i 'm fascinated by the moral and philosophical implications  but also because i 'm in desperate need of answers myself 
 we live in tenuous times  
 in fact for the first time in american history  the majority of parents do not think that their kids will be better off than they were
  this is true of rich and poor men and women 
 now some of you might hear this and feel sad  
 after all america is deeply invested in this idea of economic transcendence 
 that every generation kind of leapfrogs the one before it  earning more buying more being more 
 we 've exported this dream all over the world so kids in brazil and china and even
  kenya inherit our insatiable expectation
 for more  
 but when i read this historic poll for the first time it didn 't actually make me feel sad it felt like a provocation 
 better off based on whose standards 
 is better off finding a secure job that you can count on
 for the rest of your life 
 those are nearly extinct people move jobs on average every four point seven years  
 and it 's estimated that by two thousand and twenty nearly half of americans will be freelancers  
 ok so is better off just a number is it about earning as much as you possibly can 
 by that singular measurement  we are failing  median per capita income has been flat since about two thousand adjusted for inflation
  all right so is better off getting a big house with a white picket fence  
 less of us are doing that 
 nearly five million people lost their homes in the great recession and even more of us sobered up about the lengths we were willing to go or be tricked into going in many predatory cases to hold that deed
  we 're not finding steady employment we 're not earning as much money and we 're not living in big fancy houses  
 toll the funeral bells for everything that made america great 
 but are those the best measurements of a country 's greatness of a life well lived 
 what i think makes america great is its spirit of reinvention
 in the wake of the great recession more and more americans are redefining what better off really means  
 turns out it has more to do with community and creativity than dollars and cents  
 now let me be very clear  the fourteen point eight percent of americans living in poverty need money
  plain and simple 
 and all of us need policies that protect us from exploitation by employers and financial institutions nothing that follows is meant to suggest that 
  the gap between rich and poor is anything but profoundly immoral 
  part of what i 've learned in my research and reporting
 is that the art of living well is often practiced most masterfully by the most vulnerable 
 now  if necessity is the mother of invention  i 've come to believe
 that
 recession can be the father of consciousness
  it confronts us with profound questions questions we might be too lazy or distracted to ask in times of relative comfort  
 how should we work how should we live 
 all of us  whether we realize it or not seek answers to these questions with our ancestors kind of whispering in our ears 
 my
 was a drunk in detroit who sometimes managed to hold down a factory job he had as
  unbelievable as it might sound twenty one children with one woman my great grandmother who died at forty seven years old of ovarian cancer  
 now i 'm pregnant with my second child and i cannot even fathom
 what she must have gone through and if you 're trying to do the math there were six sets of twins
  my grandfather their son  
 became a traveling salesman and he lived boom and bust so my dad grew up answering the door for debt collectors and pretending his parents weren 't home 
 he actually took his braces off himself with pliers in the garage when his father admitted he didn 't have money to go back to the orthodontist  
 so my dad unsurprisingly  became a
  couldn 't write this in a novel right
  he was obsessed with providing a secure foundation for my brother and i 
 so i ask these questions by way of a few generations of struggle 
 my parents made sure that i grew up on a kind of steady ground that allows one to question and risk and leap 
 and ironically and probably sometimes to their frustration it is their steadfast commitment to security that allows me to question its value
  or at least its value as we 've historically defined it in the 21st century
  so let 's dig into this first question how should we work  
 we should work
 like our mothers that 's right we 've spent decades trying to fit women into a work world built for
  but others have carved a more unconventional path  
 creating a patchwork of meaning and money with enough flexibility to do what they need to do for those that they love 
 my mom called it just making it work today i hear life coaches call it a portfolio career 
 whatever you call it more and more men are craving these
  if not harried lives they 're waking up to their desire and duty to be present fathers and sons  
 now artist ann hamilton has said labor is a way of knowing 
 labor is a way of knowing in other words what we work on
 is what we understand about the world  
 if this is true and i think it is then women who have disproportionately cared for the little ones and the sick ones and the aging ones have disproportionately
 benefited
 from the most profound kind of knowing there is knowing the human condition 
 by prioritizing care men are in a sense staking their claim to the full range of human existence  
 now  this means the nine to five no longer works for anyone
  punch clocks are becoming obsolete as are career ladders whole industries are being born and dying every day  it 's all nonlinear from here  
 so we need to stop asking kids what do you want to be when you grow up and start asking them how do you want to be when you grow up 
 their work will constantly change the common denominator is them  so the more they understand their gifts and create crews of ideal
  the better off they will be 
 the challenge ahead is to reinvent the social safety net to fit this increasingly fragmented economy  we need portable health benefits we need policies that reflect that 
  everyone deserves to be vulnerable or care for vulnerable others without becoming destitute we need to seriously consider a universal basic income we need to reinvent labor organizing  
  archaic idea about bringing home the bacon is long overdue
 just ask your mother now how about the second question how should we live  we should live
 like our immigrant ancestors
  when they came to america they often shared apartments  survival tactics child care always knew how to fill one more belly no matter how small the
  food available
  but they were told that success meant leaving the village behind and pursuing that iconic symbol of the american dream the white picket fence 
 and even today we see a white picket fence and we think success 
 but when you strip away the sentimentality what it really does is divides us 
  many americans are rejecting the white picket fence and the kind of highly privatized life that happened within it 
 and reclaiming village life reclaiming interdependence instead  
 fifty million of us for example live in intergenerational households
  this number exploded with the great recession  but it turns out people actually like living this way two thirds of those who are living with multiple generations under one roof
  say it 's improved their relationships 
 some people are choosing to share homes not with family but with other people who understand the health and economic benefits of daily community 
 coabode an online platform for single moms looking to share homes with other single moms has fifty thousand users  
 and people over sixty five are especially prone to be looking for these alternative living arrangements 
 they understand that their quality of life depends on a mix of solitude
 and solidarity  
 which is true of all of us when you think about it young and old alike for too long we 've pretended that happiness is a king in his castle 
 but all the research proves otherwise  it shows that the healthiest happiest and even safest in terms of both
 climate change
  in terms of crime all of that are americans who live lives intertwined with their neighbors  
 now i 've experienced this firsthand 
 for the last few years i 've been living in a cohousing community  it 's one point five acres of persimmon trees 
 this prolific blackberry bush that snakes around a community garden all smack dab by the way in the middle of urban oakland  
 the nine units are all built to be different different sizes different shapes  but they 're meant to be as green as possible
  so big shiny black solar cells on our roof mean our electricity bill rarely exceeds more than five bucks in a month 
 the twenty five of us who live there are all different ages and political persuasions and professions and we live in homes that have everything a typical home would have 
 but additionally we share an  industrial sized kitchen and eating area where we have common meals twice
  when i tell them i live like this often have one of two extreme reactions either they say why doesn 't everyone live like this or they say that sounds
 totally horrifying i would never want to do that so let me reassure you there is a sacred respect for privacy among us  
 but also a commitment to what we call radical hospitality 
 not the kind advertised by the four seasons but the kind that says that every single person is worthy of
  kindness full stop end of sentence  
 the biggest surprise for me of living in a community like this 
 you share all the domestic labor the repairing the cooking the weeding but you also share the emotional labor 
 rather than depending only on the idealized family unit to get all of your emotional needs met you have two dozen other
 people that you can go to to talk about a hard day at work or troubleshoot how to handle an abusive teacher  teenagers in our community will often go to 
  an adult that is not their parent to ask for advice  it 's what bell hooks called revolutionary parenting this humble acknowledgment
 that kids are healthier when they have a wider range of adults to emulate and count on 
  's a lot of pressure trying to be that perfect family behind that white picket fence  
 the new better off as i 've come to call it is less about investing in the perfect family and more about investing in the imperfect village  
 whether that 's relatives living under one roof a cohousing community like mine or just a bunch of neighbors who pledge to really know and look out for one another  
 it 's good common sense right
 and yet money has often made us dumb about reaching out  
 the most reliable wealth is found in relationship  
 the new better off is not an individual prospect at all  
 in fact if you 're a failure or you think you 're a failure i 've got some good news for you you might be a success by standards you have not yet honored
  mediocre earner but a masterful father  maybe you can 't afford your dream home but you throw legendary neighborhood parties 
 if you 're a textbook success the implications of what i 'm saying could be more grim for you 
 you might be a failure by standards you hold dear but that the world doesn
  only you can know  i know that i am not a tribute to my 
 who lived such a short and brutish life if i earn enough money to afford every creature comfort  
 you can 't buy your way out of suffering or into meaning there is no home big enough to erase the pain that she must have endured 
 i am a tribute to her if i live a life as connected and courageous as possible
 in the midst of such widespread uncertainty we may in fact be insecure  
 but we can let that insecurity make us brittle or supple 
 we can turn inward  lose faith in the power of institutions to change even lose faith in ourselves or we can turn
  cultivate faith in our ability to reach out to connect to create  turns out the biggest danger
 is not failing to achieve the american dream  the biggest danger is achieving a dream that you don 't actually believe in 
 so don 't do that 
 do the harder more interesting thing  which is to compose a life where what you do every single day  the people you give your best
  love and ingenuity and energy to aligns as closely as possible with what you believe 
 that not something as mundane as making money is a tribute to your ancestors that is the beautiful struggle
