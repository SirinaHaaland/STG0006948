  i decided when i was asked to do this that what i really wanted to talk about was my friend richard feynman 
 i was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him and enjoyed his presence and i 'm going to tell
  the richard feynman that i knew  
 i 'm sure there are people here who could tell you about the richard feynman they knew and it would probably be a different richard feynman richard feynman was a very complex man
  he was a man of many many parts he was of course  foremost a very very very great scientist  
 he was an actor  you saw him act i also had the good fortune to be in those lectures up in the
  they were fantastic  he was a philosopher  he was a drum player  he was a teacher par excellence 
 richard feynman was also a showman an enormous showman  he was brash  irreverent  
 he was full of macho a kind of macho
  a lot of room at the bottom  and what i mean by that is a lot of room in my case i can 't speak for anybody else 
 but in my case a lot of room for another big ego  well not as big as his but
 fairly big i always felt good with dick feynman
  it was always fun to be with him  
 he always made me feel smart  how can somebody like that make you feel smart somehow he did he made me feel smart he made me feel he was smart  he made me feel we were both smart  and the two of us could solve any problem whatever
 and in fact we did sometimes do physics together we never published a paper together  but we did have a lot of fun
  he loved to win 
 win these little macho games we would sometimes play and he didn 't only play them with me but with all sorts of people he would almost always win  
 but when he didn 't win when he lost 
 he would laugh and seem to have just as much fun as if he had won 
 i remember once he told me a story about a joke the students played on him
  they took him for lunch to a sandwich place in pasadena it may still exist i don 't know 
 celebrity sandwiches was their thing  you could get a marilyn monroe sandwich you could get a humphrey bogart sandwich 
 the students went there in advance  and arranged that they
  all order feynman sandwiches one after another they came in and ordered feynman sandwiches feynman loved this story he told me this story and he was really happy and
 laughing when he finished the story  
 i said to him dick i wonder what would be the difference between a feynman sandwich and a susskind sandwich 
 and without skipping a beat at all he said 
  be about the same the only difference is a susskind sandwich would have a lot more ham
 well  i happened to have been very quick that day and i said yeah but a lot less baloney 
 the truth of the matter is that a feynman sandwich had a load of ham  but absolutely no
  a couple of times up in san francisco at some very rich guy 's house up in san francisco for dinner
  and the last time the rich guy invited us he also invited a couple of philosophers these guys were philosophers of mind 
 their specialty was the philosophy of consciousness  and they were full of all kinds of jargon i 'm trying to remember the words
 monism dualism categories all over the place i didn 't know what those meant neither did dick or sydney for that matter  and what did we talk
  what do you talk about when you talk about minds there 's one obvious thing to talk about can a machine become a mind 
 can you build a machine that thinks like a human being that is conscious 
 we sat around and talked about this we of course never resolved it  but the trouble with the philosophers is that they were philosophizing when they should have been
  a scientific question after all and this was a very very dangerous thing to do around dick feynman
 feynman let them have it both barrels right between the eyes it was brutal it was funny ooh it was funny  but
 it was really brutal he really popped their balloon  
 but the amazing thing was feynman had to leave a little early he wasn 't feeling too well  so he left a little bit early  and sidney and i were left there with the two philosophers  
 and the amazing thing is these guys were
  flying they were so happy  
 they had met the great man  they had been instructed by the great man  they had an enormous amount of fun having their faces shoved in the mud  
 and
 it was something special i realized there was something just extraordinary about feynman
 even when he did what he did
  dick he was my friend i did call him dick
 dick and i had a little bit of a rapport i think it may have been a special rapport that he and i had we liked each other we liked the same kind of things  i also like the intellectual macho games 
 sometimes i would win mostly he would win but we both enjoyed them  
 and dick became convinced at some point that he and i had some kind of similarity of
  personality  
 i don 't think he was right i think the only point of similarity between us is we both like to talk about ourselves  
 but he was convinced of this  and the man was incredibly curious  and he wanted to understand what it was and why it was
 that that there was this funny connection 
  the reason he called me leonardo is because we were in europe and he was practicing his french 
 and he said leonardo were you closer to your mother or your father when you were a kid
  he was a working man had a fifth grade education  he was a master mechanic and he taught me how to use tools he taught me
 all sorts of things about mechanical things he even taught me the pythagorean theorem he didn 't call it the hypotenuse  he called it the shortcut distance 
 and
 feynman 's eyes just
  he went off like a lightbulb  
 and he said that he had had basically exactly the same relationship with his father 
 in fact he had been convinced at one time that to be a good
 physicist  it was very important to have had that kind of relationship with your father  i apologize for the sexist
 conversation here but this is the way it really happened
  said he had been absolutely convinced that this was necessary a necessary part of
 the growing up of a young physicist  
 being dick he of course wanted to check this he wanted to go out and do an experiment well 
 he did  he went out and did an experiment he asked all his friends that he thought were good physicists was it your mom or your pop that influenced you
  there went that theory down the trash can of history but he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience
 with his  father as he had with his father  and for some time he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well  i don 't know
  who knows but let me tell you a little bit about feynman the physicist  
 feynman 's style
 no style is not the right word style makes you think of the bow tie he might have worn or the suit he was wearing it 's something much deeper than that
 but i can 't think of another word for it feynman 's scientific style was always to look for the simplest 
 most elementary solution to a problem that was possible  if it wasn 't
  possible you had to use something fancier
  no doubt part of this was his great joy and pleasure in showing people that he could think more simply than they could 
 but he also deeply believed he truly believed that if you couldn 't explain something simply you didn 't understand it 
  people were trying to figure out how superfluid helium worked 
 there was a theory  it was due to a russian mathematical physicist it was a complicated theory i 'll tell you what it was soon enough 
 it was a terribly complicated theory full of very difficult integrals and formulas and mathematics and so forth
 and it sort of worked but it didn 't work very well the only way it worked is when the helium atoms were very very far apart
  unfortunately the helium atoms in liquid helium are right on top of each other feynman decided as a sort of amateur helium physicist that he would try to figure it out
 he had an idea a very clear idea  he would try to figure out what the quantum wave function of this huge number of atoms looked like he would try to visualize
  guided by a small number of simple principles 
 the small number of simple principles were very very simple the first one was that when helium atoms touch each other  they repel  the implication of that is that the wave function has to go to zero it has to vanish when the helium atoms touch each other  
 the other fact is that in the ground state the lowest energy state of a quantum system the wave function is always very
  has the minimum number of wiggles so he sat down and i imagine he had nothing more than a simple piece of paper and a pencil
 and he tried to write down and did write down the simplest function that he could think of 
 which had the boundary conditions that the wave function vanish when things touch and is smooth in between 
 he wrote down a simple thing so simple in fact  that i suspect a
  student who didn 't even have calculus could understand what he wrote down 
 the thing was that simple thing that he wrote down explained everything that was known at the time about liquid helium and then some  
 i 've always wondered
 whether the professionals the real professional helium physicists were just a little bit embarrassed by this  they had their 
 technique and they
  in my own university i wasn 't there at the time 
 they were exploring the structure of the proton the proton is obviously made of a whole bunch of little particles this was more or less known  
 and the way to analyze it was of course feynman
  diagrams that 's what feynman diagrams were constructed for to understand particles 
 the experiments that were going on were very simple  you simply take the proton and you hit it really sharply with an electron this was the thing the feynman diagrams were for 
 the only problem was that feynman diagrams are complicated they 're difficult
  if you could do all of them you would have a very precise theory but you couldn 't they were just too complicated 
 people were trying to do them you could do a one loop diagram don 't worry about one loop one loop two loops maybe you could do a three loop diagram but beyond that you couldn 't do anything feynman said forget all of that 
 just think of the proton as an assemblage
  moving real fast because they 're moving real fast  
 relativity says the internal motions go very slow  
 the electron hits it suddenly it 's like taking a very sudden snapshot of the proton  
 what do you see you see a frozen bunch of partons  they don 't move and because they don 't move during the course of the experiment
  you don 't have to worry about how they 're moving  you don 't have to worry about the forces between them  
 you just get to think of it as a population of frozen partons 
 this was the key to analyzing these experiments extremely effective
 somebody said the word revolution is a bad
  but it certainly evolved
 very very deeply our understanding of the of the proton  and of particles beyond that 
 well i had some more that i was going to tell you about my connection with feynman what he was like but i see i have exactly half a minute 
 so i think i 'll just finish up by saying  i actually don 't think feynman would have liked this event  i think he would have said
  but how should we honor feynman how should we really honor feynman  i think the answer is we should honor feynman
 by getting as much baloney out of our own sandwiches as we can thank you
