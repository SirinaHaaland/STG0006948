  from all outward appearances john had everything going for him 
 he had just signed the contract to sell his new york apartment at a six figure profit  and he 'd only owned it for five years 
 the school where he graduated from with his master 's had just
  offered him a teaching appointment  which meant not only a salary  but benefits for the first time in ages  
 and yet despite everything going really well for john he was struggling  fighting addiction
 and a gripping depression 
 on the night of june 11th two thousand and three he climbed up to the edge of the fence on the manhattan bridge
  and he leaped to the treacherous waters below  
 remarkably no  miraculously he lived 
 the fall shattered his right arm  broke every rib that he had punctured his lung
  and he drifted in and out of consciousness as he drifted down the east river under the brooklyn bridge and
  out into the pathway of the staten island ferry where passengers on the ferry
 heard his cries of pain contacted the boat 's captain who contacted the coast guard who fished him out of the east river
 and took him to bellevue hospital and
 that 's actually where our story begins because once john committed himself to putting his life back together
 first physically
 then emotionally  and then spiritually
 he found that there were very few resources available to someone who has attempted to end their life in the way that he did
  research shows that nineteen out of twenty people who attempt suicide will fail 
 but the people who fail are
  more likely to succeed the second time this truly is an  at risk population
 with very few resources to support them 
 and what happens when people try to assemble themselves back into life because of our taboos around suicide we 're not sure what to
  and so quite often we say nothing and that furthers the isolation that people like john found themselves in 
 i know john 's story very well because i 'm john 
 and this is today the first time in any sort of public setting i 've ever acknowledged the journey that i have been
  but after having lost a beloved teacher in two thousand and six and a good friend last year to suicide  
 and sitting last year at tedactive i knew that i needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos
 to talk about an idea worth spreading
 and that is that people who have made the the difficult choice to come back to life
 need more resources
  and need our help 
 as the trevor project says it gets better  it gets way better  
 and i 'm choosing to come out of a totally different kind of closet today
 to encourage you to urge you that if you are someone who has contemplated or
  or you know somebody who has talk about it get help  it 's a conversation
 worth having and an idea worth spreading thank you
