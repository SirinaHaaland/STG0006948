  it began with one question 
 if africa was a bar  what would your country be drinking or doing 
 i kicked it off with a guess about south africa  which wasn 't exactly according to the rules because
 south africa 's
  not my country  
 but alluding to the country 's continual attempts to build a postracial society after being ravaged for decades by apartheid  
 i tweeted
 south africa would be drinking all kinds of alcohol and begging them to get along in its stomach 
  and then i waited and then i had that funny feeling where i wondered if i crossed the line so i sent out a few other tweets about my own country
 and a few other african countries i 'm familiar with and then i waited again but this time i read through almost every tweet i had ever tweeted
 to convince myself no to remind myself that i 'm really funny
 and that if nobody gets it that 's fine
  i didn 't have to do that for very long very soon  people were participating 
 in fact by the end of that week in july the hashtag 
 would have garnered around sixty thousand tweets lit up the continent
 and made its way to publications all over the world people were using the hashtag to do many different things
  to poke fun at their stereotypes
  and also to make fun of the countries that don 't think that they 're in africa
  but most importantly people were using the hashtag to connect  people were connecting over 
 so for one week in july twitter became a real
  and i was really thrilled  mainly because i realized that
  could work that we had before us between us at our fingertips
 a platform that just needed a small spark
 to light in us a hunger for each other my name is
  by birth
 because my parents are from two different african countries 
 my father 's from a country called botswana in southern africa it
 's only slightly bigger than germany this year we celebrate our  50th year of stable democracy 
 and it has some very progressive social policies 
 my mother 's country
 is the kingdom of swaziland
  country also in southern africa it is africa 's last complete monarchy  
 so it 's been ruled by a king and a royal family in line with their tradition for a very long time 
 on paper these countries seem very different  and when i was a kid  i could see the difference it rained a lot in one
  it didn 't rain quite as much in the other  but outside of that i didn 't really realize why it mattered that my parents were from two different places  
 but it would go on to have a very peculiar effect on me you see i was born in one country and raised in the other 
 when we moved to botswana 
 i was a toddler who spoke fluent siswati and nothing else  so i was being introduced to my new home my new cultural identity
 as a complete outsider  
 incapable of comprehending anything that was being said to me by the family and country whose traditions i was meant to move forward  
 but very soon  i would
 shed siswati and when i would go back to swaziland  i would be constantly confronted by how very
  i was becoming  add to that my entry into africa 's private school system whose entire purpose is to beat the africanness out of you 
 and i would have a very peculiar adolescence  but i think
 that my interest in ideas of identity was born here in the strange intersection of
 belonging to two places at once but not really belonging to either one very well and belonging to this vast space in
  between and around simultaneously  
 i became obsessed with the idea of a shared african identity  
 since then i have continued to read about politics and geography and identity and what all those things mean i 've also held on to a deep curiosity about african
  when i began to read i gravitated towards the works of black intellectuals like steve biko and frantz fanon who tackled complex ideas like decolonization and black consciousness  
 and when i thought at fourteen that i had digested these grand ideas  
 i moved on to the speeches of iconic african statesmen like burkina faso 's thomas sankara
 and congo 's patrice lumumba i read every piece of african fiction that
  could get my hands on 
 so when twitter came  i hopped on with the enthusiasm of a teenage girl whose friends are super super bored
 of hearing about all this random stuff the year was two thousand and eleven and all over southern africa and the whole continent affordable data
  packages for smartphones and internet surfing became much easier to get  
 so my generation we were sending messages to each other on this platform
 that just needed one hundred and forty characters and a little bit of creativity on long commutes to work 
 in lectures that some of us should have been paying attention to on our lunch breaks  we would communicate as much as we could about the everyday realities of being young and african 
 but of course this luxury
  was not available to everybody  
 so this meant that if you were a teenage girl in botswana and you wanted to have fun on the internet one you had to tweet in english two you had to follow 
  more than just the three other people you knew online you had to follow south africans zimbabweans ghanaians nigerians
  and suddenly your whole world opened up 
 and my whole world did open up 
 i followed vibrant africans who were travelling around the continent taking pictures of themselves and posting them under the hashtag # myafrica 
 because at that time  if you were to search africa on twitter or on google or any kind of social media 
 you would think that the entire continent was just pictures of animals and white guys drinking cocktails in hotel resorts
 but africans were using this platform to take some kind of ownership of the tourism sectors it was africans taking selfies on the beaches of nigeria it was africans in cocktail bars in nairobi  
 and these were the same africans that i began to meet in my own travels around the continent we would discuss african literature politics
 economic policy
  but almost invariably every single time  we would end up discussing twitter 
 and that 's when i realized what this was 
 we were standing in the middle of something amazing because for the first time ever young africans could discuss the future of our continent
  without the restriction of borders  finances and watchful governments  because the little known truth is many africans know a lot less about other african countries than some westerners might know about africa as a whole 
 this is by accident  but sometimes it 's by design 
 for example in apartheid south africa  black south africans were constantly being bombarded with this message that any country ruled by black people was destined for failure
 and this was done to convince them that they were much better off under crushing white rule than they were living in a black and free nation  
 add to that africa 's colonial  archaic education system which has been unthinkingly carried over from the 
 and at the age of fifteen  i could name all the various causes of the wars that
  had happened in europe in the past two hundred years  but i couldn 't name the president of my neighboring country 
 and to me this doesn 't make any sense because whether we like it or not the fates of african people are deeply intertwined 
 when disaster hits  when turmoil hits  we share the
  when burundians flee political turmoil 
 they go to us to other african countries africa has six of the world 's largest refugee centers  
 what was once a a burundian problem
 becomes an african problem so to me  
 there are no sudanese problems or south african problems or kenyan problems only african problems because eventually we share the turmoil  
 so if we share the problems
  doing a better job of sharing the successes 
 how can we do that well in the long term  we can shoot towards increasing inter african trade removing borders and putting pressure on leaders to fulfill regional agreements they 've already signed  
 but i think
 that the biggest way for africa to share its successes
  i 'm not inventing anything totally new here  
 but political pan africanism is usually the african unity of the political elite 
 and who does that benefit well african leaders almost exclusively 
 no what i 'm talking about
 is the
  of the ordinary african 
 young africans like me  we are bursting with creative energy with innovative ideas  
 but with bad governance and shaky institutions all of this potential could go to waste 
 on a continent where more than a handful of leaders have been in power longer than the majority of the populations has been alive  
 we are in desperate need of something new something that
  works  and i think that thing is social
 my dream
 is that young africans stop allowing borders and circumstance to suffocate our innovation 
 my dream is that when a young african comes up with something brilliant they don
  this wouldn 't work in my country and then give up my dream
 is that young africans begin to realize that the entire continent is our canvas is our home 
 using the internet  we can begin to think collaboratively  we can begin to innovate together 
 in africa we say if you want to go fast you go alone  but if you want to go far you go together and i believe that social
 pan africanism is how we can go far together
  and this is already happening  access to these online networks has given young africans something we 've always had to violently take 
 a voice we now have a platform before now  if you wanted to hear from the youth in africa you waited for the
  wake up in the morning take his heartburn medication
 and then tell you the plans he has for your generation in twenty years time  
 before now if you wanted to be heard by your possibly tyrannical government 
 you were pushed to protest suffer the consequences and have your fingers crossed that some western paper somewhere might make someone care
 but now we have opportunities to back each other up in ways we never could before  
 we support south african students who are marching against ridiculously high tertiary fees  we support zimbabwean women who are marching to parliament  we support angolan journalists who are being illegally detained 
 for the first time ever
  african pain
 and african aspiration
 has the ability to be witnessed by those who can empathize with it the most 
 other africans i believe that with a social pan africanist thinking and using the internet as a tool  
 we can begin to rescue each other and ultimately to rescue ourselves  thank you
