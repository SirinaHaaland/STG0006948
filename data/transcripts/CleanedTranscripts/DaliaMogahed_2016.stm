  what do you think when you look at me a woman of faith an expert  maybe even a sister or
 oppressed  brainwashed a terrorist or just an airport security
  line delay that one 's actually true 
 if some of your perceptions were negative i don 't really blame you that 's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me 
 one study found that eighty percent of news coverage about islam and muslims is negative  
 and studies show that americans say that most don 't know a muslim  
 i guess people don 't talk to their uber drivers
 well for those of you who have never met a muslim  it 's great to meet you 
 let me tell you who i am  
 i 'm a mom a coffee lover double espresso cream on the side  i 'm an introvert
  i 'm a wannabe fitness fanatic  and i 'm a practicing spiritual muslim  
 but not like lady gaga says because baby i wasn 't born this way  it was a choice  
 when i was seventeen  i decided to come out no
 not as a gay person like some of my friends  but as a muslim  and decided to start wearing the hijab my head covering 
 my feminist
  friends were aghast why are you oppressing yourself 
 the funny thing was it was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence
 from the pressure i felt as a 
 to conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty i didn 't just passively accept
 the faith of my parents  i wrestled with the quran i read and reflected and questioned and doubted
 and ultimately believed my relationship with god it was not love at first sight  
 it was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every reading
 its rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears  i see myself in it i feel that god knows me 
 have you ever felt like someone sees you completely understands you
 and yet loves you anyway that 's how it feels  and so later  i got married  and like all good egyptians
  started my career as an engineer 
 i later had a child after getting married and i was living essentially the 
  dream  
 and then that terrible morning of september two thousand and one i think a lot
  of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning 
 i was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast and i look up on the screen and see the words breaking news 
 there was smoke  airplanes flying into buildings people jumping out of buildings  what was this an accident
  malfunction 
 my shock quickly turned to outrage who would do this and i switch the channel and i hear
  not only had my country been attacked  
 but in a flash somebody else 's actions had turned me from a citizen to a suspect  
 that same day we had to drive across middle america to move to a new city to start grad school
  and i remember sitting in the passenger seat as we drove in silence  
 crouched as low as i could go in my seat for the first time in my life afraid for anyone to know i was a muslim 
 we moved into our apartment that night in a new town in what felt like a completely different world 
 and then i was hearing and
  i stayed inside all week  
 and then it was friday that same week the day that muslims congregate for worship  
 and again the warnings were don 't go that first friday it could be a target 
  watching the news wall to wall coverage emotions were so raw  understandably  and i was also hearing about attacks on muslims 
 or people who were perceived to be muslim being pulled out and beaten in the street mosques were actually firebombed  and i thought we should just stay home  
 and yet  something didn 't feel
  because those people who attacked our country attacked our country  
 i get it that people were angry at the terrorists  guess what so was i 
 and so to have to explain yourself all the time isn 't easy  
 i don 't mind questions  i love questions  it 's the accusations that are tough 
 today we hear people actually saying things like
  there 's a problem in this country and it 's called muslims when are we going to get rid of them 
 so some people want to ban muslims and close down mosques 
 they talk about my community kind of like we 're a tumor in the body of america and the only question is are we malignant or benign 
 you know a malignant tumor you extract
  and a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance 
 the choices don 't make sense because it 's the wrong question muslims like all other americans aren 't a tumor in the body of america
 and olympic athletes  now is closing down mosques going to make america safer it might free up some parking spots  
 but it will not end terrorism 
 going to a mosque regularly is actually linked to having more tolerant views of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement
  and as one police chief in the washington dc area recently told me people don 't actually get radicalized at mosques they get radicalized in their basement or bedroom in front of a computer 
 and what you find about the radicalization process is it starts online but the first thing that happens is the person gets cut off from their community 
  from even their family  so that the extremist group can brainwash them into believing that they
 the terrorists are the true muslims and everyone else who abhors their behavior and ideology are sellouts or apostates  
 so if we want to prevent radicalization we have to keep people going to the mosque 
 now some will still argue islam is a violent
  after all a group like isis bases its brutality on the quran  
 now as a muslim as a mother as a human being i think we need to do everything we can to stop a group like isis  
 but
 we would be giving in to their narrative if we cast them as representatives of a faith of one point six billion
  isis has as much to do with islam as the ku klux klan has to do with christianity 
 both groups claim to base their ideology on their holy book  
 but when you look at them they 're not motivated
 by what they read in their holy book  it 's their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture 
 recently a prominent imam told me a story that really took me aback he said that a girl came to him because she was thinking of going to join isis  
 and i was i was really surprised and asked him had she been in contact with a radical religious leader and he said the problem was quite the opposite
 that every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down and said that her rage her sense of injustice in the world was just going to get her in trouble  
 and so with nowhere to channel and make sense of this anger she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution 
 what this imam did was to connect her back to god and to her community he didn 't shame her for her rage
  rage
 instead he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world 
 what she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join isis 
 i 've told you a little bit about how islamophobia affects me and my family  but how does it impact ordinary americans how does it impact everyone
  a day affect the health of our democracy the health of our free thought  
 well one study actually several studies in neuroscience show that when we 're afraid at least three things happen 
 we become more accepting of authoritarianism  conformity and prejudice  
 one study showed that when subjects were exposed to news stories
 that were negative about muslims  they became more accepting of military attacks on muslim countries
 and policies that curtail the rights of american muslims  now this isn 't just academic 
 when you look at when anti muslim sentiment spiked
 between two thousand and one and two thousand and thirteen  it happened three times  but it wasn 't around
  attacks it was in the run up to the iraq war and during two election cycles  
 so islamophobia isn 't just the natural response to muslim terrorism as i would would have expected 
 it can actually be a tool of public manipulation  
 eroding the very foundation
  muslims are like canaries in the coal mine 
 we might be the first to feel it but the toxic air of fear is harming us all 
 and assigning collective guilt isn 't just about having to explain yourself all the time
 deah and his wife yusor were a young married couple living in chapel hill north carolina where they both went to school
 deah was an athlete he was in dental school  talented promising and
 his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest most generous human being she
  she was visiting him there
 and he showed her his resume and she was amazed she said when did my baby brother become such an accomplished young man 
 just a few weeks after suzanne 's visit to her brother and his new wife their neighbor  
 craig stephen hicks  murdered them as well as yusor 's sister
  who was visiting for the afternoon in their apartment  
 execution style after posting anti muslim statements on his facebook page 
 he shot  deah eight times  
 so bigotry isn 't just immoral it can even be lethal 
 so back to my story what happened after nine eleven did we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay
  we talked it over  and it might seem like a small decision but to us it was about what kind of america we wanted to leave for our kids one that would control
 us by fear or one where we were
 practicing our religion freely  so we decided to go to the mosque and we
 put my son in his car seat buckled him in and we drove silently intensely to the mosque
  i took him out i took off my shoes i walked into the prayer hall
 and what i saw made me stop 
 the place was completely full  and then the imam made an announcement thanking
 and welcoming our guests because half the congregation
 were christians jews buddhists  atheists people of faith and
  come not to attack us  but to stand in solidarity with us 
 i just break down at this time 
 these people were there because they chose courage and compassion over panic and prejudice
  what will you choose what will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry 
 will you play it safe or will you join those who say we are better than that thank you
  what would you say to those who might argue that you 're giving a ted talk you 're clearly a deep thinker  you
 work at a fancy think tank you 're an exception you 're not the rule what would you say to those people
 i would say don 't let this stage distract you i 'm completely ordinary 
 i 'm not an exception
 my story is not unusual i am as as ordinary as they come when you look at muslims around the world and i 've done this i 've done the largest study ever done on muslims around the world
 people want ordinary things they want prosperity for their family they want
  jobs and they want to live in peace  so i am not in any way an exception when you meet people who seem like an exception to the rule  oftentimes it 's that the rule is broken 
 not that they 're an exception
