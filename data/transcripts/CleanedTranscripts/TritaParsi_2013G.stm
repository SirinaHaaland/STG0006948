  israel 's best friend  and we do not intend to change our position in relation to tehran 
 believe it or not this is a quote from an israeli prime minister but it 's
  or golda meir from the era of the shah it 's actually from yitzhak rabin  the year is 
 ayatollah khomeini is still alive and much like ahmadinejad today he 's using the worst rhetoric against israel yet 
 rabin referred to iran as a geostrategic friend 
 today when we hear the threats of war and the
  're oftentimes led to believe that this is yet another one of those unsolvable middle eastern conflicts with roots as old as the region itself  
 nothing
 could be further from the truth  
 and i hope today to show you why that is 
 the relations between the iranian and the jewish people throughout history has actually been quite positive  starting in
  when king cyrus the great of persia liberated the jewish people from their babylonian captivity 
 a third of the jewish population stayed in babylonia 
 they 're today 's iraqi jews a third migrated to persia 
 they 're today 's iranian jews still twenty five thousand of them living in iran making them the largest jewish community in the middle east outside
  and a third returned to historic palestine did the second rebuilding of the temple in jerusalem  financed  incidentally 
 by persian tax money  
 but even in modern times  relations have been close at times rabin 's statement was a reflection
 of decades of security and intelligence collaboration between the two which in turn
 was born out of perception of common threats
 both states feared the soviet union
 and strong arab states such as egypt and iraq 
 and in addition  the israeli doctrine of the periphery the idea that israel 's security was best achieved
 by creating alliances
 with the non arab states in the periphery of the region in order to balance the arab states
  in its vicinity now from the shah 's perspective though he wanted to keep this as secret as possible
  so when yitzhak rabin for instance traveled to iran in the ' 70s he usually wore a wig
 so that no one would recognize him  the iranians built a special tarmac at the airport in tehran far
 far away from the central terminal  so that no one would notice the large number of israeli planes shuttling between tel aviv and tehran 
 now did all of this end with the islamic revolution in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine 
 in spite of the very clear anti israeli ideology of the new regime 
 the geopolitical logic for their collaboration lived on 
 because they still had common threats  and when iraq invaded iran in
  eighty israel feared an iraqi victory
 and actively helped iran by selling it arms and providing it with spare parts for iran 's american weaponry
 at a moment when iran was very vulnerable
 because of an american arms embargo that israel was more than happy to violate in
  it was israel
 that lobbied washington to talk to iran to sell arms to iran and not pay attention
 to iran 's anti israeli ideology  
 and this of course climaxed in the iran contra scandal of the 1980s 
 but with the end of the cold war
 came also the end of
  the two common threats that had pushed them closer together throughout decades more or less evaporated 
 the soviet union collapsed iraq was defeated  and a new environment was created in the region in which both of them felt more secure  
 but they were also now left unchecked  
 without iraq balancing iran iran could now become a threat some in israel argued 
  fact  the current dynamic that you see between iran and israel
 has its roots more so
 in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region after the cold war than in the events of one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine 
 because at this point iran and israel emerge as two of the most powerful states in the region  
  and rather than viewing each other as potential security partners they increasingly came to view each other as rivals
 and competitors so israel who in the  1980s lobbied for and improved u s iran relations
 now feared a u s iran rapprochement  
 thinking that it would come at israel 's security interests  ' expense  and instead sought to
 put iran in increased isolation  ironically this was
  happening at a time when iran was more interested in peacemaking with washington
 than to see to israel 's destruction 
 iran had put itself in isolation because of its radicalism 
 and after having helped the united states indirectly in the war against iraq in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one 
 the iranians were hoping that they would be rewarded by being included
  architecture of the region but washington chose to ignore
 iran 's outreach as it would a decade later in afghanistan  and instead moved to intensify iran 's isolation  and it is at this point
  whatever they did even if they moderated their policies the u s would continue to seek iran 's isolation  
 and the only way iran could compel washington to change its position
 was by imposing a cost on the u s if it didn 't the easiest target
 was the peace process
  and now the iranian ideological bark was to be accompanied by a nonconventional
 bite  and iran began supporting extensively
 palestinian islamist groups that it previously had shunned 
 in some ways this sounds paradoxical  but according to martin indyk
 of the clinton administration  the iranians had not gotten it entirely wrong because the more peace there would be between israel
  and palestine 
 the u s believed the more iran would get isolated  
 the more iran got isolated  the more peace there would be 
 so according to indyk and these are his words  the iranians had an interest to do us in on the peace process
 in order to defeat our policy of containment to defeat our policy of containment not about ideology
  but throughout even the worst times of their entanglement all sides have reached out to each other  
 netanyahu when he got elected in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six reached out to the iranians to see if there were any ways that the doctrine of the periphery could be resurrected 
 tehran was not interested a
  the iranians sent a comprehensive negotiation proposal to the bush administration 
 a proposal that revealed that there was some potential of getting iran and israel back on terms again 
 the bush administration did not even respond  all sides have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity
 but this is not an ancient conflict
 this is not even an ideological conflict  the ebbs and flows
 of hostility have not shifted
 with ideological zeal  
 but rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape when iran and israel 's security imperatives dictated collaboration they did so in spite of lethal ideological opposition to
  when iran 's ideological impulses collided with its strategic interests  the strategic interests always prevailed  
 this is good news 
 because it means that neither war nor enmity
 is a foregone conclusion 
 but some want war 
 some believe or say that it 's one thousand nine hundred and thirty eight iran is germany  and ahmadinejad is hitler
  if we accept this to be true that indeed it is one thousand nine hundred and thirty eight iran is germany ahmadinejad is hitler
  then the question we have to ask ourself is who wishes to play the role of neville chamberlain 
 who will risk peace this is an analogy that is deliberately aimed at
  and when you eliminate diplomacy you make war inevitable 
 in an ideological conflict there can be no truce no draw no compromise  only victory or defeat  
 but rather than making war inevitable by viewing this as ideological we would be wise to seek ways to make
  iran and israel 's conflict is a new phenomenon  
 only a few decades old in a history of two thousand five hundred years 
 and precisely because its roots are geopolitical it means that solutions can be found  
 compromises can be struck  however difficult it yet may be after all it was
  make peace with your friends you make it with your enemies
