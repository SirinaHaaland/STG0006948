  game is rigged my vote won 't count  
 the choices are terrible voting is for suckers  perhaps you 've thought some of these things  perhaps you 've even said them
  you wouldn 't be alone and you wouldn 't be entirely wrong  the game of public policy today is rigged in many ways  how else would
 more than half of federal tax breaks
 flow up to the wealthiest five percent of americans and our choices indeed are often terrible for many people across the political
  in any year you can look up and down the ballot and find plenty to be uninspired about 
 but in spite of all this i still believe voting matters  and crazy as it may sound i believe we can revive the joy of voting  
 today i want to talk about how we can do that and why 
 there used to be a time in american history when voting was fun  when it was much more than just a grim
  duty to show up at the polls that time is called most of american history 
 from the revolution to the civil rights era the united states had a vibrant robustly
 participatory and raucous culture
 of voting it was street theater open air debates fasting and feasting and toasting parades
 parades and bonfires  during the 19th century immigrants and urban political machines helped fuel this culture of voting that culture grew
 with each successive wave of new voters  
 during reconstruction when new african american voters new african american citizens 
 began to exercise their power they celebrated in jubilee parades that connected emancipation with their newfound right to vote 
 a few decades later the suffragettes
 brought a
  spirit of theatricality to their fight  marching together in white dresses as they claimed the franchise 
 and the civil rights movement which sought to redeem the promise of equal citizenship that had been betrayed by jim crow 
 put voting right at the center 
 from freedom summer to the march in selma that generation of activists knew that voting matters  and they knew that spectacle and the performance of power
  is key to actually claiming power 
 but it 's been over a half century since selma and the voting rights act and in the decades since this face to face culture of voting
 has just about disappeared  it 's been killed by television and then the internet 
 the couch has replaced the commons screens have made citizens into spectators  and while it 's nice to share political memes
  on social media that 's a rather quiet kind of citizenship  it 's what the sociologist sherry turkle calls being alone together 
 what we need today is an electoral culture that is about being together together 
 in person in loud and passionate ways so that instead of being
  voting can feel more like join the club or better yet join the party 
 imagine if we had 
 across the country right now  in local places but nationwide 
 a concerted effort to revive a face to face set of ways to engage and electioneer  
 outdoor shows in which candidates and their causes are mocked and praised in broad satirical style soapbox speeches by citizens
  public debates held inside pubs  
 streets filled with political art and handmade posters and murals battle of the band concerts in which competing performers rep
 their candidates now all of this may sound a little bit 18th century to you but
 in fact it doesn 't have to be any more
  which is to say vibrantly contemporary 
 and the fact is that all around the world today  millions of people are voting like this  
 in india elections are colorful communal affairs 
 in brazil election day is a
 festive carnival type atmosphere  in taiwan and hong kong there is a spectacle
 you might ask well  here in america who has time for this and i would tell you
 that the average american watches five hours of television a day you might ask who has the motivation and i 'll tell you any citizen
 who wants to be seen and heard
 not as a prop not as a talking point but as a participant as a creator
  we make this happen  simply by making it happen that 's why a group of colleagues and i launched a new project called the joy of voting 
 in four cities across the united states
 philadelphia miami  akron ohio and wichita kansas we 've gathered together artists and activists educators
  political folks neighbors everyday citizens to come together and create projects that can foster
 this culture of voting in a local way  in miami that means all night parties with hot djs where the only way to get in is to show that you 're registered to vote  
 in akron
 it means political plays being performed in the bed of a flatbed truck
 that moves from neighborhood to neighborhood in philadelphia it 's a voting themed scavenger hunt all throughout colonial old town
  and in wichita  it 's
 making mixtapes and live graffiti art in the north end to get out the vote  
 there are twenty of these projects and they are remarkable in their beauty and their diversity  and they are changing people let me tell you about a couple of them 
 in miami we 've commissioned and artist a young artist named atomico to create some vivid and vibrant images for a new series of i voted
  the thing is atomico had never voted 
 he wasn 't even registered 
 so as he got to work on creating this artwork for these stickers  
 he also began to get over his sense of intimidation about politics he got himself registered 
 and then he got educated about the upcoming primary election 
 and on election day he
 was out there not just passing out stickers but chatting up voters and encouraging people to vote and talking about the election with passersby  
 in akron a theater company called the wandering aesthetics has been putting on these pickup truck plays 
 and to do so they put out an open call to the public
 asking for speeches monologues dialogues poems snippets of anything that could be read aloud and woven into a performance 
 they got dozens of submissions one of them was a poem
  by nine students in an esl class all of them hispanic migrant workers from nearby hartville ohio i
 want to read to you from this poem  
 it 's called the joy of voting 
 i would like to vote for the first time
 because things are changing for hispanics i used to be afraid of ghosts now i am afraid of people there 's more
  violence and racism voting can change this 
 the border wall is nothing  it 's just a wall the wall of shame
 is something  it 's very important to vote so we can break down this wall of shame i have passion in my heart
  voting gives me a voice and power i can stand up and do something the
 joy of voting project isn 't just about joy  it 's about this passion  it 's about feeling and belief  
 and it isn 't just our organization 's work 
 all across this country right now  immigrants young people veterans people of all different backgrounds are coming together to create this kind of passionate
  joyful activity around elections  in red and blue states in urban and rural communities people of every political background 
 what they have in common is simply this their work is rooted in place  
 because remember all citizenship is local when politics becomes just a presidential
 election we yell and we scream at our screens and then we collapse exhausted  but when politics
 is about us and our neighbors
  and other people in our community
 coming together to create experiences of collective voice and imagination 
 then we begin to remember that this stuff matters we begin to remember that this is the stuff of self government 
 which brings me back to where i began why bother  there 's one way to answer this question voting matters
 because it is a
 self fulfilling act of belief  it feeds the spirit
 of mutual interest that makes any society thrive  
 when we vote even if it is in anger we are part of a collective creative leap of faith 
 voting helps us generate the very power that we wish we had 
 it 's no accident that democracy and theater emerged around the same time in ancient athens
  both of them yank the individual out of the enclosure of her private self  both of them create great public experiences of shared ritual  
 both of them bring the imagination to life
 in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end are imagined 
 and can be reimagined 
 this moment right now
  think about
 the meaning of imagination is so fundamentally important and our ability to take that spirit
 and to take that sense that there is something greater out there is not just a matter of technical expertise it 's not just a matter of making the time or having
  it is a matter of spirit  but let me give you an answer to this question why bother that is maybe a little less spiritual
 and a bit more pointed 
 why bother voting  because there is no such thing as not voting 
 not voting is voting for everything that you may detest and oppose not voting can be dressed up as an act of principled passive
  but in fact not voting
 is actively handing power over to those whose interests are counter to your own and those who would be very glad to take advantage of your absence not voting
 is for suckers
  imagine where this country would be if all the folks who in two thousand and ten created the tea party had decided that you know politics is too messy 
 voting is too complicated there is no possibility of our votes adding up to anything 
 they didn 't preemptively silence themselves they showed
  up and in the course of showing up they changed american politics imagine if all of the followers of donald trump and bernie sanders
 had decided not to upend the political status quo and blow apart the frame of the previously possible in american politics they did that
 by voting we
 live in a time right now
 divided often very dark where across the left and the right there 's a lot of talk of revolution
 and the need for revolution to disrupt everyday democracy well here 's the thing everyday democracy already gives us a playbook for revolution 
 in the two thousand and twelve presidential election  young voters latino voters 
  all showed up at less than fifty percent 
 in the two thousand and fourteen midterm elections turnout was thirty six percent  which was a 70 year low  
 and in your average local election turnout hovers somewhere around twenty percent  
 i invite you to imagine one hundred percent  
 picture one hundred percent  mobilize one hundred percent  and overnight  we get revolution
  overnight  the policy priorities of this country change dramatically and every level of government becomes radically more responsive to all the people 
 what would it take to mobilize one hundred percent  
 well we do have to push back against efforts afoot all across the country right now to make voting harder  but at the same
 same time we have to actively create a positive culture of voting that people want to belong to be part of and experience together  
 we have to make purpose  we have to make joy 
 so yes let 's have that revolution a revolution of spirit of ideas of policy and participation 
 a revolution against cynicism a revolution against the self fulfilling sense of powerlessness 
 let 's vote this revolution into existence  
 and while we 're at it let 's have some fun  
 thank you very much
