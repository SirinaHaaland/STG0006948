  my name is thomas heatherwick  i
 have a studio in london that has a particular approach to designing buildings 
 when i was growing up  i was exposed to making and crafts and materials
  and invention on a small scale  
 and i was there looking at the larger scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there
 in the publications i was seeing
  a ceramic pot or a musical instrument was a materiality and a soulfulness  and this influenced
 me  the first building i built was twenty years ago  and since in the last twenty years i 've developed a studio in london  
 sorry this was my mother by the way in her bead shop in london  i spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that
 'm just going to show for people who don 't know my studio 's work a few projects that we 've worked on this is a hospital building 
 this is a shop for a bag company  
 this is studios for artists 
 this is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and one hundred and fifty thousand
  glass beads the size of a golf ball  
 and this is a window display  
 and this is pair of cooling towers for an electricity substation next to st paul 's cathedral in london
  and this is a temple in japan for a buddhist monk  
 and this is a cafe by the sea in britain
  and just very quickly something we 've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of london to design a new bus that
 gave the passenger
 their freedom again  because the original routemaster bus that some of you may be familiar with which had this open platform at the back in fact i think all our routemasters are here in california now actually but they aren 't in london
  and so you 're you 're stuck on a bus and if the bus is going to
 stop and it 's three yards away from the bus stop you 're just a prisoner  but the the mayor of london wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform  
 so we 've been working
 with transport for london
  as a client for a new bus for fifty years  
 and so we 've been very lucky to have a chance to work  the brief is that the bus should use forty percent less energy  
 so it 's got hybrid drive  and we 've been working to try to improve everything from the fabric to the format and and
  i was going to show four main projects  and this is
 a project for a bridge  and so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open  and openings seemed
 everyone loves opening bridges but it 's quite a
 basic thing i think we all kind of stand and watch but the the bridges that we saw that opened and closed
 i once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball  and as he was diving someone had stamped on his knee  and it had broken like this
 and
 then we looked at these kinds of bridges and just couldn 't help feeling that it was a beautiful thing that had broken  
 and so this is in paddington in london  and it 's a very boring bridge
 as you can see it 's just steel and timber 
 but instead of what it is our focus was on the way
  the idea that the two farthest bits of it would end up kissing each other 
  we actually had to halve its speed because everyone was too scared when we first did it so that 's it speeded up 
  new biomass power station so a power station that uses organic waste material in the news  the subject of where our future water is 
  going to come from and where our power is going to come from is in all the papers all the time  
  't have a power station on it it has a child running through a field or something like that 
 and so when a consortium of engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station our condition was that we would work with them
 and that whatever we did we were not just going to decorate a normal power station and instead we had to learn we kind of forced them to teach us  and so we
  spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren 't being capitalized on that just taking a field and banging all these things out isn 't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work  
 so we looked at how we could compose all those elements
 instead of just
  is one of the poorest parts of britain it was voted the worst place in britain to live  and there are two thousand new homes being built next to this power station so it felt this has a
  social dimension it has a symbolic importance  and we should be proud of where our power is coming from  rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of 
 could be a place that pulls you in and it has to be 
 i 'm trying to get my two hundred and fifty feet high
  so it felt that what we could try to do is make a power park and actually bring the whole area in and using the spare soil that 's there on the site
  we could make a power station that was silent as well because just that soil could make the acoustic difference  and we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and
  way of making a structure to do this
 the finished project is meant to be more than just a power station it has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top
  it 's a power park so people can come and really experience this and also look out
 all around the area and use that height that we have to have for its function in
 shanghai we were invited to build
 well we weren 't invited what am i talking about we won the competition and it was painful to get there
 so we won the competition to build the
 's two hundred and fifty pavilions it 's the world 's biggest ever expo
 that had ever happened  so there are up to a million people there everyday  
 and two hundred and fifty countries all competing  and the british government saying you need to be in the top five 
 and so that that became
  sense was we had to do one thing and only one thing  instead of trying to have everything and so
 what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn 't do a cheesy advert for britain 
 but the thing that was true the expo was about the future of cities  and
 particularly the victorians pioneered
 integrating nature into the cities  and the world 's first public park of modern times was in britain  
 and the world 's first major botanical institution is in london  
 and they have this extraordinary project where they 've been collecting twenty five percent of all the world 's plant species  
 so we suddenly realized that there was this thing and everyone agrees that trees are beautiful  and i 've never met anyone who says
 and the same with flowers i 've never met anyone who says i don 't like flowers 
 but we realized that seeds there 's been this very serious project happening but that seeds
 at these major botanical gardens 
  't on show  but you just have to go to a garden center and they 're in little paper packets  
 but this this phenomenal project 's been happening so we realized we had to make a project that would be
 seeds some kind of seed cathedral  but how could we show these teeny weeny things  and the film jurassic park actually really helped us  because the the dna of the dinosaur 
  that was trapped in the amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious  rather than looking like nuts
  challenge was how are we going to bring light and expose these things we didn 't want to make a separate building and have separate content so we were trying to think how could we make a whole 
 whole thing emanate by the way we had half the budget of the other western nations so that was also in the mix with
  you get the idea so the idea was to take
  thousand seeds that they agreed to give us and to take each seed and trap it in this precious optical hair
 and and grow that through through this
  very simple box element  and make it a building
 that could move in the wind  so the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows  and inside the daylight each one is an optic and it brings light into the center
  and by night  artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside  
 and to make the project affordable we focused our energy instead of building a building as big as the football pitch we
  focused it on this one element  and the government agreed to do that
 and and not do anything else and focus our energy on that and so the rest of the site
 was a public space  and with a million people there a day it just felt like offering some public space we worked with an astroturf manufacturer to develop a
 even if you 're partially sighted that it was kind of crunchy and soft that piece of landscape that you see there  and then you know 
 when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral in effect we 've shaved it  
  there 's nothing there 's no famous actor 's voice there 's no projections there 's no televisions there 's no color changing there 's just silence
 and a cool temperature
  and if a if a cloud goes past you can see a cloud on the tips where it 's letting the light through 
 this is the only project that we 've done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings
 a key thing was how people would interact i mean in a way it was the most serious thing you could possible do at the expo
  and i just wanted to show  you the british government
  any government is potentially the worst client
  in the world you could ever possibly want to have and there was a lot of terror
  i 'm sorry about my stupid voice there
 so finally  texture is something in the projects we 've been working on these
 slick buildings where they might be a fancy shape  but the materiality feels the same is something that we 've been
  trying to
 research really  and explore alternatives  
 and the the project that we 're building in malaysia is apartment buildings for a property developer  and it 's in a
  piece of land that 's this this site  and the mayor of kuala lumpur said that if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city they would give them more gross floor
  area  buildable  so there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be
 better for the city  
 and the conventional thing with apartment buildings in this part of the world is you have your tower  and you squeeze a few trees around the edge  and you 
 see cars parked it 's actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience  and the rest of it is just for postcards  
  is actually the bottom part of a tower like this so if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom 
 we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer  and by linking these together we could have ninety percent of the site 
 as a rainforest instead of only ten percent of scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings
 so we 're building these buildings
 they 're actually identical so it 's quite  cost effective they 're just chopped at different heights  
 but the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape  rather than
 engulf it
  so thank you  thank you thomas you 're a delight since we have an extra minute here i
 thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds which maybe came from the shaved bit of the
  building th these are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure so there 
  thousand of these this optic
 was
 twenty two feet long  and so the daylight was just coming it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate
  waterproofing the building was a bit crazy because it 's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway  but if you say you 're going to drill sixty six thousand holes in it
 it we had quite a time  there was one person in the contractors
 who was the right size and it wasn 't a child who could fit between them for the final waterproofing of the building
