  this cell phone
 started its trajectory in an artisanal mine in the eastern congo it 's mined by armed gangs using
  some components and ended up in a factory in shinjin in china that factory over a dozen people have committed suicide already this year 
 one man died after working a 36 hour shift  
 we all love chocolate we buy it for our kids eighty percent of the cocoa comes from cote d 'ivoire and ghana
 and it 's harvested by children
  d 'ivoire we have a huge problem of child slaves  children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations heparin a
 blood thinner a pharmaceutical product starts out
 in artisanal workshops like this in china because the active ingredient
 comes from pigs ' intestines your diamond you 've all heard probably seen the movie
  diamond this is a mine in zimbabwe
 right now  
 cotton uzbekistan is the second biggest exporter of cotton on earth every year when it comes to the cotton harvest the
 government shuts down the schools  puts the kids in buses 
 buses them to the cotton fields to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton it
 's forced child labor
 on an institutional scale  
  those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in manila 
 these places these origins represent governance gaps that 's the politest
 description i have for them these are the dark pools
 where global supply chains begin the global supply chains which bring us our favorite brand name products some
  these
 governance gaps are run by
 rogue states  some of them are not states anymore at all they 're failed states some of them are just
 countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation is the best way to attract investment  promote trade 
 either way they present us with a huge moral and ethical dilemma
  i know that none of us want to be accessories
 after the fact
 of a human rights abuse
 in a global supply chain  but right now  most of the companies involved
 in these supply chains don 't have any way of assuring us
 that nobody had to mortgage their
  nobody had to sacrifice their rights to bring us our favorite brand name product 
 now i didn 't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain
 we need a reality check we need to recognize just how
 serious a deficit of rights we have this is an independent republic probably a failed state it 's definitely not a
  right now  that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us 
 that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption 
 now that 's not a new story you 've seen the documentaries of sweatshops
 making garments all over the world even in developed countries  you want to see the classic sweatshop  meet me at madison square garden
 i 'll take you down the street and i 'll show you a chinese sweatshop  
 but take the example of heparin it 's
 a pharmaceutical product you expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital probably squeaky clean 
 the problem is that the active ingredient in there as i mentioned earlier comes from pigs
  the main american manufacturer
 of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to china because it 's the world 's biggest supplier of pigs 
 and their factory in china which probably is
 pretty clean
 is getting all of the ingredients from backyard abattoirs  where families slaughter pigs
 and extract the ingredient so a couple of years ago we had a scandal which killed about eighty people around the world
  of contaminants that crept into the heparin supply chain  worse  some of the suppliers realized that they could substitute
 a product
 which mimicked heparin in tests this substitute cost nine dollars a pound  whereas real heparin
  problem was that it killed more people 
 and so you 're asking yourself how come the u s food and drug administration allowed this to happen  
 how did the chinese state agency for food and drugs allow this to happen 
 and the answer is quite simple the chinese define these facilities as chemical
  so they don 't audit them and the usfda has a jurisdictional problem this is offshore  
 they actually do conduct a few investigations overseas about a dozen a year maybe twenty in a good year there are five hundred
 of these
 facilities producing
 active ingredients in china alone in fact about eighty percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore
  india and we don 't have a governance system we don 't have a regulatory system able to ensure that that production is
 safe we don 't have a system to ensure that human rights basic dignity are ensured  
  national level
 and we work in about sixty different countries at a national level we 've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate
 production on their own soil and
 the real problem with the global supply chain is that it 's supranational  so governments who are failing who are dropping the ball
 at a national level have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level and you can
  just look at the headlines take copenhagen last year
 complete failure of governments to do the right thing
 in the face of an international challenge take the g20 meeting a couple of weeks ago
 stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago 
 you can take any one of the major global challenges we 've discussed this week and ask
  yourself where is the leadership from governments
 to step up and come up with solutions  responses to those international problems 
 and the simple answer is they can 't they 're national their voters are local 
 they have parochial interests they can 't subordinate those interests to the greater global public good so if we 're going to ensure
  the delivery of the key public goods at an international level in this case in the global supply chain we have to come up with a different
 mechanism  we need a different machine 
 fortunately we have some examples in the 
  were a whole series of scandals concerning the production of brand name goods in the u s child labor forced labor serious health and safety abuses  
 and eventually president clinton in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six convened a meeting at the white house 
 invited industry human rights ngos trade unions the department of labor 
 got them all in a room and said look i don 't want globalization to be a race to the bottom 
  know how to prevent that but i 'm at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together
 to come up with a response so they formed a white house task force  and they spent about three years
 arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain  
 companies didn 't feel it was their responsibility they don 't own those facilities they don 't employ those workers  they 're not legally liable
  everybody else at the table said folks that doesn 't cut it you have a custodial duty a duty of care to make sure that that product gets from
 wherever
 to the store
 in a way that allows us to consume it
 without fear of our safety or without having to sacrifice our conscience
 to consume that product
  agreed okay what we 'll do
 is we agree on a common set of standards  code of conduct we 'll apply that throughout our global supply chain
 regardless of ownership or control we
 'll make it part of the contract 
 and that was a stroke of absolute genius  because what they did was they harnessed the power of the contract
  to deliver public goods  and let 's face it the contract from a major multinational brand
 to a supplier in india or china
 has much more persuasive value
 than the local labor law  the local environmental regulations  the local human rights standards 
 those factories will probably never see an inspector if the inspector did come along
  if they were able to
 resist the bribe  even if they did their jobs  and they cited those facilities for their
 violations the fine would be derisory  
 but you lose that contract for a major brand name that 's the difference between
 staying
  or going bankrupt  that makes a difference so what we 've been able to do is we 've been able to harness
 the power and the influence of the only
 truly transnational institution in the global supply chain that of the multinational company and get them to do the right thing 
 get them to use that power for good to deliver the key public goods 
  companies  they weren 't set up to do this they 're set up to make money  
 but they are extremely efficient organizations they have resources and if we can add the will the commitment  
 they know how to deliver that product 
 now  getting there is not easy those supply chains i put up on the screen earlier  they 're not there
  you need a safe space  you need a place where people can come together  sit down without fear of judgment without recrimination 
 to actually face the problem agree on the problem
 and come up with solutions we can do it  the technical solutions are there  the problem is the lack of trust  the lack of confidence the lack of partnership
 between ngos campaign groups
 civil society organizations and multinational companies if
 we can put those two together in a safe space 
 get them to work together we can deliver public goods right now or in extremely short supply 
 this is a radical proposition  and it 's crazy
  bangladeshi girl leaving your rural village to go and work in a factory in dhaka
  dollars a month
 your best chance of enjoying rights at work
 is if that factory is producing for a brand name company which has got a code of conduct and made that code of conduct part of
  's crazy multinationals are protecting human rights  i know there 's going to be disbelief you 'll say how can we trust them well we don 't it
 's the old arms control phrase trust but verify 
 so we audit  we take their supply chain we take all the factory names we do a random sample  we send inspectors on an unannounced basis
 to inspect those facilities  and then we publish the results
  transparency is absolutely critical to this you can call yourself responsible but responsibility without accountability
 often doesn 't work so what we 're doing is we 're not only enlisting the multinationals we 're giving them the tools to deliver this public good
 respect for human rights
  need to believe me you shouldn 't believe me  
 go to the website look at the audit results  ask yourself is this company behaving in a socially responsible way 
 can i buy that product without compromising
 my ethics  that 's the way the system works  
 i hate the idea that governments are not protecting human rights around the world  i hate the idea that governments
 have dropped this ball and i can 't get used to the idea that
 somehow we can 't get them to do their jobs i 've been at this for thirty years and in that time i 've seen the ability the commitment  the will of government
 to do this decline  and i don 't see them making a comeback right now  so we started out thinking this was a stopgap measure 
 we 're now thinking that
  fact  this is probably the start of a new way of regulating
 and addressing international challenges call it network governance call it what you will the private actors 
 companies and ngos are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face
  look at the health systems in so many countries do they have the resources to face up to a serious pandemic no 
 could the private sector and ngos get together and marshal a response  absolutely 
 what they lack is that safe space to come together  agree
 and move to action  that 's what we 're trying to provide
 i know as well that this often seems like an overwhelming level of responsibility for people to assume 
 you want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain there are thousands of suppliers in there 
 it seems
 too daunting too dangerous for any company to take on but there are companies we have four thousand companies who are members
 some of them are very very large companies  the sporting goods industry in particular stepped up to the plate and have done it 
 the example the role model is there  
 and whenever we discuss one of these problems that we have to address child labor in cottonseed farms in india this year we will monitor fifty thousand cottonseed farms in india  
 it seems overwhelming
  the numbers just make you want to zone out but we break it down to some basic realities and human rights
 comes down to a very simple proposition 
 can i give this person their dignity back poor people people whose human rights have been violated
 the crux of that
  the loss of dignity  the lack of dignity  it starts with just giving people back their dignity  i was sitting in a slum outside gurgaon
 just next to delhi one of the
 flashiest  brightest new cities popping up in india right now  
 and i was talking to workers who worked in garment sweatshops down the road  and i asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands
  they didn 't say money  
 they said the people who employ us treat us like we are less than human like we don 't exist  
 please ask them to treat us like human beings 
 that 's my simple understanding of human rights  that 's my simple proposition to you my simple plea to every decision maker in this
  we can all make a decision to come together
 and pick up the balls and run with the balls that governments have dropped if we don 't do it 
 we 're abandoning hope we 're abandoning our essential humanity  
 and i know that 's not a place we want to be and we don 't have to be there so i appeal to you 
 join us come into that safe space  and let 's start to make this happen  thank you very much
