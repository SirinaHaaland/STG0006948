  we build autonomous aerial robots like the one you see flying here 
 unlike the commercially available drones that you can buy today this robot doesn 't have any gps on board  
 so without gps it 's hard for
  robots like this to determine their position 
 this robot uses onboard sensors  cameras and laser scanners to scan the environment it detects features from 
  the environment  and it determines where it is relative to those features using a method of triangulation and then it can assemble all these features into a map like you see behind me  
  allows the robot to understand where the obstacles are and navigate in a collision free manner what i want to show you next
 is a set of experiments we did inside our laboratory where this robot was able to go for longer distances  
 so here you 'll see on the top right what the robot sees with the
  the main screen and of course this is sped up by a factor of four on the main screen you 'll see the map that it 's building  so this is a high resolution map of the corridor around our laboratory  
 and in a minute you 'll see it enter our lab  which is recognizable by the clutter that you see 
 but the main point i want to convey to you is that these robots are capable of building 
 at five centimeters resolution
  allowing somebody who is outside the lab or outside the building to deploy these
 without actually going inside and trying to infer what happens inside the building now there 's one problem with robots like this  
 the first problem is it 's pretty big because it 's big it 's heavy  
 and these robots consume about one hundred watts per pound  and this makes for a very short mission life  
 the second problem is that these
  robots have onboard sensors that end up being very expensive a laser scanner a camera
 and the processors that drives up the cost of this robot 
 so we asked ourselves a question 
 what consumer product can you buy in an electronics store that is inexpensive that 's lightweight that has sensing onboard and computation
  and we invented the flying phone 
 so this robot
 uses a samsung galaxy smartphone that you can buy off the shelf 
 and all you need is an app that you can download from our app store  
 and you can see this robot reading the letters ted in this case  looking at the corners of the
 flying autonomously that joystick is just there to make sure if the robot goes crazy giuseppe can kill it 
 in addition to building these small robots 
 we also experiment with aggressive behaviors like you see here  
  traveling at two to three meters per second  pitching and rolling aggressively as it changes direction the main point is we can have
 smaller robots that can go faster and then travel in these very unstructured environments  and in this next video just like you see this bird an eagle  
 gracefully coordinating its wings its eyes and feet to grab prey out of the water 
  can go fishing too in this case this is a philly cheesesteak hoagie that it 's grabbing out of thin air so
 you can see this robot going at about three meters per second  which is faster than walking speed coordinating its arms its claws
 and its flight with  split second timing to achieve this maneuver 
  experiment i want to show you how the robot adapts its flight
 to control its suspended payload  whose length is actually larger than the width of the window  
 so in order to accomplish this it actually has to pitch and adjust the altitude
 and swing the payload through
  but of course we want to make these even smaller and we 're inspired in particular by honeybees  so if you look at honeybees and this is a slowed down video 
 they 're so small 
 the inertia is so lightweight 
 that they don 't care they bounce off
 my hand for example this is a little robot that mimics the honeybee behavior and smaller is better because along with the small size you get
 lower inertia
  inertia  along with lower inertia 
 along with lower inertia you 're resistant to collisions  and that makes you more robust
  so just like these honeybees we build small robots and this particular one is only twenty five grams in weight it consumes only six watts of power  
  up to six meters per second  so if i normalize that to its size it 's like a boeing seven hundred and eighty seven traveling ten times the speed of sound 
 and
 i want to show you an example 
 this is probably the first planned mid air collision at one twentieth normal speed these are going at a relative speed of two meters per second  and this illustrates
  carbon fiber cage around it prevents the propellers from entangling but essentially the collision is absorbed and the and the robot responds to the collisions  
 and so small also means safe  in my lab as we developed these robots we start off with these big robots and then now we 're down to these small robots 
 and if you plot a histogram of the number of band aids we 've ordered in the past that sort of tailed off now because these robots are really safe
  the small size has some disadvantages  and nature has found a number of ways to compensate for these disadvantages 
 the basic idea is they aggregate to form large groups or swarms  so similarly in our lab we try to create artificial robot swarms  and this is quite challenging because 
  now you have to think about networks of robots and within each robot you have to think about the interplay of
  sensing communication computation
 and this network then becomes quite difficult to control and manage  
 so from nature we take away three organizing principles that essentially allow us to develop our algorithms  
 the first idea is that robots need to be aware of their neighbors  they need to be able to sense and communicate with their neighbors
  so this video illustrates the basic idea you have four robots one of the robots has actually been hijacked by a human operator literally
  but because the robots interact with each other they sense their neighbors  they essentially follow and here there 's a single person able to lead this network of followers 
  so again it 's not because
 all the robots know where they 're supposed to go it 's because they 're just reacting to the positions of their neighbors 
 laughter so the next experiment illustrates the second organizing principle  
 and this principle has to do with the principle of anonymity
  key idea is that
 the robots are agnostic to the identities of their neighbors  
 they 're asked to form a circular shape  and no matter how many robots you introduce into the formation or how many robots you pull out 
 each robot is simply reacting to its neighbor  it 's aware of the fact that it needs to
 to form the circular shape
 but collaborating with its neighbors it forms the shape without central coordination 
 now if you put these ideas together  
 the third idea is that we essentially give these robots mathematical descriptions of the shape they need to execute  
 and these shapes can be varying as a function of time  
 and you 'll see these
 robots start from a circular formation
  change into a rectangular formation stretch into a straight line back into an ellipse  
 and they do this with the same kind of  split second coordination that you see in in natural swarms in nature  
 so why work with swarms  let me tell you about two applications that we are very interested in 
 the first one has to do with agriculture which is probably the biggest problem that we 're facing
  worldwide 
 as you well know one in every seven persons in this earth is malnourished  most of the land that we can cultivate has already been cultivated  
 and the efficiency of most systems in the world is improving but our production system efficiency is actually declining  and that 's mostly because of water shortage
  crop diseases climate change
 and a couple of other things  
 so what can robots do well we adopt an approach that 's called precision farming in the community and the basic idea is
 that we fly aerial robots
 through orchards  and then we build precision models of individual plants  so just like personalized medicine while you might imagine
 wanting to treat every patient
  what we 'd like to do is build models of individual plants
 and then tell the farmer what kind of inputs every plant needs the inputs in this case being water  fertilizer and pesticide
  here you 'll see
 robots traveling through an apple orchard and in a minute you 'll see two of its companions doing the same thing on the left side
  and what they 're doing is essentially building a map of the orchard  within the map is a map of every plant in this orchard
 let 's see what those maps look like in the next video you 'll see the cameras that are being used on this robot on the top left is essentially a standard color camera  
 is an infrared camera and on the bottom left is a thermal camera and on the main panel you
  reconstruction of every tree in the orchard
 as the sensors fly right past
 the trees
 armed with information like this we can do several things  
 the first and possibly the most important thing we can do is very simple count the number of fruits on every tree by doing this you tell the farmer
 how many fruits she has in every tree and allow her to estimate the yield
 in the orchard
  optimizing the production chain downstream  
 the second thing we can do is take models of plants  construct three dimensional reconstructions  
 and from that estimate the canopy size  
 and then correlate the canopy size to the amount of leaf area on every plant and this is called the leaf area index  so if you know this leaf area
  you essentially have a measure of how much photosynthesis is possible in every plant which again tells you how healthy each plant is 
 by combining
 visual and infrared information we can also compute indices such as ndvi and in this particular case you can essentially see there are some crops that are not doing as well as other crops this is easily discernible
  not just visual imagery but combining both visual imagery and infrared imagery 
 and then lastly one thing we 're interested in doing is detecting the early onset of  chlorosis and this is an orange tree which is essentially seen by yellowing of leaves  
 but robots flying overhead can easily spot this autonomously and then report to the farmer that he or she has a problem in this section of the orchard
  systems like this can really help  and we 're projecting yields
 that can improve by about ten percent and more importantly decrease the amount of inputs such as water by twenty five percent by using aerial robot swarms  
 lastly i want you to applaud the people who actually create the future yash 
  sikang liu and giuseppe  loianno who are responsible for the three demonstrations that you saw
