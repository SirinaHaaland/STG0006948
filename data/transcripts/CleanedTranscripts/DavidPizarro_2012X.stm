  a woman named giulia tofana
 had a very successful perfume business for over fifty years she ran it it sort of ended abruptly when she was executed 
 for murdering six hundred men you see it wasn 't a very good perfume
 in fact it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless  but as a poison it was the best money could buy  so women flocked to her
 in order to murder their husbands it turns out that
 poisoners were a valued and feared group because poisoning a human being is a quite difficult
  the reason is we have sort of a built in poison detector  you can see this as early as even in newborn infants 
 if you are willing to do this you can take a couple of drops of a bitter substance or a sour substance and you 'll see that face the tongue stick out the wrinkled nose as if they 're trying to get rid of what 's in their mouth
 this reaction expands into adulthood and becomes sort of a full blown disgust response no longer just about whether or not we 're about to be poisoned 
 but whenever there 's a threat of
  physical contamination from some source  but the face remains strikingly similar  
 it has expanded more though than just keeping us away from physical contaminants  and there 's a growing body of evidence to suggest
 that in fact  this emotion of disgust now influences our moral beliefs
 and even our deeply held political
  why this might be the case 
 we can understand this process by understanding a little bit about emotions in general so the basic human emotions those kinds of emotions that we share with all other human beings  
 exist because they motivate us to do good things and they keep us away from doing bad things so by and large they are good for our survival take the emotion of fear for instance it keeps us away from doing things that are really really risky  
 this photo taken
  just before his death is actually a
 no one reason this photo is interesting is because most people would not do this and if they did they would not live to tell it because fear would have kicked in a long time ago
 to a natural predator 
 just like fear offers us protective benefits disgust seems to do the same thing except for what disgust does is keeps us away from not things that might eat us or heights but rather things that might
  poison us or give us disease and make us sick  so one of the features of disgust that makes it such an interesting emotion
 is that it 's very very easy to elicit in fact more so than probably any of the other basic emotions and so i 'm going to show you that with a couple of images i can probably make you feel disgust so turn away i 'll tell you when you can turn
  those probably made a lot of you in the audience feel very very
 disgusted
 but if you didn 't look i can tell you about some of the other things that have been shown sort of across the world to make people disgusted things like feces urine blood  rotten flesh 
 these are the sorts of things that it makes sense for us to stay away from because they might
  actually contaminate us in fact just having a diseased appearance or or odd sexual acts these things are also
 things that give us a lot of disgust  darwin was probably one of the first scientists to systematically investigate the human emotions and he pointed to
 the universal nature and the strength of the disgust response  this is an anecdote from his travels in south america in tierro del fuego a native touched with his finger some cold
  preserved meat while i was eating and plainly showed disgust at its softness whilst i felt utter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage though his hands did not appear dirty 
 he later wrote it 's okay some of my best friends are naked savages 
 well it turns out it 's not only old timey british scientists who are this squeamish i recently got a chance to talk to richard dawkins for a documentary  and i was able to
  him a bunch of times here 's my favorite richard dawkins we 've evolved around courtship and sex are attached to
 deep rooted emotions and reactions that are hard to jettison overnight david
 so my favorite part of
 this clip is that that professor dawkins actually gagged  he jumps back and he gags  and we had to do it three times and all three times he gagged
 laughter and he was really gagging i thought he might throw up on me actually 
 one of the features though of disgust is not just its universality and its strength  but the way that it works through association 
 so when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing 
 that clean thing becomes disgusting not the other way around 
 this makes it very useful as a strategy if you want to convince somebody that an object or an
  individual or an entire social group is disgusting and should be avoided the philosopher martha nussbaum points this out in this quote thus throughout history certain disgust properties sliminess bad 
  smell stickiness  decay foulness have been repeatedly and monotonously been associated with jews women homosexuals untouchables lower class people all of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt
  let me give you just some examples of how some powerful examples of how this has been used historically this comes from a nazi children 's book published in one thousand nine hundred and thirty eight 
 just look at these guys the  louse infested beards the filthy protruding ears  those stained fatty clothes  jews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor  if you have a good nose you can smell the jews 
 a more modern example comes from people who try to convince us
  where they said gays are worthy of death for their vile sex practices they 're like dogs eating their own vomit and sows wallowing in their own feces 
 these are disgust properties that are trying to be directly linked to the social group
 that you should not like when we were first investigating the role of disgust in moral judgment one of the things we became interested in
 was whether or not these sorts of appeals are more likely to
  work in individuals who are more easily disgusted  so while disgust along with the other basic emotions are universal phenomena it just really is true that some people are easier to disgust than others you could probably see it in the audience members when i showed you those disgusting images 
 the way that we measured this was by a scale that was constructed by some other psychologists
 that simply asked people
  across a wide variety of situations how likely they are to feel disgust so here are a couple of examples 
 even if i were hungry i would not drink a bowl of my favorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed fly swatter do you agree or disagree 
 while you are walking through a tunnel under a railroad track you smell urine would you be very disgusted or not at all disgusted 
 if you ask enough of these you can get a general overall score of disgust sensitivity  it turns out that this score is actually meaningful when you bring people into the laboratory and you ask them if they
  're willing to engage in safe but disgusting behaviors like
 eating
 chocolate that 's been baked to look like dog poop 
 or in this case eating some mealworms that are perfectly healthy but pretty gross  
 your score on that scale actually predicts whether or not you 'll be willing to engage in those behaviors the first time that we set out to collect data on this and associate it with political or moral beliefs we found a general pattern
  this is with the psychologists yoel inbar and paul bloom
 that in fact 
 across three studies we kept finding that people who reported that they were easily disgusted also reported that they were more politically conservative 
 another way to say this though is that people who are very liberal are very hard to disgust 
  we were able to look at a much greater sample a much larger sample in this case this is nearly thirty thousand u s respondents  and we find the same pattern as you can see people who are on the very 
  conservative side of answering the political orientation scale are also much more likely to report that they 're easily disgusted  
  age income education  even basic personality variables and the result stays the same when we actually looked at not just self reported political orientation 
 but voting behavior  we were able to look geographically across the nation what we found was that in in regions in which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity  mccain
  so it not only predicted self reported political orientation but actual voting behavior  and also we were able 
 with this sample to look across the world in one hundred and twenty one different countries we asked the same questions 
 and as you can see this is one hundred and twenty one countries collapsed into ten different geographical regions no matter where you look what this is plotting is the size of the relationship between disgust sensitivity and political orientation 
 and no matter where we looked we saw a very similar effect
  other labs have actually looked at this as well using different measures of disgust sensitivity so rather than asking people how easily disgusted they are they hook people up to physiological measures in this case skin conductance  
 and what they 've demonstrated is that people who report being more politically conservative
 are also more physiologically aroused when you show them disgusting images like the ones that i showed you interestingly what they also showed in a finding that we
 in our previous studies as well was that one of the strongest influences here is that individuals who are very disgust sensitive not only are more likely to report being politically conservative but they 're also very
 much more opposed to gay marriage and homosexuality and pretty much a lot of the socio moral issues  in the sexual domain  
 so physiological arousal predicted  in this study attitudes toward gay marriage
  but even with all these data linking disgust sensitivity and political orientation  one of the questions that remains is what is the causal link here is it the case that disgust really 
  is shaping political and moral beliefs  we have to resort to experimental methods to answer this and so what we can do is actually bring people into the lab and disgust them and compare them to a control group that hasn 't been disgusted  it turns out that over the past five years a number of researchers have done this
 and by and large the results have all been the same that when people are feeling disgust their attitudes shift towards the right of the political spectrum toward more moral conservatism as well so this is whether you use a foul odor a bad taste
  from film clips 
 from post hypnotic suggestions of disgust images like the ones i 've shown you even just reminding people that disease is prevalent and they should be wary of it and
  wash up right to keep clean these all have similar effects on judgment  let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted 
 we asked participants
 to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups  and we either made the room smell gross or not when the room
 smelled gross what we saw was that individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men disgust didn 't influence attitudes toward all the other social groups that we asked including
 african americans the elderly  it really came down to the attitudes they had toward gay men  
 take questionnaires next to a sign that reminded them to wash their hands 
 and what we found was that just taking a questionnaire next to this hand sanitizing reminder made individuals report being more politically conservative
  and when we asked them a variety of questions about the rightness or wrongness of certain acts  what we also
 found was that simply being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them more morally conservative 
 in particular when we asked them questions about sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices  just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them think that they 
  were more morally wrong  let me give you an example of what i mean by harmless but taboo sexual practice
  in another one we said a woman enjoys masturbating with her favorite teddy bear cuddled next to her 
 people find these to be more morally abhorrent if they 've been reminded to wash their hands 
 okay  
 the fact that emotions influence our judgment should come as no surprise i mean that 's part of how emotions work they not only motivate you to behave in certain ways
  but they change the way you think 
 in the case of disgust what is a little bit more surprising is the scope of this influence 
 it makes perfect sense and it 's a very good emotion for us to have that disgust would make me change the way that i perceive the physical world whenever contamination is possible 
 it makes less sense that an emotion that was built to prevent
  me from ingesting poison should predict who i 'm going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election
