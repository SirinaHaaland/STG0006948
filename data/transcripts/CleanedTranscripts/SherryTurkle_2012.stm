  just a moment ago my daughter rebecca
 texted me for good luck her text said mom you will rock 
 i love this getting that text was like getting a hug and
  so there you have it 
 i embody the central paradox  i 'm a woman who loves getting texts
 who 's going to tell you that too many of them
 can be a problem  actually that reminder of my daughter brings me to the beginning of
  when i gave my first tedtalk rebecca was five years old and she was sitting right there in the front row  
 i had just written a book that celebrated our life on the internet
 and i was about to be on the cover of wired magazine in those heady days we were experimenting with
  rooms and online virtual communities we were exploring different aspects of ourselves  and then we unplugged  
 i was excited and as a psychologist what excited me most
 was the idea that we would use what we learned in the virtual world about ourselves about our identity 
 to live better lives in the real world
  again my daughter 's twenty she 's a college student  she sleeps with her cellphone 
 so do i 
 and i 've just written a new book 
 but this time it 's not one that will get me on the cover of wired magazine  so what happened  
 i 'm still excited by technology
  but i believe and i 'm here to make the case that we 're letting it take us places that we don 't want to go 
 over the past fifteen years i 've studied technologies of mobile communication
 and i 've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people young and old about their plugged in lives
  and what i 've found is that our little devices those little devices in our pockets are so psychologically powerful
 that they don 't only change what we do they change who we are 
 some of the things we do now with our devices are things that only a few years ago  we would have found odd or
  but they 've quickly come to seem familiar 
 just how we do things so just to take some quick examples people text or do email during corporate board meetings  
 they text and shop and go on facebook during classes during presentations actually during all meetings 
 people talk to me about the important new skill of making eye contact while you 're texting
  people explain to me that it 's hard but that it can be done parents
 text and do email at breakfast and at dinner
 while their children complain
 about not having their parents ' full attention  but then these same children deny each other their full attention 
 this is a recent shot of my daughter
 and her friends being
  together while not being together
  and we even text at funerals  i study this we remove ourselves from our grief or from our revery
 and we go into our phones 
 why does this matter  it matters to me because i think we 're setting ourselves up for trouble
 trouble certainly in how
  we relate to each other  but also trouble in how we relate to ourselves and our capacity for 
 we 're getting used to a new way of being alone together people want to be with each other  but also elsewhere
 connected to all the different
 places they want to be people want to customize their lives they want to go in and out of all the places they are because the thing that matters most to them is control over where they put their attention 
 so you want to go to that board meeting  
 but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you 
 and some people think that 's a good thing  
 but you can end up hiding from each other  even as we 're all constantly connected to each
  other a 50 year old business man lamented to me
 that he feels he doesn 't have colleagues anymore at work  when he goes to work he doesn 't stop by to talk to anybody he doesn 't call 
 and he says he doesn 't want to interrupt his colleagues because he says they 're too busy on their email 
 but then he stops himself
  you know i 'm not telling you the truth i 'm the one who doesn 't want to be interrupted 
 i think i should want to  but actually i 'd rather just do things on my blackberry 
 across the generations i see that people can 't get enough of each other  if and only if
 they can have each other at a distance in amounts they can control 
 i call it the goldilocks effect not too close not too far
  far just right  
 but what might feel just right for that middle aged executive can be a problem for an adolescent who needs to develop
  like to learn how to have a conversation 
 when i ask people what 's wrong with having a conversation people say i 'll tell you what 's wrong with having a conversation
  it takes place in real time
 and you can 't control what you 're going to say so that
  the bottom line texting email posting all of these things let us present the self as we want to be 
 we get to edit  
 and that means we get to delete  
 and that means we get to retouch  the face the voice the flesh the body
 not too little not too much just
  human relationships are rich and they 're messy and they 're demanding  and we clean them up with technology 
 and when we do one of the things that can happen is that we sacrifice conversation
 for mere connection we short change ourselves 
 and over time we seem to forget this or we seem to stop caring
  caught off guard
 when stephen colbert asked me a profound question 
 a profound question he said 
 don 't all those little tweets don 't all those little sips
 of online communication add up
  to one big gulp
 of real conversation 
 my answer was no they don 't add up connecting in sips
 may work for gathering discrete bits of information  they may work for saying i 'm
  look at how i felt when i got that text from my daughter
 but they don 't really work for learning about each other  for really coming to know and understand each other  
 and we use conversations with each other
 to learn how to have conversations with ourselves  so a flight from conversation can really matter because it can compromise
  our capacity for 
 for kids growing up  that skill is the bedrock of development 
 over and over i hear i would rather text than talk 
 and what i 'm seeing is that people get so used to being short changed out of real conversation so used to getting by with less that they 've become almost willing to dispense
  with people altogether 
 so for example  many people share with me this wish that some day a more advanced version of siri the digital assistant on apple 's iphone 
 will be more like a best friend someone who will listen
 when others won 't i believe this wish reflects
 a painful truth that i 've learned in the past fifteen years that
  feeling that no one is listening to me
 is very important in our relationships with technology 
 that 's why it 's so appealing to have a facebook page or a twitter feed
 so many automatic listeners and the feeling that no one is listening to me make us want to spend time with machines
 that seem to care about us we
  're developing robots they call them sociable robots that are specifically designed to be companions
 to the elderly to our children to us have we so lost confidence that we
 will be there for each other  during my research i worked in nursing homes  and i brought in these
  sociable robots that were designed to give the elderly the feeling
 that they were understood  and one day i came in and a woman who had lost a child
 was talking to a robot in the shape of a baby seal  it seemed to be looking in her eyes it seemed to be following the conversation
  it comforted her and many people found this amazing  
 but that woman was trying to make sense of her life
 with a machine that had no experience of the arc of a human life  that robot put on a great show  
 and we 're vulnerable people experience pretend empathy
 as though it were the real thing so
  during that moment
 when that woman was experiencing that pretend empathy  
 i was thinking that robot can 't empathize  it doesn 't face death  it doesn 't know life 
 and as that woman took comfort in her robot companion  
 i didn 't find it
  i found it one of the most wrenching complicated moments in my fifteen years of work  
 but when i stepped back i felt myself at the cold hard center
 of a perfect storm 
 we expect more from technology and less from each other  
 and i ask myself why have things come to this 
 and i believe it 's because
  technology appeals to us most
 where we are most vulnerable  
 and we are vulnerable  we 're lonely  but we 're afraid of intimacy  
 and so from social networks to sociable robots  we 're designing technologies that will give us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship we turn to technology to help us feel connected
  in ways we can comfortably control  but we 're not so comfortable we are not so much in control 
 these days  those phones in our pockets are changing our minds and hearts because they offer us three gratifying fantasies 
 one that we can put our attention wherever we want
  that we will always be heard and three that we will never have to be alone  
 and that third idea that we will never have to be alone is central to changing our psyches 
 because the moment that people are  are alone  even for a few seconds they become anxious they panic they fidget  they reach for a device just think of people at a checkout line or at a red light 
 being alone feels like a problem
 that needs to be solved and so people try to solve it by connecting but here connection is more like a symptom
 than a cure  it expresses  but it doesn 't solve an underlying problem 
 but more than a symptom constant connection is changing the way people think of
  it 's shaping a new way of being the best way to describe it is i share therefore i am  
 we use technology to define ourselves by sharing our thoughts and feelings even as we 're having them 
 so before it was 
 i have a feeling  i want to make a call now it 's  i want to have a feeling i need to send a text 
 the problem with this new regime of
  therefore i am is that if we don 't have connection we don 't feel like ourselves  we almost don 't feel ourselves  so what do we do we connect
 more and more but in the process we set ourselves up to be isolated 
 how do you get from connection to isolation you end up isolated if you don 't cultivate the capacity for solitude the ability to
  be separate to gather yourself 
 solitude is where you find yourself so that you can reach out to other people and form real attachments 
 when we don 't have the capacity for solitude  we turn to other people in order to feel less anxious or in order to feel alive
  when this happens  we 're not able to appreciate who they are it 's as though we 're using them as spare parts to support our fragile sense of self  
 we slip into thinking that always being connected is going to make us feel
 less alone  but we 're at risk  because actually it 's the opposite that 's true if we 're not able to be alone
  we 're going to be more lonely  and if we don 't teach our children to be alone  they 're only going to know how to be lonely  
 when i spoke at ted in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six reporting on my studies of the early virtual communities  
 i said those who make the most of their lives on the screen
 come to it in a spirit of 
 and that 's what i 'm calling for here now  reflection and more than that
  conversation about where our current use of technology may be taking us us what it might be costing us  we 're smitten with technology 
 and we 're afraid like young lovers that too much talking might spoil the romance  but it 's time to talk  
 it 's early days  there 's plenty of time for us to reconsider how we use it how we build it 
 i 'm not suggesting that we turn away from our devices 
 just that we develop a more self aware relationship with them with each other and with ourselves  
 i see some first steps start thinking of solitude as a good thing
 make room for it 
 find ways to demonstrate this as a value to your children 
 create sacred spaces at home the kitchen the dining room and reclaim them for conversation 
 do the same thing at work at work  we 're so busy communicating that we often don 't have time to think 
 we don 't have 't have time to talk about the
  that really matter change that most important we all really need to listen to each other  
 including to the boring bits 
 because it 's when we stumble or hesitate or lose our words
 that we reveal ourselves to each other 
  technology is making a bid to redefine human connection
 how we care for each other  how we care for ourselves
 but it 's also giving us the opportunity to affirm our values and our direction  
 i 'm optimistic  we have everything we need to start we have each other  and we have the greatest chance of
  if we recognize our vulnerability that we listen when technology says it will take something complicated
 and promises something simpler  
 so in my work i hear that life is hard  relationships are filled with risk  and then there 's technology
 simpler  hopeful 
  it 's like calling in the cavalry  
 an ad campaign promises that online and with avatars you can 
 finally love your friends love your body love your life 
 online and with avatars 
 we 're drawn to virtual romance to computer games that seem like worlds to the idea that robots robots 
 will someday be our true companions
 we spend an evening on the social network instead of
 going to the pub with friends 
 but our fantasies of substitution have cost us now we all need to focus
 on the many many ways technology can lead us back
 to our real
  own bodies our own communities our own politics our own planet  they need us 
 let 's talk about how we can use digital technology the technology of our dreams 
 to make this life
 the life we can love thank you
