  share with you the story
 as to how i have become an hiv  aids campaigner and this is the name of my campaign sing campaign 
 in november of two thousand and three i was invited to take part in the launch of nelson
  mandela 's forty six thousand six hundred and sixty four foundation
 that is his hiv aids foundation and forty six thousand six hundred and sixty four is the number that mandela had when he was imprisoned in robben island 
 and that 's me with youssou n 'dour onstage  having the time of my life 
 the next day all the artists were invited to join mandela in robben island  where he was going to give a
  conference to the world 's press 
 standing in front of his former prison cell you can see the bars of the window there it
 was quite a momentous occasion for all of us in that moment in time mandela told the world 's press
 that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country that
 were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims the most vulnerable of all were women and children 
 this was a huge impact on my mind because i am a woman
 and i am a mother 
 and i hadn 't realized that the hiv aids pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way  and so i committed
 when i left south africa
 i left capetown i told myself this is going to be something that i have to talk about i have to serve and so subsequently i
 participated in every single forty six thousand six hundred and sixty four event that i could take part in
 and gave news conferences  interviews  talking and using my platform as a musician with my commitment to mandela out of respect
 for the tremendous  unbelievable work that he had done 
 everyone in the world respects nelson mandela everyone reveres nelson mandela 
 but do they all know about what has been taking place in south africa his country the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the
  i think that if i went out into the street now and i told people what was happening there  they would be shocked  i was very very fortunate
 a couple of years later to have met zackie achmat the founder of treatment action campaign an incredible campaigner and activist i met him at a forty six thousand six hundred and sixty four event he was wearing a t shirt like the one i wear now this is a tool
 this tells you i am in solidarity with people who have hiv people who are living with hiv
  and in a way because of the stigma by wearing this t shirt i say yes we can talk about this issue it doesn 't have to be in the closet 
 i became a member of treatment action campaign and i 'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization  it 's a grassroots campaign
 with eighty percent membership being women most of whom are
 they work in the field they have tremendous outreach to the people who are living
 directly with the effects of the virus  they have education programs  
 they bring out the issues of stigma  it 's quite extraordinary what they do and
 yes my sing campaign has
 supported treatment action campaign
 in the way that i have tried to raise awareness
 and to try to also raise funds a lot of the funding that i have managed to raise has gone directly to treatment action campaign and the incredible work that they do and are still continuing to do in south africa 
 so this is my sing campaign sing campaign is basically just me
 and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me  i 've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years i went to about twelve different
  countries here i am in oslo in norway getting a nice fat check
  singing in hong kong trying to get people to raise money 
 in johannesburg i had the opportunity to play to a mainly white middle class south african audience who ended up in tears because i use film clips that really touch the heart the 
  whole nature of this terrible tragedy that is taking place that people are tending to avoid because they are fatigued
  and they really don 't quite know what the solutions are 
 aaron motsoaledi the current health minister  
 attended that concert and i had an opportunity to meet with him  and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change  which is absolutely necessary 
 this is in the scottish parliament i 've subsequently become an envoy for scotland and hiv  and i was showing them my experiences and
  to again raise awareness and once again in edinburgh with the wonderful african children 's choir who i simply adore  and it 's children like this many of whom have been orphaned because of their
 family being affected by the aids
 virus i 'm sitting here in new york with michel sidibe he 's the director of
  very honored by the fact that michel invited me  
 only a few months ago to become a  unaids ambassador  and in this way  i 've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach 
 the message that unaids are currently sending out to the world
 is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by two thousand and
  it 's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will this can happen  and here i am with a
 pregnant woman who is hiv positive and we 're smiling both of us are smiling because we 're very confident because we know that that young woman is receiving
 treatment
 so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she 's about to give birth to and her baby
 baby will receive
 pmtct  which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus now that is prevention at the very beginning of life  
 it 's one way to start looking at intervention with the aids pandemic 
 now i just would like to finish off
 to tell you the little story
 about avelile this is avelile she goes with me wherever i go  i tell her story to everyone
 because she represents one of
  millions of hiv aids orphans avelile 's mother had hiv virus she
 died from aids related illness avelile had the virus she was born with the virus  
 and here she is at seven years old  
 weighing no more than a one year old baby at this point in her life she 's suffering with full blown aids and had
 pneumonia we met her in a hospital in the eastern cape
 and spent a whole afternoon with her an adorable child the doctors and nurses were phenomenal 
 they put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her 
 and we didn 't know when we left the hospital because we filmed her story we didn 't know if she was going to survive
  it was obviously it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience this one child you know that story 
 five months later we went back to south africa
 to meet avelile again  and i 'm getting
 the hairs on my i don 't know if you can see the hairs on my arms  they 're standing up because i know what i 'm going to show you this is the transformation that took place
 isn 't it extraordinary 
 that round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of avelile  and i take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation
  i would like to say to you each one in the in the audience if you feel
 that every mother
 and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care  
 and you believe that the millennium development goals specifically five and six should be
 absolutely committed to by all governments around the world
  could you please stand up  
 i think that 's fair to say it 's almost everyone in the hall thank you very much
