  our lives depend on a world we can 't see  
 think about your week so far have you watched tv  used gps  checked the weather or even ate a meal 
 these many things that enable our daily lives rely either directly
 or indirectly on satellites 
 and while we often take for granted the services that satellites provide us the satellites themselves deserve our attention as they are leaving a lasting mark on the space they occupy  
 people around the world rely on satellite infrastructure every day for information  entertainment and to communicate 
 there 's agricultural and environmental monitoring
  internet connectivity  navigation satellites even play a role in the operation of our financial and energy markets  
 but these satellites that we rely on day in and day out have a finite life 
 they might run out of propellant they could malfunction or they may just naturally reach the end of their mission life 
 at this point these satellites effectively become space
  junk cluttering the orbital environment 
 so imagine you 're driving down the highway on a beautiful sunny day out running errands you 've got your music cranked your windows rolled down with the cool breeze blowing through your hair  feels nice right  
 everything is going smoothly until suddenly your car stutters and stalls right in the middle of the highway  so now you have
  no choice but to abandon your car where it is on the highway 
 maybe you were lucky enough to be able to move it out of the way and into a shoulder lane so that it 's out of the way of other traffic 
 a couple of hours ago your car was a useful machine that you relied on in your everyday life  
 now it 's a useless hunk of metal taking up space in a valuable transportation network
  and imagine international roadways all cluttered with broken down vehicles that are just getting in the way of other traffic  
 and imagine the debris that would be strewn everywhere if a collision actually happened  
 thousands of smaller pieces of debris becoming new obstacles 
 this is the paradigm of the satellite
  satellites that are no longer working are often left to deorbit over many many years  or only moved out of the way as a temporary solution  
 and there are no international laws in space to enforce us to clean up after ourselves  
 so the world 's first satellite sputnik i was launched in 
 and in that year  there were only a total of three launch attempts
  decades later and dozens of countries from all around the world have launched thousands of more satellites into orbit  
 and the frequency of launches is only going to increase in the future  especially if you consider things like the possibility of 900 plus satellite constellations being launched 
 now we send satellites to different orbits depending on what they 're needed for 
 one of the most common places we send satellites is the low earth orbit  possibly to image the surface of earth at up to about two thousand
  kilometers altitude 
 satellites there are naturally buffeted by earth 's atmosphere so their orbits naturally decay  and they 'll eventually burn up probably within a couple of decades 
 another common place we send satellites is the geostationary orbit at about thirty five thousand kilometers altitude satellites there remain in
 same place above earth as the earth rotates which enables things like communications or television broadcast for example 
 satellites in high orbits like these could remain there for centuries  
 and then there 's the orbit coined the graveyard the ominous junk or disposal orbits where some satellites are intentionally placed at 
  the end of their life so that they 're out of the way of common operational orbits 
  launched since the late 
 only about one in seven is currently operational  
 and in addition to the satellites that are no longer working there 's also hundreds of thousands of marble sized debris and millions of paint chip sized debris that are also orbiting around the earth 
 space debris is a major risk to space
  also to the satellites that we rely on each and every day 
 now because space debris and junk has become increasingly worrisome there have been some national and international efforts to develop technical standards to help us limit the generation of additional debris 
 so for example  there are recommendations for those low earth orbiting spacecraft to be made to deorbit in under twenty five years  
 but that 's still a really long time especially if a satellite hasn 't been working for years
 there 's also mandates for those dead geostationary spacecraft to be moved into a graveyard orbit  
 but neither of these guidelines is binding under international law  and the understanding is that they will be implemented through national mechanisms 
 these guidelines are also not long term they 're not proactive  nor do they address the debris that 's already up there they 're only in place to limit the future
  creation of debris space junk is no one 's responsibility  
 now mount everest is actually an interesting comparison of a new approach to how we interact with our environments 
 as it 's often given the dubious honor of being the world 's highest garbage dump  
 decades after the first conquest of the world 's highest peak  tons of rubbish left behind by climbers has started to raise concern
 and you may have read in the news that there 's speculation that nepal will crack down on mountaineers with stricter enforcement of penalties and legal obligations 
 the goal of course is to persuade climbers to clean up after themselves  so maybe local  not for profits will pay climbers who bring down extra waste 
 or expeditions
  might organize voluntary cleanup trips 
 and yet still many climbers feel that independent groups should police themselves  
 there 's no simple or easy answer  and even well intentioned efforts at conservation often run into problems  
 but that doesn 't mean we shouldn 't do everything in our power to protect the environments that we rely and depend on 
  the remote location and inadequate infrastructure of the orbital environment make waste disposal a challenging problem  
 but we simply cannot reach new heights and create an even higher garbage dump  one that 's out of this world 
 the reality of space is that if a component on a satellite breaks down there really are limited opportunities for repairs  and only at
  but what if we were smarter about how we designed satellites what if all satellites regardless of what country they were built in had to be standardized in some way for recycling  servicing or active deorbiting 
 what if there actually were international laws with teeth that enforced end of life disposal of satellites instead of moving them out of the way as a temporary
  or maybe satellite manufacturers need to be charged a deposit to even launch a satellite into orbit  and that deposit would only be returned if the satellite was disposed of properly or if they cleaned up some quota of debris 
 or maybe a satellite needs to have technology on board to help accelerate deorbit 
 there are some encouraging signs the uk 's 
 launched in two thousand and fourteen for example was designed for
  a small drag sail  this works for the satellite because it 's small but satellites that are higher or in
 larger orbits or are larger altogether like the size of school buses will require other disposal options so maybe you get into things like high powered lasers or tugging using nets or tethers as crazy as those sound in the short
  and then one really cool possibility is the idea of orbital tow trucks or space mechanics 
 imagine if a robotic arm on some sort of space tow truck could fix the broken components on a satellite making them usable again 
 or what if that very same robotic arm could refuel the propellant tank on a spacecraft that relies on chemical propulsion just like you or i would refuel the fuel tanks on our cars
  robotic repair and maintenance could extend the lives of hundreds of satellites orbiting around the earth  
 whatever the disposal or cleanup options we come up with it 's clearly not just a technical problem  
 there 's also complex space laws and politics that we have to sort out 
 simply put we haven 't found a way to use space sustainably yet  
 exploring  innovating to change the way we live and work are what we as humans do  and in space exploration
 're literally moving beyond the boundaries of earth  
 but as we push thresholds in the name of learning and innovation we must remember that accountability for our environments never goes away  
 there is without doubt congestion in the low earth and geostationary orbits and we cannot keep launching new satellites to replace the ones that have broken down without doing something about them first just like we
  would never leave a broken down car in the middle of the highway  
 next time you use your phone  check the weather or use your gps  think about the satellite technologies that make those activities possible  
 but also think about the very impact that the satellites have on the environment surrounding earth and help spread the message that together we must reduce our impact 
 earth orbit is breathtakingly beautiful and our gateway to exploration it 's up to us to keep it that way
