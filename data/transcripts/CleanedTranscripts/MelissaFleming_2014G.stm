  i started working
 with refugees because i wanted to make a difference and making a difference starts with telling their stories 
 so when i meet refugees  i always ask them
  who bombed your house  who killed your son  did the rest of your family make it out alive 
 how are you coping
 in your life in exile  
 but there 's one question that always seems to me to be most revealing and that is what did you take 
 what was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the bombs were exploding in your town
  and the armed gangs were approaching your house  
 a syrian refugee boy i know told me that he didn 't hesitate when his life was in imminent danger 
 he took his high school diploma  and later he told me why  
 he said i took my high school diploma because my life depended on it
 and he would risk his life to get that diploma on his way to school he would dodge snipers 
 his classroom sometimes shook with the sound of bombs and shelling 
 and his mother told me every day  i would say to him every morning ' honey  
 please don 't go to school ' and when he insisted she said i would hug him as if it were for the last time 
 but he said to his mother we 're all afraid  
 but our determination to graduate is stronger than our fear 
 but one day  the family got terrible news hany 's aunt his uncle and his cousin were murdered in their homes for refusing to leave their house their throats
 were slit  it was time to flee 
 they left that day right away in their car hany hidden in the back because they were facing checkpoints of menacing soldiers  
 and they would cross the border into lebanon  where they would find peace  
 but they would begin a life of grueling hardship and monotony
 they had no choice but to build a shack on the side of a muddy field and this is hany 's brother ashraf who plays outside  and that day  they joined
 the biggest population of refugees in the world  in a country lebanon that is tiny
  it only has four million citizens  and there are one million syrian refugees living there there 's not a town a city or a village
 that is not host
 to syrian refugees 
 this is generosity and humanity that is remarkable 
 think about it this way proportionately
  it would be as if
 the entire population of germany  eighty million people 
 would flee to the united states in just three years 
 half of the entire population of syria is now uprooted 
 most of them inside the country six and a half million people
 have fled for their lives over and well over three million people have crossed the borders
  and have found sanctuary in the neighboring countries and only a small proportion as you see have moved on
 to europe  
 what i find most worrying is that half of all syrian refugees are children i took this picture of this little girl it was just two hours after she had arrived after a long trek from syria
 into jordan  and most troubling of all
 is that only twenty percent of syrian refugee children are in school
 in lebanon  and yet syrian refugee children all refugee children tell us
 education is the most important thing in their lives
  to think of their future rather than the nightmare of their past it allows them to think of hope rather than hatred  
 i 'm reminded of a recent visit i took to a syrian refugee camp in northern iraq  and i met this girl  
 and i thought she 's beautiful 
 and i went up to her and asked her can i take your picture 
 and she said yes
  but she refused to smile  i think she couldn 't because i think she must realize that she represents
 a lost generation of syrian refugee children a generation isolated
 and frustrated  and yet
  's home was also destroyed this will need to be rebuilt
 by architects by engineers by electricians  communities will need teachers and lawyers
 and politicians interested in reconciliation
 and not revenge
 shouldn 't this be rebuilt by the people with the largest stake 
 the societies in exile the refugees 
 refugees have a lot of time to prepare for their return 
 you might imagine that being a refugee is just a temporary state
  with wars going on and on the average time a refugee will spend in exile is seventeen years  
 hany was into his second year in limbo when i went to visit him recently  and we conducted our entire conversation in
  which he confessed to me he learned from reading all of dan brown 's novels
 and from listening to american rap 
 we also spent some nice moments of laughter and fun with his beloved brother ashraf  
 but i 'll never forget what he told me when we ended our conversation that day  
 he said to me if i am not a student  i am nothing
 hany is one of fifty million people
 uprooted in this world today  
 never since world war ii have so many people been forcibly displaced 
 so while we 're making sweeping progress in human
  education and design we are doing dangerously little to help the victims
 and we are doing far too little to stop and prevent the wars that are driving them from their homes  
 and there are more and more victims 
  on average by the end of this day thirty two thousand people will be forcibly displaced from their homes
 thirty two thousand people 
 they flee across borders like this one we captured this
 on the syrian border
 to jordan and this is a typical
  or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats  risking their lives in this case just to reach safety in europe 
 this syrian young man survived one of these boats that capsized most of the people drowned
 and he told us syrians are just looking for a quiet place
 where nobody hurts you
 where nobody humiliates you and where nobody kills you well i think that should be the minimum 
 how about a place of healing of learning  
 and even opportunity
  americans and europeans have the impression that proportionally huge
  numbers of refugees are coming to their country  but the reality is
 that eighty six percent the vast majority of refugees are living in the developing world 
 in countries struggling with their own insecurity 
 with their own issues of of helping their own populations and poverty  
 so wealthy countries in the world should recognize
  recognize
 the humanity and the generosity of the countries that are hosting so many refugees  
 and all countries should make sure that no one fleeing war and persecution arrives at a closed border
  but there is something more that we can do than just simply helping refugees survive  we can help them thrive 
 we should think of refugee camps and communities as more than just temporary population centers
 where people languish
 waiting for the war to end rather as
  centers of excellence where refugees can triumph over their trauma and train for the day that they can go home
 as agents of positive change
 and social
 transformation 
 it makes so much sense  but i 'm reminded of the terrible war in somalia that has been raging on
  for twenty two years 
 and imagine living in this camp  i visited this camp it 's in djibouti neighboring somalia and it was so remote
 that we had to take a helicopter to fly there it was dusty and it was terribly hot  and we went to visit a school
 and started talking to the children and then i saw this girl across the room who looked to me
  to be the same age as my own daughter  and i went up and talked to her 
 and i asked her the questions that  grown ups ask kids  like what is your favorite subject and what do you want to be when you grow up 
 and this is when her face turned blank  
 and she said to me i have no future my schooling days are over 
 and i thought there must be some misunderstanding
  so i turned to my colleague
 and she confirmed to me
 there is no funding for secondary education in this camp  
 and how i wished at that moment that i could say to her we will build you a school 
 and i also thought what a waste  she should be and she is the future of somalia
 a boy named jacob  atem
 had a different chance but not before he experienced terribly tragedy  
 he watched this is in sudan as his village he was only seven years old burned to the ground and he learned
 that his mother and his father and his entire family
 were killed that day  only his cousin survived and the two of
  them walked for seven months this is boys like him
 chased and pursued by wild animals and armed gangs and they finally made it to refugee camps where they found safety  and he would spend the next seven years
 in kenya in a refugee camp  but his life changed
 when he got the chance to be resettled to the united states  and he found love in a foster
  family
 and he was able to go to school 
 and he wanted me to share with you this proud moment when he graduated from university 
 i spoke to him on skype the other day and he was in his new university in florida
 pursuing his
  public health  and he proudly told me how he was able to raise enough funds from the american public
 to establish a health clinic back in his village back home 
 so i want to take you back to hany 
 when i told him i was going to have the chance to speak to you here on the ted stage he allowed me to read you a poem
 that he sent in an email to me he wrote 
 i miss myself  my friends  
 times of reading novels or writing poems  birds and tea in the morning
  my room my books myself  and everything that was making me smile  
 oh oh i had so many dreams that were about to be realized 
 so here is my point not investing in refugees is a huge missed opportunity
  leave them abandoned  and they risk
 exploitation and abuse  
 and leave them unskilled and uneducated  
 and delay by years the return to peace and prosperity in their countries
  i believe how we treat the uprooted
 will shape the future
 of our world 
 the victims of war can hold the keys to lasting peace 
 and it 's the refugees who can stop the cycle of violence 
 hany is at a tipping point  we would love to help him go to university and to become
  but our funds are prioritized for the basics in life tents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets  food rations
 and a bit of medicine 
 university is a luxury  
 but leave him to languish in this muddy field  and he will become a member of a lost
  but it doesn 't have to end that way  thank you
