  like to start tonight by something completely different  asking you to join me by stepping off the land and
 jumping into the open ocean for a moment ninety percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean
  and it 's where life the title of
 our seminar tonight it 's where life began  and it 's a lively and a lovely place but we 're rapidly changing the oceans with our
 not only with our our overfishing our irresponsible fishing 
 our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland  but also most recently with climate change and steve schneider i 'm sure
  will be going into greater detail on this now as we continue to tinker with the oceans 
 more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we 're creating will be conducive to low energy type of animals like jellyfish and bacteria  
 and this might be the kind of seas we 're headed for 
 now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful  and you 'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the
  aquarium on friday  but they sting like hell  and
 jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up about one hundred grams of jellyfish equals
 four calories  so it may be good for the waistline but it probably won 't keep you satiated for very long
  and a sea that 's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn 't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans that is unless you eat jellyfish 
 and this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there a by the wind sailor  
 and that predator is
 the giant ocean sunfish the mola mola whose primary prey
  the guinness world book of records for being the world 's heaviest bony fish it reaches up to almost five thousand pounds
 on a diet of jellyfish primarily  
 and i think it 's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the mola mola its common name is sunfish that its favorite food is
 the moon jelly  so it 's kind of nice the sun and the moon getting together this way  even if one is eating the other
 now this is typically how you see
 see sunfish this is where they get their common name they like to sunbathe  can 't blame them they just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think they 're sick or lazy  but that 's a typical behavior they lie out and bask on the surface 
  mola mola 
 is it sounds hawaiian  but it 's actually latin for millstone  and that 's attributable to their roundish very bizarre cut off shape it 's as if as they were growing they just forgot the tail part  
 and that 's actually what drew me to the mola in the first place was this terribly bizarre shape  
 you know you look at sharks
  and they 're streamlined and they 're sleek and you look at tuna  and they 're like torpedoes they just give away their agenda they 're about
 migration and strength and then you look at
 the sunfish 
 and this is just so
 elegantly mysterious it 's just it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than
  so i was just intrigued with what you know 
 what is this animal 's story  
 well as with anything in biology  nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution the mola 's no exception they appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared
 sixty five million years ago at a time when whales still had legs  and
 they come from a rebellious little puffer fish
  faction
 oblige me a little kipling esque storytelling here of course evolution is somewhat random and you know
 about fifty five million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said oh the heck with the coral reefs we 're going to head to the high seas 
 and  lots of generations lots of tweaking and torquing  and we turn
  if you give mother nature enough time that is what she will produce  
 they look maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished abridged perhaps but
 in fact in fact they are the they vie for the top position of the most
  fish in the sea right up there with
  thing about that that fish has been changed  and in terms of fishes fishes appeared five hundred million years ago  and they 're pretty modern just fifty million years ago so
 so interestingly  they give away their ancestry as they develop  they start as little eggs  
 and they 're in the guinness world book of records again for having the
  most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet a single four foot female had
 three hundred million eggs can carry three hundred million eggs in her ovaries imagine and they get to be over ten feet long imagine what a ten foot one has 
 and from that little egg  they pass through this spiky
  porcupine fish stage  reminiscent of their ancestry and develop this is their little adolescent stage  they school as adolescents and
 become behemoth loners as adults  that 's a little diver up there in the corner they
 're in the guinness world book of records again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world from their little hatching size of their egg into their little larval stage
 till they reach adulthood they put on six hundred
  million times an increase in weight six hundred million now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby 
 and you had to feed this thing 
 that would mean that your child you would expect it to gain the weight of six titanics
  feed a child like that but
 we don 't know how fast the molas grow in
 in the wild but captive growth studies at the monterey bay aquarium one of the first places to have them in captivity they had one
 that gained eight hundred lbs in fourteen months  i said now that 's a true american
  in today 's seas because schooling used to be salvation for fishes but it 's suicide for fishes now but unfortunately molas  even though they don 't school they still get caught in nets as by catch 
 if we 're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination then we 've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators how they live their lives like the mola
  and unfortunately they make up a large portion of the california by catch up to twenty six percent of the drift net and in the mediterranean in the
 swordfish net fisheries  they make up up to ninety percent so
 we 've got to figure out how they 're living their lives  
 and how do you do that how do you do that with an animal very few places in the world this is an open ocean creature it knows no boundaries it doesn 't go to land how do you
 get insight how do you
  seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets  
 well there 's some great new technology that has just recently become available and it 's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals  and it 's pictured right here 
 that little tag up there  that little tag
 can
  and light intensity which is correlated with time and from that we can get locations  
 and it can record this data for up to two years and keep it in that tag release at a pre programmed time  float to the surface  upload all 
  that data that whole travelogue to satellite which relays it directly to our computers  and we 've got that whole dataset  and we didn 't even have we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and
  so the great thing about the mola is that when we put the tag on them if you look up here that 's streaming off that 's right where we put the tag  
 and it just so happens that 's a parasite hanging off the the mola molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites they 're just parasite hotels  
 even their parasites have parasites  
 i think donne wrote
  they have forty genera of parasites  and so we figured just one more parasite won 't be too much of a problem and they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment
  they don 't seem to mind  so far  
 so what are we trying to find out we 're focusing on the pacific we 're tagging on the california coast and we 're tagging over in taiwan and japan and we 're interested in
  how these animals are using the currents using temperature  using the open ocean to live their lives  
 we 'd love to tag in monterey monterey is one of the few places in the world where molas come in large numbers 
 not this time of year it 's more around october  and we 'd love to tag here this is an aerial shot of monterey but unfortunately the molas here
 end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes molas but in the wrong way  the california sea lion takes
  the molas as soon as they come into the bay rips off their fins  fashions them into the ultimate frisbee mola style  and then tosses them back and forth  
 and i 'm not exaggerating it is just and sometimes they don 't eat them it 's just spiteful  
 and you know 
 the locals think it 's terrible behavior
  it 's just horrible watching this happen day after day the poor little molas coming in getting ripped to shreds so
 we head down south to san diego not so many california sea lions down there  
 and the molas there  you can find them with a spotter plane very easily and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp  
 and under those kelps this is why the molas come there because it 's spa time for the molas there  as soon as they get under those rafts of kelp
  cleaner fish come 
 and they come and give the molas you can see they strike this funny little position that says i 'm not threatening but i need a massage 
 and they 'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head and the fish come up and they just clean clean clean because the
  just a smorgasbord of parasites  
 and it 's also a great place to go down south because the water 's warmer  
 and the molas are kind of friendly down there  i mean what other kind of fish if you approach it right will say okay  scratch me right there 
 you truly can swim up to a mola they 're very gentle and if you approach them right you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it 
 so we 've also tagged one part of the pacific we 've gone over to another part of the pacific and we 've tagged in taiwan and we
  tagged in japan 
 and over in these places the molas are caught in set nets that line these countries  
 and they 're not thrown back as by catch they 're eaten we were served a nine course meal of mola after we tagged  
 well not the one we tagged  
 and everything from the kidney to the
  to the back bone to the fin muscle to i think that s pretty much the whole fish
 is eaten  
 so the hardest part of tagging now is after you put that tag on you have to wait 
 months  and
 you 're just wondering oh i hope the fish is safe i hope i hope it 's going to be able to actually
  live its life out during the course that the tag is recording the tags cost three thousand five hundred dollars each  
 and then satellite time is another five hundred dollars so you 're like oh i hope the tag is okay  and so the waiting is really the hardest part
  i 'm going to show you our latest dataset  and it hasn 't been published  so it 's totally privy information just for ted
 and in showing
 looking at this data we 're thinking  oh do these animals do they cross the equator do they go from one side of the pacific to the other  and we found that they kind of are homebodies they
 're not big migrators this is their track we deployed the the tag off of tokyo and the mola in one month kind of got into the kuroshio current off of japan
 and foraged there  and after four months
  you know  off of the north part of japan and that 's kind of their home range now that 's important though because if there 's a lot of fishing pressure  that population doesn 't get replenished  so that 's a very important piece of data  
 but also what 's important is that
 they 're not slacker lazy fish they 're super
 super industrious and this is a day in the life of a mola and if we
 they 're up and down and up and down and up and down and up and up and down up to forty times a day 
 as the sun comes up you see in the blue  they start their dive 
 down and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper little deeper  they plumb the depths down to six hundred meters in temperatures to one degree centigrade  
 and this is why you see them on the surface it 's so cold down there  they 've got to come up warm
  that solar power  and then plunge back into the depths and go up and down and up and down and they 're hitting a layer down there it 's called the deep scattering layer which a whole
 variety of food 's in that layer so
 rather than just being some sunbathing slacker  they 're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through
 through temperature we see the same
  pattern now with these tags we 're seeing a similar pattern for for swordfishes manta rays tunas
  a real three dimensional play 
 this is part of a much larger program called the census of marine life where they 're going to be tagging all over the world
 and the mola 's going to enter into that and what 's exciting you all travel and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals
  and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge  well now with the census of marine life we 'll be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore ninety percent of our living space 
 with local knowledge it 's never it 's really never been a more exciting or a vital time to be a biologist
