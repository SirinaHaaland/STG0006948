  virtual reality started for me in sort of an unusual place it was the 
 i got into the field very young i was seven years old  and
  this was my joy back then  i rode this motorcycle everywhere  and i was there with evel knievel we jumped the snake river canyon
  i wanted the rocket  i never got the rocket i only got the motorcycle
 i felt so connected to this world i didn 't want to be a storyteller when i grew up i wanted to be stuntman
  i was there  evel knievel was my friend  i had so much empathy for him  
 but
 it didn 't work out i went to art school 
  beginning of a filmmaker  and i started using the tools that are available to me as a filmmaker
 to try to tell the most compelling stories that i can to an audience 
 and film is this incredible medium that allows us to feel empathy for people that are very different than us and worlds completely foreign from our own  
 unfortunately  evel knievel did not feel the same empathy for us that we felt for him  and he sued us for this video
  the upside the man that
 i worshipped as a child the man that i wanted to become as an adult  i was finally able to get his autograph 
  but essentially it 's the same now as it was then  it 's a group of rectangles that are played in a sequence  
 and we 've done incredible things with those rectangles  
 but
 i started thinking about is there a way that i can use modern and developing technologies to tell stories in different ways
 and tell different kinds of stories that maybe i couldn
  't tell using the traditional tools of filmmaking that we 've been using for one hundred years so
 i started experimenting  and what i was trying to do was to build the ultimate empathy machine
  and here 's one of the early experiments 
  was a collaboration
 with arcade fire it asked you to put in the address where you grew up at the beginning of it it 's a website  and out of it starts growing these
 little boxes with different browser windows  
 and you see this teenager running down a street and then you see google street view and google maps imagery and you realize the street he 's running down is yours  
 and when he stops in front of a house  he stops in front of your house
  and this was great and i saw people having an even deeper emotional reaction to this than the things that i had made in rectangles  
 and i 'm essentially taking a piece of your history
 and putting it inside the framing of the story  but then i started thinking okay well that 's a part of you  but how do i put
 i put all of you inside of the frame so to do that i started making art installations  and this is one
  the treachery of sanctuary it 's a triptych i 'm going to show you the third panel
  inside of the frame  and
 i saw people having even more visceral emotional reactions to this work than the previous one  
 but then i started thinking about frames  and what do they represent  and a frame is just a window 
  i mean all the media that we watch television cinema they 're these windows into these other worlds  
 and i thought  well great i got you in a frame but i don 't want you in the frame i don 't want you in the window i want you through the window i want you on the other side 
 in the world inhabiting the world 
 so that
 leads me back to virtual reality  let 's talk about virtual reality  
 unfortunately talking about virtual reality is like dancing about architecture
  and this is actually someone dancing about architecture in virtual reality 
 so  it 's difficult to explain why is it difficult to explain it 's difficult because it 's a very experiential medium
  you feel your way inside of it it 's a machine but inside of
  it feels like real life  it feels like truth  and you feel present in the world that you 're inside and you feel present with the people that you 're inside of it with 
 so 
 i 'm going to show you a demo of a virtual reality film 
 a full screen version of all the information that we capture when we shoot virtual reality  so we 're shooting in every direction this is a camera system that we built
 that has 3d cameras that look in every direction and binaural microphones that face in every direction we take this and we
  build basically a sphere of a world that you inhabit 
 so what i 'm going to show you is not a view into the world it 's basically the whole world stretched into a rectangle  
 so this film is called clouds over sidra 
 and it was made in conjunction with our virtual reality company called  vrse and the united nations and
  we went to a syrian refugee camp in jordan in december and shot the story of a 12 year old girl there named sidra  
 and she and her family fled syria through the desert into jordan and she 's been living in this
 camp for the last year and a half
  camp in jordan for the last year and a half i have
 a big family  three brothers one is a baby he cries a lot  
 i asked my father if i cried when i was a baby and he says i did not i think i was a stronger baby than my brother
 so when you 're inside of the headset you 're not seeing it like this  you 're looking around through this world you 'll notice you
 see full three hundred and sixty degrees in all directions
  and when you 're sitting there in her room watching her  you 're not watching it through a television screen you 're not watching it through a window  you
  you 're sitting there with her when you look down  you 're sitting on the same ground that she 's sitting on  
 and because of that you feel her humanity in a deeper way
  you empathize with her in a deeper way  and
 i think that we can change minds with this machine  and we 've already started to try to
  so we took this film to the world economic forum in davos
 in january  and we showed it to a group of people whose decisions
 affect the lives of millions of people and these are people who might not otherwise be sitting
 in a tent in a refugee camp in jordan  but
 in january  one afternoon in switzerland they suddenly all found themselves there
 and they were affected by it 
 so we 're going to make more of them 
 we 're working with the united nations
 right now to shoot a whole series of these films we just finished shooting a story in liberia  and now we 're going to shoot a story in india
 and we 're taking these films  
 and we 're showing them at the united nations to people that work there and people that are visiting there 
 and we 're showing them to the people that can actually change the lives of the people inside of the films  
 and that 's where i think we just start to scratch the surface
 of the true power of
  it 's not a video game peripheral it connects humans to other humans
 in a profound way that i 've never seen before in any other form of media and it can change people 's perception of each other 
 and that 's how i think virtual reality has the potential to actually change the world  
 so  it 's a machine
  but through this machine we become
 more compassionate we become more empathetic  and we become
 more connected and ultimately we become more human
 thank you
