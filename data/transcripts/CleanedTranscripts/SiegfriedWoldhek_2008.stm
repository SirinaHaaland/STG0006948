  good morning let 's look for a minute
 at the greatest icon of all leonardo da vinci we 're all familiar with his fantastic work his drawings his paintings his inventions his writings
  but we do not know his face thousands of books have been written about him
 but there 's controversy  and it remains about his looks 
 even this  well known portrait is not accepted by many art historians so what do you think 
 is this the face of leonardo da vinci or isn 't it 
 let 's find out 
 leonardo was a man that drew everything
  but no faces  i find that hard to believe his contemporaries made faces like the ones you see here en face 
 so surely a passionate drawer like leonardo must have made self portraits from time to time  
 so let 's try to find them i think that if we were to scan all of his work
 and look for
 self portraits we would find his face looking at us 
 so i looked at all of his drawings more than seven hundred 
 and looked for male portraits there are about one hundred and twenty you see them here 
 which ones of these could be self portraits well for that they have to be done as we just saw en face or
  so we can eliminate all the profiles 
 it also has to be sufficiently detailed  so we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized  
 and we know from his contemporaries that leonardo was a very handsome even beautiful man so we can also eliminate the ugly ones
 or the caricatures and look what happens only three candidates remain that fit
  and here they are 
 yes indeed the old man is there 
 as is this famous pen drawing of the homo  vitruvianus and lastly the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted the musician  
 before we go into these faces  i should explain why i have some right to talk about them  
 i 've made more than one thousand one hundred portraits myself for newspapers over the course of three hundred thirty years sorry thirty
  but there are one thousand one hundred and very few artists have drawn so many faces so i know a little about drawing and analyzing faces  
 ok  now let 's look at these three portraits and hold onto your seats because if we zoom in on those faces  
 remark how they have the same broad forehead the horizontal eyebrows the long nose the curved lips and the small well developed chin  
 i couldn 't believe my eyes when i first saw that there is no reason why these portraits should look alike all we did was look for portraits
  that had the characteristics of a self portrait and look they are very similar  now 
 are they made in the right order the young man should be made first and as you see here from the years that they were created it is indeed the case they are made in the right order  what was the age of leonardo at the time does that fit yes it does he was 
  when these were made so we have three pictures  potentially of the same person of the same age
  as leonardo at the time  
 but how do we know it 's him  and not someone else  well we need a reference  and here 's the only the only picture of leonardo that 's widely accepted it 's
 a statue made by verrocchio of david for which leonardo posed as a boy of fifteen and if we now compare the face of the statue with the face of the musician
  you see the very same features again the statue is the reference and it connects the identity of leonardo to those three faces
