  i coined my own definition definition of success in one thousand nine hundred and thirty four when i was teaching at a high school in south bend indiana  being a little bit
 disappointed and [ disillusioned ] perhaps by the way parents of the youngsters in my english classes expected their youngsters
 to
 get an a or a  b they thought a c was all right for the neighbors ' children because they were all average
  but they weren 't satisfied when their own it would make the teacher feel that they had
 failed or the youngster had failed and that 's not right the good lord in his infinite wisdom didn 't create us all equal as far as intelligence is concerned any more than we 're equal for size
  not everybody could earn an a or a b and i didn 't like that way of judging and i did know how
 the alumni of various schools back in the ' 30s judged coaches and athletic teams  if you won them all you were considered to be reasonably successful
 not completely  because i found out
 we had a number of years at ucla where we didn 't lose a game  but it seemed that we didn 't win each individual game by the margin that some of our alumni had predicted
 quite frequently i really felt that they had backed up their predictions in a more materialistic
 manner but
 that was true back in the 30s so i understood that but i didn 't like it i didn 't agree with it i wanted to come up with something i hoped could make me a better teacher  
 and give the youngsters under my supervision be it in athletics or the english classroom
  aspire other than just a higher mark in the classroom or more points in some athletic contest i thought about that for quite a spell and
 i wanted to come up with my own definition i thought that might help  and
 i knew how mr webster defined it as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of a position of power or prestige or something
 of that sort worthy accomplishments perhaps but in my
  opinion not necessarily indicative of success  so i wanted to come up with something of my own and i recalled
 i was raised on a small farm in southern indiana and dad tried to teach me and my brothers that you should never try to be better than someone else  
 i 'm sure at the time
 he did that i didn 't it didn 't well somewhere i guess in the hidden recesses of the mind it popped out years later never try to be better than someone else
  learn from others
 never cease trying to be the best you can be that 's under your control  
 if you get too engrossed and involved and concerned in regard to the things over which you have no control  it will adversely affect the things over which you have control  
 then i ran across this simple verse that said at god 's footstool to confess a poor soul knelt and bowed his head ' i failed ' he cried  the master said ' thou didst thy best
 that is success ' from those things and one other perhaps  i coined my own definition of success which is peace of mind attained only through 
  in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you 're capable  i believe that 's true  
 if you make the effort to do the best of which you 're capable trying to improve the situation that exists for you i think that 's success and i don 't think others can judge that it 's like character
  reputation
 your reputation is what you 're perceived to be 
 your character is what you really are and i think that character is much more important than what you are perceived to be you 'd hope they 'd both be
 good but they won 't necessarily be the same 
 well that was my idea that i was going to try to get across to the youngsters i ran across other things i love to teach and it was mentioned
 by the previous
  speaker that that i enjoy poetry and i dabble in it a bit and love it there are some things that helped me i think be better than i would have been i know i 'm not what i ought to be  what i should be but i think i 'm better than i would have been if i hadn 't run across certain things 
 one was just a little verse that said
 no written word no spoken plea can teach our youth what they should be
  nor all the books on all the shelves it 's what the teachers are themselves that made an impression on me 
 and i tried to use that more or less in my teaching whether it be in sports or whether it be in the english classroom 
 i love poetry and always had an interest in that somehow maybe it 's because dad used
  to read to us at night by coal oil lamp we didn 't have electricity
 in our farm home and dad would read poetry to us so i always liked it and about the same time  i ran across this one verse i ran across another one 
 someone asked
 a lady teacher why she taught and after some time she said she wanted to think about that then she came up and said 
 they ask me why i teach and i reply
  ' where could i find such splendid company ' there sits a statesman strong  unbiased wise another daniel webster silver tongued 
 a doctor sits beside him whose quick steady hand may mend a bone or stem the life blood 's flow 
 and there a builder  upward rise the arch of a church he builds wherein that minister may speak the
 word of god and lead a stumbling soul to touch the christ and all about a gathering of teachers farmers merchants laborers
 those who work and vote and build and plan and pray into a great tomorrow  and i may say 
 i may not see the church or hear the word or eat the food their hands may grow but yet again i may 
 and later i may say i knew him once  and he was weak or strong or bold or proud or gay i knew him once but then he was a boy  
 they ask me why i teach and i reply ' where could i find such
  splendid company ' and i believe the teaching profession it 's true you have so many youngsters and i 've got to think of my youngsters 
 attorneys  eleven dentists and doctors  many many teachers and other professions and that that
 gives you a great deal of pleasure to see them go on i always tried to make the youngsters feel that they 're there to get an
  education number one basketball was second because it was paying their way  and they do need a little time for social activities but you let social activities take a
 little precedence over the other two and you 're not going to have any
 very long so that was the idea that i tried
 to get across
 to the youngsters under my supervision  i had three rules pretty much that i stuck with practically all the time i 'd learned these prior to coming
  to ucla and i decided they were very important one was never be late  
 later on i said certain things 
 the players if we were leaving for somewhere had to be neat and clean there was a time when i i made them wear jackets and
  then i saw our chancellor coming to school in
 denims and turtlenecks and thought it 's not right for me to keep this other [ rule ] so i let them just they had to be neat and clean
 i had one of my greatest players that you probably heard of bill walton  
 he came to catch the bus we were leaving for somewhere to play and he wasn 't clean and neat  so
 i wouldn 't let him go he couldn 't get on the bus he had to go home and and get cleaned up to get to the airport
  was a stickler for that i believed in that i believe in time very important  
 i believe you should be on time  but i felt at practice for example we start on time we close on time the youngsters didn 't have to
 feel that we were going to keep them over when i speak at coaching clinics i often tell young coaches and at coaching clinics more or less they 'll be the younger coaches getting in
 the profession
  tell them don 't run practices late  
 because you 'll go home in a bad mood  and that 's not good for a young married man to go home in a bad mood  when you get older
 it doesn 't make any difference but 
 so i did believe on time i believe starting on time and i believe closing on time  
 and another one i had was not one word of profanity one word of profanity and you
 are out of here for the day if i see it in a game you 're going to come out and sit on the bench  and the third one was never criticize a teammate 
 i didn 't want that i used to tell them i was paid to do that that 's my job i 'm paid to do it  pitifully poor  but i am paid to do it not like the coaches today for gracious sakes no
 it 's a little different than
  working hard and enjoying what you 're doing coming up to the apex
  according to my definition of success and right at the top  faith and patience and i say to you in whatever you 're doing  
 you must be patient  you have to have patience to
 we want things to happen we talk
 about our youth being impatient a lot
  they are they want to change everything they think all change is progress and we get a little older we sort of
 let things go and we forget there is no progress without change  so you must have patience and i believe that we must have faith  i believe that we must believe truly believe
 not just give it word service believe that things will work out as they should  providing we do what we should i think our tendency is to hope
 things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time but we don 't do the things that
 are necessary to make those things
 become reality  i worked on this for some fourteen years and i think it helped me become
 a better teacher but it all revolved around that original definition
 of success  you know a number of years ago there was a major league baseball umpire by the name of george moriarty he spelled moriarty with only one ' i ' i 'd never seen that before but he
 did big league baseball players they 're very perceptive about those things and they noticed he had only one ' i ' in his name  you 'd be surprised how many
 also told him that  that was one more than he had in his head at various times 
 but he wrote something where i think he did what i tried to do in this pyramid he called
  the road ahead or the road behind he said sometimes i think the fates must grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we can 't win is
 the fates themselves have missed  yet there lives on the ancient claim we win or lose within ourselves the shining trophies on our shelves
 can never win tomorrow 's game you and i know deeper down there 's always a chance to win the crown but when we fail to give our best we simply haven 't met the test of giving all and saving none until the game is really won 
 of showing what is meant by grit 
 of playing through
  when others quit of
 playing through not letting up it 's bearing down that wins the cup of dreaming there 's a goal ahead of hoping when our dreams are dead of praying when our hopes have fled yet losing 
 not afraid to fall if bravely we have given all for who can ask more of a man
 than giving all within his span giving all it seems to me is not so far from victory  and so the fates are seldom wrong no matter how they twist and
  wind it 's you and i who make our fates
 we open up or close the gates on the road ahead or the road behind 
 reminds me of another set of threes that my dad tried to get across to us don 't whine don 't complain don 't make excuses just get out there and whatever you 're doing do it to the best of your ability and
 no one can do
 more than that i tried to get across too that my opponents will tell you you never heard me mention winning
 never mention winning my idea is that
 you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game  
 and you can win when you 're outscored i 've felt that way on certain occasions at various times  and i just wanted them to
 be able to hold their head up after a game i used to say that when when a game is over and you see somebody that didn 't know the outcome i hope they
  couldn 't tell by your actions
 whether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you
 that 's what really matters if you make an effort to do the best you can regularly 
 the results will be about what they should be not necessarily what you 'd want them to be but they 'll be about what they should only you will know whether you can do that and that 's what i wanted from them
 more than anything
  else and as time went by and i learned more about other things i think it worked a little better as far as the results but i wanted
 the score of a game to be the byproduct
 of these other things and not the end itself  i believe it was
 one great philosopher who
  and i like that i think that it is it 's getting there  sometimes when you get there there 's almost a let down  but it 's the getting there that 's the fun as a basketball coach at ucla i liked our practices to be the journey 
 and the game would be the end the end result i liked to go up and sit in the stands and watch the players play and see whether i 'd done a decent job
  during the week  there again it 's getting the players to get that self satisfaction in knowing that they 'd made the effort to do the best
 of which
 they are capable  
 sometimes i 'm asked who was the best player i had or the best teams i can never answer that  
 as far as the individuals are concerned i
  i was asked one time
 about that and they said suppose that you in some way could
 make the perfect player what would you want 
 and i said well i 'd want one that knew why he was at ucla to get an education he was a good student really knew why he was there in the first place  but i 'd want one 
 i 'd want one to realize that that defense usually wins championships
  work hard on defense  but i 'd want one who would play offense too i 'd want him to be unselfish and
 look for the pass first and not shoot all the time  and
 i 'd want one that could pass and would pass i 've had some that could and wouldn 't and i 've had some that would and could 
  and i wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside  i wanted them to be good inside too i 'd
 want them to
 be able to rebound well at both ends too why not just take someone like
 keith wilkes and let it go at that he had the qualifications not the only one but he was one that i used in that particular category because i think he
 he made the effort to become the best there was a couple i mention in my book they call me coach
 two players that gave me great satisfaction that came as close as i think anyone i ever had to reach their full potential one was conrad burke  and one was doug mcintosh when i saw them
 as freshmen on our freshmen team freshmen couldn 't play varsity when i taught  
 i thought oh gracious if these two players either one of them they were different years but i thought about each one at the time he was there oh if he ever makes
  our varsity must be pretty miserable  if he 's good enough to make it and you know one of them was a starting player for a
 season and a half the other one 
 his next year played thirty two minutes in a national championship game did a tremendous job for us the next year he was a starting
 a starting player on the national championship
  and here i thought he 'd never play a minute  when he was so those are the things that give you
 great joy  and great satisfaction to see neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well  
 but they had outstanding shooting percentages because they didn 't force it  
 and neither one could jump very well
 but they kept good position  and so they did well rebounding they remembered that
 that every shot that 's taken they assumed would be missed i 've had too many stand around and wait to see if it 's missed
  then they go and it 's too late somebody else is in there ahead  of them they weren 't very quick but they played good position kept in good balance
 and so they they played pretty good defense for us so they had qualities that they came close to
 as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players i ever had so i consider them to be as successful as
  or bill walton  or many of the others that we had there were some outstanding
 players have i rambled enough i was told that when he makes his appearance
