  when i was a kid  i hid my heart under the bed because my mother said
  careful someday someone 's going to break it 
 take it from me under the bed is not a good hiding spot  
 i know because i 've been shot down so many times i get altitude sickness just from standing up for myself 
 but that 's what we were told stand up for yourself and that 's hard to do if you don 't know who you are
  we were expected to define ourselves at such an early age  
 and if we didn 't do it others did it for us geek fatty  slut  fag  
 and at the same time we were being told what we were  we were being asked what do you want to be
 when you grow up 
 i always thought that was an unfair question it presupposes that we can 't be what we already are we were kids  when i was a kid i wanted to be a man
  i wanted a registered retirement savings plan that would keep me in candy long enough to make old age sweet 
 when i was a kid i wanted to shave now not so much 
 when i was eight  i wanted to be a marine biologist  when i was nine i saw the movie jaws and thought to myself no thank you and
 when i was ten i was told that my parents left because
  me  when i was eleven i wanted to be left alone when i was twelve i wanted to die when i was thirteen i wanted to kill a kid  
 when i was fourteen i was asked to seriously consider a career path  
 i said i 'd like to be a writer and they said choose something realistic so i said professional wrestler 
 and they said don 't be
  they asked me what i wanted to be  then told me what not to be  and i wasn 't the only one 
 we were being told that we somehow must become what we are not sacrificing what we are to inherit the masquerade of what we will be 
 i was being told to accept the identity that others will give me 
 and i wondered what made my dreams so easy to dismiss  
 granted my dreams are shy because they 're canadian
 my dreams are self conscious and overly apologetic they
 're standing alone at the high school dance and they 've never been kissed 
 see my dreams got called names too 
 silly foolish  impossible  but i kept dreaming  i was going to be a wrestler i had it all figured out i was going to be the garbage
  move was going to be the trash compactor my saying was going to be
 i thought to myself what now where do i turn poetry 
 like a boomerang the thing i loved came back to me one
 of the first lines of poetry i can remember writing was in response to a world that demanded i hate myself from age fifteen to eighteen i hated myself for becoming the thing that i loathed 
 a bully 
  was nineteen i wrote i will love myself despite the ease with which i lean toward the opposite standing up for yourself
 doesn 't have to mean embracing violence  
 when i was a kid  i traded in homework assignments for friendship 
 then gave each friend a late slip for never showing up on time and in most cases not at all i gave myself a hall pass to get through each
  broken promise  and i remember this plan born out of frustration from a kid who kept calling me yogi then pointed at my tummy and said too many picnic baskets 
 turns out it 's not that hard to trick someone and one day before class i said yeah you can copy my homework 
 and i gave him all the wrong answers that i 'd written down the night before he got
  and couldn 't believe it when he looked across the room at me and held up a zero  
 i knew i didn 't have to hold up my paper of twenty eight out of thirty  
 but my satisfaction was complete when he looked at me puzzled and i thought to myself smarter than the average bear motherfucker 
 this is who i am this is how i stand up for myself
  when i was a kid  i used to think that pork chops and karate chops were the same thing 
 i thought they were both pork chops my grandmother thought it was cute and because they were my favorite she let me keep doing it 
 not really a big deal one day before i realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees  i fell out of a tree
 and bruised the right side of my body  i didn 't want to tell my grandmother because i was
  scared i 'd get in trouble for playing somewhere i shouldn 't have been
 the gym teacher noticed the bruise and i got sent to the principal 's office 
 from there i was sent to another small room with a really nice lady who asked me all kinds of questions about my life at home  
 i saw no reason to lie
 as far as i was concerned life was pretty good i told her whenever i 'm sad my grandmother gives me karate chops
 this led to a full scale investigation  
 and i was removed from the house for three days  until they finally decided to ask how i got the bruises  
 news of this silly little story quickly spread through the school and i earned my first nickname
 i hate pork chops i
 'm not the only kid who grew up this way  
 surrounded by people who used to say that rhyme about sticks and stones  
 as if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called and we got called them all 
 so we grew up believing no one would ever fall
 fall in love with us 
 that we 'd be lonely forever that we 'd never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their toolshed 
 so broken heartstrings bled the blues and we tried to empty ourselves so we 'd feel nothing don 't tell me that hurts less than a broken bone 
 that an ingrown life is something surgeons can cut away that there 's no way for it to metastasize it does 
 she was eight years old our first day of grade three when she got called
  we both got moved to the back of class so we would stop getting bombarded by spitballs  
 but the school halls were a battleground we found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day  we used to stay inside for recess because outside was worse 
 outside we 'd have to rehearse running away or learn to stay still like statues giving no clues that we were there in grade five  
 they taped a sign to the front of her desk that read beware of dog 
 to this day despite a loving husband she doesn 't think she 's beautiful
  because of a birthmark that takes up a little less than half her face kids used to say she looks like a wrong answer that someone tried to erase but couldn 't quite get the job done 
 and they 'll never understand that she 's raising two kids whose definition of beauty begins with the word mom because they see her heart before they see her skin  because she 's only ever always been amazing
  was a broken branch grafted onto a different family tree
 adopted not because his parents opted for a different destiny he was three when he became a mixed drink of one part left alone and two parts tragedy 
  started therapy in eighth grade had a personality made up of tests and pills  lived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were
  a tidal wave of antidepressants and an adolescent being called popper one part because of the pills ninety nine parts because of the cruelty  
 he tried to kill himself in grade ten
 when a kid who could still go home to mom and dad had the audacity to tell him get over it 
 as if depression is something that could be remedied by any of the contents found in a first aid kit to this day he is a stick of tnt lit from both ends could describe to
  detail the way the sky bends in the moment before it 's about to fall and despite an army of friends who all call him an inspiration  he remains a conversation piece between people who can 't understand sometimes 
 being drug free has less to do with addiction and more to do with sanity  
  seems like every school has an arsenal of names getting updated every year  and if a kid breaks in a school and no one around chooses to hear do they make a sound 
 are they just background noise from a soundtrack stuck on repeat when people say things like kids can be cruel 
 every school was a big top circus tent and the pecking order went from acrobats to
  lion tamers from clowns to carnies all of these miles ahead of who we were  we were freaks
 lobster claw boys and bearded ladies  oddities juggling depression and loneliness playing solitaire spin the bottle  trying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal but at night  while the others slept  
 we kept walking the tightrope 
  and yes some of us fell but i want to tell them that all of this
 is just debris
 left over when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought we used to be  and if you can 't see anything beautiful about yourself
  get a better mirror  look a little closer stare a little longer 
 because there 's something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit you built a cast around your broken heart and signed it yourself
  wrong 
 because maybe you didn 't belong to a group or a clique
  maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything  maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show and tell but never told because how can you hold your ground if everyone around you wants to bury 
  you beneath it you have to believe that they were wrong 
 they have to be wrong  why else would we still be here we
  grew up learning to cheer on the underdog because we see ourselves in them 
 we stem from a root planted in the belief that we are not what we were called 
 we are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting empty on some highway  
 and if in some way we are don 't worry we only got out to walk and get gas we are graduating members from the class
  not the faded echoes of voices crying out names will never hurt me 
 of course
 they did but our lives will only ever always continue to be a balancing act
 that has less to do with pain
 and more to do with beauty
