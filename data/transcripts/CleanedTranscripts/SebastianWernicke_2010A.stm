 go on the ted website you can currently find there over a full week of tedtalk videos 
 over one point three million words of transcripts
  millions of user ratings 
 and that 's a huge amount of data 
 and it got me wondering if you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis  could you reverse engineer a tedtalk could you create the ultimate tedtalk 
 and
 also  could you create the worst possible tedtalk that they would still let you get away with 
 to find this out i looked at three things i looked at the topic that you should choose i
  looked at how you should deliver it and the visuals onstage  
 now with the topic there 's a whole range of topics you can choose but you should choose wisely because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk 
 now to make this more concrete let 's look at the list of top ten words that
 statistically stick out in the most favorite tedtalks
 and in the least favorite tedtalks  so if you came here to talk about how french coffee will spread happiness in our brains 
 that 's a go 
 whereas if you wanted to talk about your project involving oxygen girls aircraft
 actually i would like to hear that talk but statistics
 say it 's not so good
  generalize this the most favorite tedtalks are those
 that feature topics we can connect with both easily and deeply such as happiness our own body food emotions  and the more technical 
 topics such as architecture  materials and strangely enough men those are not good topics to talk about
  how should you deliver your talk 
 ted is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock  so they 're going to hate me for revealing this because actually you should talk as long as they will let you because the
 most favorite tedtalks are on average over fifty percent longer than the least favorite ones  
 and this holds true for all ranking lists on  ted com except if you want to have a talk that 's beautiful  
  while you 're pushing the clock there 's a few rules to obey  i found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four word phrases that appear more often in the most favorite tedtalks as opposed to the least favorite tedtalks  i 'll give you three examples
  of all i must as a speaker provide a service to the audience and talk about what i will give you instead of saying what i can 't have 
 secondly it 's imperative that you do not cite the new york times 
 and finally it 's okay for the speaker that 's the good news to fake intellectual capacity if i don 't understand something i can just say
 now let 's go to the visuals the most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker and analysis 
  shows if you want to be among the most favorite ted speakers you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average 
  though you might consider going for props  and now the most important thing 
 that is the mood onstage  color plays a very important role color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the
 website 
 for example fascinating talks contain a statistically high amount of exactly this blue color much more than the average tedtalk  
  i think i 'm not the first one who has done this analysis but i 'll leave this to your
 good judgment so now it 's time to put it all together and design the ultimate tedtalk now  since
  i learned from my analysis that i should actually give you something i will not impose the ultimate or worst tedtalk on you but rather give you a tool to create your own  and i call this tool the tedpad and
 the tedpad is a matrix of one hundred specifically selected highly curated sentences that you can easily piece
  together to get your own tedtalk 
 you only have to make one decision and that is are you going to use the white version for very good tedtalks about creativity human genius or are 
  you going to go with a black version which will allow you to create really bad tedtalks mostly about blogs  politics and stuff so  
  hope some of you will be inspired for next year to create this which i really want to see  thank you very much
