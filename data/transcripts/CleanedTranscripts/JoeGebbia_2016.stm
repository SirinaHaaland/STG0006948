  i want to tell you the story about the time i almost got kidnapped
 in the trunk of a red mazda miata it 's the day after graduating from design school
  and i 'm having a yard sale and this guy pulls up in this red mazda
 and he starts looking through my stuff  and he buys a piece of art that i made  and it turns out he 's alone in town for the night  
 driving cross country on a road trip
 before he goes into the peace corps  so i invite him out for a beer
 and he tells me all about his passion for making a difference in the world 
  now it 's starting to get late and i 'm getting pretty tired as i motion for the tab  i make the mistake of asking him 
 so where are you staying tonight and he makes it worse by saying actually i don 't have a place
  he 's going to the peace corps but i don 't really know if he 's going to the peace corps and i don 't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a miata that 's a small trunk 
 so then i hear myself saying hey i have an airbed you can stay on in my living room 
 and the voice in my head goes wait what 
 that night i 'm laying in bed  i 'm staring at the ceiling and thinking
  oh my god  what have i done there 's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room
  what if he 's psychotic 
 my anxiety grows so much i leap out of bed  i sneak on my tiptoes to the door  and i lock the bedroom door  
 it turns out he was
  we 've kept in touch ever since  and the piece of art he bought at the yard sale is hanging in his classroom he 's a teacher now  
 this was my first hosting experience  and it completely changed my perspective
  maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers
 were actually friends waiting to be discovered  the idea
  gradually became natural to me and when i moved to san francisco  i brought the airbed with me 
 so now it 's two years later  i 'm unemployed  i 'm almost broke my roommate moves out  and then the rent goes up 
 and then i learn there 's a design conference coming to town and all the hotels are sold out and i 've always believed that turning fear into fun
  so here 's what i pitch my best friend and my new roommate brian chesky 
 brian thought of a way to make a few bucks turning our place into ' designers bed and breakfast ' offering young designers who come to town a place to crash complete with wireless internet a small desk space  sleeping mat and breakfast each morning  
 ha 
 we built a basic website and airbed and breakfast was born three lucky guests got to stay on a
 floor but they loved it  and so did we i swear  the ham and swiss cheese omelets we made tasted totally different because we made them for our guests 
 we took them on adventures around the city and when we said goodbye to the last guest the door latch clicked  
 brian and i just stared at each other did we just discover it was possible to make friends
 while also making
  rent  the wheels had started to turn my old roommate nate blecharczyk joined
 as engineering  co founder and we buckled down to see if we could turn this into a business 
 here 's what we pitched investors 
 we want to build a website where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces their bedrooms the bathrooms
 the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over  
 and then over the internet they 're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes  it 's going to be huge 
 we sat back and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off  it did not 
 no one in their right minds would invest in a service that allows strangers to sleep in people 's homes
  why because we 've all been taught as kids strangers equal danger  now  when you 're faced with a problem you fall back on what you know and
 all we really knew was design 
 in art school you learn that design is much more than the look and feel of something it 's the whole experience  we learned to do that for objects
  but here we were aiming to build olympic trust between people who had never met 
 could design make that happen is it possible to design for trust
  i want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust that we were aiming to achieve  
 i 've got a 30 second experiment that will push you past your comfort
  i need you to take out your phones  
 now that you have your phone out i 'd like you to unlock your phone 
 now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left
  tiny sense of panic you 're feeling right now 
 is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home  
 because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home people don 't just see your messages they see
 your bedroom your kitchen your toilet
 now how does it feel holding someone 's unlocked phone most of us feel really responsible 
 that 's how most guests feel
 when they stay in a home  and it 's because of this that our company can even exist 
 by the way who 's holding al gore 's phone 
 would you tell twitter he 's running for president
 ok you can hand your phones back now
 so now that you 've experienced the kind of trust challenge we were facing  i 'd love to share a few discoveries we 've made along
  the way
 what if we changed one small thing about the design of that experiment  
 what if your neighbor had introduced themselves first with their their name  where they 're from the name of their kids or their dog  
 imagine that they had one hundred and fifty reviews of people saying they 're great at holding unlocked phones
  now how would you feel about handing your phone over  
 it turns out a well designed reputation system is key for building trust  
 and we didn 't actually get it right the first time 
 it 's hard for people to leave bad reviews  eventually  we learned to wait until both guests and hosts left the review before we reveal them
  a discovery we made just last week  we did a joint study with stanford  where we looked at people 's willingness to trust someone
 based on how similar they are in age  location and geography  
 the research showed not surprisingly we prefer people who are like us
  the more different somebody is the less we trust them
  now that 's a natural social bias  
 but what 's interesting is what happens when you add reputation into the mix in this case with reviews  
 now if you 've got less than three reviews  nothing changes  
 but if you 've got more than ten 
 everything changes  
 high reputation beats high similarity
  the right design can actually help us overcome one of our most deeply rooted biases  
 now we also learned that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure 
 this is what happens when a guest first messages a host 
 if you share too little 
  acceptance rates go down and if you share too much like i 'm having issues with my mother 
 acceptance rates also go down  
 but there 's a zone that 's just right like love the artwork in your place coming for vacation with my family 
 so how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure
  we use the size of the box to suggest the right length  and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing
 we bet our whole company
 on the hope that with the right design people would be willing to overcome the stranger danger bias  
 what we didn 't realize is just how many people
 were ready and waiting to put the bias aside  
  a graph that shows our rate of adoption 
 there 's three things happening here  the first an unbelievable amount of luck 
 the second is the efforts of our team  
 and third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need  
 now  things have been going pretty well obviously there are times when things don 't work out 
 guests have thrown unauthorized parties and trashed homes
  hosts have left guests stranded in the rain 
 in the early days  i was customer service  and those calls came right to my cell phone  
 i was at the the front lines of trust breaking  
 and
 there 's nothing worse than those calls  it hurts to even think about them
  the disappointment in the sound of someone 's voice was and i would say still is our single greatest motivator to keep improving  
 thankfully out of the one hundred and twenty three million nights we 've ever hosted 
 less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic  
 turns out people are justified in their trust and when trust works out
  it can be absolutely magical 
 we had a guest stay with a host in uruguay  and he suffered a heart attack  the host rushed him to the hospital 
 they donated their own blood for his operation 
 let me read you his review 
 excellent house for sedentary travelers prone to myocardial
 the area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals 
 javier and alejandra instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you 
 they will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you 're dying
 and stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass  they don
  lonely  they bring you books to read  and they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you 
 highly recommended 
 of course not every stay is like that  
 but this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for
 now  when i heard that term  i have to admit it tripped me up how do sharing and transactions go together  
 so let 's be clear  it is about commerce  but if you just called it the rental economy it would be incomplete 
 the sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection people share a part of themselves
  and that changes everything you know how most travel today is like  i think of it like fast food
 it 's efficient and consistent at the cost of local and authentic  
 what if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences  what if
  anywhere you visited there was a central marketplace of locals offering to get you thoroughly drunk on a pub crawl
 in neighborhoods you didn 't even know existed or learning to cook
 from the chef of a five star restaurant 
 today homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation  what if homes were designed to be shared
 from the ground up what would that look like
  cities embraced a culture of sharing  i see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection
 instead of isolation and separation  
 in south korea in the city of seoul they 've actually even started this they 've repurposed hundreds of government parking spots to be shared by residents  
 they 're connecting students who need a place to live with
  rooms  and they 've started an incubator to help fund the next generation of sharing economy start ups 
 tonight just on our service
  seven hundred and eighty five thousand people
 in one hundred and
  a stranger 's home or welcome one into theirs  clearly it 's not as crazy as we were taught 
 we didn 't invent anything new  hospitality has been around forever 
 there 's been many other websites like ours so why did ours eventually take off
  off  
 luck and timing aside  
 i 've learned that you can take the components of trust and you can design for that 
 design can overcome our most deeply rooted stranger danger bias  and that 's amazing
  to me it blows my mind  i think about this every time i see a red miata go by  
 now we know design won 't solve all the world 's problems  
 but if it can help out with this one if it can make a dent in this it makes me wonder  
 what else can we design for next  
 thank you
