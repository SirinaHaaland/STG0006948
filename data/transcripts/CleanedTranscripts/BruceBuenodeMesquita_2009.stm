  what i 'm going to try to do is explain to you quickly how to predict and illustrate it with some predictions about what iran is going to do in the next couple of years 
  we need to use science 
 and the reason that we need to use science is because then we can reproduce what we 're doing it 's not just wisdom or guesswork  
 and if we can predict  then we can engineer the future so if
 you are concerned to influence energy policy  
 or you are concerned to influence national security policy  or health policy or education
 science and a particular branch of science is a way to do it not the way we 've been doing it which is  seat of the pants wisdom 
 now before i get into how to do it let me
 give you a little truth in advertising because i 'm not engaged in the business of magic there are lots of thing that the approach i take can predict
  and there are some that it can 't it can predict
 complex negotiations or situations involving coercion that is in essence everything that has to do with politics much of what has to do with business 
 but sorry  if you 're looking to speculate in the stock market  
 i don 't predict stock markets ok  it 's not going up any time really soon
  i 'm not engaged in doing that i 'm not engaged in predicting random number generators i actually get phone calls from people who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win  
 i don 't have a clue  
 i engage in the use of game theory game theory is a branch of mathematics and that means sorry that even in the study of politics  math has 
  come into the picture we can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics we
  need to look at this in a rigorous way  now what is game theory about it assumes that people
 are looking out for what 's good for them that doesn 't seem terribly shocking although it 's controversial for a lot of people that we are self interested 
 in order to look out for what 's best for them or what they think is best for them people have values they identify what they want
  what they don 't want  and they have beliefs about what other people want and what other people don 't want  how much power other people have how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want  
 and they face
 limitations  constraints  they may be weak they may be located in the wrong part of the world they may be einstein  
 stuck away farming someplace in a rural village in india not being noticed as was the case for ramanujan for a long time a great mathematician but nobody noticed  
 now who is rational a lot of people are worried about what is rationality about you know 
 what if people are rational mother theresa  she was rational  
 terrorists they 're rational  
 pretty much everybody is rational  i think there are only two exceptions that i 'm aware
  of two year olds they are not rational  they have very fickle preferences  they switch what they think all the time 
 and schizophrenics are probably not rational but pretty much everybody else is rational that is they are just trying to do what they think is in their own best interest  
 now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests we have to think
  about who has influence in the world if you 're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior with regard to producing pollutants 
 one approach the common approach is to exhort them to be better to explain to them what damage they 're doing to the planet  
 and many of you may have noticed that doesn 't have as big an effect as perhaps you would like it to have 
 but if you show them that it 's in their interest
 then they 're responsive 
 so we have to work out who influences problems  if we 're looking at iran  the president of the united states we would like to think may have some influence certainly the president in iran has some influence
 but we make a mistake if we just pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder because that person
 doesn 't know much about iran  or about energy
  policy  or about health care  or about any particular policy  that person surrounds himself or herself with advisers if we 're talking 
  about national security problems maybe it 's the secretary of state  maybe it 's the secretary of defense the director of national intelligence maybe the ambassador to the united nations or somebody else
  who they think is going to know more about the particular problem but let 's face it  the secretary of state doesn 't know much about iran  the secretary of defense doesn 't know much about iran  each of those people in turn
 has advisers who advise them so they can advise the president 
 there are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome not just the people at the pinnacle
 pyramid  
 unfortunately a lot of times we don 't do that there 's a good reason that we don 't do that and there 's a good reason that using game theory and computers we can overcome the limitation of just looking at a few people 
 imagine a problem with just five 
  imagine for example that sally over here  wants to know what harry and jane and george and frank
 are thinking  and sends messages to those people sally 's giving her opinion to them  and they 're giving their opinion to sally  
 but sally also wants to know what harry is saying to these three  and what they 're saying to harry and harry wants
  to know what each of those people are saying to each other and so on and sally would like to know what harry thinks those people are saying  that 's a complicated problem that 's a lot to know 
 there are a lot of linkages
 one hundred and twenty as a matter of fact if you remember your factorials five factorial is one hundred and twenty  
 now you may be surprised to know that smart people can keep one hundred and twenty things straight
 in their head  suppose we double the number of
  influencers from five to ten does
 that mean we 've doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know from one hundred and twenty to two hundred and forty  no how about ten times to one thousand two hundred no we 've increased it to three point six million  
 nobody can keep that straight in their head  but computers
  they can 
 they don 't need coffee breaks  they don 't need vacations  they don 't need to go to sleep at night  
 they don 't ask for raises either  they can keep this information straight and that means that we can process the information  
 so i 'm going to talk to you about how to process it and i 'm going to give you some examples out of iran  and you 're going to be wondering 
 why should we listen to this guy  why should we believe what he 's saying
 going to show you
 a factoid this is an assessment by the central intelligence agency
 of the percentage of time that the model i 'm talking about is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known 
 when the experts who provided the data inputs got it wrong 
  a cia claim you can read it it was declassified a while ago you can read it in a volume edited by h bradford westerfield yale university press 
 so what do we need to know in order to predict 
 you may be surprised to find out we don 't need to know very much 
 we do need to know who has a stake in trying to shape the outcome of a decision  
 we need to know what they say
  not what they want in their heart of hearts not what they think they can get but what they say they want because that is a strategically chosen position  and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision making 
 we need to know how focused they are on the problem at hand 
 that is how willing are they to drop what they 're doing when the issue comes up and attend to it instead of something
  that 's on their plate how big a deal is it to them 
 and how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to engage on the issue 
 if we know those things
 we can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody cares about two things on any decision
  they care about the outcome they 'd like an outcome as close to what they are interested in as possible they 're careerists they also care about getting credit
 ego involvement they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome  or as important if it 's their druthers to block an outcome  and 
  so we have to figure out how they balance those two things different people trade off between standing by their outcome  faithfully holding to it going down
  a blaze of glory  or giving it up putting their finger in the wind and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position most people fall in between and if we can work out where they fall we can work out how to negotiate with them to change their behavior  
 so with just that little bit of input
 we can work out what the choices are that people have what the chances are that they 're willing to take what they 're after what they
  what they want  and what they believe about other people you might notice what we don 't need to know  
 there 's no history in here  
 how they got to where they are may be important in shaping the input information but once we know where they are we 're worried about where they 're going to be headed in the future
 how they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting i remind you of that ninety
  so where are we going to get this information we can get this information
 from the internet from the economist  the financial times the new york times 
 u s news and world report lots of sources like that or we can get it from asking experts who spend their lives studying places and problems 
 because those experts know this information if they don 't
  who are the people trying to influence the decision how much clout do they have how much they care about this issue and what do they say they want  are they experts  that 's what it means to be an expert that 's the basic stuff an expert needs to know  
 alright  lets turn to iran let me make
 three important predictions you can check this out time will tell what is iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program
  how secure is the theocratic regime in iran what 's its future  
 and everybody 's best friend  
 ahmadinejad how are things going for him how are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two 
 you take a look at this this is not based on
  i want to be very clear here i 'm not projecting some past
 data into the future  i 've taken inputs on positions and so forth run it through a computer model that had simulated the dynamics of interaction 
 and these are the simulated dynamics the predictions about the path of policy  
 the bomb 
 at one hundred and thirty  we start somewhere above one hundred and thirty  
 between building a bomb and making enough weapons grade fuel so that you could build a bomb  that 's where according to my analyses the iranians were at the beginning of this year  
 and then the model makes predictions down the road at one hundred and fifteen they would only produce enough weapons grade fuel to show that they know how but they wouldn
  't build a weapon they would build a research quantity it would achieve some national pride  but not go ahead and build a weapon and down at one hundred they would build civilian nuclear energy which is what they say is their objective  
 the yellow line shows us the most likely path the yellow line includes an analysis of eighty seven decision makers in iran and a vast number of outside influencers trying to pressure iran
  into changing its behavior  various players in the united states and egypt and saudi arabia and russia european union japan so on and so forth
  the white line reproduces the analysis if the international environment just left iran to make its own internal decisions under its own domestic political pressures  that 's not going to be happening  but you can see
 that the line comes down faster
 if they 're not put under international pressure if they 're allowed to pursue their own devices  but in any event by the end of this year beginning of next year  we get to a stable 
 equilibrium outcome and that equilibrium is not what the united states would like but it 's probably an equilibrium that the united states can live with and that a lot of others can live
  and that is that iran will achieve that nationalist pride
 by making enough weapons grade fuel through research so that they could show that they know how to make weapons grade fuel but not enough to actually build a bomb  
 how is this happening over here you can see this is the distribution of power
 in favor of civilian nuclear energy today  this is what that power
  block is predicted to be like by the late parts of two thousand and ten early parts of two thousand and eleven 
 just about nobody supports research on weapons grade fuel today  
 but by two thousand and eleven that gets to be a big block and you put these two together that 's the controlling influence in iran  
 out here today
  a bunch of people ahmadinejad for example who would like not only to build a bomb  but test a bomb  
 that power disappears completely nobody supports that by two thousand and eleven 
 these guys are all shrinking the power is all drifting out here  so the outcome is going to be the weapons grade fuel 
 who are the winners and who are the losers in iran  take a look at these guys
  they 're growing in power 
 and by the way this was done a while ago before the current economic crisis  and that 's probably going to get steeper  
 these folks are the moneyed interests in iran the bankers  
 the oil people the bazaaries they are growing in political clout as the mullahs are isolating themselves with the exception of one group of 
  mullahs who are not well known to americans that 's this line here growing in power 
 these are the ayatollahs mostly based in qom who have great clout in the religious community have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder because they see iran going in an unhealthy direction a direction contrary
 to what khomeini had in mind here is mr ahmadinejad
  two things to notice he 's getting weaker  and while he gets a lot of attention in the united states he is not a major player in iran  he is on the way down 
 ok  so i 'd like you to take a little away from this everything is not predictable the stock market is at least for me not predictable  
 but most complicated negotiations are predictable  again whether we 're talking
  all of these are complicated problems that are predictable  that this sort of technology can be applied to 
 and the reason that being able to predict those things is important 
 is not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it  but because if you can predict what people will do you can engineer what they will do and if you engineer what
  they do you can change the world you can get a better result  i would like to leave you with one thought which is
 for me the dominant theme
 of this gathering  and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world  when people say to you 
 that 's impossible you say
  that was fascinating  i love that you put it out there 
 i got very nervous halfway through the talk though just panicking whether you 'd included in your model the possibility that putting this prediction out there might
  change the result we 've got eight hundred people in tehran who watch tedtalks bruce bueno de mesquita i 've thought about that  and
 since i 've done a lot of work for the intelligence community  they 've also pondered that it would be a good thing if
 people paid more attention took seriously  and engaged in the same sorts of
  because it would change things but it would change things in two beneficial ways it would hasten
 how how quickly people arrive at an agreement  and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time 
 and it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with without having to manipulate them so much
 which is
 basically what i do i manipulate them so it would be a good thing ca so you 're kind of trying to say people of iran  this is your destiny  lets go there
  well people of iran  this is what many of you are going to evolve to want  and we could get there a lot sooner and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic 
  sanctions  and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end and the world would be a better place ca
