  they told me that i 'm a traitor to my own profession 
 that i should be fired have my medical license taken away  that i should go back to my own
  email got hacked in a discussion forum for other doctors someone took credit for
 my account now i didn 't know if this was a good or bad thing  but then came the response too bad it wasn 't a real bomb 
 i never thought that i would do something that would provoke this level of anger among other doctors  
 becoming a doctor was my dream  i grew up in china and my earliest
  memories are of being rushed to the hospital because i had such bad asthma that i was there nearly every week 
 i had this one doctor dr sam who always took care of me  
 she was about the same age as my mother she had this wild curly hair  and she always wore these bright yellow flowery dresses  
 she was one of those doctors who if you fell and
 broke your arm she would ask you why you weren 't laughing because it 's your humerus get it 
 see you 'd groan but
 she 'd always make you feel better after having seen her well we all have that childhood hero that we want to grow up to be just like right  
 well i wanted to be just like dr sam  
 when i was eight  my parents and i moved to the u s and ours became the typical immigrant narrative my parents cleaned hotel rooms and washed
  dishes and pumped gas so that i could pursue my dream  
 well eventually i learned enough english and my parents were so happy the day that i got into medical school and took my oath of healing and service  
 but then one day  everything changed my mother called me to tell me that she wasn 't feeling well she had a cough that wouldn
  go away she was short of breath and tired well i knew that my mother was someone who never complained about anything 
 for her to tell me that something was the matter  i knew something had to be really wrong 
 and it was 
 we found out that she had stage iv breast cancer cancer that by then had spread to her lungs her bones and her brain  
 my mother was brave though and she had hope she went through surgery and radiation
  and was on her third round of chemotherapy when she lost her address book 
 she tried to look up her oncologist 's phone number on the internet and she found it  but she found something else too 
 on several websites  he was listed as a highly paid speaker to a drug company and in fact often spoke on behalf of the same chemo regimen that he had prescribed her 
 she called me in a panic and i didn 't know what to believe  maybe this was the right chemo regimen for her but maybe it wasn 't it made her scared
 and it made her doubt when it comes to medicine having that trust is a must and when that trust is gone then
 all that 's left is fear  
 there 's another side to this fear as a medical student  i was taking care of this 19 year old who was biking back to his dorm when he got struck and hit
  shattered hip bones  and he was bleeding inside his belly and inside his brain  
 now imagine being his parents who flew in from seattle two thousand miles away to find their son in a coma i mean you 'd want to find out what 's going on with him right  
 they asked to attend our bedside rounds where we discussed his condition and his plan  which i thought was a reasonable request and also would give us a chance to show them how much we were trying and how much we cared 
  doctor though said no 
 he gave all kinds of reasons  maybe they 'll get in the nurse 's way  maybe they 'll stop students from asking questions 
 he even said what if they see mistakes and sue us 
 what i saw behind every excuse was deep fear and what i learned was that to become a doctor  we have to put on our white coats put up a wall and hide behind
 there 's a hidden epidemic in medicine 
 of course patients are scared when they come to the doctor imagine you wake up with this terrible bellyache you go to the hospital you 're lying in this strange place you 're on this hospital gurney you 're wearing 
  this flimsy gown strangers are coming to poke and prod at you you don 't know what 's going to happen you don 't even know if you 're going to get the blanket you asked for thirty minutes ago
  just patients who are scared 
 doctors are scared too 
 we 're scared of patients finding out who we are and what medicine is all about 
 and so what do we do we put on our white coats and we hide behind them 
 of course the more we hide the more people want to know what it is that we 're hiding the more fear then spirals into mistrust and poor
  we don 't just have a fear of sickness we have a sickness of fear  
 can we bridge this disconnect between what patients need and what doctors do can we overcome the sickness of fear
 let me ask you differently if hiding isn 't the answer what if we did the opposite what if doctors were to become totally transparent with their patients
  i conducted a research study to find out what it is that people want to know about their healthcare  
 i didn 't just want to study patients in a hospital but everyday people so my two medical students suhavi tucker and laura johns  literally took their research to the streets 
 they went to banks coffee shops  senior centers  chinese restaurants and train stations 
 what did they find well when we asked people what do you want to know about your healthcare
  responded with what they want to know about their doctors because people understand health care to be the individual interaction between them and their doctors 
 when we asked what do you want to know about your doctors people gave three different answers  
 some want to know that their doctor is competent and certified to practice medicine  
 some want to be sure that their doctor is unbiased and is making decisions based on evidence and science not on who
  pays them  
 surprisingly to us many people want to know something else about their doctors  
 jonathan a 28 year old law student  says he wants to find someone who is comfortable with lgbtq patients and specializes in lgbt health  
 serena a 32 year old accountant  says that it 's important to her for her doctor to share her values when it comes to reproductive choice and women 's rights
 frank a 59 year old hardware store owner doesn 't even like going to the doctor
 and wants to find someone who believes in prevention first but who is comfortable with alternative treatments 
 one after another our respondents told us that that doctor patient relationship is a deeply intimate one
 that to show their doctors their bodies and tell them their deepest secrets they want to first understand their
  because doctors have to see every patient
 doesn 't mean that patients have to see every doctor people want to know about their doctors first so that they can make an informed choice 
 as a result of this i formed a campaign who 's my doctor  that calls for total transparency in medicine  
 participating doctors voluntarily disclose on a public website not just information about where we went to medical school and what specialty we 're in
  also our conflicts of interest we go beyond the government in the sunshine act about drug company affiliations  and we talk about how we 're paid 
 incentives matter 
 if you go to your doctor because of back pain  you might want to know he 's getting paid five thousand dollars to perform spine surgery versus twenty five dollars to refer you to see a physical therapist 
 or if he 's getting paid the same thing no matter what he recommends
 then  we go one step further  
 we add our values when it comes to women 's health  lgbt health  alternative medicine preventive health and end of life decisions 
 we pledge to our patients that we are here to serve you so you have a right to know who we are 
 we believe that transparency can be the cure for fear
  i thought some doctors would sign on and others wouldn 't but i had no idea of the huge backlash that would ensue  
 within one week of starting who 's my doctor medscape 's public forum and several online doctors ' communities had thousands of posts about this topic  
 here are a few 
 from a gastroenterologist in portland i devoted twelve years of my life to being a slave i have loans and mortgages i depend on lunches from drug companies to serve
  patients 
 well  times may be hard for everyone  
 but try telling your patient making thirty five thousand dollars a year to serve a family of four that you need the free lunch 
 from an orthopedic surgeon in charlotte 
 i find it an invasion of my privacy to disclose where my income comes from my patients don 't disclose their incomes to me 
 but your patients ' sources of income
 don 't affect your health 
 from a psychiatrist in new york city 
 pretty soon we will have to disclose whether we prefer cats to dogs what model of car we drive and what toilet paper we use 
 well how you feel about toyotas or   cottonelle won 't affect your patients ' health  but your views on a woman 's right to choose and preventive
  wen needs to move back to her own country 
 well two pieces of good news first of all this is meant to be voluntary and not mandatory and second of all i 'm american and i 'm already here
  my employers were getting calls asking for me to be fired  
 i received mail at my undisclosed home address with threats to contact the medical board to sanction me 
 my friends and family urged me to quit this campaign after the bomb threat i was done  
 but then i heard from patients  over social media a
  that was by then generated four point three million impressions  and thousands of people wrote to encourage me to continue 
 they wrote with things like if doctors are doing something they 're that ashamed of they shouldn 't be doing it 
 elected officials have to disclose campaign contributions lawyers have to disclose conflicts of interests why shouldn 't doctors
  people wrote and said let us patients decide what 's important when we 're choosing a doctor 
 in our initial trial  over three hundred doctors have taken the total transparency pledge what a crazy new idea right  
 but actually this is not that new of a concept at all remember dr sam my doctor in china with the goofy jokes and the wild hair well she was my doctor
 but she was also our neighbor who lived in the building across the street 
 i went to the same school as her daughter  
 my parents and i trusted her because we knew who she was and what she stood for and she had no need to hide from us 
 just one generation ago  this was the norm in the u s as well  you knew that your family doctor was the father of two teenage
  teenage boys that he quit smoking a few years ago that he says he 's a regular churchgoer but you see him twice a year once at easter and once when his  mother in law comes to town 
 you knew what he was about and he had no need to hide from you 
 but the sickness of fear has taken over and patients suffer the consequences  i know this firsthand 
 my mother fought her cancer for eight years she was a planner  and she thought a lot about how she wanted to live and how she wanted to die
 not only did she sign advance directives  she wrote a  12 page document about how she had suffered enough how it was time for her to go 
 one day when i was a resident physician i got a call to say that she was in the intensive care unit 
 by the time i got there she was about to be intubated and put on a breathing
  you were that age how would you have liked to grow up without your mother 
 her oncologist was there too and said this is your mother can you really face yourself for the rest of your life
 if you don 't do everything for her
  i knew my mother so well  i understood what her directives meant so well but i was a physician 
 that was the single hardest decision
 i ever made to let her die in peace and i carry those words of those doctors with me every
  we can bridge the disconnect between what doctors do
 and what patients need 
 we can get there because we 've been there before and we know that transparency gets us to that trust 
 research has shown us that openness also helps doctors that having open medical records being willing to talk about medical errors will increase patient trust improve health outcomes 
  and reduce malpractice 
 that openness that trust is only going to be more important as we move from the infectious to the behavioral model of disease  
 bacteria may not care so much about trust and intimacy but
 for people to tackle the hard lifestyle choices to address issues like smoking cessation  blood pressure management and diabetes control well
 that requires us to establish trust  
  's what other transparent doctors have said  
 brandon combs an internist in denver this has brought me closer to my patients the type of relationship i 've developed
 that 's why i entered medicine 
 aaron stupple an internist in denver i tell my patients that i am totally open with them 
 i don 't hide anything from them this is me  now tell me about you we
 're in this together
 nguyen a family physician in houston my colleagues are astounded by what i 'm doing they ask me how i could be so brave  
 i said  i 'm not being brave 
 it 's my job 
 i leave you today with a final thought being totally transparent
 is scary you feel naked exposed and vulnerable
  but that vulnerability  that humility it can be an extraordinary benefit to the practice of medicine 
 when doctors are willing to step off our pedestals take off our white coats and show our patients who we are and what medicine is all about 
 that 's when we begin to overcome the sickness of fear  that 's when we establish
  that 's when we change the paradigm of medicine  from one of secrecy and hiding to one that is fully open and engaged for our patients  thank you
