  i will not dance to your war drum  
 i will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum  i will not dance to that beating  i know that beat 
 it is lifeless  
 i know intimately
  that skin you are hitting it was alive once hunted  stolen stretched  
 i will not dance to your drummed up war  i will not pop spin break for you i will not hate for you or even hate you  
 i will not kill for you  especially
 i will not die for you  i will not mourn the dead with murder
  nor suicide i will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing everyone can be wrong life is a right not collateral or casual  i will not forget where i come from  
 i will craft my own drum  gather my beloved near and our chanting will be dancing our humming
  will not be played  i will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat  i will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance this heartbeat is louder than death 
 your war drum
 ain 't louder than this
 breath haaa what 's up ted people let me hear you make some
  i 've been wrong a lot lately 
 like a lot so i couldn 't figure out
 what to read today  i mean i 've been saying i 've been prepping what that means is prepping my outfit
  options  trying to figure out what i 'm coming behind and going in front of 
 poetry does that 
 it preps you  it aims you  so i am going to read a poem that was chosen just now but i 'm going to need you
 to just sit for like ten minutes and hold a woman who is not here hold her now
 with you you don 't need
 to say her name out loud you can just hold her are you holding her 
 this is break clustered 
 all holy history banned 
 unwritten books predicted the future projected the past but my head unwraps
 around what appears limitless man 's creative violence  whose son shall it be 
 which male child will perish a new day  
 our boys ' deaths galvanize we cherish corpses we mourn women complicated
  bitches get beat daily  profits made prophets ignored war and tooth enameled salted lemon childhoods all colors run none of us solid don 't look for shadow behind me i carry it within 
 i live cycles of light and darkness rhythm is half silence i see now i never was one and not the other  sickness health tender
  i think now i never was pure 
 before form i was storm 
 blind ign 'ant still am human contracted itself blind  malignant i never was pure  
 girl spoiled before ripened  
 language can 't math me  i experience exponentially everything is everything  one woman
  loses fifteen maybe twenty members of her family  one woman loses six  one woman loses her head one woman searches rubble  one woman feeds on trash 
  one woman shoots her face  one woman shoots her husband  one woman straps herself  one woman gives birth to a baby  one woman gives birth to borders one woman no longer believes love will ever find her  one woman never did where do
  placed where they 're not from don 't want to be missed faced with absence we mourn each one or we mean nothing at all my spine 
 curves spiral precipice running to and running from human beings cluster bombs left behind 
  do not fear what has blown up
  if you must 
 fear the unexploded
