  the first half of the 20th century was an absolute disaster
 in human affairs a cataclysm we had the first world war the great
  the second world war and the rise of the communist nations  
 and each one of these forces split the world  tore the world apart divided the world  and they threw up walls
 political walls  trade walls transportation walls  communication walls iron curtains
 which divided peoples and nations  it was only in the second half of the 20th century
 that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss 
 trade walls began to come tumbling down  here are some data on tariffs starting at forty percent  coming down to less than five percent we globalized the 
  world and what does that mean it means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries 
 transportation walls came tumbling down 
 you know in one thousand nine hundred and fifty the typical ship carried five thousand to ten thousand tons worth of goods 
 today a container ship can carry one hundred and fifty thousand tons it can be manned with a smaller crew  and unloaded faster than ever before  
 communication walls i don 't have to tell you the internet have come tumbling down
  and of course the iron curtains political walls
 have come tumbling down  now all of this has been tremendous for the world  trade has increased here is just a little bit of data 
 exports from china to the united states fifteen billion dollars  by two thousand and seven over three hundred billion dollars  and perhaps most remarkably
  at the beginning of the 21st century  
 really for the first time in modern history 
 growth extended to almost all parts of the world  
 so china i 've already mentioned beginning around one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight around the time of the death of mao growth ten percent a year year after year after year absolutely
  in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in china 
 china is the world 's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades 
 india  
 starting a little bit later but in one thousand nine hundred and ninety ninety  begetting tremendous growth  incomes at that time less than $ one thousand per year  and over the next eighteen years have almost tripled growth of six percent a year
  absolutely incredible  now africa sub saharan africa  sub saharan africa
 has been the area of the world most resistant to growth 
 and we can see the tragedy of africa in the first few bars here growth was negative people were actually getting poorer
  and sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been 
 but at the end of the 20th century the beginning of the 21st century we saw growth in africa  and i think as you 'll see there 's reasons for optimism  
 because i believe that the best is yet to come  
 now why on the cutting edge today it 's new ideas which are driving growth and by that i mean it 's products
 for which the research and development costs are really high and the manufacturing costs are low more than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge 
 now ideas have this amazing property thomas jefferson i think really expressed this quite well he said he who receives an idea from me
 receives instruction himself without lessening mine as he who lights his candle at mine
 receives light without darkening me or to put it
  slightly differently  one apple feeds one man  but an idea can feed the world  
 now this is not new this is practically not new to tedsters this is practically the model of ted  but what is new is that the greater function of ideas
 is going to drive growth  even more than ever
  this provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important more powerful than ever before and are going to increase growth more than ever before 
 and to explain why this is so i have a question  
 suppose that there are two diseases one of them is rare the other one is common  but if they are not treated they are equally severe  
 if you had to choose which would you rather have the common disease or the rare disease 
 common the common i think
  absolutely right and why because there are more drugs to treat common diseases than there are to treat rare diseases  the reason for this is incentives 
 it costs about the same to produce a new drug
 whether that drug treats one thousand people one hundred thousand people or a million people  
 but the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people so the incentives are much larger to produce drugs
 which treat more people to put this differently larger markets save lives 
 in this case misery truly does love company  
 now
 think about the following  if china and india were as rich as the united states is today  the market for cancer drugs would be eight
  times larger than it is now 
 now we are not there yet but it is happening
 as other countries become richer the demand for these pharmaceuticals is going to increase tremendously and that means an increase incentive to do research and development which benefits everyone in the world  
 larger markets increase the incentive to produce all kinds of ideas whether it 's software whether it 's a computer chip  whether it 's a new design for the hollywood people in the audience this even explains why
  movies have larger budgets than comedies it
 's because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures  
 so the market for those movies is larger people are willing to invest more and the budgets are larger  
 alright  well if larger markets increase the incentive to produce new ideas  how do we maximize that incentive it
 's by having one world market
  globalizing the world the way i like to put this is 
 one idea ideas are meant to be shared  so one idea can serve one world  one market  
 one idea one world  one market  
 well how else
 can we create new ideas that 's one reason globalize trade  how else can we create new ideas  well more idea creators
  now idea creators they come from all walks of life artists and innovators many of the people you 've seen on this stage i 'm going to focus on scientists and engineers
 because i have some data on that and i 'm a data person 
 now today less than one tenth of one percent of the world 's population are scientists and
  the united states has been an idea leader a large fraction of those people are in the united states  
 but the u s is losing its idea leadership  
 and for that i am very grateful that is a good thing  
 it is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader because for too long the united states and a handful of other developed countries have shouldered the entire burden of research and development 
 consider the following  
 if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the united states is now there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers contributing to ideas which benefit everyone which are shared by everyone 
 i think of the great indian mathematician ramanujan  how many ramanujans are there in india today toiling in the fields
  able to feed themselves  when they could be feeding the world  
 now we 're not there yet but it is going to happen in this century  the real tragedy of the last century
 is this if you think about the world the world 's population as a giant computer
  a massively parallel processor  then the great tragedy has been that billions of our processors have been off line  
 but in this century china is coming on line  india is coming on line  africa is coming on line  we will see an einstein in africa in this century  
 here is just some data this is china 
  less than one million new university students in china per year  two thousand and six over five million  
 now think what this means 
 this means we all benefit when another country gets rich 
 we should not fear other countries becoming wealthy that is something that we should embrace
 a wealthy china a wealthy india a wealthy africa we need a greater demand for ideas those larger markets i was talking about earlier
 and a greater supply
 of ideas for the world  now you can see some of the reasons why i 'm optimistic 
 globalization is increasing the demand for ideas the incentive to create new ideas
 investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas in
 fact if you look at world history you can see some reasons for optimism from about the beginnings of humanity to
  economic growth nothing one thousand five hundred to one thousand eight hundred maybe a little bit of economic growth 
 but less in a century than you expect to see in a year today
 1900s maybe one percent twentieth century a little bit over two percent  twenty first century could easily be three point three even higher percent even at that rate
  by two thousand one hundred average gdp per capita in the world will be $ two hundred thousand 
  gdp per capita which will be over a million but world gdp per capita $ two hundred thousand that 's not that far 
  we won 't make it but some of our grandchildren probably will  and i should say
  i think this is a rather modest prediction in kurzweilian terms this is gloomy
  terms i 'm like the eeyore of economic growth 
 alright what about problems what about a great depression  
 well let 's take a look let 's take a look at the great depression  
 here is gdp per capita from one thousand nine hundred to one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine now let 's imagine that you were an economist in
  future growth for the united states 
 not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century what would you have predicted not knowing this 
 if you had based your prediction your forecast on one thousand nine hundred to one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine you 'd have predicted something like this 
 if you 'd been a little more optimistic say based upon the roaring twenties
 you 'd have said this so what actually happened we went off a cliff but we recovered
 in fact in the second half of the 20th century growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted based upon the first half of the  20th century  
 so growth can wash away
 even what appears to be a great depression  alright what else
  oil oil this was a big topic when i was
 writing up my notes oil was $ one hundred and forty per barrel
  so people were asking a question they were saying is china drinking our milkshake 
 and there is some truth
  in the sense that
 we have something of a finite resource and increased growth is going to push up demand for that but i think i don 't have to tell this audience that a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing  
 moreover  
 as everyone knows look it 's energy not oil which counts and higher oil prices mean a greater incentive to invest in energy r
  you can see this in the data as oil prices go up energy patents go up  the world is much better equipped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today than ever in the past because of what i 'm talking about one idea 
 one world  one market
  the united states has
