  tell your daughters of this year  
 how we woke needing coffee but discovered instead cadavers strewn about our morning papers waterlogged facsimiles of our sisters spouses small children 
 say to your baby of this year when she asks as she certainly should
  should tell her it was too late coming  admit even in the year we leased freedom  we didn 't own it outright there were still laws for every way we used our privates while they pawed 
  at the soft folds of us grabbed with no concern for consent no laws made for the men that enforced them we were trained to dodge to wait
  to cower and cover to wait more still wait we were told to be silent 
 but speak to your girls of this wartime a year preceded by a score of the same so as in two decades before  we wiped our eyes  laced caskets
  with flags evacuated the crime scene of the club caterwauled in the street laid our bodies on the concrete against the outlines of our fallen
  chanted for our disappeared the women wept this year 
 they did 
 in the same year we were ready 
 the year we lost our inhibition and moved with courageous abandon was also the year we stared down barrels sang of cranes in skies ducked and parried caught gold in hijab collected death 
  threats knew ourselves as patriots said we 're thirty five now time we settled down and found a running mate made road maps for infant joy shamed nothing but fear  called ourselves fat and meant of course
  impeccable this year we were women  
 not brides or trinkets not an off brand gender not a concession but women  instruct your babies  remind them that the year has passed to be docile or small 
 some of us said for the first time that we were women  took this oath of solidarity seriously  some of us bore children and some of us did
  and none of us questioned whether that made us real or appropriate or true when she asks you of this year your daughter  whether your offspring or heir to your triumph from her comforted 
  side of history teetering towards woman she will wonder and ask voraciously  though she cannot fathom your sacrifice she will hold your estimation of it holy curiously probing where were you 
  what colored the walls of your regret what did you do for women in the year it was time this path you made for me which bones had to break did you do enough and are you ok momma and are 
  you a hero she will ask the difficult questions she will not care about the arc of your brow the weight of your clutch she will not ask of your mentions your daughter for whom you have already carried 
  so much wants to know what you brought  what gift what light did you keep from extinction when they came for victims in the night did you sleep through it or were you roused what was the
  cost of staying woke  what in the year we said time 's up  what did you do with your privilege did you sup on others ' squalor  did you look away or directly into the flame did you know your skill
  or treat it like a liability were you fooled by the epithets of nasty or less than did you teach with an open heart or a clenched fist  where were you tell her the truth  make it your
  i stood there with the moment drawn on my face like a dagger and flung it back at itself slicing space for you tell her the truth  how you lived in spite of crooked odds tell her you were brave and 
 always always in the company of courage mostly the days when you just had yourself tell her she was born as you were as your mothers before  and the sisters beside them  in the age 
 of legends like always tell her she was born just in time just in time
