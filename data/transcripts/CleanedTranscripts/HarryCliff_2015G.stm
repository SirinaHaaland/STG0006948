  a hundred years ago this month
  albert einstein stood up in front of the prussian academy of sciences in berlin to present a radical new theory of space time and gravity the general theory of relativity 
 general relativity is unquestionably einstein 's masterpiece
  a theory which reveals the workings of the universe at the grandest scales  capturing in one beautiful line of algebra everything from why apples fall from trees to the beginning of time and space one thousand 
 nine hundred and fifteen must have been an exciting year to be a physicist two new ideas were turning the subject on its head one was einstein 's theory of
  the other was arguably even more revolutionary 
 quantum mechanics 
 a  mind meltingly strange yet stunningly successful new way of understanding the microworld the world of atoms and particles 
 over the last century these two ideas have utterly transformed our understanding of the universe it 's thanks to relativity and quantum mechanics that we 've learned what the universe is made from how it began and how
  it continues to evolve 
 a hundred years on we now find ourselves at another turning point in physics  but what 's at stake now is rather different 
 the next few years may tell us whether we 'll be able to continue to increase our understanding of nature or whether maybe for the first time in the history of science we could be facing questions that we cannot answer 
 not because we don 't have the brains or technology
  because the laws of physics themselves forbid it 
 this is the essential problem the universe is far far too interesting 
 relativity and quantum mechanics appear to suggest that the universe should be a boring place it should be dark  lethal and lifeless 
 but when we look around us we see we live in a universe full of interesting stuff full of stars planets trees  squirrels 
 the question is 
  does all this interesting stuff exist why is there something rather than nothing  
 this contradiction is the most pressing problem in fundamental physics and in the next few years  we may find out whether we 'll ever be able to solve it 
 at the heart of this problem are two numbers  two extremely dangerous numbers these are properties of the universe
  extremely dangerous because if they were different even by a tiny bit then the universe as we know it would not exist 
 the first of these numbers is associated with the discovery that was made a few kilometers from this hall at cern home of this machine  the largest scientific device ever built by the human race the large hadron collider  
 the lhc whizzes subatomic particles around a 27 kilometer ring getting them closer and closer to the speed of light before smashing them into each other inside gigantic particle
  detectors 
 on july four two thousand and twelve physicists at cern announced to the world that they 'd spotted a new fundamental particle being created at the violent collisions at the lhc 
 the higgs boson  
 now if you followed the news at the time you 'll have seen a lot of physicists getting very excited indeed and you 'd be forgiven for thinking we get that way every time we discover a new particle  well that is kind of true  but the higgs boson
  is particularly special  
 we all got so excited because finding the higgs proves the existence of a cosmic energy field  
 now  you may have trouble imagining an energy field but we 've all experienced one if you 've ever held a magnet close to a piece of metal and felt a force pulling across that gap  then you 've felt the effect 
 of a field  and the higgs field is a little bit like a magnetic field  except it has a constant value everywhere it
  around us right now  we can 't see it or touch it but if it wasn 't there we would not exist  
 the higgs field gives mass to the fundamental particles that we 're made from if it wasn 't there those particles would have no mass and no atoms could form and there would be no us  
 but there is something deeply mysterious about
  relativity and quantum mechanics tell us that it has two natural settings a bit like a light switch it should either be off  so that it has a zero value everywhere in space or it should be on so it has an absolutely enormous value 
 in both of these scenarios atoms could not exist and therefore all the other interesting stuff that we see around us in the universe would not exist 
 in reality the higgs field is just slightly on not zero but ten thousand trillion times
  weaker than its fully on value a bit like a light switch that 's got stuck just before the off position  
 and this value is crucial if it were a tiny bit different  then there would be no physical structure in the universe  so this is the first of our dangerous numbers the strength 
 of the higgs field  theorists have spent decades trying to understand why it has this very peculiarly fine tuned number and they 've come up with a number of
  possible explanations they have sexy sounding names like supersymmetry or large extra dimensions i 'm not going to go into the details of these ideas now  but the key point is this 
 if any of them explained this weirdly fine tuned value of the higgs field  then we should see new particles being created at the lhc along with the higgs
  we 've not seen any sign of them  
 but there 's actually an even worse example of this kind of fine tuning of a dangerous number and this time it comes from the other end of the scale from studying the universe at vast distances 
 one of the most important consequences of einstein 's general theory of relativity was the discovery that the universe began as a rapid expansion of space and time thirteen point eight billion years ago the big bang 
 now according to early versions of the big bang
  theory the universe has been expanding ever since with gravity gradually putting the brakes on that expansion  
 but in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight astronomers made the stunning discovery that the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up the universe is getting bigger and bigger faster and faster driven by a mysterious repulsive force called dark energy 
  whenever you hear the word dark in physics you should get very suspicious because it probably means we don 't know what we 're talking about 
 we don 't know what dark energy is 
 but the best idea is that it 's the energy of empty space itself the energy of the vacuum  
 now if you use good old quantum mechanics to work out how strong dark energy should be you get an absolutely astonishing result 
 you find that dark energy should be ten to the power of one hundred and twenty times
  stronger than the value we observe from astronomy that 's one with one hundred and twenty zeroes after it 
 this is a number so mind bogglingly huge that it 's impossible to get your head around we often use the word astronomical when we 're talking about big numbers well even that one won 't do here this number is bigger than any number in
  it 's a thousand trillion trillion trillion times bigger than the number of atoms in the entire universe so
 that 's a pretty bad prediction 
 in fact it 's been called the worst prediction in physics  and this is more than just a theoretical curiosity if dark energy were anywhere near this strong then the universe would have been torn 
  apart stars and galaxies could not form and we would not be here  
  fantastic level of fine tuning than we saw for the higgs field  but unlike the higgs field  this number has no known explanation  
 the hope was that a complete combination of einstein 's general theory of relativity which is the theory of the universe at grand scales with quantum mechanics the theory of the universe at small
  might provide a solution 
 einstein himself spent most of his later years on a futile search for a unified theory of physics and physicists have kept at it ever since 
 one of the most promising candidates for a unified theory is string theory and
 the essential idea is if you could zoom in on the fundamental particles that make up our world you 'd see actually that they 're not particles at all but tiny vibrating strings of energy with each frequency of vibration corresponding to a different particle
 a bit like musical notes on a guitar string 
 so it 's a rather elegant almost poetic way of looking at the world but it has one catastrophic problem 
 it turns out that string theory isn 't one theory at all but a whole collection of theories it
 's been estimated in fact that there are ten to the five hundred different versions of string theory each one would describe a different universe with different laws of physics
 critics say this makes string theory unscientific you can 't disprove the theory  
 but others actually turned this on its head and said well maybe this apparent failure is string theory 's greatest triumph 
 what if all of these ten to the five hundred different possible universes actually exist out there somewhere in some grand multiverse  
 suddenly we can understand the weirdly  fine tuned values of these two dangerous
  numbers in most of the multiverse dark energy is so strong that the universe gets torn apart or the higgs field is so weak that no atoms can form 
 we live in one of the places in the multiverse where the two numbers are just right we live in a goldilocks universe 
 now  this idea is extremely controversial and it 's
  easy to see why 
 if we follow this line of thinking then we will never be able to answer the question why is there something rather than nothing in most of the multiverse there is nothing and we live in one of 
  the few places where the laws of physics allow there to be something 
  that doesn 't mean the multiverse doesn 't exist there are other planets other stars other galaxies so why not other universes the problem is it 's unlikely we 'll ever know for sure  
 now the idea of the multiverse has been around for a while but in the last few years we 've started to get the first solid hints that this line of reasoning may get born out 
 despite high hopes for the first run of the lhc
  what we were looking for there we were looking for new theories of physics supersymmetry or large extra dimensions that could explain this weirdly fine tuned value of the higgs field  
 but despite high hopes the lhc revealed a barren subatomic wilderness populated only by a lonely higgs boson
  my experiment published paper after paper where we glumly had to conclude that we saw no signs of new physics
 the stakes now could not be higher this summer the lhc began its second phase of operation with an energy almost double what we achieved in the first run what particle physicists 
  are all desperately hoping for are signs of new particles micro black holes or maybe something totally unexpected emerging from the violent collisions at the large
  if so then we can continue this long journey that began one hundred years ago with albert einstein towards an ever deeper understanding of the laws of nature  
 but if in two or three years ' time when the lhc switches off again for a second long shutdown  we 've found nothing but the higgs boson  
 then we may be entering a new era in physics  
 an era where there are weird features of the universe that we cannot explain an era where we have hints that we live in a multiverse
 that lies frustratingly forever beyond our reach 
 an era where we will never be able to answer the question why is there something rather than nothing 
 thank you bruno giussani harry
 even if
  you just said the science may not have some answers i would like to ask you a couple of questions and the first is
 building something like the lhc is a generational project i just mentioned introducing you that we live in  a
 short term world how do you think so long term  
 projecting yourself out a generation when building something like this harry cliff i was very lucky that i joined the experiment i work on at the lhc in two thousand and eight just as we were switching
  and there are people in my research group who have been working on it for three decades their entire careers on one machine so i think the first conversations about the lhc were in 
 and you start planning the machine without the technology that you know you 're going to need to be able to build it so the computing power did not exist in the early ' 90s when design work began in earnest one of the big detectors 
  which record these collisions they didn 't think there was technology that could withstand the radiation that would be created in the
  there was basically a lump of lead in the middle of this object with some detectors around the outside but subsequently we have developed technology so you have to rely on people 's ingenuity that they will solve the problems but it may be a decade or more down the line 
 bg china just announced two or three weeks ago that they intend to build
 a supercollider twice the size of the lhc i was wondering how you and your colleagues
 welcome the news hc size isn 't everything bruno
  mean  seriously it 's great news so
 building a machine like the lhc requires
 countries from all over the world to pool their resources no one nation can afford to build a machine this large apart from maybe china because they can mobilize huge amounts of resources manpower and money to to build machines like this so
  it 's only a good thing what they 're really planning to do is to build a machine that will study the higgs boson in detail and could give us some clues as to whether these new ideas like supersymmetry are really out there so it 's great news for physics i think
