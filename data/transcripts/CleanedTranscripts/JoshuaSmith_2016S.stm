  about forty percent of us will hear those three words within our lifetime
  and half will not survive
 this means that two out of five of your closest friends and relatives will be diagnosed with some form of cancer  
 and one will die  
 beyond the physical hardships roughly one third of cancer survivors here in the us will go into debt from treatment and they 're at least two and a half times more likely to declare bankruptcy than those
  this disease is pervasive it 's emotionally draining and for many financially destructive  
 but a cancer diagnosis doesn 't have to be a death sentence  finding cancer early  
 closer its genesis is one of the critical factors to improving treatment options  reducing its emotional impact and minimizing financial burdens 
  finding cancer early which is one of the primary aims of my research
 greatly enhances your odds of survival 
 if we just look at the case of breast cancer for example we find that those who are diagnosed and treated at stage one have a five year survival rate of nearly one hundred percent
 odds that decrease to just twenty two percent if treated at stage four  and similar trends are found for colorectal and ovarian cancer
  now we 're all aware that an early diagnosis that is accurate is critical for survival 
 the problem is that many cancer diagnostic tools are invasive  costly  
 often inaccurate and they can take an agonizing amount of time
 to get the results
  still worse when it comes to some forms of cancer such as
 ovarian  liver or pancreatic cancer  good screening methods simply don 't exist 
 meaning that often people wait until physical symptoms surface which are themselves already indicators of late stage progression 
 like a tornado strike in an area without an early warning system  there is
  no alarm to warn for the danger is already at your doorstep when your odds of survival are greatly reduced 
 having the convenience and accessibility of regular screening options that are
 affordable noninvasive and could provide results much sooner would provide us with a formidable
 weapon in the fight against cancer an early warning would allow us to get out ahead of the disease instead of merely following in its relentless wake
 and this is exactly what i 've been doing for the past three years  
 i 've been developing technologies that could ultimately aid clinicians with rapid early stage cancer diagnostics  
 and i 've been fueled
 by a deep scientific curiosity and a passion to change these statistics  
 last year however this fight became much more personal
 when my wife was
  diagnosed with breast cancer  it was an experience that added a strong and unexpected emotional dimension to these efforts
 i know firsthand how  life altering treatment can be 
 and i 'm keenly aware of the emotional havoc that cancer can wreak on a family which in our case included our two young daughters 
 because we found it early
 during a routine mammogram we were able to focus primarily on
 treatment options for the localized tumor reaffirming to me how important an early diagnosis is 
 unlike other forms of cancer  
 mammograms do offer an early stage screening option for breast cancer  
 still not everyone has this done or they may develop breast cancer before the middle age recommendation for having
  a mammogram 
 so there 's still a lot of room for improvement even for cancers that do have screening options and of course  considerable benefits for those that don 't 
 a key challenge then for cancer researchers
 is to develop methods that make regular screening for many types of cancers much more accessible
  imagine a scenario where during your regular checkup your doctor can take a simple noninvasive urine sample or other liquid biopsy 
 and present you with the results before you even leave the doctor 's office 
 such a technology could dramatically reduce the number of people who slip through the net of an early stage cancer diagnosis
 my research team of engineers and biochemists is working on exactly this challenge we 're working on ways to frequently activate
 an early stage cancer alarm
 by enabling regular screenings that would start when a person is healthy
 so that action could be taken to stop cancer the moment it emerges  and before it can progress beyond its infancy 
 the silver bullet in this case are tiny vesicles  little escape pods
 pods regularly shed by cells called exosomes exosomes
 are important biomarkers that provide an early warning system for the development of cancer  
 and because they 're abundantly present in just about every bodily fluid including blood urine and saliva  they 're extremely attractive for noninvasive liquid biopsies
 there 's just one problem an automated system for rapidly sorting these important biomarkers is not currently available
 we 've created a technology that we call
  is capable of precisely this automated exosome isolation
 to aid rapid cancer diagnostics 
 exosomes are the newest early warning weapon if you will to emerge on the liquid biopsy front  and they 're really really small 
 they measure just thirty to one hundred and fifty nanometers in diameter
  this is so tiny that you could fit about a million of them into a single red blood cell 
 that 's roughly the difference between a golf ball and a fine grain piece of sand  
 once thought to be little bins for unwanted cellular waste it has been found that cells actually communicate
 by
 producing and absorbing these exosomes which contain surface receptors  proteins and other genetic
  material collected from their cell of origin
 when absorbed by a neighboring cell exosomes release their contents into the receiving cell  
 and can set in motion fundamental changes in gene expression some good  and this is where cancer comes in some bad 
 because they are clothed in the material of the mother cell  and contain a sample of its environment they provide a genetic
  snapshot of that cell 's health
 and its origin  all of these qualities make exosomes invaluable messengers that potentially allow physicians to
 eavesdrop on your health at the cellular level to catch cancer early however  you have to frequently intercept these messages
 to determine when
  troublemakers within your body decide to start staging a coup which is why regular screening is so critical
 and why we 're developing technologies to make this possible
 while the first exosome based diagnostics emerged on the market just this year they are not yet part of mainstream healthcare options 
 in addition to their recent emergence another factor that 's limiting their widespread adoption
 is that currently no automated
  exists to make regular screening economically accessible 
 the current gold standard for exosome isolation includes  ultracentrifugation a process requiring expensive laboratory equipment 
 a trained lab tech and about thirty hours of time to process a sample 
 we 've come up with a different approach for achieving automated exosome isolation
 from a sample such as urine
 we use a chip based 
 continuous flow separation technique called deterministic lateral displacement 
 and we have done with it what the semiconductor industry has done so successfully for the past fifty years  we shrunk the dimensions of this technology from the micron scale
 to the true nanoscale so how does it work in a nutshell a set of tiny pillars separated by
  nanoscopic gaps
 are arranged in such a way that the system divides the fluid into streamlines with the larger cancer related nanoparticles being separated through a process of redirection
 from the smaller healthier ones which can in contrast
 move around the pillars in a zigzag type motion in the direction of fluid flow the net result is a complete separation of these two particle populations
  you can visualize this separation process similar to traffic on a highway
 that separates into two roads with one road going into a low clearance tunnel under a mountain and the other road going around it 
 here smaller cars can go through the tunnel
 while larger trucks  carrying potentially hazardous material are forced to take the detour route  traffic is effectively separated by size
 and contents without impeding its flow  and this is exactly how our system works on a much much smaller scale 
 the idea here is that the separation process for screening
 could be as simple as processing a sample of urine blood or saliva  which is a near term possibility within the next few
  it could be used to
 isolate and detect
 target exosomes associated with a particular type of cancer  sensing and reporting their presence within minutes 
 this would make rapid diagnostics virtually painless  
 broadly speaking the ability to separate and enrich biomarkers with nanoscale precision in an automated way 
 opens the door to better understanding diseases such as cancer with applications ranging from
  preparation to diagnostics and from drug resistance monitoring to therapeutics  
 even before my wife 's bout with cancer  it was a dream of mine to facilitate the automation of this process
 to make regular screening more accessible 
 similar to the way henry ford made the automobile accessible to the general population through development of the assembly line 
 automation is the key to accessibility
 and in the spirit of the hoover dream a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage 
 we 're developing a technology that could ultimately place an early warning cancer detection system in every home 
 this would allow every man woman and child the opportunity to
 be regularly tested while they 're still healthy catching cancer when it first emerges  it is my hope and dream to help people around the
  world
 avoid the high costs physical financial and emotional faced by today 's cancer patients 
 hardships that i 'm well acquainted with 
 i 'm also happy to report that because we caught my wife 's cancer early  her treatment was successful and she is now thankfully
  is an outcome that i would like to see for everyone with a cancer diagnosis 
 with the work that my team has already done on separation of nanoscale biomarkers for rapid early stage cancer diagnostics  
 i am optimistic that within the next decade this type of technology will
  helping protect our friends our family and future generations  
 even if we are so unlucky as to be diagnosed with cancer that early stage alarm will provide a strong beacon of hope
