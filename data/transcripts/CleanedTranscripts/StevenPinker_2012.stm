  reason appears to have fallen on hard times 
 popular culture plumbs new depths of dumbth and political discourse has become a race to the bottom  
 we 're living in an era of scientific creationism  
 nine eleven conspiracy theories  psychic hotlines and a resurgence of religious fundamentalism
 who think too well are often accused of elitism  and even in the academy there are attacks on 
 the crime of letting logic dominate our thinking sp 
 but is this necessarily a bad thing 
 perhaps reason is overrated many pundits have argued that a good heart and steadfast moral clarity are superior
  overeducated policy wonks  like the best and brightest and that dragged us into the quagmire of vietnam  
 and wasn 't it reason that gave us the means to despoil the planet and threaten our species with weapons of mass destruction 
 in this way of thinking  it 's character and conscience not cold hearted calculation that will save us  
 besides a human being is not a brain on a stick
 my fellow psychologists have
  shown that we 're led by our bodies and our emotions and use our puny powers of reason merely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact rng 
 how could a reasoned argument logically entail the ineffectiveness of reasoned arguments 
 look you 're trying to persuade us of reason 's impotence you 're not threatening us or bribing us suggesting that we resolve the issue with a show of hands or a beauty contest
 by the very act of trying to reason us into your position you 're conceding reason 's potency reason isn 't up for grabs here it can 't be you show up for that debate and you 've already lost it sp 
 but can
 reason lead us in directions that are good or decent or moral
  pointed out that reason is just a means to an end and the end depends on the reasoner 's passions reason can lay out a road map to peace and harmony if the reasoner wants peace and harmony  
 but it can also lay out a road map to conflict and strife if the reasoner delights in conflict and strife can reason force the reasoner to want less cruelty and waste rng all
 on its own  the answer is no but it doesn 't take much to switch it to yes you need two conditions
  the first is that reasoners all care about their own well being that 's one of the passions that has to be present in order for reason to go
 to work  and it 's obviously present in all of us we all care passionately about our own well being 
 the second condition is that reasoners are members of a community of reasoners who can affect one another 's well being can exchange messages and
  comprehend each other 's reasoning 
 and that 's certainly true of our gregarious and loquatious species well endowed with the instinct for language sp well that sounds good in theory  but 
  has it worked that way in practice in particular can it explain a momentous historical development that i spoke about five years ago here at
  we seem to be getting more humane  centuries ago our ancestors would burn cats alive as a form of popular entertainment  
 knights waged constant war on each other by trying to kill as many of each other 's peasants as possible  
 governments executed people for frivolous reasons  like stealing a cabbage or criticizing the royal garden  
 the executions were designed to be as prolonged and as painful as possible like crucifixion
  breaking on the wheel  respectable people kept slaves for all our flaws we have abandoned these barbaric practices rng so do you think it 's human nature that 's changed sp 
 not exactly  i think we still harbor instincts that can erupt in violence like greed tribalism revenge  dominance sadism but we also have instincts that can steer us away  like  self control 
 empathy 
 a sense of fairness what abraham lincoln called the better angels of our nature rng so if human nature
  didn 't change what invigorated those better angels sp well among other things our circle of empathy expanded
  years ago our ancestors would feel the pain only of their family and people in their village  but with the expansion of literacy and travel people started to sympathize with wider and wider circles the clan  the tribe the nation
  really give so much credit to soft hearted empathy sp they can and do
  have found neurons in the brain that respond to other people 's actions the same way they respond to our own  
 empathy emerges early in life perhaps before the age of one books on empathy have become bestsellers  like the empathic civilization and the age of empathy
  i 'm all for empathy i mean who isn 't but all on its own it 's
 a feeble instrument for making moral progress for one thing it 's innately biased toward blood relations babies and warm fuzzy animals as far as empathy is concerned  
 ugly outsiders can go to hell  
 and even our best attempts to work up sympathy
  for those who are unconnected with us fall
 miserably short a sad truth about human nature that was pointed out by adam smith adam smith let
 us suppose that the great empire of china was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake  
 and let us consider how a man of humanity in europe would react on receiving intelligence of this dreadful calamity  
 he would i imagine first of all express very strongly his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people he would make many melancholy reflections upon the precariousness of human life  
 and when all these humane
  sentiments had been once fairly expressed he would pursue his business or his pleasure with the same ease and tranquility as if no such accident had happened if he was to lose
  his little finger tomorrow he would not sleep tonight  but provided he never saw them  he would snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred million of his brethren sp 
  you didn 't mention what might be one of our most effective better angels
 reason reason has muscle it 's reason that provides the push to widen that circle of empathy  
 every one of the humanitarian developments that you mentioned originated with thinkers who gave reasons for why some practice was indefensible
  demonstrated that the way people treated some particular group of others was logically inconsistent with the way they insisted on being treated themselves sp 
 are you saying that reason can actually change people 's minds don
 't people just stick with whatever conviction serves their interests or conforms to the culture that they grew up in rng 
 here 's a
  a fascinating fact about us contradictions bother us at least when we 're forced to confront them which is just another way of saying that we are susceptible to reason  
 and if you look at the history of moral progress you can trace a direct pathway from reasoned arguments to changes in the way that we actually feel 
  time and again a thinker would lay out an argument as to why some practice was indefensible
  with values already held their essay would go viral get translated into many languages  get debated at pubs and coffee houses and salons and at dinner parties 
 and influence leaders  legislators  popular opinion eventually their conclusions get
  absorbed into the common sense of decency erasing the tracks of the original argument that had gotten us there 
 few of us today feel any need to put forth a rigorous philosophical argument as to why slavery is wrong or public hangings or beating children 
 by now these things just feel wrong  but just those arguments had to be made and they were in centuries past sp 
  grasp why something might be a wee bit wrong with burning heretics at the stake rng oh they did  here 's the french theologian sebastian  castellio making the case 
 and other sects say that they are who shall be judge if the matter is certain to whom is it so to calvin  but then why does he write so many books about manifest truth
  in view of the uncertainty we must define heretics simply as one with whom we disagree  and if then we are going to kill heretics the logical outcome will be a war of extermination  since each is sure of himself sp 
 or with hideous punishments like breaking on the wheel rng the prohibition in our constitution of cruel and unusual punishments was a response to a pamphlet circulated in one thousand seven 
 by the italian jurist cesare beccaria cesare
  as punishments become more cruel the minds of men which like fluids always adjust to the level of the objects that surround them  
 become hardened  and after a hundred years of cruel punishments 
 breaking on the wheel causes no more fear than imprisonment previously did
  for a punishment to achieve its objective  it is only necessary that the harm that it inflicts outweighs the benefit that derives from the crime and
 into this calculation
  to be factored the certainty of punishment and the loss of the good that the commission of the crime will produce  
 everything beyond this is superfluous  and therefore tyrannical sp but surely antiwar movements depended on mass demonstrations and catchy tunes by folk singers
 and wrenching photographs of the human costs of war rng no doubt but modern anti war movements reach back to a long chain of thinkers who had argued as to why we ought to mobilize our emotions against war
  such as the father of modernity  erasmus erasmus the advantages derived from peace diffuse themselves far and wide 
 and reach great numbers  while in war if anything turns out happily  the advantage  redounds only to a few and those unworthy of reaping it 
 one man 's safety is owing to the destruction of another 
 one man 's prize is derived from the plunder of another the cause of rejoicings made by one side is to the other a cause of mourning
  whatever is unfortunate in war is severely so indeed  and whatever on the contrary is called good fortune is a savage and a cruel good fortune an ungenerous happiness deriving its existence 
  from another 's woe sp but everyone knows that the movement to abolish slavery depended on faith and emotion it was a movement spearheaded by the quakers  and it only became popular
  when harriet beecher stowe 's novel uncle tom 's cabin became a bestseller rng but the ball got rolling a century before  john locke bucked the tide of millennia 
 that had regarded the practice as perfectly natural he argued that it was inconsistent with the principles of rational government john locke freedom of men under government is to have
  a standing rule to live by common to everyone of that society and made by the legislative power erected in it 
 not to be subject to the inconstant  uncertain  unknown  arbitrary will of another man as freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint but the law of nature sp 
 those words sound familiar where have i read them before ah 
 yes mary astell if absolute sovereignty be not necessary in a state  how comes it to be so in a
  or if in a family why not in a state  
 since no reason can be alleged for the one that will not hold more strongly for the other if all men are born free how is it that all women are born slaves 
 as they must be if being subjected to the inconstant  uncertain  unknown  arbitrary will of men be the perfect condition of slavery rng 
 that sort of
 all in the job description of
  one movement for the expansion of rights inspires another because the logic is the same and once that 's hammered home  it becomes increasingly uncomfortable 
 to ignore the inconsistency in the  1960s the civil rights movement inspired the movements for women 's rights children 's rights  gay rights and even animal 
  rights  but fully two centuries before the enlightenment thinker jeremy bentham had exposed the
  practices such as the cruelty to animals jeremy bentham the
 question is not can they reason  nor can they talk  but can they suffer rng 
 and the persecution of homosexuals jb 
 as to any primary mischief  it 's evident that it produces no pain in anyone on the contrary it produces pleasure  
  if either of them be unwilling the act is an offense  totally different in its nature of effects it 's a personal injury it 's a kind of rape
  as to the any danger exclusive of pain the danger if any much consist in the tendency of the example  
 but what is the tendency of this example to dispose others to engage in the same practices  but this practice produces not pain of any kind to anyone sp 
 still
  it took at least a century for the arguments of these great thinkers to trickle down and infiltrate the population as a whole it kind of makes you wonder about our own time
  are there practices that we engage in where the arguments against them are there for all to see
 but nonetheless we persist in them rng when our great grandchildren look back at us will they be as appalled by some of our practices as we are by our
  i 'm sure everyone here could think of an example rng 
 i opt for the mistreatment of animals in factory farms sp 
 the imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders and the toleration of rape in our nation 's prisons rng scrimping on donations to life saving charities in the developing world sp 
 the possession of nuclear weapons 
 rng the appeal to religion to justify the otherwise unjustifiable  such as the ban on contraception
  faith in general rng eh 
 i 'm not holding my breath sp 
 still  i have become convinced that reason is a better angel that deserves the greatest credit for the moral progress our species has enjoyed and that holds out the greatest hope for continuing moral progress in the future rng 
 and if our friends you detect a flaw in this argument just remember you 'll be depending on reason to
  out thank you
