  we switch to the video disc which is in play mode
 i 'm really interested in how you put people and computers together we will be using the tv screens
  there is another way where computers touch people wearing
  this i was also asked to look at all fourteen ted talks that i had given  chronologically the
 first one was actually two hours the second one was an hour and then they became half hours  
 and all i noticed was my bald spot getting bigger 
 imagine seeing
  for me quite a shocking experience  so what i 'm going to do in my time is try and share with you what happened during the thirty years
  and then also make a prediction  and then
 tell you a little bit about what i 'm doing next  and i put
 on a slide where ted one happened in my life
  and it 's rather important
 because i had done fifteen years of research before it so i had a backlog  
 so it was easy it 's not that i was fidel castro and i could talk for two hours or bucky fuller i had fifteen years of stuff and the media lab was about to start so that was easy  
 but there are a couple of things about that period
 and about what
  happened that are really quite important one is that
 it was a period when computers weren 't yet for people 
 and the other thing that sort of happened during that time
 is that we were considered sissy computer
  considered the real thing so what i 'm going to show you is in retrospect a lot more interesting and a lot more accepted than it was at the time  
 so i 'm going to characterize the years and i 'm even going to go back
 to some very early work of mine and this was the kind of stuff i was doing in the ' 60s very direct manipulation very influenced as i studied architecture
 by the architect moshe safdie and you can see that we even built robotic things that could build habitat like structures and this for me was
 not yet the media lab  but was the beginning of what i 'll call sensory computing  and i pick fingers partly because
 everybody thought it was ridiculous papers were published
 about how stupid it was to use fingers three reasons one was they were
  low resolution the other is your hand would occlude what you wanted to see  and the third which was the winner was that your fingers would get the screen dirty  
 and hence fingers would never be a device that you 'd use  and this was a device we built in the ' 70s which has never even been picked up it 's not just touch sensitive
  was to sort of do interface concurrently so when you talked and you pointed and you had if you will multiple
  air france was hijacked taken to entebbe  
 and the israelis not only did an extraordinary rescue they did it partly because they had practiced on a physical model of the airport 
 because they had built the airport so they built a model in the desert  and when they arrived at entebbe they knew where to go because they had actually been there
  government asked some of us ' seventy six if we could replicate that computationally and of course somebody like myself says yes immediately  you get a contract department of 
  defense and we built this truck and this rig  we did sort of a simulation because you had video discs  and again this is ' seventy six 
  and so you have google maps 
 still people thought no that was not serious computer science  
 and it was a man named jerry wiesner who happened to be the president of mit who did think it was computer science  
 and one of the keys for anybody who wants to start something in life  
 make sure your president
 is part of it  
  so when i was doing the media lab  it was like having a gorilla in the front seat  if you were stopped for speeding
 and the officer looked in the window and saw who was in the passenger seat then oh continue on sir and so we were able  and this is a cute actually device 
 parenthetically this was a lenticular photograph of jerry wiesner where the only thing that changed in the photograph were the lips  
  lenticular sheet with his photograph it would be in lip sync with zero bandwidth it was a zero bandwidth teleconferencing system at the time
  so 
 this was the media lab 's this is what we said we 'd do that the world of computers publishing and so on would come together  again not generally accepted
 but very much part of ted in the early days and this is really where we were headed  
 and that created the media lab one of the things about
 age
 is
 that i can tell you with great confidence  i 've been to the future i 've been there actually many times  and the reason i say
  that is how many times in my life have i said oh in ten years this will happen and then ten years comes and then you say
 oh in five years this will happen and then five years comes  so i say this a little bit with having felt that i 'd been there a number of times  and 
 one of the things that is most quoted that i 've ever said is that computing is not about computers 
  didn 't quite get enough traction and then it started to 
 it started to because people caught on that the medium wasn 't the message  
 and the reason i show this car in actually a rather ugly slide is just again to tell you the kind of story that characterized a little bit of my life  
 this is a student of mine who had done a
  backseat driver it
 was in the early days of gps the car knew where it was and it would give audio instructions to the driver  when to turn right when to turn left and so on turns out there are a lot 
  of things in those instructions that back in that period were pretty challenging like what does it mean take the next right well
  the student did a wonderful thesis  and the mit patent office said don 't patent it it
 'll never be accepted  
 the liabilities are too large there will be insurance issues don 't patent it so we didn 't 
 but it shows you how people  again at times  don 't really look
  what 's happening 
 some work and i 'll just go through these very quickly a lot of sensory stuff you might recognize a young  yo yo ma and tracking his body
 for playing
 the cello or the hypercello these fellows literally walked around like that at the time
 it 's now a little bit more discreet and more commonplace  and then there are at least three heroes i want to quickly mention marvin minsky
  taught me a lot about common sense  and i will talk briefly about muriel cooper who was very important to ricky wurman and to ted and
 in fact when she got onstage she said
 the first thing she said was i introduced ricky to nicky and nobody calls me nicky and nobody calls richard ricky so nobody knew who she was talking about 
 and then of course seymour papert
 who is the person who said you can 't think about thinking unless you think about thinking about something and that 's actually you can
 unpack that later it 's a pretty profound pretty profound statement
  i 'm showing some some slides that were from ted two a little silly as slides perhaps then i
 felt television
  really was about displays
  again now we 're past ted one 
 but just around the time of ted two  and what i 'd like to mention here is even though you could imagine intelligence in the device  i look today 
  at some of the work being done about the internet of things and i think it 's kind of tragically pathetic  
  the oven
 panel and put it on your cell phone or the door key onto your cell phone just taking it and bringing it to you and in fact that 's actually what you don 't want you want to put a chicken 
  in the oven  and the oven says aha it 's a chicken and it cooks the chicken oh it 's cooking the chicken for nicholas and he likes it this way and that way so the
  instead of being in the device we have started today to move it back onto the cell phone or closer to the user  not a particularly enlightened view of the internet of things
  television again television what i said today that was back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety and the television of tomorrow would look something like that 
 again people
  decided that he would call
 this diagram the negroponte switch i 'm
 probably much less famous than george so when he called it the negroponte switch it stuck  
 but the idea of things that came in the ground would go in the air and stuff in the air would go into the ground has played
  itself out that is the original slide
 from from that year  and it has worked in lockstep obedience we started wired magazine some people
 i remember we shared the reception desk periodically and some parent called up irate
  that his son had given up sports illustrated to subscribe for wired  and he said are you some porno magazine or something 
 and couldn 't understand why his son would be interested in wired 
 at any rate
  i will go through this a little quicker this is
  you at least it gives me pleasure
 when somebody says how dead wrong you are 
 being digital came out for me it gave me an opportunity to to be more in the trade press and get this out to the public  
 and it also allowed us to build the new media lab which if you
  we came to them  i looked forward to it every year  it was the party that ricky wurman never had
 in the sense that he invited many of his old friends including myself  and then something for me changed
  i became more involved with computers and learning and influenced by seymour but particularly looking at learning
 as something that is best approximated by computer programming  
 when you write a computer program  you 've got to not just list things out and sort of take an algorithm and translate it into a set of instructions but when there 's a bug and all programs have bugs  you 've got to
  you 've got to go in change it and then re execute and you iterate  and that iteration is
 really a very very good approximation of learning  
 so that led to my own work with seymour in places like cambodia and the starting of one laptop per child 
 enough ted talks on one laptop per child so i 'll go through it very fast
  but it did it did give us the chance to do something at a relatively large scale
 in the area of learning development and computing 
 very few people know that one laptop per child was a $ one billion project  and it was at least over the seven years i ran it but even more important the world bank contributed zero
  it was mostly the countries using their own treasuries which is very interesting at least to me it was very interesting in terms of what i plan to do next  so these are the various places it happened 
 i then tried an experiment  and the experiment happened in ethiopia  
 and here 's the experiment the
 experiment is can
 learning happen where there are no schools and we dropped off tablets with no instructions
 and let the children figure it out and in a short period of time they not only
 turned them on and were using fifty apps per child within five days they were singing
 but they hacked android
 within six months  and so that seemed sufficiently interesting this is perhaps the best picture i have the kid
 on your right has sort of nominated himself as teacher look at the kid on the left and so on there are no
  no adults involved in this at all so i said well can we do this at a larger scale and what is it that 's missing the
 kids are giving a press conference at this point and sort of writing in the dirt  
 and the answer is what is missing and i 'm going to skip over my prediction  actually because i 'm running out of time  and here 's the question 
 is what 's going to happen  
 i think
 the challenge is to connect the last billion people and connecting the last
  billion
 is very different than connecting the next billion  
 and the reason it 's different is that the next billion are sort of low hanging fruit  but the last billion are rural 
 being
 rural and being poor are very different  poverty tends to be created by our society  
 and the people in that community are not
 poor
 in the same way at all they may be primitive  but
 the way to approach it and to connect them  the history of one laptop per child  and the
 experiment in ethiopia  lead me to believe that we can in fact do this in a very short period of time  
 and so my plan and
 unfortunately
  i haven 't been able to get my partners at this point to let me announce them but is to do this with a stationary satellite
 there are many reasons that stationary satellites aren 't the best things  
 but there are a lot of reasons why they are and for two billion dollars you can connect a lot more than one
  hundred million people  but the reason i picked two  and i will leave this as my last slide is two billion dollars
 is what we were spending
 in afghanistan every week  so surely if we can connect
 africa and the last billion people for numbers like that we should be doing
 thank you very much
 and my prediction and this is a prediction because it 'll be thirty years i won 't be here  
 but one of the things about learning how to read  
 we have been doing a lot of consuming of information going through our eyes and so that may be a very inefficient channel 
 so my prediction is that we are going to ingest
 information
 you 're going to swallow a pill and know english  
 you 're going to swallow a pill and know shakespeare  and the way to do it is through the bloodstream  
 so once it 's in your bloodstream it basically goes through it and gets into the brain and when it knows that it 's in the brain in the different pieces 
 it deposits it in the right places  so it 's ingesting ca have you been hanging out with ray kurzweil
  boyden and hanging around with one of the speakers who is here hugh herr  and there are a number of people this isn 't quite as far fetched so
 thirty years from now ca we will check it out we 're going to be back and we 're going to play this clip thirty years from now  and then all eat the red pill  
 well thank you for that
