  im going around the world giving talks about darwin and usually what im talking about is darwins strange inversion of reasoning  
 now that title that phrase comes from a critic an early critic  and this is a passage that i just love and would like to
 read for you
  the theory with which we have to deal absolute ignorance is the artificer so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system 
 that in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine it is not requisite to know how to make it 
 this proposition will be found on careful examination to express in condensed
  the essential purport of the theory 
 and to express in a few words all mr darwins meaning  who by a strange inversion of reasoning  
 seems to think absolute ignorance fully qualified to take the place of absolute wisdom in the achievements of creative skill 
 exactly
 exactly  and it is a strange inversion a creationist pamphlet has
  this wonderful page in it test two do you know of any building that didnt have a builder  yes no 
 do you know of any painting that didnt have a painter  yes no  do you know of any car that didnt have a maker  yes no if you answered ' yes '
 for any of the above  give details
 you would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer  
 but darwin shows that its just false  
 today though im going to talk about darwins other strange inversion which is equally puzzling at first  but in some ways just as important
  it stands to reason that we love chocolate cake
 because it is sweet  guys go for girls like this because they are sexy 
 we adore babies because theyre so cute and of course we are amused by jokes
 because they are funny  
 this is all backwards
  it is and darwin shows us why  lets start with sweet our sweet tooth
 is basically an evolved sugar detector 
 because sugar is high energy  and its just been wired up to the preferer to put it very crudely  
 and thats why we like sugar honey is sweet because we like it not
  like it because honey is sweet theres nothing intrinsically sweet
 about honey if you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind you wouldnt see why they tasted sweet 
 you have to look in our brains to understand why theyre sweet
  if you think first there was sweetness  and then we evolved to like sweetness youve got it backwards thats just wrong 
 its the other way round sweetness was born with the wiring
 which evolved and theres nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies  and its a good thing
 that there isnt because if there were then mother nature would have a problem how on earth do you get chimps to
 now you might think ah
 theres a solution  hallucinations that
 would be one way of doing it but theres a quicker way 
 just wire the chimps up to love that look 
 and apparently they do
 thats all there is to
  over six million years we and the chimps evolved our different ways we became
 oddly enough for one reason or another they didnt if we hadnt then probably this would be the height of sexiness
  tooth
 is an evolved and instinctual preference for high energy food it wasnt designed for chocolate cake chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus the 
  term is owed to niko tinbergen who did his famous experiments with gulls where he found that that orange spot on the gulls beak if he made a bigger oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder it was a hyperstimulus for them
  they loved it what we see with say chocolate cake is its a supernormal stimulus
 to tweak
 our design wiring  and there are lots of supernormal stimuli chocolate cake is one there 's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness  and there 's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness heres a pretty good
  its important that we love babies and that we not be put off by say messy diapers 
 so babies have to have to attract our affection and our and our nurturing  and they do and by the way a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby 
 so nature works on many levels here  but now if babies didnt look the way they do if babies looked like this thats what we would find adorable
 thats what we would find we would think  oh my goodness do i ever want to hug that 
 this is the strange inversion well now finally what about funny  
 my answer is its the same story 
 the same story this is the hard one the one that isnt obvious thats why i leave it to the end and i wont be able to say too much about it 
 but you have to think evolutionarily
  have to think what hard job that has to be done its dirty work somebodys got to do it
 is so important
 to give us such a powerful inbuilt reward for it when we succeed 
 now i think we 've found the answer i and a few of my colleagues 
 its a neural system thats wired up to reward the brain
 for doing a
 grubby clerical job our bumper sticker for this view is
 that this is the joy of debugging now im not going to have time to spell it all out but ill just
 say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward and what were doing is were using
 humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe
  by switching humor on and off by turning the knob on a joke now its not funny oh now its funnier  now well turn a little bit more now its not funny in this way we can actually learn something about the architecture of the brain 
 the functional architecture of the brain
