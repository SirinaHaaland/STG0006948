  imagine if you could record your life
 everything you said everything you did available in a perfect memory store at your fingertips  so you could go back
 and find memorable moments and relive them  or sift through traces of time and
  discover patterns in your own life that previously had gone undiscovered  well that 's exactly the journey
 that my family began five and a half years ago  
 this is my wife and collaborator rupal and on this day at this moment we walked into the house with our first child our beautiful baby
  we walked into a house with a very special home video recording system 
 okay deb roy 
 this moment and thousands of other moments special for us were captured in our home because in every room in the house
  see a camera and a microphone  and if you looked down you 'd get this bird  's eye view of the room here 's our living room  
 the baby bedroom kitchen  dining room
 and the rest of the house  and all of these fed into a disc array
 that was designed for a continuous capture  so here we are flying through a day in our home as we move from sunlit morning through
  incandescent evening and finally  lights out
 for the day  
 over the course of three years  
 we recorded eight to ten hours a day  
 amassing roughly a quarter million hours of multi track audio and video  so you 're looking at a piece of what is by far the largest home video
  what this data represents for our family at a personal level
 the impact has already been immense and we 're still learning its value  
 countless moments of unsolicited natural moments not posed moments are captured there  and we 're starting to learn how to discover them and find them  
 but there 's also a scientific reason that drove this project  which was to use this
  natural longitudinal data to understand the process of how a child learns language that child being my son  
 and so with many privacy provisions put in place to protect everyone who was recorded in the data  we made elements of the data available 
  to my trusted research team at mit so we could start teasing apart patterns
  set  trying to understand the influence of social
 environments on language acquisition  so we 're looking here at one of the first things we started to do this is my wife and i cooking
 breakfast in the kitchen  and as we move through space and through time a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen
  in order to convert
 this opaque  ninety thousand hours of video into something that we could start to see we use motion analysis to pull out as we move through space and through time what we call space time worms 
 and this has become part of our toolkit for being able to look and see where the activities are in the data and with it trace the pattern of in particular
 where my son moved throughout the home  so that we could focus our transcription efforts all of the speech environment
 around my son all of the words that he heard from myself my wife our nanny  and over time the words he began to produce 
 so with that technology and that data and the ability to with machine assistance transcribe speech we 've now transcribed well over seven million words of
  and with that let me take you now for a first tour into the data  so you 've all i 'm sure seen time lapse videos where a flower will blossom as 
  you accelerate time i 'd like you to now experience the blossoming of a speech form  my son soon after his first birthday would say gaga 
  so we 're going to cruise through half a year
 in about forty seconds no video here  so you can focus on the sound the acoustics of a new kind of trajectory gaga to water
  so he didn 't just learn water  over the
  the first two years that we really focused on this is a map of every word he learned in chronological order and because we have full transcripts  we 've identified 
 each of the five hundred and three words that he learned to produce by his second birthday he was an early talker  
  interpret this apparently simple graph is on the vertical is an indication of how complex caregiver utterances are based on the length of utterances 
 and the [ horizontal ] axis is time 
 and all of the data  we aligned based on the following idea every time
 my son would learn a word we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contained that word
  and we would plot
 the relative length of the utterances and what we found was this curious phenomena 
 that caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum  making language as simple as possible and then slowly ascend back up in complexity 
 and the amazing thing was that bounce that dip
  lined up almost precisely with when each word was born word after word systematically so it appears that all three primary caregivers myself my wife and our nanny
 were systematically and i would think  subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into
 more complex language and the implications of this there are many but one i just want to point out is that there must be amazing
  feedback loops of course my son is learning from his linguistic environment  but the environment is learning from him that environment people are in these tight feedback loops and creating a kind of scaffolding
 that has not been noticed until now  but that 's looking at the speech context what about the visual context we 're not looking at
 think of this as a dollhouse cutaway of
  taken those circular fish eye lens cameras  and we 've done some optical correction  and then we can bring it into three dimensional life  
 so welcome to my home  
 this is a moment one moment captured across multiple cameras  the reason we did this is to create the ultimate memory machine where you can go back and interactively fly around and then breathe
 what i 'm going to do is give you an accelerated view of thirty minutes again of just
 life in the living room that 's me
 and my son on the floor  
 and there 's video analytics that are tracking our movements 
 my son is leaving red ink i am leaving green ink we 're now on the couch looking out through the window at cars
 cars passing by and finally my son playing in a walking toy by himself now we freeze the action thirty minutes  
 we turn time into the vertical axis  and we open up for a view of these interaction traces we 've just left behind  
 and we see these amazing structures
 these little knots of two colors of of thread we call social hot spots the spiral thread
  and we think that these affect the way language is learned what we 'd like to do is start understanding the interaction between these patterns
 and the language that my son is exposed to to see if we can predict how the structure of when words are heard affects
 when they 're learned so in other words the relationship between words and what they 're about in the world so here 's how
  she offers water 
 and off go the two worms over to the kitchen to get water  and what we 've done is use the word water to tag that moment that bit of activity
  and now we take the power of data and take every time my son ever heard the word water and the context he saw it in  
 and we use it to penetrate through the video and find every activity trace that co occurred with an instance of water 
 and what this data leaves in its wake is a landscape 
 we call these wordscapes  this is the wordscape for the word water and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen that 's where those big peaks are
  are over to the left  and just for contrast we can do this with any word  we can take the word bye 
 as in good bye and we 're now zoomed in over the entrance to the house  and we look and we find as you would expect a contrast in the landscape
 where the word bye occurs much more in a structured way so we 're using these structures to start predicting
 the order of language acquisition
  and that
 's ongoing work now in my lab which we 're peering into now at mit this is at the media lab  this has become my favorite way of videographing just about any space 
 three of the key people in this project philip decamp  rony kubat and brandon roy are pictured here  philip has been a close collaborator on all the visualizations you 're
  student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis and he made the following observation 
 that just the way that we 're analyzing how language connects to events which provide common ground for language that same idea we can take out of your home deb  and we can apply it to the world of public media 
 and so our effort took an unexpected turn 
 think of mass media
 as providing common ground
 and you have the recipe for taking this idea to a whole new place we 've started analyzing television content
 using the same principles analyzing event structure of a tv signal
 episodes of shows commercials all of the components that make up the event structure  and we 're now with satellite dishes pulling and analyzing a
  good part of all the tv being watched in the united states 
 and you don 't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones to get people 's conversations 
 you just tune into publicly available social media feeds  so we 're pulling in about three billion comments a month  
 and then the magic happens you have the event structure  the common ground that the words are about coming out of the television feeds you 've got the
  conversations that are about those topics and through semantic analysis and this is actually real data you 're looking at from our data
 processing each yellow line is showing a link being made between a comment in the wild
 and a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal and the same idea now can be built up  and we get
  wordscape except now words are not assembled in my living room  instead the context the common ground activities 
 are the content on television that 's driving the conversations  and what we 're seeing here these skyscrapers now are commentary that are linked
 to content on television same concept  but looking at
  very different sphere and
 so fundamentally rather than for example measuring content based on how many people are watching this gives us the basic data for looking at engagement properties of content  
 and just like we can look at feedback cycles and dynamics in a in a family we can now open up the same concepts and look at
 much larger groups of people this is a subset of data from our database just fifty thousand out
  of several million
 and the social graph that connects them through publicly available sources
  and if you put them on one plain a second plain is where the content lives  
 so we have the programs and
 the the sporting events and the commercials and all of the link structures that tie them together make a content graph and then the important third
  dimension each of the links that you 're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between
 something someone said and a piece of content  and there are again now tens of millions of these links that give us the connective tissue
 of social graphs and how they relate to content  and we can now start to probe the structure in interesting ways  so if we for example trace
  the path of one piece of content
 that drives someone to comment on it and then we follow where that comment goes and then look at the entire social graph that becomes activated
 and then trace back to see the relationship between that social graph and content a very interesting structure becomes visible we call this a
  a virtual living room if you will  
 and there are fascinating dynamics at play it 's not one way a piece of content an event  causes someone to talk they talk to other people that drives tune in behavior back into mass media 
 and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior another example very different
 another actual person in our database and we 're finding at least hundreds if not thousands of these we 've given this person a name  this is a
 pro amateur or pro am media critic
 who has this
 high fan out rate so a lot of people are following this person very influential and they have a propensity to talk about what 's on tv 
 so this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together 
 one last example from this data  sometimes it 's actually a piece of content that is special so if we go and look at
  this piece of content  president obama 's state of the union address from just a few weeks ago 
 and look at what we find in this same data set at the same scale  
 the engagement properties of this piece of content are truly remarkable a nation exploding in conversation
 in real time in response to what 's on on the broadcast and of course through all of these
  lines are flowing unstructured language we 
 pulse of a nation real time sense of the social reactions in the different circuits
 in the social graph being activated by content 
 so to summarize  the idea is this as our world becomes increasingly instrumented
 and we have the capabilities to collect and connect the dots
  between what people are saying and the context they 're saying it in 
 what 's emerging is an ability to see new social structures and dynamics that have previously not been seen it 's like building a microscope or telescope and revealing new structures about our own behavior around communication  
 and i think the implications here are profound
  whether it 's for science for commerce for government or perhaps most of all for us as individuals  
 and so just to return to my son 
 when i was preparing this talk he was looking over my shoulder  and i showed him the clips i was going to show to you today and i asked him for permission granted  
 and then i went on to reflect isn 't it amazing 
 this
  going to hand off to you and to your sister who arrived two years later and you guys are going to be able to go back 
  moments that you could never with your biological memory  
 possibly remember the way you can now and he was quiet for a moment and i thought what am i thinking he 's five years old he 's not going to understand this 
 and just as i was having that thought he looked up at me and said so
 that when i grow up i can show this to my kids
  i thought wow this is powerful stuff so i want to leave you with one last
 memorable moment from our family  this is the first time our son took more than two steps at once
 captured on film  and i really want you to focus on something as i take you through
 's a cluttered environment  it 's natural life 
 my mother 's in the kitchen cooking and of all places in the hallway i realize he 's about to do it about
 to take more than two steps and so you hear me encouraging him  realizing what 's happening and then the magic happens listen very carefully about three steps in 
 he realizes something magic is happening and the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in and
  i echo back the same and so let 's fly back in time to that memorable moment
