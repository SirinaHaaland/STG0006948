  forty million americans
 are indebted for their passage to the new economy  too poor to pay their way through college they now owe lenders
 more than one trillion us dollars they do find what jobs they can get
  to pay off a debt that is secured on their person in america  even a
 bankrupt gambler
 gets a second chance  but it is nearly impossible
 for an american to get discharged their student loan debts  
 once upon a time in america
  going to college did not mean graduating with debt  my friend paul 's father graduated from colorado state university
 on the gi bill 
 for his generation higher education was free or almost free because it was thought of as a public good 
  when paul also graduated from colorado state university he paid for his english degree
 by working part time 
 thirty years ago  higher education tuition was affordable reasonable  and what debts you accumulated you paid off by graduation date not anymore  
 paul 's daughter followed
 in his footsteps but with one difference when she graduated five years ago it was with a whopping debt
  students like kate have to take on a loan
 because the cost of higher education has become unaffordable for many if not most american families 
 but so what getting into debt to buy an expensive education is not all bad if you could pay it off
 with the increased income that you earned from it  but that 's where the rubber meets the road
 even a college grad
 earned ten percent more in two thousand and one than she did in two thousand and thirteen so 
 tuition costs up public funding down  family incomes diminished  personal incomes
 weak is it any wonder that more than a quarter of those who must
  make their student loan payments 
 the worst of times
 can be the best of times because certain truths flash up in ways that you can 't ignore  i want to speak of three of them today 
 one point two trillion dollars of debts for diplomas make it abundantly obvious that higher education is a consumer product you can buy
  all of us talk about education just as the economists do now as an investment
 that you make to improve the human stock by training them for work 
 as an investment you make to sort and classify people so that employers can hire them more easily 
  world report ranks colleges just as the consumer report rates washing machines the language is peppered
 with barbarisms teachers are called service providers students are called consumers 
 sociology and shakespeare and soccer and and science all of these are content 
 student debt is profitable only not on you
  your debt fattens the profit of the student loan industry 
 the two  800 pound gorillas of which sallie mae and navient
 posted last year a combined profit of one point two billion dollars  
 and just like home mortgages student loans can be bundled and packaged and sliced and
  and sold on wall street  and colleges and universities that invest in these securitized loans
 profit twice  once from your tuition and then again from the interest on debt 
 with all that money to be made are we surprised that some in the higher education business
 have begun to engage in false advertising
  in bait and switch 
 in exploiting the very ignorance that they pretend to educate 
 diplomas are a brand 
 many years ago my teacher wrote 
 when students are treated as consumers they 're made prisoners of addiction and envy 
  as consumers can be sold and resold upgraded versions of an iphone so also people can be sold more and more education
 college is the new high school we already say that but why stop there people can be upsold on certifications and 
 master 's degrees  doctoral degrees 
 higher education is also
  marketed as a status object 
 buy a degree much like you do a lexus of a louis vuitton bag to distinguish yourself from others  so you can be the object of envy of others  
 diplomas are a brand  but these truths
 are often times hidden by a very noisy sales pitch  there is not a day that goes by
  college degree is absolutely essential to get on that up escalator to a middle class life 
 and the usual evidence offered is the college premium a college grad
 who makes on average fifty six percent more than a high school grad let 's look at that number more carefully because on the face of it it seems to belie
  the stories we all hear about college grads working as
 baristas and cashiers 
 of one hundred people who enroll in any form of post secondary education forty five do not complete it in a timely fashion for a number of reasons including financial 
 of the fifty five that do graduate two will remain unemployed  and another eighteen are
  college grads earn more than high school grads but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition and the lost wages while at college 
 now even economists admit
 going to college
 pays off for only those who complete it  but that 's only because high school wages have been cut to the bone for decades
  workers with a high school degree have been denied a fair share of what they have produced
 and had they received as they should have 
 then going to college would have been a bad investment for many college premium  i think it 's a high school discount 
 two out of three people who enroll are not going to find an adequate job and the future for them
  doesn 't look particularly promising in fact it 's downright bleak  and it is they who are going to suffer
 the most punishing forms of student debt  
 and it is they curiously and sadly who are marketed most loudly about this college premium thing  
 that 's not just cynical marketing that 's cruel so what do we do
  do what if students and parents
 treated higher education
 as a consumer product  
 everybody else seems to 
 then like any other consumer product you would demand to know what you 're paying for when
 you buy medicines  you get a list of side effects  when you buy a higher educational
  you should have a warning label that allows consumers to choose make informed choices  
 when you buy a car it tells you how many miles per gallon to expect who knows what to expect from a degree say in
 canadian studies  there is such a thing by the way 
 what if there was an app for that 
 one that linked up the cost of a major to the
  expected income let 's call it income based tuition  or ibt one of you make this 
 discover your reality there
 are three advantages three benefits to income based tuition 
 any user can figure out how much money he or she will make from a given college and major  such informed users are unlikely
  to fall victim to the huckster 's ploy to the sales pitch  
 but also to choose wisely  why would anybody pay more for college than let 's say fifteen percent of the additional income they earn there
 's a second benefit to income based tuition by tying the cost to the income 
 college administrators would be forced to manage costs better to find innovative
  ways to do so for instance all of you students here pay roughly the same tuition for every major
 that is manifestly unfair  and should change 
 an engineering student
 uses more resources and facilities and labs and faculty than a philosophy student
  but the philosophy student as a consequence is subsidizing the engineering student  who then by the way goes on and earns more money  why should two people buy 
  the same product  pay the same but one person receive half or a third of the service 
 in fact college grads  some majors 
 pay twenty five percent of their income servicing their student debt  while others pay five percent 
  if inequity would end when majors are priced more correctly 
 now of course all this data and one of you is going to do this right  all this data has to be well designed  maybe audited by public accounting firms to avoid statistical lies 
 we know about statistics right 
 but be that as it may the third and biggest benefit
 of
  free americans from the fear and the fact of financial ruin because they bought a defective product  
 perhaps in time young and old americans may rediscover  as the gentleman said earlier 
 their curiosity their love of learning begin to study what they love love what they study  follow their
  getting stimulated by their intelligence  follow paths of inquiry that they really they really want to after all it was eric and
 kevin two years ago  
 just exactly these kinds of young men 
 who prompted me and worked with me and still do in the study of indebted students in america  
 thank you for your attention
