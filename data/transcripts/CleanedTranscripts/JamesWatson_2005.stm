  chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of dna  and since you know i follow his orders i 'll do it  but
  and why francis and i found it and then i hope maybe i have at least five minutes to say what
 makes me tick now in back of me is a picture
  me when i was seventeen i was at the university of chicago in my third year and
 i was in my third year because the university of chicago let you in after two years of high school so you
 it was fun to get away from high school because
 i was very small and i was no good in sports or anything like that but i should say that
 my background my father
  raised to be an episcopalian and republican  but after one year of college he became an atheist and a democrat and
 my mother was irish catholic  and but she didn 't take
 religion too seriously and by the age of eleven i was no longer
  going to sunday mass and going on birdwatching
 walks with my father so early on i heard of charles darwin i guess you know he was
 the big hero and you know  you understand life as it now exists through evolution  
 and at the university of chicago i was a zoology major  
 and thought i would end up  you know if i was bright enough maybe getting a ph d from cornell in ornithology
 then
 in the chicago paper there was a review of a book
 called what is life by the great physicist schrodinger 
 and that of course had been a question i wanted to know you know darwin explained life after it got started but what was the essence of life 
 and schrodinger said the essence was information
 present in our chromosomes
 and it had to be present
 on a molecule i 'd never really thought of molecules before you know chromosomes but this was a molecule and
 somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form  and there was the big question of how did you copy the information 
 so
 that was the book and
 so from that moment on
  i wanted to
 be a geneticist understand the gene and through that understand life  so
 i had you know a hero at a distance it wasn 't a baseball player it was linus pauling  and so i applied to caltech and
 they turned me down
  so i went to indiana which was actually as good as caltech in genetics and besides they had a really good basketball team so
 i had a really quite happy life at indiana and it was at indiana
 i got the impression that you know the gene was likely to be dna and so when i got my ph d i should go and search for dna  so i first went to
 copenhagen because
 i thought well maybe i could become a biochemist
  discovered biochemistry was very boring  it wasn 't going anywhere toward you know saying what the gene was it was just nuclear science and
 oh that 's the book little book you can read it in about two hours  and
 but then i went to a meeting in italy  and
 there was an unexpected speaker who wasn 't on the program  and he talked about dna and this was maurice wilkins
  was trained as a physicist and after the war he wanted to do biophysics and he picked dna because
 dna had been determined at the rockefeller institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes most people believed it was proteins but
 wilkins you know thought dna was the best bet  and
 he showed this x ray photograph
  sort of crystalline 
 so dna had a structure even though it owed it to probably different molecules carrying different sets of instructions so there was something universal about the dna molecule  so i
 wanted to work with him but he didn 't want a former birdwatcher  and i ended up in cambridge england so i went to cambridge because
 it was really the best place in the world then for
  those days it was the domain of the physicists  so the best place for x ray crystallography was at the cavendish laboratory at
 cambridge  and
 there i met francis crick i went there without knowing him he was thirty five i was twenty three and within
  had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of dna not solve it like you know 
 in rigorous fashion  but build a model
 an electro model using some coordinates of you know length all that sort of stuff
 from x ray photographs but just ask what the molecule how should it fold up and the reason for doing so
  about six months before he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins  and in doing so he banished the man out on the right  sir lawrence bragg 
 who was the cavendish professor this is a photograph
 several years later when bragg had cause to smile  he certainly wasn 't smiling when i got there because he was
 somewhat humiliated by pauling getting the alpha helix and
 the cambridge people failing
 because they
 and
 certainly neither crick or i were chemists  so we tried to build a model and
 he knew 
 francis knew wilkins so wilkins said he thought it was the helix x ray diagram he thought was comparable with the helix  so we built a  three stranded model 
 the people from london came up wilkins
  possible collaborator rosalind franklin came up and sort of laughed at our model they said it was lousy and it was 
 so we were told to build no more models  we were incompetent and
 so we didn 't build any models and francis sort of continued to work on proteins and basically i did nothing
  reading is a good thing you get facts  
 and we kept telling the people in london that linus pauling 's going to move on to dna  if dna is that important linus will know it he 'll build a model and then we 're going to be scooped and 
 in fact he 'd written the people in london could he see their x ray photograph and they had the wisdom to say no so he didn 't have it 
 but there was ones in the literature  actually linus didn 't look at
  about 
 oh fifteen months after i got to cambridge a rumor began to appear from linus pauling 's son who was in cambridge that his father was now working on dna  
 and so one day peter came in and he said he was peter pauling and he gave me a copy of his father 's manuscripts  
 and
 boy i was scared
  we may be scooped i have nothing to do no qualifications for anything and so there was the paper  and he proposed
  if the peak ph that cells have is around seven those hydrogen bonds couldn 't exist we rushed over to the chemistry department and said 
 could pauling be right and alex hust said no so
 we were happy and you know we were still in the game
  we were frightened that somebody at caltech would tell linus that he was wrong and
 so bragg said build models and a month after we got the pauling manuscript
 i should say i took the manuscript to london and showed the people well i said linus was wrong and that we 're still in the game and that they should immediately start building models but
 wilkins said no rosalind franklin was leaving in about two months and after she left
 he would start building models
 so i came back with that news to cambridge and bragg said build models well of course i wanted to build models  and
 there 's a picture of rosalind she really  you know  in one sense she was a chemist but really she would have been trained
 she didn 't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry she was a crystallographer  and
 i think part of the reason she didn 't want to build models was she wasn 't
 chemist whereas pauling was a chemist  and
 so crick and i  you know started building models and i 'd learned a little chemistry but not enough well we got the answer on the 28th
 february ' fifty three and it was because of a rule which to me is a very good rule never be the brightest person in
  chemists in the room i went in and showed them a pairing i 'd done and
 jerry donohue he was a chemist he said it 's wrong you 've got the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place i just put them down like they were in the books he said they were wrong  
 so the next day you know after i thought well he might be right so i changed the locations
  then we found
 the base pairing and francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions and
 we knew we were right  so
 it was a pretty you know it all happened in about two hours 
 from nothing to thing and we knew it was big because  you know  if you just put a next to
 t and g next to c you have a
  you might as well believe it because you didn 't have any other scheme 
 but that 's not the way most scientists think
  most scientists are really
 rather dull they said we won 't think about it until we know it 's right but
 you know we thought well it 's at least ninety five percent right or ninety nine percent right  so think about it 
 the next five years there were essentially something like five references to our work in nature none  
  so we were left by ourselves and trying to do the last part of the trio how do you
 what does this genetic information do 
 it was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an rna molecule and then how do you go from rna to protein 
 for about three years we just i tried to solve the structure of rna it didn 't
 yield
  i was decidedly unhappy a girl didn 't marry me it was really you know sort of a shitty time 
 so there 's a picture of francis and i before i met the girl so i 'm still looking happy laughter
 but there is what we did when we didn 't know where to go forward we formed a club
  he designed the tie he was one of the members the question was how do you go from a four letter code to the 20 letter code of proteins  
 feynman was a member and teller and friends of gamow
 but that 's the only no we were only photographed twice and on both
  get happy until one thousand nine hundred and sixty 
 because then we found out basically  you know  that there are three forms of rna and we knew basically dna provides the information
  that 's what chris wanted me to do it was so what happened since then well  at that time
 i should go back when we
 found the structure of dna  
 i gave my first talk at cold spring harbor the physicist leo szilard he looked at me and said are you going to patent this and
 but he he knew patent law and that we couldn 't patent it because you couldn 't no use for it 
 and so dna didn 't become a useful molecule and the lawyers didn 't enter into the equation until
  boyer and cohen
 in san francisco and stanford came up with their method of recombinant dna and stanford patented it and made a lot of money  
 at least they patented something which you know could
 do useful things and
 then they learned how to read the letters for the code and  boom we 've you know 
 had a biotech industry
  were still a long ways from you know  answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood which is 
 how do you nature nurture and
 so i 'll go on 
  time but this is michael wigler a very very clever mathematician turned physicist and he developed a technique which
  will let us look at sample dna and eventually a million spots along it there 's a chip there a conventional one then there 's one made by a photolithography by a company in madison called nimblegen 
 which is
 way ahead of affymetrix  and
 we use their technique  and what you can do is sort of compare dna of normal segs versus cancer and
  you can see
 on the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions  
 so the dna is really badly mucked up whereas if you have a chance of surviving the dna isn 't so mucked up  
 so we think that this will eventually lead to what we call dna biopsies before you get treated for cancer you should really
 look at this technique and get a feeling of
  the face of the enemy it 's not a it 's only a partial look but it 's a
 i think it 's going to be very very useful so we started with breast cancer because there 's lots of money for it  no government money and
 now i have a sort of vested interest i want to do it for prostate cancer  so you know you aren 't treated if it 's not dangerous 
  but wigler besides looking at cancer cells looked at normal cells and made a really sort of surprising observation
  which is all of us
 have about ten places in our genome where we 've lost a gene or gained another one 
 so we
 're sort of all imperfect and the question is well  if we 're around here  you know  these little losses or gains might not be too bad  
 but if these
 deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene maybe
  so the first disease he looked at is autism  and
 the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it looking at an individual is about three thousand dollars and the parent of a child with asperger 's disease the high intelligence autism 
 had sent his thing to a conventional company they didn 't do it
  couldn 't do it by conventional genetics but just scanning it
 we began to find genes for autism and you can see here there are a lot of them so
 a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of dna  
 i mean big piece at the molecular level we saw one autistic kid about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes  
 we haven 't yet looked at the parents but the parents probably don 't have that loss or they wouldn 't be parents
  now so our autism study is just beginning we got three million dollars i think it will cost at least ten to twenty before
 you 'd be in a position to help parents who 've had an autistic child or think they may have an autistic child and can we
 spot the difference so this same technique should probably look at
  it 's a wonderful way to find genes  and so i 'll conclude by saying we 've looked at twenty people with schizophrenia  
 and we thought we 'd probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture but as you can see there 's seven out of twenty had a change which was
 very high and yet in the controls there were three so what 's the meaning of the controls were they crazy also and we didn 't know
  guess they 're normal  and what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure  and
 whether this is one that predisposes and then there 's only a 
  of the population that 's capable of being schizophrenic now we don 't have
  to give you a hypothesis the best guess
 is that
 if you 're left handed you 're prone to schizophrenia 
 thirty percent of schizophrenic people are left handed and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics which means sixty percent of the people are
 genetically left handed but only half of it showed i don 't have the time to say now some people who think they
 i 'm just saying that if you think oh i don 't carry a left handed gene so therefore my  you know children won 't be at risk of schizophrenia you might
