  six thousand miles of road six hundred miles of subway track four hundred miles of bike lanes
 and a half a mile of tram track if you 've ever been to roosevelt island these are the numbers that make up the
  of new york city these are the statistics of our infrastructure they 're the kind of numbers you can find released in reports by city agencies for example the department of transportation will probably tell you how many miles of road they maintain the mta will boast how many miles of subway track there are 
 most city agencies give us statistics this is from a report this year from the taxi and limousine commission where we learn that there 's about thirteen 
 taxis here in new york city  pretty interesting right  but did you ever think about where these numbers came from because for these numbers to exist
  city agency had to stop and say hmm 
 here 's a number that somebody might want want to know here 's a number that our citizens want to know 
 so they go back to their raw data  they count they add they calculate  and then they put out reports and those reports will have numbers like this 
 the problem is how do they know all of our questions we have lots of questions  in fact  in some ways there 's literally an infinite number of questions that we can ask about our city
 the agencies can never keep up so the
  paradigm isn 't exactly working and i think
 our policymakers realize that because in two thousand and twelve  mayor bloomberg signed into law what he called the most ambitious and comprehensive open data legislation in the country 
 in a lot of ways he 's right  in the last two years the city has released one thousand datasets on our open data portal  
 and it 's pretty awesome  so you go and look at data like this and instead of just counting the number of cabs we can start to ask different questions
 so i had a question  
 when 's rush hour in new york city it can be pretty bothersome when is rush hour exactly  
 and i thought to myself these cabs aren 't just numbers these are gps recorders driving around in our city streets recording each and every ride they take 
 there 's data there  and i looked at that data and i made a plot of the average speed of taxis in new york city throughout the day you can see that from about midnight to around five eighteen in the morning  speed increases and at that point
  things turn around and
 they get slower and slower and slower until about eight thirty five in the morning when they end up at around eleven and a half miles per hour the average taxi is going eleven and a half miles per hour on our city streets  
 and it turns out it stays that way
 for the entire day so i said to myself i guess there 's no rush hour in new york city there 's just a rush day
 for a couple of reasons if you 're a transportation planner 
 this might be pretty interesting to know  but if you want to get somewhere quickly you now know to set your alarm for four forty five in the morning and you 're all set new york right  but there 's a story behind this data this data wasn 
  't just available it turns out it actually came from something called a freedom of information law request  
  fill it out  and they will notify you and a guy named chris whong
 did exactly that chris went down  and they told him just bring a brand new hard drive down to our office leave it here for five hours we 'll copy the data and you take it back 
 and that 's where this data came from 
 now chris is the kind of guy who wants to make the data public and so it ended up online for all to use and that 's where this graph came from and
 the fact that it exists is amazing these gps recorders really cool
  but the fact that we have citizens walking around with hard drives picking up data from city agencies to make it public it was already kind of public you could get to it but it was public it wasn 't public  and we can do better than that as a city we don 't need our citizens walking around with hard drives 
 now 
 not every dataset is behind a foil request  here is a map i made with the most dangerous intersections in new york city based on cyclist accidents  
 so the red areas are more
  dangerous and what it shows is first the east side of manhattan especially in the lower lower area of manhattan
 has more cyclist accidents that might make sense because there are more cyclists coming off the bridges there  but there 's other hotspots worth studying there 's williamsburg there 's roosevelt avenue in queens  and this is exactly the kind of data we need for vision zero this is exactly what we 're looking for
  story behind this data as well this data didn 't just appear how many of you guys know this logo  
 yeah i see some shakes have you ever tried to copy and paste data out of a pdf and make sense of it 
 i see more shakes 
 more of you tried copying and pasting than knew the logo i like that
 so what happened is the data that you just saw was actually on a pdf  in fact hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages of pdf put out by our very own nypd 
 and in order to access it you would either have to copy and paste for hundreds and hundreds of hours  or you could be john
  krauss  john krauss was like i 'm not going to copy and paste this data i 'm going to write a program it 's called the nypd crash data
 and it goes to the nypd 's website and it would download pdfs every day it would search  if it found a pdf it would download it and then it would run some pdf scraping program and out would come the text and it would go on the internet  and then people could make maps like
  the fact that the data 's here the fact that we have access to it every accident by the way is a row in this table you can imagine how many pdfs that is the fact that we have access to that is great  
 but let 's not release it in pdf form  because then we 're having our citizens write pdf scrapers it 's not the best use of our citizens ' time and we as a city can do better than that now the good news is that the de blasio administration actually recently released this data a few months
  and so now we can actually have access to it but there 's a lot of data still entombed in pdf for example our crime data is still only available in pdf and not just our crime data our own city budget
 our city budget is only readable right now in pdf form  and it 's not just us that can 't analyze it our own legislators who vote for the budget also only get it in 
  pdf  so our legislators cannot analyze the budget that they are voting for and i think as a city we can do a little better than that as well
 's a lot of data that 's not hidden in pdfs this is an example of a map i made  and this is the dirtiest waterways in new york city  now how do i measure dirty well it 's
 kind of a little weird but i looked at the level of fecal coliform
 which is a measurement of fecal matter in each of our waterways  the larger the circle  the dirtier the water  
 so the large circles are dirty water the small circles are cleaner what you see is inland waterways
  all data that was sampled by the city over the last five years  
 and inland waterways are in general dirtier that makes sense right  
 and the bigger circles are dirty and i learned a few things from this number one never swim in anything that ends in creek or canal 
 but number two i also found the dirtiest waterway in new york city by this measure  one measure  in coney
  which is not the coney island you swim in luckily it 's on the other side  but coney island creek ninety four percent of samples taken over the last five years have had fecal levels so high
 that it would be against state law to swim in the water  
 and this is not the kind of fact that you 're going to see boasted in a city report right it 's not going to be the front page on nyc gov you 're not going to see it there  but the fact that we can get to that data is awesome 
 but once again it wasn 't super easy because this data was not on the open data portal  if you were to go to the open data portal you 'd see just a snippet of it
  year or a few months it was actually on the department of environmental protection 's website and each one of these links is an excel sheet  and each excel sheet is different  
 every heading is different you copy paste reorganize when you do you can make maps and that 's great but once again we can do better than that as a city we can normalize things  and we 're getting there because there 's this website that socrata makes called
  hundred data sets that don 't suffer from the things i just told you live and that number is growing  
 and that 's great you can download data in any format be it csv or pdf   or excel document whatever you want you can download the data that way  
 the problem is once you do you will find
 that each agency codes their addresses differently  so one is street name intersection street street borough address building building address
  so once again you 're spending time  even when we have this portal  you 're spending time normalizing our address fields  and that 's not the best use of our citizens ' time  we can do better than that as a city 
 we can standardize our addresses  and if we do  we can get more maps like this this is a map of fire hydrants in new york city  but not just any fire hydrants 
 these are the top two hundred and fifty grossing fire hydrants in terms of parking tickets 
 laughter so i learned a few things from this map and i really like this map number one just don 't park on the
  upper east side just don 't it doesn 't matter where you park you will get a hydrant ticket 
 number two i found the two highest grossing hydrants in all of new york city and they 're on the lower east side  and they were bringing in over fifty five thousand dollars a year a year in parking tickets  
 and that seemed a little strange to me when i noticed it so i did a little digging and it turns out what you had is a hydrant
 and then something called a curb extension  which is like a seven foot space to walk on
  and then a parking spot  and so these cars came along and the hydrant it 's all the way over there i 'm fine and there was actually a parking spot painted there beautifully for them  they would park there  and the nypd disagreed with this designation and would ticket them
  and it wasn 't just me who found a parking ticket  this is the google street view car driving by
 finding the same parking ticket  so i wrote about
  while the dot has not received any complaints about this
 location  we will review the roadway markings and make any appropriate alterations and
 i thought to myself  typical government response all right moved on with my life but then a few weeks later something incredible happened 
 they repainted the spot and for a second i thought i saw the future of open data because think about what happened here for five years
  for five years  this spot was being ticketed and it was confusing and then a citizen found something they told the city and within a few weeks
 the problem was fixed  it 's amazing and a lot of people see open data as being a watchdog it 's not it 's about being a partner  we can empower our citizens to be better partners for government and it 's not 
 that hard all we need are a few changes  if you 're foiling data if you 're seeing your data being foiled over and over again
  release it to the public that 's a sign that it should be made public  
 and if you 're a government agency releasing a pdf let 's pass legislation that requires you to post it with the underlying data because that data is coming from somewhere i don 't know where
 but it 's coming from somewhere and you can release it with the pdf and let 's adopt and share some open data standards let 's start with our addresses here in new york city let 's just start normalizing our addresses because new york is a leader in open data despite all this we are absolutely a
  leader in open data and if we start normalizing things and set an open data standard  others will follow the state will follow and maybe the federal government 
 other countries could follow  and we 're not that far off from a time where you could write one program and map information from one hundred countries it 's not science fiction we 're actually quite close 
 and by the way who are we empowering with this  because it 's not just john krauss and it 's not just chris whong there are hundreds of meetups going
 going on in new york city right now  active meetups there are thousands of people attending these meetups these people are going after work and on weekends  and they 're attending these meetups to look at open data and 
  make our city a better place  groups like  betanyc who just last week released something called 
 that allows you to subscribe to three hundred and eleven complaints around your own home 
  or around your office you put in your address you get local complaints 
 and it 's not just the tech community that are after these things it 's urban planners like the students i teach at pratt  it 's policy advocates  it 's everyone it 's citizens from a diverse set 
  of backgrounds  and with some small incremental changes  we can unlock the passion and the ability of our citizens to harness open data and make our city even better whether it 's one dataset
