  a poem written by a very famous english poet at the end of the 19th century it was said to echo in churchill 's brain in the
  hark i hear a distant drummer drumming like a sound in dreams  far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by dear to friend
 and food to powder soldiers marching  soon to die 
 those who are interested in poetry the poem is a shropshire lad written by a e housman 
 but what housman understood and you hear it in the symphonies of nielsen too
  that the long  hot  silvan summers of stability of the 19th century were coming to a close  
 and that we were about to move into one of those terrifying periods of history
 when power changes  and these are always periods ladies and gentlemen accompanied by turbulence  and all too often
  and my message for you is that i believe we are condemned if you like 
 to live at just one of those moments in history when the gimbals upon which the established order of power is beginning to change and the new look of the world the new powers that exist in the world  
 are beginning to take form form  and these are and we see it very clearly today nearly always highly turbulent times highly difficult
  and all too often very bloody times by the way it happens about once every century  you might argue that the last time it happened and that 's what housman felt coming and what churchill felt too was that when power passed from the old
 nations the old powers of europe  across the atlantic to the new emerging power of the united states of america the beginning of the american century 
 and of course into the vacuum where the too old european powers used to be were played the two bloody catastrophes of the last
  century
 the one in the first part and the one in the second part the two great world wars mao zedong used to refer to them as the european civil wars and it 's probably a more accurate way of describing them  
 well ladies and gentlemen  we live at one of those times but for us i want to talk about three factors today 
 and the first of these the first two of these is about a shift in power 
 and the second is about some new dimension
  which i want to refer to which has never quite happened in the way it 's happening now but let 's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world  
 and what is happening today is in one sense frightening because it 's never happened before  
 we have seen lateral shifts of power the power of greece passed to rome
 and the power shifts that occurred during the european civilizations
 but we are seeing something
 for power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation it 's also moving vertically  what 's happening today is that the power that was encased held to accountability held to the rule of law  
 within the institution of the nation state
 has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage the globalization of power we talk about the globalization of markets but actually it 's the globalization of real
  power 
 and where at the nation state level that power is held to accountability subject to the rule of law on the international stage it is not 
 the international stage and the global stage where power now resides the power of the internet the power of the satellite broadcasters  the power of the money changers this
  times the amount of money necessary for the trade it 's supposed to be there to finance
 the money changers if you like the
 financial speculators that have brought us all to our knees quite recently  the power of the multinational corporations now developing
 budgets often 
  countries these live in a global space which is largely unregulated not subject to the rule of law
  which people may act free of constraint now that suits the powerful
 up to a moment it 's always suitable for those who have the most power to operate in spaces without constraint but the lesson of history is
 that sooner or later  unregulated space space not subject to the rule of law
 becomes populated not just by the things you wanted international trade the internet
  the things you don 't want
 international criminality international terrorism  the revelation of nine eleven
 is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth 
 nevertheless those who inhabit that space can attack you even in your most iconic of cities one bright september morning 
  it 's said that something like sixty percent of the four million dollars that was taken to fund nine eleven actually passed through the institutions of the twin towers which nine eleven destroyed  
 you see our enemies also use this space the space of mass travel the internet satellite broadcasters
 to be able to get around
 their poison which is about destroying our systems and our ways sooner or later  sooner or later  
 the rule of history is that where power goes
 governance
 must follow  and if it is therefore the case as i believe it is that one of the phenomenon of our time
 is the globalization of power then it follows that one of the challenges of our time
 is to bring governance to the global space and
 i believe that the decades ahead of us now will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent
 the more or less we are able to achieve that aim to bring
  governance to the global space now notice i 'm not talking about government i 'm not talking about setting up some global democratic institution 
 my own view by the way ladies and gentlemen is that this is unlikely to be done by spawning more u n institutions if we didn 't have the u n we 'd have to invent it the world needs an international forum  it needs a means by which you can legitimize international action  
 but when it comes to governance of the global space
  my guess is this won 't happen through the creation of more u n institutions it will actually happen by the powerful coming together and making treaty based systems treaty based agreements 
 to govern that global space and if you look you can see them happening already beginning to emerge the world trade organization treaty based organization
  and yet powerful enough to hold even the most powerful the united states to account if necessary  kyoto the beginnings of struggling to create a treaty based organization  
 the g20 we know now that we have to put together an institution
 which is capable of bringing governance to that financial space for financial speculation  
 and that 's what the g20 is a treaty based institution now there 's a problem there and we 'll come back to it in a minute which is that if you bring the most powerful together to make the rules
  in treaty based institutions to fill that governance space  
 then what happens to the weak who are left out  and that 's a big problem and we 'll return to it in just a second so there 's my first message that
 if you are to pass through these turbulent times more or less turbulently  then our
 success in doing that will in large measure depend on our capacity to bring sensible governance to the global space and watch that beginning to happen 
 my second point is and i know i don 't have to talk to an audience like this
 about such a thing but
 power is not just shifting vertically  it 's also shifting horizontally  you might argue that the story the history of civilizations has been civilizations gathered around seas with
 the first ones around the mediterranean
 the more recent ones in the ascendents of western power around the atlantic  
 well it seems to me that we 're now seeing a fundamental shift of power broadly speaking away from nations gathered around the atlantic [ seaboard ] to the nations gathered around the pacific rim now that begins with economic power but that 's the way it always begins  
 you already begin to see the development of foreign policies the augmentation of military budgets occurring in the other growing
  powers in the world  i think actually this is not so much a
 shift from the west to the east something different is happening 
 my guess is for what it 's worth is
 that the united states will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next ten years  fifteen  
 but the context in which she holds her power has
  now radically altered it has radically changed we are coming out of fifty years most unusual years of history
 in which we have had a totally mono polar world in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to washington
 a world bestrode by a single colossus  
 but that 's not a usual case in history in fact what 's now emerging is the much more normal case of history you 're beginning to see the emergence of a
  up until now the united states has been the dominant feature of our world they will remain the most powerful nation  but they will be the most powerful nation in an increasingly multi polar world and you begin to see
 the alternative centers of power building up in china of course  though my own guess is that china 's ascent to greatness is not smooth it
 's going to be quite grumpy as china begins to democratize her society after liberalizing her
  economy but that 's a subject of a different discussion  
 you see india you see brazil  you see increasingly that the world now looks actually for us europeans much more like
 europe in the  19th century  europe in the  19th century a great british foreign secretary lord canning used to describe it as the european concert of
  britain always played to the balance  if paris got together with berlin britain got together with vienna and rome to provide a counterbalance now notice 
 in a period which is dominated by a mono polar world you have fixed alliances nato  
 the warsaw pact a fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances 
 but a multiple polarity of power
 means shifting and changing alliances and that 's the world we 're coming into in which we will increasingly
  see that our alliances are not fixed canning the great british foreign secretary once said britain has a common interest but no common allies 
 and we will see increasingly that even we in the west will reach out have to reach out  
 beyond the cozy circle of the atlantic powers to make alliances with others if we want to get things done in the world note 
 that when we went into libya  it was not good enough for the
  west to do it alone  we had to bring others in we had to bring in this case the arab league in my guess is iraq and afghanistan are the last times
 when the west has tried to do it themselves  and we haven 't succeeded my guess is
 that we 're reaching the beginning of the end
 of four hundred years i say four hundred years because it 's the end of the ottoman empire of the hegemony of western power western institutions and western values
  values you
 know up until now if the west got its act together it could propose and dispose in every corner of the world  
 but that 's no longer true  take the last financial crisis
 after the second world war the west got together the bretton woods institution world bank international monetary fund
 fund the problem solved  now we have to call in others  now we have to create the
 g20 now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle of our western friends let me make a prediction for you which is probably even more startling  
 i suspect we are now reaching the end of four hundred years
 when western power was enough people say to me the chinese of course they 'll never get themselves involved
  why not how many chinese troops are serving under the blue beret serving under the blue flag serving under the u n command in the world today 
 how many americans  eleven 
 what is the largest naval contingent tackling the issue of somali pirates  
 the chinese naval contingent of course they are they are a mercantilist nation they want to keep the sea lanes open 
 increasingly we are going to have to do business with
  people with whom we do not share values  
 but with whom for the moment we share common interests it 's a whole new different way of looking at the world that is now emerging 
 and here 's the third factor which is totally different 
 today in our modern world  because of the internet because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here everything is connected
 we are now interdependent we are now interlocked  
 as nations as individuals in a way which has never been the case before never been the case before 
 the interrelationship of nations well it 's always existed diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations  but now we are
  intimately locked together 
 you get swine flu in mexico  
 it 's a problem for charles de gaulle airport twenty four hours later  
 lehman brothers goes down the whole lot collapses there are fires in the steppes of russia food riots in africa 
 we are all now deeply  deeply  deeply interconnected  
 and what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone
  not connected with others not working with others 
 is no longer a viable proposition because the actions of a nation state are neither confined to itself  
 nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself to control its own territory because the effects outside the nation state
 are now beginning to affect what happens inside them  i was a young soldier
 in in the last of the small empire wars of britain at that time the defense
  of my country was about one thing and one thing only  how strong was our army how strong was our air force how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies 
 that was when the enemy was outside the walls now the enemy is inside the walls  now if i want to talk about the defense of my country i have to speak to the minister of health
 because pandemic disease is a threat to my
  have to speak to the minister of agriculture because food security is a threat to my security i have to speak to the minister of industry
 because the fragility of our hi tech infrastructure is now a point of attack for our enemies
 as we see from cyber warfare i have to speak to the minister of home affairs
 because who has entered my country who lives in that terraced house in that inner city
 has a direct effect on what happens in my country as we in london saw in the seven seven bombings
  longer the case that the security of a country
 is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense  it 's its capacity to lock together its institutions and this tells you something very important 
 it tells you that in fact our governments vertically constructed constructed on the economic model of the industrial revolution vertical hierarchy
  command structures
 have got the wrong structures completely you in business know that the paradigm structure of our time ladies and gentlemen is the network  
 it 's your capacity to network that matters  both within your governments and externally  
 so here is ashdown 's third law by the way don 't ask me about ashdown 's first law and second law because i haven 't invented those yet it always sounds better if there 's a third law doesn 't it 
 ashdown 's third law is that in the modern age where everything is connected to
  everything the most important thing about what you can do
 is what you can do with others the most important bit about your structure whether you 're a government whether you 're an army regiment whether you 're a business
 is your docking points your interconnectors your capacity to network with others  you understand that in industry governments don 't  
  but now one final thing if it is the case ladies and gentlemen and it is
 that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before then it 's also the case that we share a destiny with each other suddenly
 and for the very first time  collective defense the thing that has dominated us
 as the concept of securing our nations 
 is no longer enough it used to be the case that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe i was safe if my country was more powerful than their country i was safe
 my alliance like nato was more powerful than their alliance  i was safe  it is no longer the case  the advent of
 the interconnectedness and of the weapons of mass destruction means that increasingly  i share a destiny with my enemy 
 when i was a diplomat negotiating the disarmament treaties with the soviet union in geneva in the
  we succeeded because we understood we shared a destiny with them  collective security is not enough 
 peace has come to northern ireland because both sides realized that the zero sum game couldn 't work they shared a destiny with their enemies 
 one of the great barriers to peace in the middle east is that both sides both israel and i think the palestinians do not understand that they share a collective
  and so suddenly ladies and gentlemen what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages
 becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy  i started with a poem i 'll end with one 
 the great poem of john donne 's 
 send not for whom the bell tolls 
 the poem is called no man is an island and it
  every man 's death affected me for i am involved in mankind  send not to ask
 for whom the bell tolls  it tolls for thee 
 for john donne a recommendation of morality for us i think part of the equation for our survival thank you very much
