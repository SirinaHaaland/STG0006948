  what i want to tell you about today is
 how i see robots invading our lives at multiple levels 
 over multiple timescales  and when i look out in the future i can 't imagine a world five hundred years from now where we don 't have robots everywhere assuming
 despite all the dire predictions from many people about
 our future assuming we 're still around i can 't imagine the world not being populated with robots and then the question is well if they 're going to be here in five hundred years 
 are they going to be everywhere sooner than that are they going to be around in fifty years yeah i think that 's pretty likely there 's going to be lots of robots everywhere and in fact i think that 's going
 to be a lot sooner than that i think we 're sort of on the cusp of
  in personal computer years where the first few robots are starting to appear  computers sort of came around
 through games and toys  and you know 
 the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play pong a little microprocessor embedded and then
 other games that came after that and
  to see that same sort of thing with robots lego mindstorms furbies
 who here did anyone here have a furby yeah there
 million of them sold worldwide 
 they are pretty common and they 're a little tiny robot a simple robot with some sensors a little bit of processing actuation on the right there is another robot doll who you could get a couple of years ago  
 and
 just as in the early days when there was a lot of
 sort of amateur
  on the left there is a platform from evolution robotics where you put a pc on and you
 program this thing with a gui to wander around your house and do various stuff  
 and then there 's a higher price point sort of robot toys the sony aibo  and on the right there is one that the nec developed the papero  
 which i don 't think they 're going to release  but
 nevertheless those sorts of things are out there  and we 've seen over the last two
  or three years lawn mowing robots husqvarna on the bottom friendly robotics
 on top there
 an israeli company  and then in the last twelve months or so we 've started to see a bunch of
 home cleaning robots appear the top left one is a very nice home cleaning robot from a company called dyson  in the u k except it was so
  five hundred dollars they didn 't release it but at the bottom left you see electrolux which is on sale 
 another one from karcher at the bottom right is one that i built in my lab about ten years ago and we finally turned that into
 a product and let me just show you that we 're going to give this away i think chris said after the talk this is a
 robot that you can go out and buy and that will clean up your floor
  starts off sort of just going around in ever increasing circles
 if it hits something you people see that now it 's doing wall following it 's following around my feet to
 to clean up around me let 's see let 's
 oh  who stole my rice krispies they stole my rice krispies
  i put a bunch of rice krispies there  i put some pennies let 's just shoot it at that see if it cleans up
  the trick was
 building a better cleaning mechanism actually the intelligence on board was fairly simple
 and that 's true with a lot of robots we 've all i think become sort of computational chauvinists and think that computation is everything but the mechanics still matter here
 's another robot
  the packbot that we 've been building for a bunch of years it 's a military surveillance robot to go in ahead of
 troops looking
 at caves for instance  but we had to make it fairly robust  much more robust than the robots we build in our labs
  on board that robot is a pc running linux  it can withstand a 400g shock
  the robot has local intelligence it
 can
 flip itself over can get itself into communication range can go upstairs by itself et cetera
  it 's doing local navigation there a soldier gives it a command to
 go upstairs and it does 
 that was not a controlled descent 
 now it 's going to head off 
  we had the robots down at the world trade center late that evening  couldn 't do a lot in the main rubble pile things were just too
 there was nothing left to do but we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated 
 and searched for possible survivors in the buildings that were too dangerous to go into
  companions are helping to reduce the combat risks  nick robertson has that story
  in afghanistan every day  and that 's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening
  sea change happening in how
 where technology 's going thanks and
 over the next couple of months we 're going to be
 sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground  
 very hostile environments one hundred and fifty c ten thousand psi
  autonomous robots going down doing this sort of work but robots like this they 're a little hard to program 
 how in the future are we going to program our robots and make them easier to use  and i want to actually use a robot here a robot named chris
 stand up  yeah  okay  come over here  now notice he
 thinks robots have to be a bit
  i 'm going to show this robot a task it 's a very complex task
  now notice he nodded there he was giving me some indication he was understanding the flow of communication  and if i 'd said something completely bizarre he would have looked askance at me and regulated the conversation 
 so now i brought this up
  looked at his eyes  and i saw his eyes looked at this bottle top 
 and i 'm doing this task here and he 's checking up his eyes are going back and forth up to me to see what i 'm looking at so we 've got shared attention 
 and so i do this task  and he looks and he looks to me to see what 's happening next and now i 'll give him
 the bottle and we 'll see if he can do the task can you do that okay he
 's pretty good 
  i didn 't show you how to do that now see if you can put it back together 
 laughter and he thinks a robot has to be really slow  good robot that 's good so we saw a bunch of things there  we saw
 when we 're interacting we 're trying to show someone how to do something we direct their visual attention the other thing communicates
 their internal state to us whether he 's understanding or not regulates a social interaction there was shared attention
  looking at the same sort of thing and recognizing socially
 communicated reinforcement at the end  and we 've been trying to put that into our lab robots because we think this is how you 're going to want to interact with robots in the future  
 i just want to show you one technical diagram here the most important thing
 for building a robot that you can interact with socially is its visual attention system because what it pays attention to is what it 's seeing and interacting with and what
  're understanding what it 's doing so in the videos i 'm about to show you you 're going to see a visual attention system on a robot which has
 it looks for skin tone in hsv space so it works across all human
 colorings it looks for highly saturated colors from toys and it looks for things that move around and it weights those together into an attention window and it looks for the
  place the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening and that is what its eyes then segue
 to 
 and it looks right at that at the same time some top down sort of stuff might decide that it 's lonely and look for skin tone or might decide that it 's bored and look for a toy to play with and so these weights change and over here
  on the right this is what we call the steven spielberg memorial module  did people see the movie ai rb yeah it was really bad but
 remember especially when haley joel osment the little robot  looked at the blue fairy for two thousand years without taking
 his eyes off it well this gets rid of that because
 this is a habituation gaussian that gets negative and more and more intense as it looks at one thing and it gets
  so it will then look away at something else so  once you 've got that and here 's a robot here
 's kismet looking around for a toy  
 you can tell what it 's looking at you can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera  
 and you can tell when it 's actually seeing the toy and it 's got a little bit of an emotional response here 
 laughter but it 's still going to pay attention if something more significant comes into its field of view such as cynthia breazeal
 the builder of this robot from the right it sees her pays attention to her  
 kismet has an underlying three dimensional emotional space a vector space of where it is
 emotionally and at different places in that space  it expresses
  so it 's expressing its emotion through its face and the prosody in its voice  
 and when i was dealing with my robot over here  
 chris the robot was measuring the prosody in my voice  and so we have the robot measure prosody for four
  basic messages that mothers give their children
 here we 've got naive subjects praising the robot
  it smiles she imitates the smile this happens a lot these are naive subjects here we asked them to get the robot 's attention
 and indicate when they have the robot 's attention
  here they 're asked to prohibit the robot and this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner
  we put that together then we put in turn taking when we talk to someone we talk then we sort of raise our eyebrows  
 move our eyes give the other person the idea it 's their turn to talk  and then they talk and then we pass the baton back and forth
 between each between each other so we put this
  in the robot we got a bunch of naive subjects in we didn 't tell them anything about the robot  sat them down in front of the robot and said talk to the robot  now what they didn 't know was the robot wasn 't understanding a word they said  
 and that the robot wasn 't speaking english it was just saying random english phonemes and i want you to watch carefully at the beginning of this where this person ritchie who happened to talk to the robot
  i want to show you my watch and he brings
 the watch center into the robot 's field of vision points to it gives it a motion cue and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully we don 't know whether he understood or not that the robot
 notice the
  and they successfully have that sort of communication  and here 's another aspect of the sorts of things that chris and i were doing
 christie looks over at this toy  the robot estimates her gaze direction and looks at the same thing that she 's looking at 
 so we 're going to see more and more of this sort of robot
 over the next few years in in labs  but then the big questions two big questions that people ask me are 
 if we make these robots more and more human like will we accept them will we will they need rights
 eventually
  and the other question people ask me is will they want to take over 
 and on the first you know this has been a very hollywood theme with lots of movies you probably recognize these characters here
 where in each of these cases the robots want more respect  well do you ever need to give robots respect they
 're just machines after all  but i think you know we have to accept that we are just machines after all
  's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us you don 't see a description of
 how you know  molecule a you know comes up and docks with this other molecule  and it 's moving forward you
 know propelled by various charges  and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect it 's all mechanistic we are
  if we are machines then in principle at least  we should be able to build machines out of other stuff  which are just as as
 alive as we are  but i think for us to admit that we have to give up on our special ness in a certain way and we 've had the
 retreat from special ness under the barrage of science and technology many times over the last few hundred years at least  five hundred years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe
 when the earth
  started to go around the sun one
 hundred and fifty years ago with darwin we had to give up the idea we were different from animals  and to imagine you know it 's always hard for us  recently we 've been battered with the idea 
 that maybe we didn 't even have our own creation event here on earth which people didn 't like much and then the human genome said maybe we only have thirty five thousand genes and that was really
  so you know having the idea that robots could really have emotions or that robots could be living creatures i think is going to be hard for us to accept  but we 're going to come to accept it over the next
 fifty years or so
