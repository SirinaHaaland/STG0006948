  there are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography
 women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives
 and women in whom it doesn 't work well at all do you know which group you 're in if you don 't
 't you 're not alone  because the breast has become a very political organ 
 the truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press politicians  radiologists and medical imaging companies 
 i will do my best this morning to tell you what i
  but first my disclosures i am not a breast cancer survivor 
 i 'm not a radiologist 
 i don 't have any patents and i 've never received any money from a medical imaging company  
 and i am not seeking your vote 
 what i am is a doctor of internal medicine
 who became passionately interested in this topic about ten years ago when a patient asked me a question
  she came to see me after discovering a breast lump 
 her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s 
 she and i were both very pregnant at that time and my heart just ached for her imagining how afraid she must be 
 fortunately her lump proved to be benign  but she asked me a question how confident was i that i would find a tumor
  early on her mammogram if she developed one 
 so i studied her mammogram  and i reviewed the radiology literature 
 and i was shocked to discover that in her case  our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin 
 you may recall a year ago
 when a firestorm erupted after the united states preventive services task force
 reviewed
  the world 's mammography screening literature
 and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40s 
 now everybody rushed to criticize the task force even though most of them weren 't in anyway familiar with the mammography studies  
 it took the senate just seventeen days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage
  radiologists were outraged by the guidelines 
 the pre eminent mammographer in the united states issued the following quote to the washington post  
 the radiologists were in turn  criticized for protecting their own financial 
 but in my view  the radiologists are
  there 's a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms  and that 's because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret  
 and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause  
 but that very fact is telling  
 where there is this much legal smoke there is likely to be some fire the factor most
  responsible for that fire is breast density 
 breast density refers to the relative amount of fat pictured here in yellow versus connective and epithelial tissues pictured in
 pink  and that proportion is primarily genetically determined
 two thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue which is why mammography doesn 't work as well in them 
 and although breast
  density generally declines with age up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause  
 so how do you know if your breasts are dense well you need to read the details of your mammography report 
 radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram if the
  breast is less than twenty five percent dense that 's called 
 the next category is scattered fibroglandular densities  followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense 
 and breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense the problem with breast density is that it 's truly the wolf in sheep 's
  both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram and the x ray often can 't distinguish between the two 
 so it 's easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast  
 but imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast 
 that 's why mammograms find over eighty percent of tumors in fatty breasts  but as few as forty percent in extremely dense breasts  
 now it 's bad enough that breast density makes it
  hard to find a cancer  
 but it turns out that it 's also a powerful predictor of your risk for breast cancer  
 it 's a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer 
 at the time my patient posed this question to me 
 breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature and very few women having mammograms or the physicians ordering them knew about this
  but what else could i offer her
 mammograms have been around since the one thousand nine hundred and sixty 's  and it 's changed very little there have been surprisingly few innovations 
 until digital mammography was approved in two thousand 
 digital mammography is still an x ray of the breast  but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally just like we can with a digital camera
 the u s has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment 
 and what have we gained from that investment 
 in a study funded by over twenty five million taxpayer dollars 
 digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography and
  it was worse in older women  but it was better in one group and that was women under fifty who were 
 and had dense breasts  and in those women digital mammography found twice as many cancers  but it still only found sixty percent  
 so digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment  
 but it 's been a very small step forward
  for womankind 
 what about ultrasound ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies so it 's not widely used 
 and mri is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors  but it 's also very expensive
  if we think about disruptive
  we see an almost ubiquitous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive  think about ipods compared to stereos  
 but it 's the exact opposite in health care 
 the machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive 
 screening the average young woman with an mri is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a hummer
  it 's just way too much equipment one mri scan costs ten times what a digital mammogram costs 
 and sooner or later we 're going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can 't always come at a much higher price  
 malcolm gladwell wrote an article in the new yorker on innovation  
 and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual 's genius  
 rather big ideas can be orchestrated
 if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don 't ordinarily talk about 
 it 's like the essence of ted 
 he quotes one innovator who says the only time a physician and a physicist get together
 is when the physicist gets sick
  of problems that they don 't realize have solutions and physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they don 't realize are problems 
 now 
 take a look at this cartoon that accompanied gladwell 's article and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers 
 laughter so if you will allow me a little creative license  i will tell
  you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient 's problem with a physicist 's solution  
 shortly after her visit 
 i was introduced to a nuclear physicist at mayo named michael o 'conner who was a specialist in cardiac imaging something i had nothing to do with 
 and he happened to tell me about a conference he 'd just returned from in israel  where they were talking about a
  type of gamma detector now
 gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart  and it had even been tried to image the breast  
 but the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge bulky tubes  and they were filled with these scintillating crystals and you just couldn 't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors  
 but the potential advantage was that gamma rays
 unlike x rays are not influenced by breast density  
 but this technology could not find tumors when they 're small and finding a small tumor is critical for survival 
 if you can find a tumor when it 's less than a centimeter survival exceeds ninety percent but drops off rapidly as tumor size
  but michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he 'd seen  and this is it 
 it 's made not of a bulky tube but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector  
 and i started talking to him about this problem with breast density  and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors  
 so after putting
  together a grid of these cubes with tape
 of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out  
 and we attached the new detector  and we decided to call this machine molecular breast imaging or
  this is an image from our first patient and you can see using the old gamma technology that it just looked like noise  
 but using our new detector we could begin to see the outline of a tumor  
 so here we were 
 a nuclear physicist an internist soon joined by carrie hruska a biomedical engineer  and two radiologists 
 and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape
  to say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement 
 but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work
 that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system this is our current detector  and you can see that it looks a lot
  the duct tape is gone  and we added a second detector on top of the breast which has further improved our tumor detection  so how does this work 
 the patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that 's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells but not by normal cells  
 and this is the key difference from mammography 
 mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue  and we 've seen that those differences can be obscured
  in a dense breast 
 but mbi exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors and therefore it 's impervious to breast density 
 after the injection the patient 's breast is placed between the detectors  and if you 've ever had a mammogram if you 're old enough to have had a mammogram you know what comes
  you may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study that 's regulated by federal law  
 and the law requires that the equivalent of a  40 pound car battery come down on your breast during this study  
 but with mbi  we use just light
  then transmits the image to the computer  
 so here 's an example you can see on the right a mammogram showing a faint tumor the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue  but the mbi image shows that tumor much more 
  clearly as well as a second tumor which profoundly influence that patient 's surgical
  in this example although the mammogram found one tumor we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors one is small as three millimeters 
 our big break came in two thousand and four 
 after we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors we used these images to submit a grant to the susan g komen foundation  
 and we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators
 and funded us to study
 one thousand women with dense breasts  comparing a screening mammogram to an mbi of the tumors that we found mammography found only
  percent of those tumors mbi found eighty three percent 
 here 's an example from that screening study  the digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue but the mbi shows an area of intense uptake
  which correlated with a two centimeter tumor in this case a one centimeter tumor  
 and in this case a 45 year old medical secretary at mayo who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young 
 wanted to enroll in our study  
 and her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue  but her mbi showed an area of worrisome uptake  which we can also see
  on a color image  
 and this corresponded to a tumor the size of a golf ball  but fortunately it was removed before it had spread to her lymph nodes  
 so now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast we had to solve one very important problem 
 we had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose  and we have spent the last three years
 making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this 
 and i 'm very happy to report that we 're now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram  
 and at this low dose we 're continuing this screening study  and this image from three weeks ago
  woman shows a normal digital mammogram but an mbi image showing an uptake
 that proved to be a large cancer so this is not just young women that it 's benefiting it 's also older women with dense tissue  
 and we 're now routinely using one fifth the radiation dose
 that 's used in any other type of gamma technology mbi generates four images per breast
 mri generates over a thousand 
 it takes a radiologist years of specialty training
  to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding but i suspect even the 
  the room can find the tumor on the mbi image  but this is why mbi is so potentially disruptive
 it 's as accurate as mri it 's far less complex to interpret  and it 's a fraction of the cost but you can understand why there
  may be forces in the breast imaging world who prefer the status quo 
 after achieving what we felt were remarkable results our manuscript was rejected by four journals 
 after the fourth rejection we requested reconsideration of the manuscript because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a
  technology our manuscript was then accepted
 and will be published later this month in the journal radiology 
 we still need to complete the screening study using
  and then our findings will need to be replicated at other institutions  and this could take five or more years 
 if this technology is widely adopted i will not benefit financially in any way  
 and that is very important to me because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth  
 but
 i recognize 
 i recognize that the adoption of this technology will
  depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science
 the mbi unit has now been fda approved  but it 's not yet widely available 
 so until something is available for women with dense breasts  
 there are things that you should know to protect yourself first know your density ninety percent of women don 't and
  percent of women don 't know that it increases your breast cancer risk 
 the state of connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram 
 i was at a conference of sixty thousand people in breast imaging last week in chicago
  and i was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what
  their breast density is of course we should and if you don 't know please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report 
 second if 
 try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle when breast density is relatively lower 
 third if you notice a persistent change in your breast insist on additional imaging 
  fourth and most important the mammography debate will rage on but i do believe that all women forty and older should have an annual mammogram 
 mammography isn 't perfect  but it 's the only test that 's been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer  
 but this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography 's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation
 some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later and most women thankfully survive  so it takes ten or more years for any 
  screening method to to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer  
  mammography and the limitations  we need to individualize screening based on density 
 for women without dense breasts mammography is the best choice  
 but for women with dense breasts we shouldn 't abandon screening altogether  we need to offer them something better  
 the babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question
 are now both in middle school  and the answer has been so slow to come 
 she 's given me her blessing to share this story with you 
 after undergoing biopsies that further increased her risk for cancer
 and losing her sister to cancer she made the difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy
 we can and must do better 
 not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters  but in time for you 
 thank you
