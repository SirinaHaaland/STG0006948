  is a man that most of you have probably never heard about even though he may have been responsible for 
 somewhat mediocre minutes of your life on april nineteen two
  he may have also been responsible for twenty two very entertaining minutes but not very many of you 
 and all of that goes back to a decision that roy had to make about three years ago so you see roy price is a senior executive with amazon studios that 's the tv production 
  company of amazon he 's forty seven years old slim spiky hair describes himself on twitter as movies tv  
  roy price has a very responsible job because it 's his responsibility to pick the shows the original content that amazon is going to make  and of course that 's a highly competitive space i mean there are so many tv shows already out there 
 that roy can 't just choose any show he has to find shows that are really really great  so in other words  he has to find shows that are on the very right end of this curve here so this curve here is the rating
  distribution of about two thousand five hundred tv shows on the website imdb and the rating goes from one to ten  and the height here shows you how many shows 
  get that rating so if your show gets a rating of nine points or higher that 's a winner then you have a top two percent show that 's shows like breaking bad
  your brain is basically like where can i get more of these episodes that kind of show  
 on the left side just for clarity here on that end you have a show called toddlers and tiaras 
 about what 's going on on that end of the curve now  roy price is not worried about
 getting on the left end of the curve because i think you would have to have some serious brainpower
 to undercut toddlers and tiaras so
 what he 's worried about is this this middle bulge here the bulge of average tv you know those shows that aren 't really good or really bad they don 't really get you excited so he needs to make sure that he 's really on the right end of this 
 so the pressure is on and of course
  it 's also the first time that amazon is even doing something like this so roy price does not want to take any chances he wants to engineer success he needs a guaranteed success  and so what he does is he holds a competition  
 so he takes a bunch of ideas for tv shows and from those ideas through an evaluation they select eight candidates for tv shows 
 and then he just makes the first episode of each one of these shows and puts them online for free for everyone to watch  and so
  when amazon is giving out free stuff you 're going to take it right so
 millions of viewers are watching those episodes  
 what they don 't realize is that while they 're watching their shows actually  they are being watched they are being watched by roy price and his team who record everything  
 they record when somebody presses play when somebody presses pause what parts they skip what parts they watch again  so they collect millions
  of data points  because they want to have those data points to then decide which show they should make and sure enough so they collect all the data they do all the data crunching  and an answer emerges 
  and the answer is amazon should do a sitcom about four republican us senators 
  seems like not too many of you here remember that show actually because it didn 't turn out that great it 's actually just an average show actually literally in fact because
 the average of this curve here is at seven point four and alpha house lands at seven point five so a slightly above average show but certainly not what roy price and his team were aiming for 
  about the same time  at another company 
 another executive did manage to land a top show using data analysis and his name is ted  ted sarandos who is the chief content officer of netflix and just like roy he 's on a constant mission to find that great tv show  
 and he uses data as well to do that except he does it a little bit differently so instead of holding a competition what he did and his team of course was they looked at all the data they already had about netflix viewers you know the ratings
  give their shows the viewing histories what shows people like and so on 
 and then they use that data to discover all of these little bits and pieces about the audience what kinds of shows they like what kind of producers what kind of actors and once they had all of these pieces 
  together they took a leap of faith  and they decided to license not a sitcom about four senators but a drama series about a single senator
  you guys know the show 
 laughter yes house of cards and netflix of course nailed it with that show at least for the first two seasons 
 house of cards gets a nine point one rating on this curve so it 's exactly where they wanted it to be 
 now the question of course is what happened here so you have two very competitive
 of these millions of data points  
 and then it works beautifully for one of them and it doesn 't work for the other one so why  
 because logic kind of tells you that this should be working all the time i mean if you 're collecting millions of data points on a decision you 're going to make then you should be able to make a pretty good decision you have two hundred years of statistics to rely
  amplifying it with very powerful computers the least you could expect is good tv right 
 and if data analysis does not work that way 
 then it actually gets a little scary  because we live in a time where we 're turning to data more and more to make very serious decisions that go far beyond tv 
 does anyone here know the company
  systems is a software company  and i hope that nobody here in this room ever comes into contact with that software  
 because if you do it means you 're in prison 
 if someone here in the us is in prison  and they apply for parole then it 's very likely that data analysis software from that company
 will be used in determining whether to grant that parole  so it 's the same principle as amazon
  and netflix but now instead of deciding whether a tv show is going to be good or bad  you 're deciding whether a person is going to be good or bad  and
 mediocre tv twenty two minutes that can be pretty
 bad but more years in prison i guess even worse  
 and unfortunately there is actually some evidence that this data analysis despite having lots of data does not always produce optimum results
  and that 's not because a company like multi health systems doesn 't know what to do with data even the most data savvy companies get it wrong  yes  even google gets it wrong sometimes 
 in two thousand and nine google announced that they were able with data analysis to predict outbreaks of influenza the nasty kind of flu  by doing data analysis on their on their google searches  
 and it worked beautifully and
 big splash in the news
 including the pinnacle of scientific success a publication in the journal nature 
 it worked beautifully for year after year after year until one year it failed  
 and nobody could even tell exactly why it just didn 't work that year and of course that again made big news including now
 a retraction of a
  amazon and google they sometimes get it wrong  and despite all those failures data is moving rapidly into 
 into the workplace law enforcement medicine  so we should better make sure that data is helping  now
  personally i 've seen a lot of this struggle with data myself because i work in computational genetics which is also a field where lots of very smart people are using unimaginable amounts of data to make pretty serious decisions like deciding on a cancer therapy or developing a drug  
 and over the years i 've noticed a sort of pattern or kind of rule if you will about the difference between successful  decision making with data and unsuccessful decision making and i find this a pattern worth sharing  and it goes something like this
  so whenever you 're solving a complex problem you 're doing essentially two things the first one is you take that problem apart into its bits and pieces so that you can deeply analyze those bits and pieces and 
  then of course you do the second part you put all of these bits and pieces back together again to come to your conclusion  and
  taking apart and putting back together again and now the crucial thing is that
 data and data analysis is only good for the first part 
 data and data analysis no matter how powerful can only help you taking a problem apart and understanding its pieces 
 it 's not suited to put those pieces back together again and then to come to a conclusion  there 's another tool that can do that and we all have it and that tool is the brain 
 if there 's one thing a brain is good at it 's taking bits
  and pieces back together again even when you have incomplete information  and coming to a good conclusion especially if it 's the brain of an expert  
 and that 's why i believe that netflix was so successful because they used data and brains where they belong in the process  
 they use data to first understand lots of pieces about their audience that they otherwise wouldn 't have been able to understand at that depth  
 but then the decision to take all these bits and pieces and put them back
  together again and make a show like house of cards that was nowhere in the data ted sarandos and his team
 made that decision to license that show  which also meant by the way that they were taking a pretty big personal risk with that decision  
 and amazon on the other hand they did it the wrong way around they used data all the way to drive their decision making first when they held their competition of
  tv ideas then when they selected alpha house
 to make as a show  
 which of course was a very safe decision for them because they could always point at the data saying this is what the data tells us but it didn 't lead to the exceptional results that that they were hoping for 
 so data is of course a massively useful tool to make better decisions  but i believe
 that things go wrong when data is starting to drive those decisions  no matter how powerful data is just
  tool and to keep that in mind i find this device here quite useful many of you will 
 before there was data this was the  decision making device to use laughter
 many of you will know this this toy here is called the magic eight ball and it 's really amazing because if you have a decision to make a yes or no question all you have to do is you shake the
  and then you get an answer 
 most likely right here in this window in real time i 'll have it out later for tech demos now the thing is of course
 so i 've made some decisions in my life where in hindsight i should have just listened to the ball but 
 you know of course if you have the data available you want to replace this with something much more sophisticated like data analysis to come to a
  that does not change the basic setup so the ball may get smarter and smarter and smarter  
 but i believe it 's still on us to make the decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary on the right end of the curve  
 and
 i find that a very encouraging message in fact that even in the face of huge amounts of data it still pays off
  be an expert in what you 're doing and take risks because in the end 
 it 's not data it 's risks that will land you on the right end of the curve
