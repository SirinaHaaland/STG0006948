  i 'm here because i have a very important message i think we have found the most important factor for success  and it was found
 close to here stanford psychology professor took kids that were four years old and
  put them in a room
 all by themselves  and he would tell the child a four year old kid johnny i am going to leave you here with a marshmallow
 for fifteen minutes  if after i come back  this marshmallow is here you will get another one so you will have two 
  to wait fifteen minutes for something that they like is equivalent to telling us we 'll bring you coffee in two hours 
 exact equivalent  so
 what happened when the professor left the room as soon as the door closed  
 two out of three ate the marshmallow  five seconds ten seconds forty seconds fifty seconds
  could not wait 
 what 's interesting is that one out of three would look at the marshmallow and go like this 
 would look at it 
 put it back  
 they would walk around  they would play with their skirts and pants that child already at four understood
 the most important principle for success  which is the ability to delay gratification
 the most important factor for success  fifteen years later fourteen or fifteen years later follow up study  what did they find 
 they went to look for these kids who were now eighteen and nineteen and they found that one hundred percent
  of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful  
 they had good grades  they were doing wonderful  they were happy  they had their plans  they had good relationships with the teachers students  they were doing fine 
 a great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow  
 they were in trouble they did not make it to university  they had bad grades some of them dropped out a few were still there with bad grades a few had good grades  i had a question in my
  mind would hispanic kids react the same way as the american kids  
 so i went to colombia  and i reproduced the experiment and it was very funny i used four five and six years old kids  and let me show you what happened
  and
  what happened in colombia hispanic kids two out of three ate the marshmallow one out of three did not
 this little girl was interesting she ate the inside of the marshmallow 
 in other words she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it so she would get two  but she ate it  so we know she 'll be successful but we have to watch her
 she should not go into banking for example or work at a cash register but she will be successful  and
 this applies for everything even in sales the sales person that that the
 customer says i want that and the person says okay here you are that person ate the marshmallow 
 if the sales person says wait a second let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice then you sell a lot more so this has
  this has applications in all walks of life
