  it was an afternoon in the fall of two thousand and five  
 i was working at the aclu as the organization 's science advisor i
 really really loved my job  but i was having one of those days where i was feeling just a little bit discouraged  
 so i wandered
  down the hallway
 to my colleague chris hansen 's office 
 chris had been at the aclu for more than thirty years  so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights 
 i explained to chris that i was feeling a little bit stuck i had been investigating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil
  to engage these issues in a much bigger way in a way that could really make a difference
  so chris cut right to the chase and he says well of all the issues you 've been looking at what are the top five well  there 's
 genetic discrimination and
 reproductive technologies and biobanking and  oh there 's this really cool issue functional mri and using it for lie detection
  gene patents gene patents 
 yes you know patents on human genes no 
 you 're telling me that the us government has been issuing patents on part of the human body 
 that can 't be right 
 i went back to my office and sent chris three articles  and
  now chris is a really brilliant lawyer  but he knew almost nothing about patent law
 and certainly nothing about genetics  
 i knew something about genetics but i wasn 't even a lawyer  let alone a patent lawyer  so clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit
  we needed to understand exactly what was patented when someone patented a gene 
 gene patents typically contain dozens of claims  
 but the most controversial of these are to so called isolated dna 
 namely a piece of dna that has been removed from a cell 
 gene patent proponents say see we didn 't patent the gene in your
  we patented an isolated gene and that 's true  but the problem is that any use of the gene
 requires that it be isolated 
 and the patents weren 't just to a particular gene that they isolated  
 but on every possible version of that gene so what does that mean 
 that means that you can 't give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it say to see if it has any mutations without
  permission of the patent holder 
 it also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing 
 allowing patent holders often private companies to lock up stretches of the human genome
 was harming patients consider abigail
  with long qt syndrome a serious heart condition that if left untreated can result in sudden death 
 the company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose the syndrome  
 but then they went bankrupt and they never offered it 
 so another lab tried to offer the test but the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab for patent infringement so as a result for two years  
 no test was available
  during that time abigail died
 of undiagnosed long qt 
 gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients but was there a way we could challenge them 
 turns out that the supreme court has made clear through a long line of cases that certain things are not patent eligible 
 you can 't patent products of nature
 the air the
  water  minerals elements of the periodic table and you can 't patent laws of nature the law of gravity
 these things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all and reserved exclusively to none 
 it seemed to us that dna  the most fundamental structure of life that codes for the production of all of our proteins
  both a product of nature and a law of nature  regardless of whether it 's in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube 
 as we delved into this issue we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts
 scientists medical professionals  lawyers patent lawyers 
 most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy and at least in theory as a matter of law
  law all of them thought our chances of winning a gene patent challenge
 were about zero  why is that well the patent office had been issuing these patents
 for more than twenty years  there were literally thousands of patents on human genes 
 the patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo the biotech industry
  had grown up around this practice and legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced year after year in congress and had gone absolutely nowhere  
 so the bottom line courts just weren 't going to be willing to overturn these patents 
 now neither chris nor i
 were the type to shy away from a challenge and hearing being right just isn 't enough seemed all the more reason to take on this fight
 so we set out to build our case  
 now patent cases tend to be company a sues company b over some really narrow obscure technical issue 
 we weren 't really interested in that kind of case and we thought this case was much bigger than that this was about scientific freedom medical progress the rights of patients
  so we decided we were going to develop a case that was not like your typical patent case
 more like a civil rights case  we set out to identify a gene patent holder that was vigorously enforcing its patents
 and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation 
  we found the prime candidate to sue in myriad genetics a company that 's based in salt lake city utah myriad held patents on two genes the 
 and the brca2 genes 
 women with certain mutations along these genes are considered to be at a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer 
 myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on brca testing in the united states
 it had forced multiple labs that were offering brca testing to stop it charged a lot of money for its test over three thousand dollars  
 it had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community  
 and perhaps worst of all for a period of several years  myriad refused to
  update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in france 
 it has been estimated that during that period for several years as many as twelve percent of women undergoing testing received the wrong answer
 a negative test result that should have been positive 
 this is kathleen maxian kathleen 's sister eileen developed breast cancer at age forty and she was
  tested by myriad 
 the test was negative 
 the family was relieved that meant that eileen 's cancer most likely didn 't run in the family  and that other members of her family didn 't need to be tested 
 but two years later  kathleen was diagnosed with  advanced stage ovarian cancer 
 it turned out that kathleen 's sister was among the twelve percent who received
  result 
 had eileen received the proper result kathleen would have then been tested 
 and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented  
 once we settled on myriad we then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could illuminate these problems 
 we ended up with twenty highly committed plaintiffs 
 genetic counselors
  who had received cease and desist letters 
 advocacy organizations  
 four major scientific organizations that collectively represented more than one hundred and fifty thousand scientists and medical professionals 
 and individual women who either couldn 't afford myriad 's test or who wanted to obtain a second opinion but could not as a result of the
  one of the major challenges we had in preparing the case
 was figuring out how best to communicate the science so in order to argue that what myriad did was not an invention  
 and that isolated  brca genes were products of nature 
 we had to explain a couple of basic concepts like what 's a gene what 's dna how is dna isolated and why isn 't that
  we spent hours and hours
 with our plaintiffs and experts trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts simply yet accurately  
 and we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors like gold  
 so isolating dna it 's like extracting gold from a mountain or
 taking it out of a stream bed you might be able to patent the process for mining the gold  but you can 't patent the gold itself
 it might 've taken a lot of hard work and effort to dig the gold out of the mountain you
 still can 't patent it it 's still gold 
 and the gold once it 's extracted can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn 't be used for when it was in the mountain you can make jewelry out of it for example
 still can 't patent the gold  it 's still gold  
  so now it 's two thousand and nine and we 're ready to file our case  we filed in federal court
 in the southern district of new york and the case was randomly assigned to judge robert sweet 
 in march two thousand and ten judge sweet issued his opinion
 one hundred and fifty two pages and a complete victory for our side 
 in reading the opinion we could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case  i mean
  brief it was pretty good  but not this good 
 how did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time we just could not comprehend how this had happened  
 so it turned out judge sweet 's clerk working for him at the time 
 was not just a lawyer
 he was a scientist
  he was not just a scientist he had a phd in molecular biology 
 what an incredible stroke of luck 
 myriad then appealed to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit and here things got really interesting 
 first in a pivotal moment of this case  the us government
 switched sides  so in the district court the government submitted a brief on myriad 's side  but now
 in direct opposition to its own patent office 
 the us government files a brief that states that is has reconsidered this issue in light of the district court 's opinion  
 and has concluded that isolated dna is not patent eligible 
 this was a really big deal totally unexpected 
 the court of appeals for the federal circuit hears all patent cases  and it has a reputation for being
  very very pro patent so even with this remarkable development  we expected to lose  and we did sort of 
 ends up split decision two to one  
 but the two judges who ruled against us did so for completely different reasons  
 the first one judge lourie made up his own novel biological theory
 totally wrong
 decided myriad had created a new chemical made absolutely no sense myriad didn 't even argue this so it came out of the blue  
 the other judge moore  said she basically agreed with us that isolated dna is a product of nature  
 but she 's like i don 't want to shake up the biotech industry 
 the third
  judge bryson agreed with us  
 so now we sought review by the supreme court and when you when you petition the supreme court you have to present a question that you want the court to answer 
 usually these questions take the form of a super long paragraph like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses 
 wherein this and therefore that 
 we submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever  
 four words
 are human genes patentable  
 now when chris first asked me what i thought of these words  i said well i don 't know i think you have to say ' is isolated dna patentable ' nope  
 i want the justices to have the very same reaction that i had when you brought this issue to me seven
  i certainly couldn 't argue with that the supreme court only hears about one percent of the cases that it receives  and it agreed to hear ours  
 the day of the oral argument arrives  and it was really really exciting
 long line of people outside people had been standing in line since two thirty in the morning to try to get into the courthouse 
 two breast cancer organizations breast cancer action and force had organized a demonstration on the courthouse steps
  chris and i sat quietly in the hallway moments before he was to walk in
 and argue the most important case of his career i was clearly more nervous than he was 
 but any remaining panic subsided as i walked into the courtroom
 and looked around at a sea of friendly
  our individual women clients who had shared their deeply personal stories  
 the geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers to dedicate themselves to this fight
 and representatives from a diverse array of medical patient advocacy environmental and religious organizations who had submitted friend of the court
 briefs in the case  also in the room were three leaders
  the human genome project including the co discoverer of dna himself james watson who had submitted a brief to the court 
 where he referred to gene patenting as lunacy 
 the diversity of the communities represented in this room and the contributions each had made to make this day a reality
 spoke volumes to what was at stake  the argument itself was
  chris argued brilliantly  
 but for me the most thrilling aspect was watching the supreme court justices grapple with isolated dna through a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges 
  very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years
 and in one of my absolutely favorite moments  justice sotomayor proclaimed isolated dna to be just nature sitting there 
 we felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day  but i could never have anticipated the outcome 
 nine to zero a naturally occurring dna segment is a product of nature and not
  merely because it has been isolated and furthermore myriad did not create anything 
 within twenty four hours of the decision five labs had announced that they would begin to offer testing for the brca genes  
 some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than myriad 's 
 some promised to provide a more comprehensive test than the one myriad was offering 
 but of course
  the decision goes far beyond myriad it ends a 25 year practice of allowing patents on human genes in the united states  
 it clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery
 and innovation  and it helps to ensure that patients like abigail kathleen and eileen have access to the tests that they need 
 a few weeks after the court issued its decision
  i received a small package in the mail it was from bob cook deegan a professor at duke university
 and one the very first people chris and i went to visit when we started to consider whether to bring this case  i opened it up to find a small stuffed animal
  we took a big risk in taking this case  part of what gave us the courage to take that risk was knowing that we were doing the right thing 
 the process took nearly eight years from the start to finish with many twists and turns along the way 
 a little luck certainly helped but it was the communities that we bridged  the alliances that we created that made pigs fly
