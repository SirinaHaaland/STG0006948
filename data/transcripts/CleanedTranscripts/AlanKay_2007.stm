  way to start i think with my view of simplicity is to
 take a look at ted here you are understanding why we 're here what 's going on
 with no difficulty at all the best a i in the planet would find it
  complex and confusing  and my little dog watson
 would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point 
 he would have a great time  and of course if you 're a speaker
 here like hans rosling a speaker finds this complex tricky  but in hans rosling 's case
  he had a secret weapon yesterday literally in his sword swallowing
 act  and i must say i thought of quite a few objects that i might try to swallow
 today and finally gave up on but he just did it and that was
 a wonderful thing so puck meant
 not only are we fools in the pejorative sense but that we 're easily fooled in fact what
  shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled  so we 're actually looking forward to it 
 we go to magic shows in order to be fooled  and this makes
 many things fun  but it makes it difficult
 to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves and our friend betty edwards the drawing on the
  right side of the brain lady shows these two tables to her
 drawing class and says the problem you have with learning to draw is not that you can 't move your hand but
 that the way your brain perceives images
 is faulty it 's trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what 's there and to prove it she says
  size and shape of these tabletops
 is the same  and i 'm going to prove it to you she does this with cardboard but since i have an expensive computer here i 'll
 just rotate this little guy around and 
 now having seen that and i 've seen it hundreds of times because i use this in every talk i give i still can
  that they 're the same size and shape and i doubt that you can either  so what do artists do well what artists do is to measure 
 they measure very very carefully and if you measure very very carefully with a stiff arm
 and a straight edge you 'll see that those two shapes are exactly the
 same
  the talmud
 saw this a long time ago  saying we see things
 not as they are but as we are i certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight
 back then if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion 
 so if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are then
 what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here it 's a waking
  dream  and understanding that that is what
 we actually exist in is
 one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history  
 and what that means simple and understandable might not be actually simple or understandable and
 things we think are complex might be made simple and understandable
 somehow we have to understand ourselves to get
  around our flaws we can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel 
 the way i think of it is we can 't learn to see until we admit we 're blind once you start
 down at this very humble level then you can start
 finding ways to see things and what 's happened over the last four hundred years in particular is that human beings have invented
 little additional parts for our brain made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways and
 these are in the form of sensory apparatus telescopes microscopes reasoning apparatus various ways of thinking
 and most importantly in the ability to change perspective on things i 'll talk about that a little bit
 it 's this change in perspective on what it is we think we 're perceiving
 that has helped us make more progress in the last four hundred years than we have in the rest of human
 history  and yet 
 it is not taught in
 any k through twelve curriculum in america that i 'm aware of 
  the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more 
 we like more if we do more in a kind of a stupid way the simplicity gets complex
 and in fact  we can keep on doing it for a very long time  
 but murray gell mann yesterday talked about emergent properties  another name for them could be architecture as a metaphor
  taking the same old material and thinking about
  ways of combining it and in fact  what murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty
 of nature of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar all goes down to the
  the idea that the elementary particles
 are both sticky and standoffish  and
 they 're in violent motion those three things give rise to all the different levels of
 what seem to be complexity in our world
  a few years ago i just thought it was the greatest thing i 'd seen
 in conveying complex ideas simply but then i had a thought of boy maybe it 's too simple and i put some effort in
 to try and check
 to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the
  side and i found that they matched up very well  so the roslings have been able to do simplicity
 without removing what 's important about the data  whereas the
 the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell as a former molecular biologist
  i didn 't like that at all not because it wasn 't beautiful or anything but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand
 about molecular biology and that is why is there
 any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed 
 and what we saw yesterday was every reaction was fortuitous  they just swooped in the air and bound
  something happened  
 but in fact those molecules are spinning at the rate of about a million revolutions per second 
 they 're agitating back and forth their size
 every two nanoseconds they 're completely crowded together they 're jammed they 're bashing up against each other
  and if you don 't understand that in your mental model of this stuff 
 what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous and i think that 's exactly the wrong image
 for when you 're trying to teach science  
 so another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication
 with the actual understanding of some principle  so a kid who 's fourteen in high school
 gets this version of the pythagorean
 theorem  which is a truly subtle and interesting proof  but in fact it 's not a good way to start learning about
 mathematics so a more direct one one that gives you more of the feeling of math
  is something closer to pythagoras  ' own proof which goes like this so here we have this triangle and if we surround that
 c square with three more triangles and we copy that notice that we can
 move those triangles down like this and that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious  
 and bingo 
  that is all you have to do  and this kind of proof is the kind of proof
 that you need to learn when you 're learning mathematics in order to get an idea of what it means before you look into the literally 
  hundred or one thousand five hundred proofs of pythagoras ' theorem that have been discovered 
 now let 's go to young children this is a very unusual teacher who
 was a kindergarten and
  teacher but was a natural mathematician  so she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific
 musician she just had a feeling for math  and
 here are her six year olds and she 's got them
 making shapes out of a shape so they pick a shape they like
  like a diamond or a square or a triangle or a trapezoid and then they try and make the next larger shape of that same shape and the next larger shape you can see the trapezoids
 are a little challenging there and what this teacher did on every project was to have the children
 act like first it was a creative arts project and then something like science so they had created these artifacts now she had
  them look at them and do this laborious  which i thought
 for a long time until she explained to me was to slow them down
 so they 'll think so they 're cutting out the
 little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up but the whole point of this thing is
 for them to look at this chart
 and fill it out what have you noticed about what you did
  lauren there noticed that the first one took one and the second one took three more
 and the total was four on that one the third one took five more
 and the total was nine on that one and then the next one  she saw right away that
 the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by
  so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there and she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six 
 where she wasn 't sure what six times six was
 and what seven times seven was but then she was confident
 again  so that 's what lauren did and then the teacher  gillian ishijima had the
 kids bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor and everybody went batshit
  shit  they 're the same no matter what the shapes were the growth law
 is the same  and the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize
 these two progressions as a first order discrete differential equation and a second order discrete
 differential equation
  what we usually try to teach six year olds so let 's take a look now at
 how we might use the computer for some of this and so the first
 first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children
 do i 'm using the software that we 're putting on the $ one hundred laptop
  so i 'd like to draw a little car here i 'll just do this very quickly
 and put a big
 tire on him
 and i get a little object here and i can look inside this object i 'll call it a car and here
  little behavior car forward each time i click it car turn if i want to make a little script to do this over and over again i just drag these guys out
 and set them going  
 and i can try steering the car here by see the car turn by five here  so what if i click this down to zero it
 goes straight that 's a big revelation for
 nine year olds make it go in the other direction  but of course that 's a little bit like kissing your sister as far as
 driving a car so the kids want to do a steering wheel  so they draw a steering wheel 
 and we 'll call this a wheel 
  this wheel 's heading here if i turn this wheel you can see that number over there going minus and positive 
 that 's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of those numbers coming out
 there and to just drop it into the script here and now i can
 steer the car with the steering wheel and it
 's interesting you know how much trouble the children have with
  but by learning it this way in a situated fashion they never forget from this single trial what a variable is and how to use it 
 and we can reflect here the way gillian ishijima did so
 if you look at the little script here the speed is always going to be thirty we 're going to move the car according to that over and over again  
 and i 'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things they 're evenly
 spaced because they 're thirty apart  
 and what if i do this progression that the  six year olds did of saying ok  i 'm going to increase the speed by two each time 
 and then i 'm going to increase the distance by the speed each time what do i get there 
 we get a visual pattern of what these nine year olds called acceleration  so how do the children do science
  not pay any attention to what anybody else
 is
  putting on
  aristotle never asked a child
 about this particular point because of course he didn 't bother doing the experiment and neither did  st thomas aquinas and
 it was not until galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child only four hundred
  years ago  we get one child like that about every classroom of thirty kids
 who will actually cut straight to the chase now what if we want to look at this more closely  we can take a movie
 of what 's going on but even if we single stepped this movie it 's tricky to see what 's going on  
 and so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up  
 so when the children see
  this they say ah acceleration 
 remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways  and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration
 it is 
 so what i 'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image about a fifth of a second later 
 like that and they 're getting
  faster and faster each time and if i stack these guys up 
 then we see the differences  the increase in the speed
 is constant and they say oh yeah constant acceleration we 've done that already 
 how shall we look and verify that we actually
 have it so you can 't tell much from just making the ball
 drop there  but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time  
 we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model 
 galileo by the
  did this
 very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute 
 i pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that
 this is actually
 probably a newton and the apple type story but it 's a great story  and i thought i would do just one thing
 on the $ one hundred laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here
  so once you have gravity here 's this
 increase the speed by something increase the ship 's
 speed if i start the little game here that the kids have done it 'll crash the space ship 
 but if i oppose gravity here we go
