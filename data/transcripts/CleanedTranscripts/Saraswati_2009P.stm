  a human child
 is born
 and for quite a long time
 is a consumer
 it cannot be
 consciously
 a contributor
 it is helpless
  how to survive
 even though
 it is endowed with an instinct to survive
 it needs
 the help of
 mother or a foster mother
  to survive
 it can 't afford to
 doubt the person who tends the child
 it has to totally surrender
 as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist
 it has to totally surrender
 that implies a lot of trust
 that implies
  the trust as the child grows
 it begins to discover
 that the person trusted
 is violating the trust it
  it has to blame itself
 a wordless blame
 which is more more
 difficult to really resolve the wordless
  the child grows to become an adult
 so far it has been a consumer but the growth of a human being
 lies in his or her capacity to contribute
 to be a contributor
  one cannot contribute unless one feels secure
 one feels big
 one feels i have enough
 to be compassionate is not a joke
  not that simple
 one has to discover
 a certain bigness in oneself
 that bigness should be centered on oneself not in terms of money
 not in terms of power you wield
 not not in terms of any status that you can command in the society
 but it should be
  centered on oneself
 the self you are self aware
 on that self it should be centered a bigness a wholeness
 otherwise compassion is just a word and a
  than by compassion
 thank god we are empathetic
 when somebody 's in pain we pick up the pain in a wimbledon
 match final match
 these two guys fight it out each one has got two games
 it can be anybody 's game
 what they have sweated
 so far has no meaning
 one person wins
 the tennis etiquette is
 both the players have to come to the net
 and shake hands
 the winner boxes the air
  and kisses the ground throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it
 and this guy has to come to the net when he comes to the net
 you see his whole face face changes
 it looks as though he 's wishing that
  that he didn 't win why empathy
 that 's human heart no human hearted is denied of that empathy
 no religion can demolish that by indoctrination
 no culture no nation
  and nationalism nothing can touch it because it is empathy
 and that capacity to empathize
 is the window through which
 you reach out to people
 you do something that makes a difference in
  somebody 's life even words even time
 compassion is not defined in one form
 there 's no indian compassion there 's no american compassion
 it transcends nation gender age
  age
 why because
 it is there in everybody it
 's experienced by people occasionally
 then this occasional compassion we are not talking about
 it will never remain occasional
 by mandate you cannot make a person compassionate
 you can 't say please love me
 love is something you discover
 it 's not an action
  in the english language it is also an action
 i will come to it later
 so one has got to discover a certain wholeness
 i am going to cite the possibility of being whole
 which is within our experience
 everybody 's experience
 in spite of
 a very tragic life
 one is happy in moments
 which are very few and far between and the one who is happy
 even for a slapstick joke
 accepts himself
 and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself
 that means the whole universe known things
  and unknown things all of them are totally accepted
 because you discover your wholeness in yourself
 the subject me
 and the object the scheme of things fuse into oneness
 an experience nobody can say i am denied of
 an experience common to all and sundry
 that experience confirms
 that in spite of all your limitations
 all your wants desires unfulfilled
  and the credit cards and layoffs
 and finally baldness
 you can be happy but the extension of the logic is
 that you don 't need to fulfill your desire to be happy
 you are the very happiness the wholeness that you want to be
 there 's no choice in this that only confirms the reality
 that the wholeness cannot
 be different from you cannot be minus
  you
 it has got to be you you cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole
 your moment of happiness reveals that reality that realization that recognition
 maybe i am the whole maybe the swami is right
 maybe the swami is right you
 you start your new life
 then everything becomes meaningful
 i have no more reason to blame myself if one has to blame oneself one has
  million reasons plus many
 but if i say in spite of my body being limited
 if it is black it is not white if it is white it is not black
 body is limited any which way you look at it limited your knowledge is
  limited health is limited and power is therefore limited and the cheerfulness is going to be limited
 compassion is going to be limited
 everything is going to be limitless you cannot command
  unless you become limitless and nobody can become limitless either you are or you are not period
 and there is no way of your being not limitless too
 your own experience reveals in spite of all limitations you are
  the whole
 and the wholeness is the reality of you
 when you relate to the world it is love first
 when you relate to the world the dynamic
 manifestation of the wholeness is what we say
 love
 and
  itself becomes compassion
 if the object that you relate to
 evokes that that emotion
 then that again transforms into into giving
  express yourself because you have compassion
  there 's no
  the dynamic manifestation of the
