  imagine that when you walked in here this evening you discovered that everybody in the room
 looked almost exactly the same ageless raceless generically good looking that person sitting
  right next to you might have the most idiosyncratic inner life but you don 't have a clue because we 're all wearing the same blank expression all the time 
 that is the kind of creepy transformation that is taking over cities only it applies to buildings not people 
 cities
 are full of roughness and shadow texture and color you can still find
 architectural surfaces of great individuality
  and character
 in apartment buildings in riga
 and yemen  
 social housing in vienna  
 hopi villages in arizona  brownstones in new york  
 wooden houses in san francisco 
 these aren 't palaces or cathedrals these are just ordinary residences expressing the ordinary splendor of cities 
  they 're like that is that the need for shelter is so bound up with the human desire for beauty 
 their rough surfaces give us a touchable city 
 right streets that you can read by running your fingers over brick and stone 
 but that 's getting harder to do because cities are becoming smooth
  sprout towers that are almost always made of concrete and steel and covered in glass you can look at skylines all over the world
 houston guangzhou  frankfurt
 and you see the same army of high gloss robots marching over the horizon 
  just think of everything we lose when architects stop using the full range
 of available materials 
 when we reject granite and limestone and sandstone and wood and copper and terra cotta and brick and wattle and plaster 
 we simplify architecture and we impoverish cities  
 it 's as if you reduced all of the world 's cuisines
 down to airline food
  but worse still assemblies of glass towers like this one in moscow
 suggest a disdain for the civic and communal aspects of urban living  
 right buildings like these are intended to enrich their owners and tenants  
 but not necessarily the lives of the rest of us those of us who navigate the spaces between the buildings 
 and we expect to do so for
  free  shiny towers are an invasive species
 and they are choking our cities and killing off public space we tend to think of a facade as
 being like makeup a decorative layer applied at the end to a building that 's effectively complete 
 but just because a facade is superficial doesn 't mean it 's not also deep let me give you an example
 of how a city
  's surfaces affect the way we live in it when i visited salamanca in spain i gravitated to the plaza mayor
 at all hours of the day  early in the morning sunlight rakes the facades sharpening shadows  
 and at night  lamplight segments the buildings into hundreds of distinct areas  
 balconies and windows and arcades each one a separate pocket of visual activity
 that detail and depth that glamour gives the plaza a theatrical quality  
 it becomes a stage where the generations can meet 
 you have teenagers sprawling on the pavers seniors monopolizing the benches  and real life starts to look
  the curtain goes up on salamanca 
 so just because i 'm talking about the exteriors of buildings 
 not form  not function not structure  
 even so those surfaces give texture to our lives 
 because buildings create the spaces around them and those spaces can
 draw people in or push them away  and the difference often has to do with the quality of those
  exteriors so one contemporary equivalent of the plaza mayor in salamanca is 
 in paris a windswept glass walled open space
 that office workers hurry through on the way from the metro to their cubicles but otherwise spend as little time in as possible 
  the architect philip johnson
 tried to recreate a gracious european plaza in pittsburgh 
 this is ppg place a half acre of open space encircled by
 commercial buildings made of mirrored glass  and he ornamented those buildings with metal trim and bays and
 gothic turrets which really pop on the skyline  but at ground level the plaza feels like a black glass cage
  i mean sure in summertime kids are running back and forth through the fountain and there 's ice skating in the winter  
 but it lacks the informality of a leisurely hangout it 's just not the sort of place you really want to just hang out and chat 
 public spaces thrive or fail for many different reasons architecture is only one but it 's an important one
 some recent plazas like federation square in melbourne
 or superkilen in copenhagen
 succeed because they combine old and new rough and smooth  
 neutral and bright colors  and because they don 't rely excessively on glass
  i 'm not against glass  it 's an ancient and versatile material 
 it 's easy to manufacture and transport and install and replace and clean  
 it comes in everything from enormous  ultraclear sheets to
 translucent bricks new coatings make it change mood in the shifting
  in expensive cities like new york  it has the magical power of being able to multiply real estate values by allowing views which is really the only commodity that developers have to offer to justify those surreal prices 
 in the middle of the  19th century with the construction of the crystal palace in london 
 glass leapt to the top of the list of quintessentially modern substances
  it had come to dominate the downtowns of some american cities  
 largely through some really spectacular office buildings like lever house in midtown manhattan designed by skidmore owings and merrill 
 eventually the technology advanced to the point where architects could design structures so transparent
 they practically disappear  and along the way glass became the default material of the high rise city and there
  's a very powerful reason for that because as the world 's populations converge on cities  
 the least fortunate pack into jerry built shantytowns  
 but hundreds of millions of people need apartments and places to work in ever larger buildings so it makes economic sense to put up towers and wrap them in cheap and practical
  has a limited ability
 to be expressive this is a section of wall framing a plaza in the  pre hispanic city of mitla in southern mexico 
 those 2 000 year old carvings make it clear that this was a place of high ritual significance  
 today we look at those and we can see a historical and textural continuity between those carvings the mountains
  all around and that church
 which is built on top of the ruins using stone plundered from the site 
 in nearby oaxaca even ordinary plaster buildings become canvasses for bright colors  political murals
 and sophisticated graphic arts  it 's an intricate  communicative language
 that an epidemic of glass would simply wipe out
  the good news is that architects and developers have begun to rediscover the joys of texture without backing away from modernity some find
 innovative uses for old materials like brick
 and terra cotta others invent new products like the molded panels that snhetta used
 to give the san francisco museum of modern art that crinkly
  sculptural quality  
 the architect stefano boeri even created living facades this is his vertical forest a pair of apartment towers in milan  whose most visible feature is greenery 
 and boeri is designing a version of this for nanjing in china  
 and imagine
 if green facades were as ubiquitous as glass ones how much cleaner the air in chinese cities would become
 but the truth is that these are mostly one offs boutique projects not easily reproduced at a global scale 
 and that is the point 
 when you use materials that have a local significance you prevent cities from all looking the same 
 copper
 has a long history in new york the statue of liberty  the crown of the woolworth
  building
 but it fell out of fashion for a long time until shop architects used it to cover the american copper building 
 a pair of twisting towers on the east river  
 it 's not even finished and you can see the way sunset
 lights up that metallic facade which will weather to green as it ages  buildings can be like people their faces broadcast their experience
  experience  
 and that 's an important point because when glass ages  
 you just replace it and the building looks pretty much the same way it did before until eventually it 's demolished  almost all other materials
 have the ability to absorb infusions of history and memory and project it
  the utah natural history museum in salt lake city in copper and zinc  ores that have been mined in the area for one hundred and fifty years
 and that also camouflage the building against the ochre hills
 so that you have a natural history museum
 that reflects the region 's natural history and when the chinese pritzker prize winner wang shu was building
  museum in ningbo  he didn 't just create a wrapper for the past 
 he built memory right into the walls by using brick and stones and shingles salvaged from villages that had been demolished  
 now architects can use glass in equally lyrical and inventive ways  here in new york  two buildings one by jean nouvel
 and this one by frank gehry
 face off across west 19th street  and the play of reflections that they toss back and forth is like a symphony in light
  but when a city defaults to glass as it grows  it becomes a hall of mirrors  disquieting
  after all cities are places of concentrated variety
 where the world 's cultures and languages
 and lifestyles come together and mingle so rather than encase all that variety
 and diversity in buildings of crushing sameness we should have an architecture that honors the full range of the urban experience  
 thank you
