  two thousand and three the uk government carried out a survey  
 and it was a survey that measured levels of numeracy in the population  and they were shocked to find out that for every one hundred working age adults
 in the country forty seven of them
 lacked level one numeracy skills now level one numeracy skills that 's
  score it 's the ability to deal with fractions  percentages and decimals so this figure prompted a lot of hand wringing in
 whitehall policies were changed investments were made and then they ran the survey again in two thousand and eleven  so can you guess what happened to this number
  it went up to forty nine and in fact when i reported this figure in the ft one of our readers joked and said this figure
 is only shocking to fifty one percent of the population 
 but i preferred actually  the reaction of a schoolchild when i presented at a school this information
  raised their hand and said how do we know that the person who made that number isn 't one of the forty nine percent either so
 clearly there 's a numeracy issue because these are important skills for life and a lot of the changes that we want to introduce
 in this century involve us becoming more comfortable with numbers  
 now  it 's not just an english problem  oecd this year released some figures looking at numeracy in young people 
 and leading the way  the usa nearly
  forty percent of young people in the us have low numeracy now england is there too but there are 
 seven oecd countries with figures above twenty percent that is a problem because it doesn 't have to be that way if you look at the far end of this graph 
 you can see the netherlands and korea are in single figures
 so there 's definitely
 a numeracy problem that we want to address now
  useful as studies like these are i think we risk herding people inadvertently into one of two categories that there are two kinds of people 
 those people that are comfortable with numbers that can do numbers  and the people who can 
  i 'm trying to talk about here today is to say that i believe that that
  a false dichotomy  it 's not an immutable pairing  
 i think you don 't have to have tremendously high levels of numeracy to be inspired by numbers  and that that should be the starting point to the journey ahead
 and one of the ways in which we can begin that journey for me is looking at statistics now i am the first to acknowledge that statistics has got somewhat of an image problem 
 laughter it 's the part of mathematics that even mathematicians don 't particularly like because whereas the rest of
  maths is all about precision and certainty statistics is almost the reverse of that  but actually
 i was a late convert to the world of statistics myself  if you 'd asked my undergraduate professors what two
 subjects would i be least likely to excel in after university they 'd have told you statistics and computer programming  and yet here i am about to show you some statistical graphics that i programmed
  inspired that change in me what made me think that statistics was actually an interesting thing  
 it 's really because statistics are about us  if you look at the etymology of the word statistics 
 it 's the science of dealing with data about the state or the community that we live in so statistics are about us as a group 
 not us as individuals and i think as social animals we share this fascination about how we as individuals
  relate to our groups to our peers and statistics in this way are at their most powerful when they surprise us
  and there 's been some really wonderful surveys carried out recently by ipsos mori in the last few years 
 they did a survey of over one thousand adults in the uk and said  for every one hundred people in england and wales  how many of them are muslim 
  now the average answer from this survey which was supposed to be representative of the total population was
 that 's what people thought british people think twenty four out of every one hundred people in the country are muslim now official figures
 reveal that figure to be about five  
 so there 's this big variation between what we think our perception  and the reality as as given by statistics and i think that 's interesting what could possibly be causing
 that misperception
 and i was so thrilled with this study i started to take questions out in presentations i was referring to it now  i did a presentation at st paul 's school for girls in hammersmith  
 and i had an audience rather like this except it was comprised entirely of sixth form girls  and i said 
 girls  
 how many
 teenage girls do you think the british public think get pregnant every
  year and the girls were apoplectic when i said
 the british public think that fifteen out of every one hundred teenage girls get pregnant in the year  
 and they had every right to be angry  because in fact i 'd have to have closer to two hundred dots before i could color one in in terms of what the official figures tell us 
 and rather
  like numeracy this is not just an english problem  ipsos mori expanded the survey in recent years
 to go across the world  
 and so they asked saudi arabians for every one hundred adults in your country  how many of them are overweight or obese  
 and the average answer from the saudis
 was
 just over a quarter that 's what they thought just over a quarter of
  overweight or obese the official figures show actually  it 's nearer
 to three quarters 
 so again a big variation  and i love this one they asked in japan
  they asked the japanese for every one hundred japanese people how many of them live in rural areas 
  the average was about a 50 50 split just over
  of every one hundred japanese people lived in rural areas  the official figure is seven so
 extraordinary variations and surprising to some but not surprising to people who have read the work of daniel kahneman for example the 
 economist he and his colleague  amos tversky spent
 years researching this disjoint between what people perceive and the reality the fact that people are actually pretty poor intuitive statisticians
 and there are many reasons for this individual experiences certainly can influence our perceptions but so too can things like the media reporting things by exception 
 rather than what 's normal 
 kahneman had a nice way of referring to that he said we can be blind to the obvious so we 've got the numbers wrong but we can be blind to our blindness about it and that has enormous repercussions
 for decision making so at the statistics office while
  this was all going on i thought this was really interesting i said this is clearly a global problem but maybe geography is the issue here
  these were questions that were all about how well do you know your country  so in this case it 's
 how well do you know  sixty four million people not very well it turns out i can 't do that so i had an idea which was
 to think about this same sort of approach but to think about it in a very local sense
  is this a local  if we reframe the questions and say how well do you know your local area would your answers be any more accurate  
 so i devised a quiz  how well do you know your area  
 it 's a simple web app you put in a post code and then it will ask you questions based on census data for your local
  and i was very conscious in designing this i wanted to make it
 open to the widest possible range of people not just the forty nine percent who can get the numbers i wanted everyone to engage with it so for the design of the quiz
 i was inspired by the isotypes of otto neurath from the 1920s and ' 30s now these
 are methods for representing
 numbers using repeating
  the numbers are there but they sit in the background 
 so it 's a great way of representing quantity without resorting to using terms like percentage fractions and ratios so
 here 's the quiz  
 the layout of the quiz is you have your repeating icons on the  left hand side there and a map showing you the area we 're asking you questions about on the right hand side there are seven questions 
 each question
  there 's a possible answer between zero and a hundred and at the end of the quiz you get an overall score between zero and a hundred and so because this is 
 i thought we would have a quick look at the quiz for the first few questions
 of exeter and so the first question is for every one hundred people  how many are aged under sixteen  
 now  i don 't know exeter very well at all so i had a guess at this but it gives you an idea of how this quiz
  you drag the slider
 to highlight your icons  
 and then just click submit to answer and we animate away the difference between your answer and reality  
 and it turns out i was a pretty terrible guess five  
 how about the next question this is asking about what the average age is so the age at which half the population are younger and half the population are older and i thought
  in exeter it 's incredibly young and i had underestimated the impact of the university
 in this area  the questions get harder as you go through  so this one 's now asking about homeownership 
 for every one hundred households how many are owned with a mortgage or loan  and i hedged my bets here because i didn 't want to be more than fifty out
 on the answer
  these get harder these questions because when you 're in an area when you 're in a community things like age
 there are clues to whether a population is old or young just by looking around the area you can see it something like homeownership
 is much more difficult to see so we revert to our own heuristics our own biases about how many people we think own their own homes
  the truth is when we published this quiz  the census data that it 's based on was already a few years old we 've had
 online applications that allow you to put in a post code and get statistics back for years  so in some senses this was all a little bit
 old and and not necessarily new but i was interested to see
 what reaction we might get by  gamifying the data in the way that we have by using animation and playing on the fact that people have their own preconceptions
  it turns out  the reaction was um 
 was more than i could have hoped for it was a long held ambition of mine to bring down a statistics website due to public demand 
 laughter this url contains the words statistics gov and uk which are three of people 's least favorite words in a
  and the amazing thing about this was that the website came down
 at quarter to ten at night because people were actually
 engaging with this data of their own free will using their own personal time
  i was very interested to see that we got something like a quarter of a million
 people playing the quiz within the space of forty eight hours of launching it and it sparked an enormous
  on social media which was largely dominated
 by people having fun with their misconceptions which is something that i
 i couldn 't have hoped for any better in some respects i also liked the fact that people started sending it to politicians  how well do you know the area you claim to represent 
 and then just to finish 
 going back to the two kinds of people  i thought it would be really interesting to see how people who are good with numbers would do on this quiz  the national
  statistician of england and wales  john pullinger you would expect he would be pretty good he got forty four for his own area 
 jeremy paxman
 admittedly after a glass of wine thirty six even worse  it just shows you that the numbers can inspire
  can surprise us all so very often we talk about statistics as being the science of uncertainty my parting thought for today is actually statistics is the science of us  and that 's why we should be fascinated
 by numbers thank you very much
