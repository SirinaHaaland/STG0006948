  i 'd like to tell you a story about death and architecture 
 a hundred years ago we tended to die of infectious diseases like pneumonia that if they took hold would take us away quite quickly  
 we tended to die at home in our own beds looked after by family although that was the default
  because a lot of people lacked access to medical care 
 and then in the 20th century a lot of things changed  we developed new medicines like penicillin so we could treat those infectious diseases 
 new medical technologies like x ray machines were invented and because they were so big and expensive we needed large centralized buildings to keep them in  and they became our
  after the second world war a lot of countries set up universal healthcare systems so that everyone who needed treatment could get it 
 the result was that lifespans extended from about forty five at the start of the century to almost double that today 
 the 20th century was this time of huge optimism about what science could offer  but with all of the focus on life 
 death was forgotten even as our approach to death changed dramatically
  i 'm an architect and for the past year and a half i 've been looking at these changes and at what they mean for architecture related to death and dying  
 we now tend to die of cancer and heart disease  and what that means is that many of us will have a long period of chronic illness at the end of our lives  
 during that period we 'll likely spend a lot of time in hospitals and hospices and care homes 
 now  we 've all been in a modern
  you know those fluorescent lights and the endless corridors and those rows of uncomfortable chairs hospital architecture has earned its bad reputation  
 but the surprising thing is it wasn 't always like this 
 this is l 'ospedale degli 
  nineteen by brunelleschi who was one of the most famous and influential architects of his time  
 and when i look at this building and then think about hospitals today what amazes me is this building 's ambition it 's just a really great building
  it has these courtyards in the middle so that all of the rooms have daylight and fresh air and the rooms are big and they have high ceilings so they just feel more comfortable to be in 
 and it 's also beautiful  
 somehow  we 've forgotten that that 's even possible for a hospital 
 now  if we want better buildings for dying then we have to talk about it 
 but because we find the subject of death uncomfortable we don 't talk about it and we don 't question how we as a society
  approach death 
 one of the things that surprised me most in my research though is how changeable attitudes actually are this is the first crematorium in the u k which was built in woking in the 
 and when this was first built there were protests in the local village  cremation wasn 't socially acceptable and ninety nine point eight percent of people got
  only a hundred years later  three quarters of us get cremated people are actually really open to changing things if they 're given the chance to talk about them 
 so this conversation about death and architecture was what i wanted to start when i did my first exhibition on it in venice in june which was called death in venice 
 it was designed to be quite playful so that people would literally engage with it this is one of our exhibits which is an interactive map of london that shows just how much of the real estate in the city
 is given over to death and dying  and as you wave your hand across the map the name of that piece of real estate the building or cemetery is revealed  
 another of our exhibits was a series of postcards that people could take away with them  
 and they showed people 's homes and hospitals and cemeteries and mortuaries  
 and they tell the story of the different spaces that we pass through on either side of death  
 we wanted to
  show that where we die is a key part of how we die 
 now the strangest thing was the way that visitors reacted to the exhibition especially the audio visual works  
 we had people dancing and running and jumping as they tried to activate the exhibits in different ways  
 and at a certain point they would kind of stop and remember that they were in an exhibition about death and that maybe that 's not
  how you 're supposed to act 
 but actually i would question whether there is one way that you 're supposed to act around death 
 and if there 's not i 'd ask you to think about what you think a good death is and what you think that architecture that supports a good death might be like  
 and mightn 't it be a little less like this and a little more like this
