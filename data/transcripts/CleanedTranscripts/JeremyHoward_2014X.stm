  it used to be that if you wanted to get a computer to do something new you would have to program it now programming for those of you here that haven 't done it yourself  requires laying out 
  in excruciating detail every single step that you want the computer to do in order to achieve your goal
  goal 
 now if you want to do something that you don 't know how to do yourself then this is going to be a great challenge  so this was the challenge faced by this man arthur samuel in one thousand nine 
  he wanted to get this computer to be able to beat him at checkers  how can you write a program lay out in excruciating detail
  how to be better than you at checkers  so he came up with an idea he had the computer play against itself thousands of times and learn how to play checkers  
 and indeed it worked  and in fact by one thousand nine hundred and sixty two this computer had beaten the connecticut state champion 
 so arthur samuel was the father of machine learning and i have a great debt to him because i am a machine learning practitioner
 i was the president of kaggle a community of over two hundred thousand machine learning
 kaggle puts up competitions to try and get them to solve previously unsolved problems  and it 's been successful hundreds of times  
 so from this vantage point i was able to find out a lot about what machine learning can do in the past can do today  and what it could do in the future  
 perhaps the first big success of machine learning commercially was google  google showed that it is possible to find
  information
 by using a computer algorithm and this algorithm is based on machine learning  
 since that time there have been many commercial successes of machine learning  companies like amazon and netflix use machine learning to suggest products that you might like to buy  movies that you 
  might like to watch sometimes it 's almost creepy  companies like linkedin and facebook sometimes will tell you about who your friends might be and you have no idea how it did it
 and this is because it 's using the power of machine learning  these are algorithms that have learned how to do this from data rather than being programmed by hand  
 this is also how ibm was successful in getting watson to beat the two world champions at jeopardy 
 answering incredibly subtle and complex questions like this one
  cars  if you want to be able to tell the difference between say a tree and a pedestrian well that 's pretty important  we don 't know how to write those programs by hand  but with machine learning this 
  is now possible and in fact this car has driven over a million miles without any accidents on regular roads
  can learn and computers can learn to do things that we actually sometimes don 't know how to do ourselves or maybe can do them better than us 
 one of the most amazing examples i 've seen of machine learning happened on a project that i ran at kaggle where a team run
 by a guy called geoffrey hinton from the university of toronto won a competition for automatic drug discovery 
 now what was extraordinary here is not just that they beat all of the algorithms developed by merck or the international academic community
  but nobody on the team had any background in chemistry or biology or life sciences and they did it in two weeks how did they do this 
 they used an extraordinary algorithm called deep learning
 so important was this that in fact the success was covered in the new york times in a front page article a few weeks later  this is geoffrey hinton here on the
  is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works  and as a result it 's an algorithm which has no theoretical limitations on what it can do 
 the more data you give it and the more computation time you give it the better it gets 
 the new york times also showed in this article another extraordinary result of deep learning which i 'm going to show you now 
 it shows that computers can
  take in this process is to actually speak to you in chinese 
 now the key thing there is we 've been able to take a large amount of information from many chinese speakers
 and produce a text to speech system that takes chinese text and converts it into chinese language
  hour or so of my own voice and we 've used that to modulate the standard text to speech system so that it would sound like me
  that was at a machine learning conference in china
  it 's not often actually at academic conferences that you do hear spontaneous applause  although of course sometimes at tedx conferences feel free
  everything you saw there was happening with deep learning
  english was deep learning  the translation to chinese and the text in the top right deep learning and the construction of the voice was deep learning as well
 so deep learning is this extraordinary thing it 's a single algorithm that can seem to do almost anything  and i discovered that a year earlier it had also learned to see in this obscure 
  competition from germany called the german traffic sign recognition benchmark deep learning had learned to recognize traffic signs like this
 not only could it recognize the traffic signs better than any other algorithm the leaderboard actually showed it was better than people about twice as good as people  so by two thousand and eleven we had the first example of computers that can see better than people  
 since that time a lot has happened in two thousand and twelve google announced that they had a deep learning algorithm watch youtube videos and crunched the data on sixteen thousand computers for a month and
  computer independently learned about concepts such as people and cats just by watching the videos  this is much like the way that humans learn  humans don 't learn by being told what they see but by learning for themselves what these things are 
 also in two thousand and twelve geoffrey hinton who we saw earlier  won the very popular  imagenet
  looking to try to figure out from one and a half million images what they 're pictures of 
 as of two thousand and fourteen we 're now down to a six percent error rate in image recognition  this is better than people  again so machines really are doing an extraordinarily good 
  job of this and it is now being used in industry for example  google announced last year that they had mapped every single location in france
  images into a deep learning algorithm to recognize and read street numbers imagine how long it would have taken before  dozens of people many years  
 this is also happening in china baidu is kind of the chinese google i guess  and what you see here in the top left is an example of a picture that i uploaded to baidu 's deep learning system and underneath you can see that the system has
  understood what that picture is and found similar images the similar images actually have similar backgrounds similar directions of the faces  even some with their tongue out 
 this is not clearly looking at the text of a web page all i uploaded was an image  
 so we now have computers which really understand what they see and can therefore search databases of
  hundreds of millions of images in real time  so what does it mean now that computers can see well
 it 's not just that computers can see  in fact deep learning has done more than that 
 complex nuanced sentences like this one are now understandable with deep learning algorithms as you can see here this stanford based system showing the red dot at the top has figured out that this sentence is expressing negative sentiment 
  now in fact is near human performance at understanding what sentences are about and what it is saying about those things 
 also deep learning has been used to read chinese  again at about native chinese speaker level
  this algorithm developed out of switzerland by people  none of whom speak or understand any chinese as i say  using deep learning is about the best system in the world for this
  even compared to native human understanding 
 this is a system
  that we put together at my company which shows putting all this stuff together these are pictures which have no text attached  and as i 'm typing in here sentences in real time it 's understanding 
  these pictures and figuring out what they 're about and finding pictures that are similar to the text that i 'm writing  so you can see it 's actually understanding my sentences and actually understanding these pictures 
  in things and it will show you pictures  but actually what it 's doing is it 's searching the webpage for the text this is very different from actually understanding the images  this is something that computers have only been able to do for the first time in the last few months  
 so we can see now that computers can not only see but they can also read and of course we 've shown that they can understand what they hear  
 perhaps not surprising now that i 'm going to tell you they can write
 here is some text that i generated using a deep learning algorithm yesterday  
 and here is some text that an algorithm out of stanford generated each of these sentences was generated by a deep learning algorithm to describe each of those pictures 
 this algorithm before has never seen a man in a black shirt playing a guitar  it 's seen a man before it 's seen black before it 's seen a guitar before
  this novel description of this picture we 're still not quite at human performance here but we 're close  in tests  humans prefer the
  caption one out of four times now this system is now only two weeks old so probably within the next year the computer algorithm will be well past human performance at the rate things are going  
 so computers can also write  so we put all this together and it
  leads to very exciting opportunities for example in medicine a team in boston announced that they had discovered
 dozens of new clinically relevant features of tumors which help doctors make a prognosis of a cancer 
 very similarly  in stanford a group there announced that looking at tissues under magnification
  they 've developed a machine learning based system which in fact is better than human pathologists at predicting survival rates for cancer sufferers  
 in both of these cases not only were the predictions more accurate but they generated new insightful science 
 in the radiology case they were new clinical indicators that humans can understand in this pathology case
  the computer system actually discovered that the cells
  as important as the cancer cells themselves in making a diagnosis  this is the opposite of what pathologists had been taught for decades  
 in each of those two cases they were systems developed by a combination of medical experts and machine learning experts but as of last year we 're now beyond that too  this is an example of identifying cancerous areas
 of human tissue under a microscope
  the system being shown here can identify
  those areas more accurately or about as accurately as human pathologists but was built entirely with deep learning using no medical expertise by people who have no background in the field
  similarly here  this neuron segmentation  
 we can now segment neurons about as accurately as humans can but this system was developed with deep learning using people with no previous background in medicine
  as somebody with no previous background in medicine i seem to be entirely well qualified to start a new medical company which i did 
 i was kind of terrified of doing it but the theory seemed to suggest that it ought to be possible to do very useful medicine
 using just these data analytic techniques  and thankfully the feedback has been fantastic not just from the media but from the medical community who have been very supportive
  the theory is that we can take the middle part of the medical process and turn that into data analysis as much as possible leaving doctors to do what they 're best at 
 i want to give you an example  it now takes us about fifteen minutes to generate a new medical diagnostic test and i 'll show you that in real time now but i 've compressed it down to three minutes by cutting some pieces out 
 rather than showing you creating a medical
  test i 'm going to show you a diagnostic test of car images  because that 's something we can all understand  
 so here we 're starting with about one point five million car images  and i want to create something that can split them into the angle of the photo that 's being taken 
 so these images are entirely unlabeled  so i have to start from scratch 
 with our deep learning
  it can automatically identify areas of structure in these images  
 so the nice thing is that the human and the computer can now work together  so the human as you can see here is telling the computer about areas of interest which it it wants the computer then to try and use to improve its algorithm 
 now these deep learning systems actually are in 
  space so you can see here the computer rotating this through that space trying to find new areas of structure  and when it does so successfully the human who is driving
  it can then point out the areas that are interesting  so here the computer has successfully found areas for example  angles  
 so as we go through this process we 're gradually telling the computer more and more about the kinds of structures we 're looking for 
 you can imagine in a diagnostic test this would be a pathologist identifying areas of pathosis for example  or a
  sometimes it can be difficult for the algorithm  in this case it got kind of confused the fronts and the backs of the cars are all mixed up  so here we have to be a bit more careful  
 manually selecting these fronts as opposed to the backs then telling the computer
 that  this is a type of
 group that we 're interested in so we do that for a while we skip over a little bit  and then we train the machine learning algorithm based on these couple of
  hundred things and we hope that it 's gotten a lot better you can see it 's now started to fade some of these pictures out showing us that it already is recognizing how to understand some of these itself 
 we can then use this concept of similar images  
 and using similar images you can now see the computer at this point is able to entirely find just the fronts of cars so at this
  you 've done a good job of that sometimes of course  even at this point it 's still difficult to separate out groups
 in this case even after we
 let the computer try to rotate this for a while  we still find that the left sides and the right sides pictures are all mixed up together  
 so we can again give the computer some hints and we say okay try and find a projection that separates out the left sides and the right sides as much as possible using this deep learning algorithm
  and giving it that hint ah  okay it 's been successful it 's managed to find a way of thinking about these objects that 's separated out these together  so
 you get the idea here  this is a case not where 
 the human is being replaced by a computer but where they 're working together what we 're doing here is we 're replacing something that used to take a team of five
  or six people about seven years and replacing it with something that takes fifteen minutes for one person acting alone  so
 this process takes about four or five iterations you can see we now have sixty two percent of our one point five million images classified correctly  and at this point we can start to quite quickly 
 grab whole big sections  check through them to make sure that there 's no mistakes where there are mistakes we can let the computer know about them
  and using this kind of process for each of the different groups we are now up to an eighty percent success rate in classifying the one point five million images
  and at this point it 's just a case of finding the small number that aren 't classified correctly  and trying to understand
 why  and using that approach by fifteen minutes we get to ninety seven percent classification rates so
  this kind of technique could allow us to fix a major problem which is that there 's a lack of medical expertise in the world the world economic forum says that there 's between a 10x and 
  of physicians in the developing world and it would take about three hundred years to train enough people
 to fix that problem  so imagine if we can help enhance their efficiency using these deep learning approaches so i 'm very excited about the
  opportunities i 'm also concerned about the problems  
 the problem here is that every area in blue on this map is somewhere where services are over eighty percent of employment what are services 
 these are services 
 these are also the exact things that computers have just learned how to do  
 so
 eighty percent of the world 's employment in the developed world is stuff that computers have just learned how to do what does that mean
 well it 'll be fine they 'll be replaced by other jobs for example there will be more jobs for data scientists 
 well not really it doesn 't take data scientists very long to build these things for example these four algorithms were all built by the same guy  
 so if you think oh it 's all happened before
  we 've seen the results in the past of when new things come along and they get replaced by new jobs what are these new jobs going to be  
 it 's very hard for us to estimate
  this because human performance grows at this gradual rate but we now have a system deep learning that we know actually grows in capability exponentially  
 and we 're here  so currently we see the things around us and we say oh computers are still pretty dumb 
 right but in five years ' time computers will be off this chart  so we need to be starting to think about this capability right now 
 we have seen this once before of course in the industrial
  revolution  we saw a step change in capability thanks to engines  
 the thing is though that after a while things flattened out there was social disruption but once engines were used to generate power in all the situations things really settled down 
 the machine learning revolution is going to be very different from the industrial revolution  because the machine
  it never settles down  the better computers get at intellectual activities the more they can build better computers to be better at intellectual capabilities  
 so this is going to be a kind of change that the world has actually never experienced before  so your previous understanding of what 's possible is different  
 this is already impacting us in the last twenty five years as capital productivity has increased  labor productivity has been
  in fact even a little bit down
