  technology has brought us so much the moon landing  the internet  the ability to sequence the human genome  
 but it also taps into a lot of our deepest fears  and about thirty years ago  the culture critic neil postman wrote a book called
  ourselves to death which lays this out really brilliantly  
 and here 's what he said  comparing the dystopian visions of george orwell and aldous huxley 
 he said  orwell feared we would become a captive culture huxley feared we would become a trivial culture
  orwell feared the truth would be concealed from us and huxley feared we would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance 
 in a nutshell it 's a choice between big brother watching you
 and you watching big brother 
 but it doesn 't have to be this way we are not passive consumers of data and technology we shape the role it plays in our lives and the way we make meaning from it 
 but to do that
 we have to pay as much attention to how we think
 as how we code  we have to ask questions  and hard questions to move past counting things to understanding them we
 're constantly bombarded with stories about how much data there is in the world but when it comes to big data and the challenges of interpreting it size isn 't everything
  also the speed at which it moves  and the many varieties of data types and here are just a few examples images  
 text
  video  
 audio  and what unites this disparate types of data is that they 're created by people and they require context
  now there 's a group of data scientists out of the university of 
  and they 're called the health media collaboratory and they 've been working with the centers for disease control to better understand how people talk about quitting smoking 
 how they talk about electronic cigarettes  and what they can do collectively to help them quit  
 the interesting thing is if you want to understand how people talk about smoking
  first you have to understand what they mean when they say smoking 
 and on twitter there are four main categories number one smoking cigarettes  
 number two  smoking marijuana 
 number three  smoking ribs and number four smoking hot women laughter
 so then you have to
  think about well how do people talk about electronic cigarettes and there are so many different ways that people do this and you can see from the slide
 it 's a complex kind of a query  
 and what it reminds us is that language is created by people 
 and people are messy and we 're complex and we use metaphors and slang and jargon and we do this twenty four seven in many many languages and then as soon as we
  figure it out we change it up  so did these
 ads that the cdc put on these television ads that featured a woman with a hole in her throat and that were very graphic and very disturbing 
 did they actually have an impact on whether people quit  
 and the health media collaboratory
  respected the limits of their data  but they were able to conclude that those advertisements and you may have seen them
 that they had the effect of jolting people into a thought process that may have an impact on future behavior  
 and what i admire and appreciate about this project aside from the fact including the fact that it 's
 based on real human need is that it 's a fantastic example of courage in the face of a sea of irrelevance
  and so
 it 's not just big data that causes challenges of interpretation because let 's face it we human beings have a very rich history of taking any amount of data no matter how small and screwing it up 
 so
 many years ago you may remember that former president ronald reagan was very criticized for making a statement that facts are stupid things
 and it was a slip of the tongue let 's be fair he actually meant to quote john adams ' defense of british soldiers in the boston massacre trials that facts are stubborn things  
 but i actually think there 's
 a bit of accidental wisdom in what he said  because facts are stubborn things  
 but sometimes they 're stupid too 
 i want to tell you a personal
  story about why this matters a lot to me i need to take a breath my
 son isaac when he was two was diagnosed with autism  
 and he was this happy  hilarious  loving affectionate little guy  
 but the metrics on his developmental evaluations which looked at things like the number of words at that point
  gestures and minimal eye contact put his developmental level at that of a nine month old baby 
 and the diagnosis was factually correct  but it didn 't tell the whole story  
 and about a year and a half later when he was almost four  i found him in front of the
  i did what any
 obsessed parent would do which is immediately started hitting the back button to see what else he 'd been searching for 
 and they were in order men  school bus
 and computer  
 and i was stunned
  we didn 't know that he could spell much less read and so i asked him isaac how did you do this and he looked at me very seriously and said 
 typed in the box 
 he was teaching himself to communicate  but
 we were looking in the wrong place  and this is what happens when assessments and analytics overvalue one metric in this case verbal
 and undervalue others  such as creative
 communication was hard for isaac  and so he found a workaround to find out what he needed to know 
 and when you think about it it makes a lot of sense because forming a question is a really complex process  
 but he could get himself a lot of the way there by putting a word in a search box
  box  and so this little moment
 had a really profound impact on me
 and our family because it helped us change our frame of reference for what was going on with him  
 and worry a little bit less and appreciate his resourcefulness more 
 facts are stupid things  
 and they 're vulnerable to misuse
  or otherwise i have a friend emily willingham who 's a scientist and she wrote a piece for forbes not long ago
 entitled the ten weirdest things ever linked to autism it 's quite a list  
 the internet  blamed for everything  right  and of course mothers because
  there 's more there 's a whole bunch in the mother category here and you can see it 's a pretty rich and interesting list
  i 'm a big fan of being pregnant near freeways personally 
 the final one is interesting because
 the term refrigerator mother was actually the original hypothesis for the cause of autism and that meant somebody who was cold and unloving 
 and at this point you might be thinking
  okay susan we get it you can take data you can make it mean anything and this is true it 's absolutely true  but
 the challenge is that
 we have this opportunity to try to make meaning out of it ourselves  because frankly 
 data doesn 't create meaning we do 
 so
  businesspeople as consumers as patients as citizens we have a responsibility i think 
 to spend more time focusing on our critical thinking skills  why  because at this point in our history as we 've heard
 many times over we can process exabytes of data at lightning speed and we have the potential to make bad decisions
 far more quickly efficiently and with far greater impact than we did in the past  
 great  right  and so
 what we need to do instead is spend a little bit more time on things like the humanities and sociology  and the social sciences
  because they give us context that is so important for big data and because they help us become better critical thinkers  because after all 
 if
 i can spot a problem in an argument it doesn 't much matter whether it 's expressed in words or in numbers  and this means
 teaching ourselves to find those confirmation biases and false correlations and being able to spot
  naked emotional appeal from thirty yards  
 because something that happens after something doesn 't mean it happened because of it necessarily  and if you 'll let me geek out on you for a second  the romans called this post hoc 
 ergo propter hoc after which therefore because of which 
  because they 're based on assumptions about who we all are based on our gender and our age and where we live as opposed to data on what we actually think and do  
 and since we have this data  we need to treat it with appropriate privacy controls
 and consumer opt in 
 and beyond that we need to be clear about our hypotheses  the methodologies that we use and our confidence in the result
  as my high school algebra teacher used to say  show your math  because
 if i don 't know what steps you took i don 't know what steps you didn 't take  and if i don 't know what questions you asked i don 't know what questions you didn 't ask  
 and it means asking ourselves really the hardest question of all did the data really show us this or does the result make us feel
 more successful
 and more comfortable  so
 the health media  collaboratory at the end of their project they were able to find that eighty seven percent of tweets about those very graphic and disturbing anti smoking ads expressed fear  
 but did they conclude that they actually made people stop smoking no it 's science not magic
 if we are to unlock the power of data 
 we don 't have to go blindly into orwell 's vision of a totalitarian future or huxley 's vision
 of a trivial one or some horrible cocktail of both what we have to do
 is treat critical thinking with respect and be inspired
  by examples like the health media collaboratory and as they say in the superhero movies let 's use our powers for good  thank you
