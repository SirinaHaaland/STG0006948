  sometimes the most important things come in the smallest packages i am going to try to convince you in the fifteen minutes i have 
 that microbes have a lot to say about
 questions such
  and they can tell us more about not only life in our solar system but also maybe beyond and this is why i am tracking them down in the most impossible places
 on earth in extreme environments where conditions are really pushing them to the brink of survival actually sometimes me too when i 'm trying to follow them too close but
 here 's the thing we are the only advanced civilization in the solar system
  but that doesn 't mean that there is no microbial life nearby in fact the planets and moons you see here could host life
 all of them and we know that 
 and it 's a strong possibility  and if we were going to find life on those moons and planets 
 then we would answer questions such as 
 are we alone in the solar system
  we coming from do we have family in the neighborhood is there life beyond our solar system  
 and we can ask all those questions because there has been a revolution
 in our understanding of what a habitable planet is and today a habitable planet is a planet that has a zone where
 water can stay stable but to me
  this is a horizontal definition of habitability because it involves a distance to a star but there is another dimension to habitability and this is a vertical dimension 
 think of it as
 conditions in the subsurface of a planet where you are very far away
 from a sun but you still have water energy nutrients  which for some of them means food and a protection 
 and when you look at the earth  very far away
 from any sunlight  deep in the ocean you have life thriving and it uses only chemistry
 for life processes  so when you think of it
 at that point all walls collapse you have no limitations basically  and if you have been looking at the
  headlines lately then you will see that we have discovered a subsurface ocean on europa on ganymede on enceladus on titan  
 and now we are finding a geyser and hot springs on enceladus our solar system is turning into a giant spa 
 for anybody who has gone to a spa knows how much microbes like that right 
  that point think also about mars there is no life possible at the surface of mars today  but it might still be hiding underground 
 so 
 we have been making progress in our understanding of habitability but we also have been making progress in our understanding of what the signatures of life are on earth 
 and you can have what we call organic
  and these are the bricks of life  and you can have fossils  and you can minerals biominerals which is
 due to the reaction between bacteria and rocks and of course you can have gases in the atmosphere and when you look at those tiny green algae on the right of the slide here 
  they are the direct descendants of those who have been pumping oxygen a billion years ago in the atmosphere of the earth  
  today  
 but as much as our understanding grows of all of these things there is one question we still cannot answer  and this is where are we coming from  
 and you know it 's getting worse because we won 't be able to find the physical evidence
 of where we are coming from on this
  and the reason being is that anything that is older than four billion years is gone all record is gone 
 erased by plate tectonics and erosion 
 this is what i call the earth 's biological horizon beyond this horizon we don 't know where we are coming from 
 so is everything lost well maybe not 
 and we might be able to find evidence of our own origin in the most unlikely place
  possible well clearly at the beginning of the solar system  mars and the earth were bombarded by giant asteroids and comets  
 and there were ejecta from these impacts all over the place earth and mars kept throwing rocks at each other for a very long time  
 pieces of rocks landed on the earth  pieces of the earth landed on mars  so clearly those two planets may have been seeded by the same material
  so yeah maybe granddady is sitting there on the surface and waiting for us  but
 that also means that
 we can go to mars and try to find traces of our own origin mars may hold that secret for us this is why mars is so special to us 
 but for that to happen mars needed to be habitable
 at the time when
 conditions were right
 so
 was mars habitable we have a number of missions telling us exactly the same thing today 
 at the time when life appeared on the earth  
 mars did have an ocean  
 it had volcanoes  it had lakes and it had deltas like the beautiful picture you see here this picture was sent by the curiosity rover only a few weeks ago  it shows the remnants of a delta  and this picture tells us something
 water was abundant and stayed founting at the surface for a very long time this is good news for life life chemistry takes a long time to actually happen  
 so this is extremely good news but does that mean that if we go there life will be easy to find on mars  not necessarily 
 here 's what happened  at the time when life exploded at the surface of the earth  then everything went south for mars
  the atmosphere was stripped away
 by solar winds mars lost its magnetosphere  
 and then cosmic rays and u v bombarded the surface and water escaped to space and went underground  
 so
 if we want to be able to understand if we want to be able to find those traces
 of the signatures of life at the surface of mars
  are there we need to understand what was the impact of each of these events on the preservation of its record only then will we be able
 to know where those signatures are hiding and only then will we be able to send our rover to the right places where we can sample those rocks that may be telling us something really important
  maybe telling us that somewhere independently life has appeared on another planet  
 so to do that it 's easy you only need to go back three point five billion years ago in the past of a planet  
 we just need a time machine  
 easy right well
 actually it is look around you that 's planet earth  this is our time machine  geologists are using it to go back in the
  past of our own planet i am using it a little bit differently 
 i use planet earth to go in very extreme environments where conditions were similar to those of mars at the time when the climate changed and there i 'm trying to understand what happened
 what are the signatures of life what is left how are we going to find it 
 so for one moment now i 'm going to take you with me on a trip into that time machine
  and now what you see here we are at four thousand five hundred meters in the andes  but in fact we are
 less than a billion years after the earth and mars formed 
 the earth and mars will have looked pretty much exactly like that volcanoes everywhere  evaporating lakes everywhere  
 minerals
  and then you see those mounds on the shore of those lakes those are built by the descendants of the first organisms that gave us the first fossil on earth  
 but if we want to understand what 's going on we need to go a little further  
 and the other thing about those sites is that exactly like on mars three and a half billion years ago the climate is changing very fast and water and ice are disappearing
  but we need to go back to that time when everything changed on mars and to do that we need to go higher 
 why is that because when you go higher  
 the atmosphere is getting thinner  it 's getting more unstable the temperature is getting cooler  and you have a lot more u v radiation  basically you are getting to those conditions on mars
 when everything changed  so
 i was not promising anything about
  trip on the time machine you are not going to be sitting in that time machine you have to haul one thousand pounds of equipment to the summit of this 20 000 foot volcano
 in the andes here 
 that 's about six thousand meters  and you also have to sleep on 42 degree slopes and really hope that there won 't be any earthquake that night  
 but when we get to the summit 
 we actually find the lake we came for
 at this altitude this lake is experiencing exactly the same conditions as those on mars three and a half billion years ago  
 and now we have to change our voyage into an inner voyage inside that lake and to do that we have to remove our mountain gear and actually don suits and
  go for it 
 but at the time we enter that lake at the very moment we enter that lake we are stepping back three and a half billion years in the past of another planet  
 and then we are going to get the answer came for 
 life is everywhere  absolutely everywhere everything you see in this picture is a living organism maybe not so the diver  but everything else
  this picture is very deceiving 
 life is abundant in those lakes  
 but like in many places on earth right now and due to climate change there is a huge loss in biodiversity 
 in the samples that we took back home thirty six percent of the bacteria in those lakes were composed of three species 
 and those three species are the ones that have survived so far 
 here 's another lake  right next
  the first one the red color you see here is not due to minerals it 's actually due to the presence of a tiny algae 
 in this region 
 the u v radiation is really nasty anywhere on earth eleven is considered to be extreme  
 during u v storms there the u v index reaches forty three 
 spf thirty is not going to do anything to you over there
  and
 the water is so transparent in those lakes that the algae has nowhere to hide really and so they are developing their own sunscreen and this is the red color you see but they can adapt only so far  
 and then when all the water is gone from the surface microbes have only one solution left  they go underground
  and those microbes the rocks you see in that slide here  
 well they are actually living inside rocks and they are using the protection of the translucence of the rocks to get the good part of the u v and discard the part that could 
 actually damage their dna  and this is why we are taking our rover to train them to search for life on mars in these areas because if there was life on mars three and a half billion 
  years ago  it had to use the same strategy to actually protect itself 
  it is pretty obvious that going to extreme environments is helping us very much
 for the exploration of mars and to prepare missions 
 so far  it has helped us to understand the geology of mars it has helped to understand the past climate of mars and its evolution  
 but also its habitability
  our most recent rover on mars has discovered traces of organics yeah there are organics at the surface of mars and
 it also discovered traces of methane and we don 't know yet if the methane in question is really
 from geology or biology  regardless 
 what we know is that because of the discovery the hypothesis that there is still life present on mars today remains a viable one
  so by now i think i have convinced you
 that mars is very special to us  
 but it would be a mistake to think that mars is the only place in the solar system that is interesting to find potential microbial life
 and the reason is because mars and the earth could have a common root to their
  when you go beyond mars  
 it 's not that easy celestial mechanics is not making it so easy for an exchange of material between planets and so if we were to discover
 life on those planets it would be different from us it would be a different type of life  
 but in the end  it might be just us it might be us and mars  or it can be many trees of life in
  i don 't know the answer yet but i can tell you something no matter what the result is no matter what that magic number is  it is going to give us a standard by 
  which we are going to be able to measure the life potential abundance and diversity beyond our own solar system  
  if somebody tells you that looking for alien microbes is not cool because you cannot have a philosophical conversation with them 
 let me show you why
  and how you can tell them they 're wrong 
 well organic material is going to tell you about environment about complexity and about
  or any information carrier is going to tell you about adaptation about evolution about survival about
 planetary changes and about the transfer of information all together they are telling us
 what started as a microbial pathway 
 and why what started as a microbial pathway sometimes ends up as a civilization or sometimes ends
  up as a dead end 
 look at the solar system  and look at the earth  on earth there are many intelligent species  but only one has achieved
 technology right here in the journey of our own solar system  there is a very very powerful message
 that says here 's how we should look for alien life small and big  so yeah  microbes are
  talking and we are listening  and they are taking us one planet at a time and one moon at a time towards their big brothers out there  
 and they are telling us about diversity they are telling us about abundance of life and they are telling us how this life has survived thus far
 to reach civilization intelligence
