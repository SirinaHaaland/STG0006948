  what is the intersection between technology  art and science  
 curiosity and wonder because it drives us to explore  because we 're surrounded by
  things we can 't see and i love to use film
 to take us on a journey through portals of time and space to make the invisible visible 
 because what that does it expands our horizons it transforms our perception it opens our minds
 and it touches our heart so here are some scenes from my 3d imax film mysteries of the unseen
  there is movement which is too slow for our eyes to detect
  and time lapse makes us discover and broaden our perspective of life  
 we can see how organisms emerge and grow
  how a vine survives
 by creeping from the forest floor to look at the sunlight 
  the grand scale time lapse allows us to see our planet in motion
  we can view not only the vast sweep of nature  but the restless movement of humanity
  each streaking dot represents a passenger plane
  and by turning air traffic data into time lapse imagery  we can see something that 's above us constantly but invisible 
 the vast network of air travel over the united states
  we can do the same thing with ships at sea  
 we can turn data into a time lapse view of a global economy in motion  
 and decades of data
 give us the view of our entire planet as a single organism
 sustained by currents circulating throughout the oceans
  oceans and by clouds swirling through the atmosphere  pulsing with lightning crowned by the aurora borealis
 it may be the ultimate time lapse image 
 the anatomy of earth brought to life 
 at the other extreme there are things that move too fast for
  our eyes but we have technology that can look into that world as well
 with high speed cameras we can do the opposite of time lapse  we can shoot images that are thousands of times faster than our vision
  and we can see how nature 's ingenious devices work and perhaps we can even imitate them
 when a dragonfly flutters by you may not realize
  but it 's the greatest flier in nature  it can hover 
 fly backwards
  even upside down
  and by tracking markers on an insect 's wings  we can visualize the air flow that they produce  nobody knew the secret
  high speed shows that a dragonfly can move all four wings in different directions at the same time 
 and what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places 
  we 're unaware of things that are too small for us to see 
 the electron microscope fires electrons which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times 
 this is the egg of a butterfly  
 and there are unseen creatures living all over your body  
 including mites that spend their entire lives dwelling on your eyelashes  crawling over your skin at night 
 can you guess what this is
 shark skin a
 caterpillar 's mouth
  the eye of a fruit fly
  we think we know most of the animal kingdom  but there may be millions of tiny species waiting to be discovered 
 a spider also has great secrets  
 because spiders ' silk thread is pound for pound stronger than steel
 but completely elastic this journey will take us
  all the way down to the nano world the silk is one hundred times thinner than human hair 
 on there is bacteria  and near that bacteria  ten times smaller  a virus  
 inside of that ten times smaller  three strands of dna
  nearing the limit of our most powerful microscopes  single carbon atoms 
 with the tip of a powerful microscope we can actually move atoms and begin to create amazing nano devices 
 some could one day patrol our body for all kinds of diseases and clean out clogged arteries along the way
 tiny chemical machines of the future
 can one day perhaps repair dna
  we are on the threshold of extraordinary advances  
 born of our drive to unveil the mysteries of life
  so under an endless rain of cosmic dust
  the air is full of pollen micro diamonds and jewels from other planets
 and supernova explosions  people go about their lives
 surrounded by the unseeable 
 knowing that there 's so much around us we can 't see forever changes our understanding of the world  
 and by looking at unseen worlds  we recognize that we exist in the living universe  and this new perspective creates wonder and
  inspires us to become explorers in our own backyards  
 who knows what awaits to be seen and what new wonders will transform our lives we 'll just have to see
