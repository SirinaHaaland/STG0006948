  grew up interacting with the physical objects around us there are an enormous number of them that we
 unlike most of our computing devices these objects are much more fun to use when you talk about objects
  one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing 
 and that is gestures how we manipulate these objects how we use these objects in everyday life 
 we use gestures not only to interact with these objects but we also use them to interact with each other 
 a gesture of namaste maybe to respect someone or maybe in india i don 't need to teach a
  in cricket it comes as a part of our everyday learning  so i am very interested from the beginning how our knowledge
 about everyday objects and gestures and how we use these objects can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world  
 rather than using a keyboard and mouse why can i not use my computer in the same way that i interact in the physical world  
 so i started this exploration
  around eight years back  and it literally started with a mouse on my desk
 rather than using it for my computer  i actually opened it
 most of you might be aware that in those days the mouse used to come with a ball inside and there were two rollers
 that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving and accordingly where the mouse is moving
  i was interested in these two rollers  and i actually wanted more so i borrowed another
 mouse from a friend never returned to him and i now had four rollers 
 interestingly what i did with these rollers is basically  i took them off of these mouses
 and then put them in one line it had some strings and pulleys and some springs what i got is basically a 
  whatever movement i do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that i made around eight years back in two thousand  
 because i was interested in integrating these two worlds  i thought of sticky notes 
 i thought why can i not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world a message written on a sticky note to my mom
  on paper can come to an sms  or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar
 a to do list that automatically syncs with you 
 but you can also search in the digital world  or maybe you can write a query saying what is dr smith 's address and this small system actually prints it out so it actually acts like a paper
  just made out of paper 
 in another exploration i thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions  
 so i implemented this pen that can help designers and architects
 not only think in three dimensions but they can actually draw so that it 's more intuitive to use that way then i thought why not make a google map 
  rather than
 typing a keyword to find something i put my objects on top of it if i put a boarding pass it will show me where the flight gate is a coffee cup
 will show where you can find more coffee  or where you can trash the cup 
 so these were some of the earlier explorations i did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly  
 among all these experiments there was one thing in common i was trying to bring a part of the physical world
 to the digital world
  i was taking some part of the objects or any of the intuitiveness of real life and bringing them to the digital world  
 because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive  
 but then i realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing 
 what we are interested in is information  we want to know about things we want to know about dynamic things going around 
 so i thought
  last year
 in the beginning of the last year i started thinking why can i not take this approach in the reverse way maybe how about i take my digital world
 and paint
 the physical world with that digital information because pixels are actually right now confined in these rectangular devices that fit in our pockets  
  why can i not remove this confine
 and take that to my everyday objects everyday life so that i don 't need to learn the new language for interacting with those pixels  
 so  in order to realize this dream i actually thought of putting a  big size projector on my head i think that 's why this is called a head mounted projector isn 't it  
 i took it very literally and took my bike helmet put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely so now what i can do i can
  the world around me with this digital information 
 but later i realized that i actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels also so i put a small camera over there that acts as a digital eye  
 later we moved to a much better
 consumer oriented pendant version of that that many of you now know as the sixthsense device  
 but the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can carry your
  digital world with you wherever you go you can start using any surface any wall around you as an interface the camera is actually tracking
 all your gestures  whatever you 're doing with your hands it 's understanding that gesture 
 and actually if you see there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it you can start painting on any wall you stop by a wall and start painting on that wall  
  tracking one finger here 
 we are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present
 the camera is actually doing
 just getting all the images is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms
  little bit complex but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use in some sense  
 but i 'm more excited that you can actually take it outside  
 rather than getting your camera out of your pocket you can just do the gesture of taking a photo  and it takes a photo for you thank
 and later i can find 
  and start browsing those photos or maybe ok i want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend so we are looking for an
 an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world 
 and of course if you don 't have any surface you can start using your palm for simple operations here i 'm dialing a phone number just using my hand
 the camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements but interestingly is also able to understand what
  objects you are holding in your hand
 for example in this case the book
 cover is matched with so many thousands or maybe millions of books online  and checking out which book it is once it has that information it finds out more reviews about that or maybe
 new york times has a sound overview on that so you can actually
  famous talk at harvard university this was obama 's
 visit last week to mit and particularly i want to thank two outstanding
 mit pranav mistry so i was seeing the live [ video ] of his talk outside  on just a newspaper your newspaper will show you live
 weather information rather than having it updated you have to check your computer in order to
  'm going back  i can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed because at that particular time i 'm not feeling like opening my iphone and checking out a particular icon  
 and i think this technology will not only change the way yes  it will change the way we interact with people also not only the physical
  the fun part is i 'm going to the boston metro  and playing a pong game inside the train
 on on the ground right 
 laughter and i think the imagination is the only limit of what you can think of when this kind of technology merges with real life  but many of you argue actually that
 all of our work is not only about physical objects  we actually do lots of accounting and paper editing and all those kinds of things  what about that 
 and many of you are excited about the
  to come out in the market  so rather than waiting for that i actually made my own just using a piece of paper so what i did here is
 remove the camera all the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera i removed the microphone from that 
 and then just pinched that like i just made a clip out of the microphone and clipped that to a piece of paper any paper that you found
  around so now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly i 'm touching the paper  but the camera is actually tracking where
 my fingers are moving you can of course watch movies
  the camera is actually understanding how you 're holding the paper and playing a car racing game 
 many of you already must have thought ok you can browse yeah of course you can browse to any any websites or you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper wherever you need it 
 so more interestingly
  i 'm interested in how we can take that
 in a more dynamic way  when i come back to my desk i can just pinch that information back to my desktop so i can use my full size
 computer 
 and why only computers  we can just play with papers paper world is interesting to play with here i 'm taking a part of a document 
 and putting over here a second part from
  and i 'm actually modifying the information that i have over there  
 yeah  and i say  ok this looks nice let me print it out that thing so i now have a print out of that thing so the the workflow is more intuitive the way we used to do it maybe
 twenty years back rather than now switching between these two worlds  so as a last thought  i think that integrating
 information to everyday objects will not
  only help us to get rid of the digital divide the gap between these two worlds  
 but will also help us in some way to stay human
 to be more connected to our physical world 
 and it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines
  this is there a company being planned  or is this research forever or what pranav mistry so there are lots of companies sponsor companies of media lab interested in taking this ahead in one or another way companies like mobile phone operators want to take this in a different way than the ngos in india 
 thinking why can we only have ' sixth sense ' we should have a ' fifth sense ' for missing sense people who cannot speak this technology can be used for them to speak out
 in a different way maybe a speaker system
  plans are you staying at mit or are you going to do something with this pm i 'm trying to make this more available to people so that anyone can develop their own sixthsense device because the hardware is actually not 
  that hard to manufacture or hard to make your own  we will provide all the open source software for them maybe starting next month
  you going to split your your time going forward pm there is a lot of energy here lots of learning all of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in india and now if you see it 's more about the cost effectiveness 
  this system costs you $ three hundred compared to the $ twenty thousand
 surface tables or anything like that  or maybe even the $ two mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $ five thousand 
 i showed that at a conference  to president abdul kalam at that time and then he said ok we should use this in bhabha atomic research centre for some use of that so i 'm excited about how i can bring the technology to the masses rather
  based on the people we 've seen at ted i would say you 're truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now it 's an honor to have you at
