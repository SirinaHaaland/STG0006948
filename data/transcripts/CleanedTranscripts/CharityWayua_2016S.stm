  growing up in kenya  i knew i always wanted to study biochemistry  see i 
 had seen the impact of the high prevalence of diseases like malaria  and i wanted
  to make medicines that would cure the sick  
 so i worked really hard  got a scholarship to the united states where i became a cancer researcher  and i loved it 
 for someone who wants to cure diseases there is no higher calling  
 ten years later  i returned to kenya to do just that 
 a freshly minted phd  ready to take on this horrific illness which in kenya was almost certainly a death sentence
  but instead of landing a job in a pharmaceutical company or a hospital  i found myself drawn to a different kind of lab working with a different kind of patient
 a patient whose illness was so serious it impacted every single person in my country  
 a patient who needed to get healthy fast that patient was my government 
 see many of us will agree that lots of governments are unhealthy today
 and kenya was no exception 
 when i returned to kenya in two thousand and fourteen there was seventeen percent youth unemployment 
 and nairobi the major business hub was rated
  on the quality of living index it was bad 
 now 
 an economy is only as healthy as the entities that make it up 
 so when government one of its most vital entities is weak or unhealthy  everyone and everything suffers 
 sometimes you might put a band aid in place
 to try and temporarily stop the pain  maybe some of you here have participated in a band aid operation to an african country
 setting
  up alternative schools  building hospitals digging wells because governments there either weren 't or couldn 't provide the services to their citizens
  we all know this is a temporary solution there are just some things  band aids can 't fix like
 providing an environment where businesses
  feel secure that they 'll have an equal opportunity to be able to run and start their businesses successfully 
 or there are systems in place that would protect the private property that they create 
 i would argue only government is capable of creating these necessary conditions for economies to thrive 
  economies thrive when business are able to quickly and easily set up shop 
 business owners create new sources of income for themselves new jobs get added into the economy and then
 more taxes are paid to fund public projects new business is good for everyone 
 and it 's such an important measure of economic growth the world bank has a ranking called the ease of doing business ranking which measures how easy or difficult it is to start a business in any given country  
 and as you can imagine 
 starting or running a business in a country with an ailing government
 almost impossible
 the president of kenya knew this which is why in two thousand and fourteen  he came to our lab and asked us to partner with him
 to be able to help kenya to jump start business growth  
 he set an ambitious goal
 he wanted kenya to be ranked top fifty in this world bank ranking in two thousand and fourteen when he came kenya was ranked one hundred and
  one hundred and eighty nine countries  we had our work cut out for us  
 fortunately  he came to the right place we
 're not just a band aid kind of team we
 're a group of computer scientists mathematicians  engineers and a cancer researcher who understood that in order to cure the sickness of a system as big as
  we needed to examine the whole body  
 and then we needed to drill down all the way from the organs into the tissues all the way to single cells so that we could properly make a diagnosis 
 so with our marching orders from the president himself we embarked on the purest of the scientific method  
 collecting data all the data we could get our hands on making hypotheses creating solutions one after the other 
 so we met with hundreds of individuals who worked at government agencies
 from the tax agency the lands office  utilities company the agency that 's responsible for registering companies  
 and with each of them  we observed them as they served customers  we documented their processes
 most of them were manual
  we also just went back and looked at a lot of their previous paperwork to try and really understand to try and diagnose what bodily
  malfunctions had occurred that lead to that 136th spot on the world bank list what did we find well 
 in kenya it was taking seventy two days for a business owner to register their property 
 compared to just one day in new zealand which was ranked second on the world bank list 
  to get a new electric connection in korea it took eighteen days  
 if you wanted to get a construction permit so you could put up a building in kenya it was going to take you one hundred and twenty five days 
 in singapore which is ranked first that would only take you  twenty six days 
  god forbid you had to go to court to get help in being able to settle a dispute to enforce a contract  because that process alone would take you four hundred and
 sixty five days  and if that wasn 't bad enough 
 you would lose forty percent of your claim in just fees legal fees enforcement fees court fees  
 now  i know what you 're thinking  for there to exist such inefficiencies in an
  an african country there must be corruption the very cells that run the show must be corrupt to the bone  
 i thought so too actually 
 when we started out i thought i
 was going to find so much corruption  i was literally going to either die or get killed in the process 
 but when we dug deeper we didn 't find corruption in the classic sense slimy gangsters lurking in the darkness
  waiting to grease the palms of their friends what we found
 was an overwhelming sense of helplessness our government was sick because government employees
 felt helpless  they felt that they were not empowered to drive change  
 and when people feel stuck and and helpless they stop seeing their role in a bigger system
  they start to think the work they do doesn 't matter in driving change  and when that happens things slow down fall through the cracks
 and inefficiencies flourish  now imagine with me if you had a process 
 you had to go through had no other alternative and this process was inefficient  complex and very
  very slow what would you do  
 i think you might start by trying to find somebody to outsource it to so that they can just take care of that for you if that doesn 't work 
 maybe you 'd consider paying somebody to just unofficially take care of it on your behalf especially if you thought nobody was going to catch you
  not out of malice or greed just trying to make sure that you get something to work for you so you can move on 
 unfortunately that is the beginning of corruption  
 and if left to thrive and grow it seeps into the whole system and before you know it the whole body is sick  
 knowing this  we had to start by making sure that every single
  stakeholder we worked with
 had a shared vision for what we wanted to do  
 so we met with everyone from the clerk whose sole job is to remove staples from application packets 
 to the legal drafters at the attorney general 's office 
 to the clerks who are responsible for serving business owners when they came to access government services  
 and with them  we made sure
  were impacting our ability as a country
 to create new jobs and to attract investments no one 's role was too small everyone 's role was vital 
 now guess what we started to see  
 a coalition of government employees who are excited and ready to drive change began to grow and form  
 and together we started to implement changes that impacted the service delivery of
  our country the result in just two years kenya 's ranking moved from one hundred and
 and in recognition of the
 significant reforms we 've been able to implement in such a short time kenya was
  recognized to be among the top three global reformers in the world two years in a row 
 are we fully healthy 
 no we have some serious work still to do  i like to think about these two years like a
  it 's that time after months of hard  grueling work at the gym  
 and then you get your first time to weigh yourself  and you 've lost twenty pounds you 're feeling unstoppable  
 now 
 some of you may think this doesn 't apply to you you 're not from kenya you don 't intend to be an entrepreneur  but think with me for just a moment 
 when is the last
  time you accessed a government service  maybe applied for your driver 's license  tried to
 do your taxes on your own 
 it 's easy in this political and global economy to want to give up when we think about transforming government  
 we can easily resign to the fact or to the thinking that government is too inefficient
 too corrupt unfixable 
 we might even rarely get some key government responsibilities to other sectors to band aid solutions or to just
 give up and feel helpless  but just because a system is sick
 doesn 't mean it 's dying  we cannot afford
 to give up when it comes to the challenges of fixing our governments
  in the end what really makes a government healthy is when healthy cells that 's you and i
 get to the ground  roll up our sleeves  refuse to be helpless
 and believe that sometimes all it takes is for us to create some space for healthy cells to grow and thrive
