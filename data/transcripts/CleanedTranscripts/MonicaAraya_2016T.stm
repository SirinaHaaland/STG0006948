  how do we build a society
 without fossil fuels 
 this is a very complex challenge  and i believe developing countries could take the lead in this transition  
 and i 'm aware that this is a contentious statement
 but the reality is that so much is at stake in our countries
 if we let fossil fuels stay at the center
 of our development we can do it differently 
 and it 's time it really is time to debunk the myth
 that a country has to choose between development on the one hand
 and environmental protection renewables  quality of life on the other 
 i come from costa rica a developing country  we are nearly five million people  
 and we live right in the middle of the americas so it 's very easy to remember where we live 
  we did not use any fossil fuels in order to generate all our electricity  it 's a fantastic
 achievement  and yet  it hides a paradox  
 which is that nearly seventy
  because of our transportation system  which is totally dependent on fossil fuels  like it is in most countries  
 so if we think of the energy transition as a marathon the question is how do we get to the finish line 
  the rest of the economy and it 's fair to say that if we don 't succeed it 's difficult to see who will so that is why i want to talk to you about costa rica  
 because i believe we are a great candidate in pioneering a vision for development without fossil fuels
  if you know one thing about our country it 's that we don 't have an army so i 'm going to take you back to
 that year the country was coming out of civil war  
 thousands of costa ricans had died  and families were bitterly split  
 and yet a surprising idea won the hearts and minds  we would reboot the country
  and that second republic would have no army  so we abolished it and the president at the time
 found a powerful way by smashing the walls of an army base  
 the following year one thousand nine hundred and forty nine we made that decision permanent in the new constitution  
 and that is why i can tell you that story nearly seventy years later 
  grateful i 'm grateful they made that decision before i was born  
 because it allowed me and millions of others to live in a very stable country  
 and you might be thinking that it was good luck
  health care we called that social guarantees by abolishing the army  we were able to turn military spending
 into social spending  and that was a driver of stability 
 in the ' 50s 
  we started investing in hydropower  
 and that kept us away from the trap of using fossil fuels for electricity generation which is what the world is struggling with today 
 in the ' 70s we invested in national parks  and that kept us away
 from the deeply flawed logic of growth growth growth at any cost that you see others embracing especially in the developing world in the
  for ecosystem services  and that helped us reverse deforestation and boosted ecotourism which today is a key engine of growth  
 so investing in environmental protection did not hurt our economy quite the opposite  and it doesn 't mean we are perfect  
 and it doesn 't mean we don 't have contradictions that 's not the point 
 the point is that by making our own choices
  able to develop resilience in dealing with development problems  
 also  if you take a country like ours  the gdp per capita is around eleven thousand dollars  
 depending on how you measure it  
 but according to the social progress index we are an absolute outlier when it comes to turning gdp into social progress abolishing the
  army  investing in nature and people did something
 very powerful too it shaped the narrative  
 the narrative of a small country with big ideas and it was very empowering to grow up with that narrative  
 so the question is what is the next big idea for this generation  and i believe what
  comes next is for this generation
 to let go of fossil fuels for good 
 just as we did with the army  
 fossil fuels create climate change  we know that  and we know how vulnerable we are to the impacts of climate change  
 so as a developing country it is in our best interest
 to build development without fossil fuels that harm
  people in the first place  
 because why would we continue importing oil
 for transportation if we can use electricity instead remember this is the country where
  abolishing fossil fuels means disrupting
 our transportation system
 so that we can power our cars buses and trains with electricity instead of dirty energy 
 and transportation let me tell you
  become an existential issue for us costa ricans because the model we have is not working for us it 's hurting people it
 's hurting companies and it 's hurting our health  because when policies and infrastructure fail  
 this is what happens on a daily basis 
 two hours in the morning two hours in the evening
  i don 't understand why we have to accept this as normal  it 's offensive
 to have to waste our time like this every single day  
 and this highway is actually quite good compared to what you see in other countries where traffic is exploding you know costa ricans call this
 are turning violent
 in a country that is otherwise happy in pura vida  
 it 's happening  so a lot is at stake  the good news
 is that when we talk about clean transportation and different mobility we 're not talking about some
  we 're talking about electric mobility that is happening today by 
 electric cars
 and conventional cars are expected to cost the same 
 and cities are already trying electric buses and these really cool creatures
 are saving money  and they reduce pollution  so if we want to get rid of
 oil based transportation we can because we have options now that we didn 't have before it 's really exciting  
 but of course some get very uncomfortable
 with this idea and they will come
 and they will tell you that the world is stuck with oil
  and so is costa rica so get real that 's what they tell you  and you know what the answer to that argument is that in one thousand nine hundred and forty eight we didn 't say the world is stuck with armies so let 's keep our army too no 
 we made a very brave choice  
 and that choice made the whole difference 
 so it 's time for this generation
 to be brave again
 and abolish fossil fuels for good  and i 'll give you three reasons why we have to do this first
  our model of transportation and urbanization is broken so this is the best moment to redefine our urban and mobility future 
 we don 't want cities that are built for cars we want cities for people
 where we can walk and we can use bikes  and we want public
  lots of it public transportation that is clean and dignifying  
 because if we continue adding fleets of conventional cars 
 our cities will become unbearable 
 second we have to change  but incremental change is not going to be sufficient
  we need transformational change  and there are some incremental projects in my country and i am the first one to celebrate them
 but let 's not kid ourselves we
 're not talking about ending up with really beautiful electric cars here and a few electric buses there
 while we keep investing in the same kind of infrastructure more cars more roads more oil  
 we 're talking about breaking free from oil  
  and you know this one 
 the world is hungry for inspiration 
 it craves stories of success in dealing with complex issues especially
 in developing countries  so i believe costa rica can be an inspiration to others as we did last year
 when we disclosed that for so many days we were not using any fossil fuels in order to
 generate all our electricity the news went viral
 around the world  also and this makes me extremely proud a costa rican woman 
  played a decisive role
 in the negotiations of the paris climate agreement  
 so we have to protect that legacy and be an example  so what comes next 
 the people how do we get people to own this how do we get people
 to believe that it 's possible to build a society without fossil fuels
 a lot of work from the ground up is needed that is why in two thousand and fourteen we created costa rica 
 because we want to empower and we want to inspire citizens if citizens don 't get
  clean transportation decisions will be bogged down by endless  and i mean endless  technical discussions and by avalanches
 of lobbying by various established interests 
 wanting to be a green country
 powered by renewables is already part of our story  we should not let anybody take that away from us 
 last year
 we brought people from our seven provinces to talk about climate change in terms that matter to them  
 and we also brought this year
 another group of costa ricans to talk about renewable energy and you know what these people disagree on almost everything except
 on renewable energy and clean transportation and clean air  it brings people together
 and the key to real participation is to help people not to feel small people feel powerless  and they are tired of not being heard  
 so what we do is concrete things  and we translate technical issues into citizen language
 to show that citizens have a role to play and can play it together for the first time we 're tracking the promises
  that were made on clean transportation and politicos know that they have to deliver it  but the tipping point will come when we form coalitions
 citizens companies  champions of public transportation that will make electric mobility the new normal  especially in a developing country  
 by the time the next election comes i believe every candidate
  will have to disclose where they stand on the abolition of fossil fuels  because this question has to enter our mainstream politics  
 and i 'm telling you this is not a question of climate policy or environmental agenda  
 it 's about the country that we want
 and the cities that we have
  and the cities that we want and who makes that choice  because at the end of the day what we have to show
 is that development with renewable energy is good for the people 
 for costa ricans that are alive today and especially for those who haven 't been born 
 this is our national museum today it
 's bright and peaceful and when you stand up in front of it it 's really hard
  to believe these were military barracks at the end of the ' 40s we started a new life without an army in this place  
 and here is where
 our abolition of fossil fuels will be announced one day  and we will make history again thank you
