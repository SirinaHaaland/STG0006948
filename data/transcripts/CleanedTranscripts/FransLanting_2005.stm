  nature 's my muse
 and it 's been my passion as a photographer for national geographic i 've portrayed it for many 
 but five years ago  i went on a personal journey
 i wanted to visualize the story of life it
 's the hardest thing i 've ever attempted  and there have been plenty of times when i felt like backing out 
 but there were also revelations  and one of those i 'd like to share with you today  
 i went down to a remote lagoon in australia  hoping to see the earth
  the way it was three billion years ago  back before the sky turned blue 
 there 's stromatolites down there the first living things to capture photosynthesis
 and it 's the only place they still occur today  going down there was like entering a time capsule
  i came out with a different sense of myself in time 
 the oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites is what we all breathe today  
 stromatolites are the heroes in my story i hope it 's a story that has some resonance for our time
  and me nature and science and with that said i 'd like to invite you for
 a short brief journey of life through time
  where matter condenses into spheres over time  
 solidifying into surface  molded by fire
  fire gave way earth emerged
 but this was an alien planet 
 the moon was closer things were different  
 heat from within made geysers erupt
 that is how
  the oceans were born 
 water froze around the poles
 and shaped the edges of the earth 
 water is the key to life but in frozen form
  it is a latent force  
 and when it vanishes 
 earth becomes mars  
 but this planet is different it 's roiling inside and where
 that energy touches water something new
  emerges life 
 it arises around cracks in the earth  
 mud and minerals become substrate  there are bacteria 
 learn to multiply  
  growing living structures under an alien sky 
 stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen and they
 changed the atmosphere a breath that 's fossilized now as iron
 meteorites delivered chemistry and perhaps membranes too 
 life needs a membrane to contain itself
 so it can replicate
 and mutate
  with skeletons of silicon 
 circuit boards of the future  
 shallow seas nurtured life early on 
 and that 's where it morphed
 into more complex forms
 it grew as light and oxygen increased  
 life hardened and became defensive  
 it learned to move
 and began to see the first eyes
  grew on trilobites  
 vision was refined in horseshoe crabs 
 among the first to leave the sea  
 they still do what they 've done for ages  their enemies long gone
  out of the sea  slugs became snails  fish tried amphibian life 
 frogs adapted to deserts  
 lichens arose as a co op fungi married algae  
  true land plants arose  leafless at first
  once they learn how to stay upright they grew in size and shape 
 the fundamental forms of ferns followed
  bear spores that foreshadowed seeds  life flourished in swamps 
 on land life turned a corner  
 jaws formed first  teeth came later  leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era
  it took time for life to break away from water 
 and it still beckons all the time  
 life turned hard so it could venture inland  
 and the dragons that arose are still
 still among us today
 jurassic park still shimmers in part of madagascar
 and the center of brazil where
 plants called
 forests arose and nurtured things with wings 
 one early form left an imprint like it died only yesterday  
 and others fly today like echoes of the
 in birds life gained new mobility 
 flamingos covered continents 
 migrations got underway
  birds witnessed the emergence of flowering plants 
 water lilies were among the first 
 plants began to diversify and grew turning into trees
  in australia  a lily turned into a grass tree
 and in hawaii  a daisy became a silver sword 
 in africa  gondwana
  but when that ancient continent broke up 
 life got lusher tropical rainforests arose  
 sparking new layers of interdependence fungi multiplied
  a trick shared by the largest flower on earth 
 co evolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever 
  can 't fly
 they become vulnerable  kiwis are and
 so are these hawks trapped near antarctica  
 extinction can come slowly  
 but sometimes
 it arrives fast an asteroid hits and the world went down in flames  but there were
  witnesses  survivors in the dark  
 when the skies cleared a new world was born 
 a world fit for mammals 
  accustomed to the dark new forms became
 bats civets 
 new predators hyenas 
 getting faster and faster still 
 grasslands created opportunities
 safety came with sharpened senses  
 growing big was another answer but
 size always comes at a price  
 some mammals turned back to water
 walruses adapted with layers of fat sea lions got sleek
  and cetaceans moved into a world without bounds
 there are many
  roo hops in oz 
 a horse runs in asia and
 a wolf evolves stilt legs in brazil  
 primates emerge from
  becoming lemurs not much later  
 learning became reinforced bands of apes ventured into the open
 and forests dried out once more 
 going upright
  so who are we brothers of masculine chimps  
 sisters of feminine bonobos we are all of them and more we
 're molded by the same life force 
 the blood veins in our hands
 echoed a course of water traces on the earth and
 our brains our celebrated brains reflect a drainage of
