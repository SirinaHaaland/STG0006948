  me just start with my story  so i tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college 
 then i went on to tear my acl the ligament in my knee  and then developed an arthritic knee and i 'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story and
 by the way i married a
  who has exactly the same story  so this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon
 and to see if i couldn 't focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me 
 so with that let me just show you a quick video
 to get you in the mood of what we 're trying to explain narrator we are all aware of the risk of cancer but there 's another disease that 's destined to affect even more of us
  arthritis  cancer may kill you but when you look at the numbers arthritis ruins more lives  
 assuming you live a long life there 's a fifty percent chance you 'll develop arthritis and it 's not just aging that causes arthritis  common injuries can lead to decades of pain  until our joints quite literally grind to a halt  
 desperate for a solution we 've turned to
  to design artificial components to replace our worn out body parts  
 but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body  shouldn 't we stop and ask if there 's a better more natural way 
 let 's consider an alternative path 
 what if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature  or within our own stem cells  this is the field of biologic replacements where we replace
  and so the mission is how do i treat these things biologically and let 's talk about both what i did for my wife and what i 've done for hundreds of other patients
 first thing for my wife and the most common thing i hear from my patients particularly in the 40 to 80 year old age group 70 year old age group is they come in and say hey doc isn 't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee i 'm not ready for joint replacement 
 and so for her i put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that
  unstable ligament we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee  
 and then for the damaged arthritis on the surface we did a stem cell paste graft which we designed in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one to regrow that articular cartilage surface and give it back a smooth surface there  
 so here 's my wife 's bad knee on the left and her just hiking now four months later in aspen and doing well
  and it works not just for my wife but certainly for other patients the girl on the video jen hudak just won the superpipe in aspen
 just nine months after having destroyed her knee as you see in the other image and having a paste graft to that knee  and so we can regrow these surfaces biologically  
 so with all this success
  why isn 't that good enough you might ask 
 well the reason is because there 's not enough donor cycles there 's not enough young healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us  
 and the tissue 's very expensive  and so that 's not going to be a solution that 's going to get us global with biologic tissue  
 but the solution is animal tissue because it 's plentiful it 's
  you can get it from young healthy tissues 
 but the barrier is immunology and the specific barrier is a specific epitope called the galactosyl or gal epitope so if we 're going to transplant animal tissues to people we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope  
 so my story in working with animal tissues starts in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four and i started first with cow achilles tendon  where we would take the cow achilles tendon  which is type i collagen strip it of its antigens
  by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template 
 we would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patient 's knee  
 we 've now done that procedure and it 's been done worldwide in over four thousand cases
  the tissue  but what happens for your ligament when i need an intact ligament i can 't grind it up in a blender  
 so in that case i have to design and we designed with uri galili and tom turek an enzyme wash to wash away or strip those galactosyl 
 epitopes with a specific enzyme and we call that a gal stripping technique what we do is humanize the tissue
 's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it and then we can put it back into a patient 's knee 
 and we 've done that now we 've taken pig ligament young healthy big tissue put it into ten patients in an fda approved trial and then one of our patients went on to have three canadian masters downhill
  he calls it so we know it can work and there 's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending  
 so what about the next step what about getting to a total biologic knee replacement not just the parts how are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement  well here 's how we 're going to do it  
 so what we 're going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young healthy pig 
 strip it of its antigens load it with your stem cells
 then put it back on to that arthritic surface in your knee  tack it on there have you heal that surface
 and then create a new biologic surface for your knee  
 so that 's our biologic approach right now we 're going to rebuild your knee with the parts
 we 're going to resurface it with a completely new surface 
 but we have other advantages from the animal kingdom there 's a benefit of four hundred million years of ambulation  we can harness those benefits  we can use thicker 
 younger better tissues than you might have injured in your knee or that you might have when you 're forty fifty or sixty 
  super biologics it 's not hardware 
 it 's not software it 's bioware it 's version two point zero of you 
 and so with that coming to a 
 coming to an operating theater near you soon i believe  thank you very much
