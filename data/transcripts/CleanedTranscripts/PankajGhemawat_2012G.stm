  i 'm here to talk to you about
 how globalized we are how globalized we aren 't and why it 's important to actually be accurate in making those kinds of
  the leading point of view on this whether measured by number of books sold mentions in media  or surveys that i 've run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the world trade organization 
 is this view that national borders really don 't matter very much anymore
 cross border integration is close to complete and we live in one world and what 's interesting
  about this view is again it 's a view that 's held by 
 like tom friedman from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted  but it 's also held by 
 who see this giant globalization tsunami that 's about to wreck all our lives if it hasn 't already
 done so 
 the other thing i would add is that this is not a new view  
 i 'm a little bit of an amateur historian  so i 've spent some time going back trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing 
 and the best earliest quote that i could find
 was one from david livingstone writing in the
 about how the
  the steam ship  and the telegraph were integrating east africa perfectly
 with the rest of the world  
 now clearly  david livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time
  but it does seem useful to ask ourselves just how global are we before we think about where we go from here  
 so the best way
 i 've found
 of trying to get people to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat  may not even be close to flat 
 is with some data  so one of the things i 've been doing over the last few years
 is really compiling data on things that could either happen within national borders or across national borders  
 and i 've looked at the
  as a percentage of the total 
 i 'm not going to present all the data that i have here today  but let me just give you a few data points  i 'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow 
 one kind of flow of people one kind of flow of capital and of course trade in products and services  
 so let 's start
  in the world last year what percentage do you think
 were accounted for by cross border phone calls pick a percentage in your own mind the
 answer turns out to be two percent  
 if you include internet telephony you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent
  but it 's nowhere near what people tend to estimate  
 or let 's turn to people moving across borders 
 one particular thing we might look at in terms of long term flows of people 
 is what percentage of the world 's population is accounted for by
 turns out to be a little bit higher it 's actually about three percent  
 or think of investment take all the real investment that went on in the world in two thousand and ten 
 what percentage of that
 was accounted for by foreign direct investment
  and then finally  the one statistic that i suspect many of the people in this room have seen the 
  ratio if you look at the official statistics they typically indicate a little bit above thirty percent  
 however  there 's a big problem with the official statistics
  in that if for instance a japanese component supplier ships something to china to be put into an ipod and then the ipod gets shipped 
  to the u s that component ends up getting counted multiple times 
 what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of gdp  without the 
 and it 's actually probably a bit under twenty percent  rather than the thirty percent plus numbers that we 're talking about 
 so it 's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that i talk about in my book
  point zero that we 're very very far from the 
 effect benchmark  which would imply internationalization levels of the order of
 who are prone to this kind of overstatement i 've also spent some time surveying audiences in different parts of the world
 on what they actually guess these numbers to be 
 let me share with you the results of a survey that harvard business review was kind enough to run of its readership
 as to what people 's guesses along these dimensions
 actually were 
 so a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide  
 first of all there is a suggestion of some error okay 
 second these are pretty large errors for four quantities whose average value is less than ten percent
  people guessing three four times that level even though i 'm an economist i find that a pretty large error  
 and third 
 this is not just confined to the readers of the harvard business review 
 i 've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world 
 and in all cases except one where a group actually underestimated
  ratio people have this tendency towards overestimation 
 and so i thought it important to give a name to this and that 's what i refer to as globaloney  
 the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars  
 especially because i
 i suspect some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims i think it 's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to globaloney a
 couple of different reasons come to mind  
 first of all there 's a real dearth of data in the debate let me give you an example  
 when i first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called foreign policy 
 one of the people who wrote
  in not entirely in agreement was tom friedman  
 and since my article was titled why the world isn 't flat that wasn 't too surprising 
 what was very surprising to me was tom 's critique  
 which was ghemawat 's data are narrow 
 and this caused me to scratch my head because as i went back through his
  book  i couldn 't find a single figure  chart table  reference or footnote  
 so my point is i haven 't presented a lot of data here to convince you that i 'm right 
 but i would urge you to go away and look for your own data to try and actually assess whether some of
  insights that we 've been bombarded with actually are correct  
 so dearth of data in the debate is one reason a second reason has to do with peer pressure  
 i remember  i decided to write my why the world isn 't flat article because i was being interviewed on tv in mumbai  
 and the interviewer 's first question to me was
  professor ghemawat 
 why do you still believe that the world is round 
 and i started laughing  because i hadn 't come across that formulation before 
 laughter and as i was laughing i was thinking i really need a more coherent response especially on national tv i 'd better write something about
  but what i can 't quite capture for you
 was the pity and disbelief
 with which the interviewer asked her question  
 the perspective was here is this poor professor  
 he 's clearly been in a cave for the last twenty thousand years  he really has no idea as to what 's actually going on in the world 
 so try this out with your friends and acquaintances if you like
  that it 's very cool to talk about the world being one etc  
 if you raise questions about that formulation you really are considered a bit of an antique  
 and then the final reason which i mention especially to a ted audience with some trepidation has to
  if you listen to techno music for long periods of time it does things to your brainwave activity 
 something similar seems to happen with exaggerated conceptions of how technology is going to overpower in the very immediate run
 all cultural barriers  all political
  all geographic barriers  
 because at this point i know you aren 't allowed to ask me questions  but when i get to this point in my lecture with my students hands go up 
 and people ask me yeah  but what about facebook 
 and i got this question often enough that i thought i 'd better do some research on facebook  
 because in some sense it 's the ideal kind of technology to think about 
 theoretically it makes it as easy to
  form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door what percentage of people 's friends
 on facebook are actually located in countries other than where people we 're analyzing are based  
 the answer is probably
  so we don 't live in an entirely local or national world but very very far from the ninety five percent level that you would expect  
 and the reason 's very simple we don 't  or i hope we don 't  form friendships at random
 on facebook
  and those relationships are what the technology doesn 't quite displace those relationships are why we get far fewer than ninety five percent of our friends being located in countries other than where we are  
 so
 does all this matter or is globaloney just
  a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to 
  issues  i want to suggest that actually globaloney can be very harmful to your health 
 first of all recognizing that the glass is only ten to twenty percent full
 is critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional
  whereas if we thought we were already there 
 there would be no particular point to pushing harder it 's a little bit like we wouldn 't be having a conference on radical openness if we already thought we 
  were totally open to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about at this conference  
  room
 for something more something that would contribute further to global welfare which brings me to my second point 
 avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization 
 so i actually spend most of my
  three point zero book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have
 that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate 
 i 'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today  so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what i have
  think of france and the current debate about immigration
  when you ask people in france what percentage of the french population is immigrants  the answer is about twenty four percent  that 's their guess 
 maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent
 might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue or to take an even
  more striking example  when the chicago council on foreign relations did a survey of americans asking them to guess what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid  
 the guess was thirty percent  which is
 slightly in excess of the actual level
  thing about this particular survey was when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data 
 some of them not all of them seemed to become more willing to consider increases in foreign aid  
 so foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up
  if you think about it what i 've been talking about today is this notion very uncontroversial amongst economists that most things are very 
 foreign aid is the most aid to poor people 
 is about the most home biased thing you can find if you look at the oecd countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person 
 and compare it with how much they spend
 per poor person in
  poor countries 
 the ratio branko milanovic at the world bank did the calculations turns out to be about thirty thousand to one  
 now of course some of us if we truly are cosmopolitan would like to see that ratio being brought down
  like to make the suggestion that we don 't need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are 
 if we simply brought that ratio down to fifteen thousand to one 
 we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the rio summit twenty years ago
 that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on
