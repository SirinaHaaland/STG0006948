  we need to change the culture in our jails
 and prisons especially for young inmates new york state is one of only two in the u s that automatically arrests and tries 
  as adults 
 this culture of violence takes these young people and puts them in a hostile environment and the correctional officers pretty much allow any and everything to go on there
 's not really much for these young people to do to actually enhance their talent and actually rehabilitate them 
 until we can raise the age of criminal responsibility to eighteen  we need to focus on changing the daily lives of these young people  
 i know firsthand  before i ever turned eighteen i spent approximately
 four hundred days on rikers island and to add to that i spent almost three hundred days in solitary confinement  and let me tell you this  
 screaming at the top of your lungs all day on your cell door or screaming at the top of your lungs out the window it gets tiring  
 since there 's not much for you to do while you
  start pacing back and forth in your cell you start talking to yourself your thoughts start running wild 
  become your own worst enemy  
 jails are actually supposed to rehabilitate a person not cause him or her to become more angry frustrated  and feel more hopeless 
 since there 's not a discharge plan put in place for these young people they pretty much reenter
  's not really much for them to do to keep them from recidivating 
 but it all starts with the  c o s it
 's very easy for some people to look at these correctional officers as the good guys and the inmates as the bad guys or vice versa for some  
 but it 's a little more than that 
 see these  c o s are normal everyday people  they come from the same
  they 're just normal people they 're not robots  and there 's nothing special about them 
 they do pretty much everything anybody else in society does 
 the male c o s want to talk and flirt with the female   c o s they play the little high school kid games with each other 
 they politic with one another and the female c o s
 gossip to each other
  of time with numerous amounts of c o s and let me tell you about this one in particular named monroe 
 one day he pulled me in between the a and b doors which separate the north and south sides of our housing unit 
 he pulled me there because i had a physical altercation with another young man in my housing unit  and he felt  since there was a female officer working on the floor that i
  so he punched me in my chest  he kind of knocked the wind out of me 
 i wasn 't impulsive  i didn 't react right away  because i know this is their house i have no wins all he has to do
 is pull his pin and backup will come immediately  so i just gave him a look in his eyes
 and i guess he saw the anger and frustration just burning
  your eyes are going to get you in a lot of trouble 
 because you 're looking like you want to fight so he commenced to taking off his utility belt he took off his shirt and his badge and he said we could fight 
 so i asked him you gonna hold 
  a term that 's commonly used on rikers island meaning that you 're not going to say anything to anybody and you 're not going to report it he
  gonna hold it down  you gonna hold it down i didn 't even respond  i just punched him right in his face and we began fighting right then and there 
 towards the end of the fight
  he slammed me up against the wall  so while we were tussled up he said to me 
 you good as if he got the best of me but in my mind i know i got the best of him  
 so i replied very cocky
  my hand  said he gave me my respect  gave me a cigarette and sent me on my way  believe it 
 you come across some c o s on rikers island that 'll fight you one on one 
 they feel that they understand how it is and they feel that i 'm going to meet you where you 're at since this is how you commonly handle your disputes
  i walk away from it like a man  you walk away from it like a man and that 's it 
 some  c o s feel that they 're jailing with you this is why they have that mentality and that attitude and they go by that concept 
 in some instances we 're in it together with the c o s 
 however  institutions need to give these correctional officers proper trainings on how to properly deal with the adolescent population  and they also
  need to give them proper trainings on how to deal with the mental health population as well 
 these  c o s play a big factor in these young people 's lives for x amount of time until a disposition is reached on their case 
 so why not try to mentor these young people while they 're there
 why not try to give them some type of insight to make a change so once
 they reenter back into society  they 're doing something positive 
 a second big thing
  to help our teens in jails is better programming  when i was on rikers island the huge thing was solitary confinement 
 solitary confinement was originally designed to break a person mentally physically and emotionally  
 that 's what it was designed for 
 the u s attorney general recently released a report stating that they 're going to ban solitary confinement in new york state for teens
  one thing that kept me sane while i was in solitary confinement was reading  i tried to educate myself as much as possible  i read any and everything i could get my hands on and aside from that i wrote music and short stories 
 some programs that i feel would benefit our young people are
 art therapy programs for the kids that like to draw and have that
  and what about the young individuals that are musically inclined how about a music program for them that actually teaches them
 how to write and make music just a thought when adolescents come to rikers island
 is the building that they 're housed in that 's nicknamed gladiator school
  because you have a young individual coming in from the street thinking that they 're tough 
 being surrounded by a bunch of other young individuals from all of the five boroughs and everybody feels that they 're tough 
 so now you have a bunch of young gentlemen poking their chests out
 feeling that i have to prove i 'm equally as tough as you or i 'm tougher than you you and you 
 but let 's be honest  that culture is very dangerous and damaging
 to our young people we need to help institutions
  these teens realize
 that they don 't have to lead the previous lifestyle that they led when they were on the street that they can actually make a change it
 's sad to report that while i was in prison  i used to hear dudes talking about when they get released from prison  
 what type of crimes they 're going to commit when they get back in the street
  man over here got this connection for the low price let 's exchange information and when we hit the town we 're going to do it real big i used to hear these conversations and think 
 these dudes are really talking about going back in the street and committing future crimes so i came up with a name for
  but i will tell you this  being in jail and being in prison i came across some of the most intelligent  
  and talented people that i would ever meet i 've seen individuals take a potato chip bag and turn it into the most beautiful picture frame  
 i 've seen individuals take the state soap that 's provided for free and turn them into the most beautiful sculptures that would make michelangelo look like a kindergartner made it 
 at the age of twenty one i was in a  maximum security prison called elmira correctional facility  i just came out of the weight shack from working
  and i saw an older gentleman that i knew standing in the middle of the yard just looking up at the sky mind you this older gentlemen was serving a 
  sentence in which he already had served twenty years of that sentence so i walk up to him and i said
  you know please let me know if you do then let me get some lottery numbers
  picture young blood  that plane with those people is going somewhere while we 're here stuck 
 the big picture is this that plane with those people going somewhere  that 's life passing us by while we behind these walls stuck 
 ever since that day that sparked something in my mind and made me know i had to make a change  growing up
  i was always a good smart kid some people would say i was a 
 little too smart for my own good i
 had dreams of becoming an architect
 or an archaeologist  currently i 'm working at the fortune society which is a reentry program and i work with people as a case manager
 that are at high
  risk for recidivism  so i connect them with the services that they need once they 're released from jail and prison
 so they can make a positive transition back into society  
 if i was to see my 15 year old self today  i would sit down and talk to him and try to educate him and i would let him know listen this is me i 'm
 you this is us  we are one 
 everything that you 're about to do i know what you 're gonna do before you do it because i already did it and i would encourage him not to hang out with x
 i would tell him not to be in 
 i would tell him  keep your behind in school man because that 's where you need to be because that 's what 's going to get you somewhere in life 
 this is the message that we should be sharing with our young men and young women we shouldn 't be treating them as adults and putting them in cultures of violence that are nearly impossible for them to
