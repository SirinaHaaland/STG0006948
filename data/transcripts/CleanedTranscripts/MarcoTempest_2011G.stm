  the type of magic i like and i 'm a magician is magic that uses technology to create illusions 
 so i would like to show you something i 've been working on it 's an application that i think will be useful for artists multimedia artists in particular 
 it synchronizes videos across multiple
  screens of mobile devices i borrowed these three ipods from people here in the audience to show you what i mean 
 and i 'm going to use them to tell you a little bit about my favorite subject 
 deception 
  one of my favorite magicians
 is karl germain he had this wonderful trick where a rosebush would bloom
 right in front of your eyes but it was his production of a butterfly
 that was the most beautiful
  deception he said this announcer 
 magic is the only honest profession a magician promises to deceive you
 and he does mt i like to think of myself as an honest magician i use a lot of tricks  which means that sometimes
 i have to lie
  it 's just what i 've always wanted
  now polls show that men tell twice as many lies as women
 assuming the women they asked told the truth we deceive to gain advantage
 and to hide our weaknesses the chinese general sun tzu said that all war was based on deception
 said the same thing of romance  some people deceive
 for money  let 's play a game 
 three cards three chances announcer 
 one five will get you ten ten will get you twenty now where 's the lady  where is the queen mt 
 this one sorry you lose
 i didn 't deceive you you deceived yourself
 yourself self deception that 's when we convince ourselves that a lie is the truth  sometimes it 's hard to tell
 forget the times they lose the brain is very good at forgetting bad experiences are quickly forgotten 
 bad experiences
 quickly disappear which is why in this vast and lonely cosmos we are so
 wonderfully optimistic
  a positive illusion
 why movies are able to take us onto extraordinary adventures 
 why we believe romeo when he says he loves juliet  and why single notes of music  
 when played together
  become a sonata and conjure up meaning 
 that 's clair de lune its composer called debussy said that
  was the greatest deception of all  art
 is a deception that creates real emotions a lie that
 creates a truth  and when you give yourself over to that deception
