  in the yale alumni magazine
 told the story of clyde murphy a black man who was a member of the class of one thousand nine hundred and seventy 
 clyde was a success story 
 after yale and a law
  degree from columbia  clyde spent the next thirty years as one of america 's top civil rights lawyers 
 he was also a great husband and father  
 but despite his success personally and professionally  clyde 's story had a sad ending
  clyde died from a blood clot in his lung  
 clyde 's experience was not unique  
 many of his black classmates from yale also died young  
 in fact the magazine article indicated
  after graduation from yale 
 the black members of the class of one thousand nine hundred and seventy had a death rate that was three times higher than that of the average class member it
 's stunning america has recently awakened
 to a steady drumbeat of unarmed black men being shot by the police  what is even
 a bigger story
 is that every seven minutes a black person dies prematurely in the united states 
 that is over two hundred black people
 die every single day who would not die if the health of blacks and whites were equal
  for the last twenty five years  
 i have been on a mission to understand why does race matter so profoundly for health 
 when i started my career  many believed that it was simply about racial differences in income and education 
 i discovered
 that while economic status matters for health
  health  
 there is more to the story so for example if we look at life expectancy at age twenty five 
 at age  twenty five there 's a five year gap between blacks and whites 
 and the gap by education for both whites and blacks is even larger
 than the racial gap at the same time at every level
  of education whites live longer than blacks 
 so whites who are high school dropouts live three point four years longer than their black counterparts and the gap is even larger
 among college graduates 
 most surprising of all whites who have graduated from high school live longer
 than blacks
  a college degree or more education so why does race matter so profoundly for health what else is it
 beyond education and income that might matter in the early 
 i was asked to review a new book on the health of black america  i was struck that almost
  every single one of its twenty five chapters
 said that racism was a factor that was hurting the health of blacks all of these researchers
 were stating that racism was a factor adversely impacting blacks  
 but they provided no evidence for me that was not good enough 
 a few months later
  i was speaking at a conference in washington dc and i said that one of the priorities for research
 was to document the ways in which racism affected health 
 a white gentleman stood in the audience and said that while he agreed with me that racism was important 
 we could never
  there 's no reason why we can 't measure racism if we put our minds to it and so i put my mind to it
 and developed three scales  
 the first one captured major experiences of discrimination like being unfairly fired or being unfairly stopped by the police  
 but discrimination also occurs in more minor and subtle experiences  and so my second scale
  called the everyday discrimination scale 
 captures nine items that captures experiences like you 're treated with less courtesy than others you receive poorer service than others in restaurants or stores or people act as if they 're afraid of you 
 this scale captures
 ways in which the dignity and the respect of people who society does not
  value is chipped away on a daily basis  research has found
 that higher levels of discrimination
 are associated with an elevated risk of a broad range of diseases from blood pressure to abdominal obesity to breast cancer to heart disease and even premature mortality
  strikingly some of the effects are observed at a very young age for example a study of black teens
 found that those who reported higher levels of discrimination as teenagers
 had higher levels of stress
  of blood pressure and of weight at age twenty  
 however
  the stress of discrimination
 is only one aspect discrimination and racism also matters in other profound ways for health for example
  the national academy of medicine
 asked me to serve on a committee that found concluded based on the scientific evidence that blacks and other minorities
 receive poorer quality care than whites this was true for all kinds of medical treatment from the most simple
 to the most technologically sophisticated
 one explanation for this pattern
 was a phenomenon that 's called implicit bias or unconscious discrimination 
 research for decades by social psychologists indicates
 that if you hold a negative stereotype about a group in your subconscious mind and you
  meet someone from that group 
 you will discriminate against that person you will treat them differently it 's an unconscious process  it 's an automatic process  
 it is a subtle process but it 's normal
 and it occurs even among the most
 individuals  but the deeper that i delved
 into the health impact of racism the more insidious the effects became
 there is institutional discrimination 
 which refers to discrimination that exists in the processes of social institutions 
 residential segregation by race which has led to blacks and whites living in very different neighborhood contexts is a
  is how residential segregation is the secret source
 that creates racial inequality in the united states  in america where you live
 determines your access to opportunities
  in housing and even in access to medical care one study
 of the one hundred and seventy one largest cities in the united states
 concluded that there is not even one city
 where whites live under equal conditions to blacks 
 and that the worst urban contexts in which whites reside is considerably better than the average context of black communities
  another study found
 that if you could eliminate statistically
 residential segregation you would completely erase black white differences in income 
 education and unemployment and reduce black white differences in single motherhood
 by two thirds all of that driven
 by segregation i have also learned
 how the negative stereotypes
 and images of blacks in our culture
 literally create and sustain both institutional and individual discrimination 
 a group of researchers have put together a database
 that contains the books  magazines
  american would read over their lifetime 
 it allows us to look within this database and see how americans have seen words paired together
 as they grow up in their society  so when the word black appears in american culture what co occurs with it
  so when a police officer overreacts when he sees an unarmed black male
 and perceives him
  to be violent and dangerous  we are not necessarily dealing with an inherently bad cop 
 we may be simply viewing
 a normal american who is reflecting what he has been exposed to as a result of being raised in this society
  from my own experience i believe that your race
 does not have to be a determinant of your destiny i migrated to the united states
 from the caribbean island of saint lucia
 in the late 
 in pursuit of higher education and in the last forty years  i have done well i have had a supportive family
  i have worked hard  
 i have done well  
 but it took more for me to be successful i received a minority fellowship from the university of michigan  
 yes i am an affirmative action baby  
 without affirmative action 
 i would not be here  
 but in the last forty
  years black america has been less successful than i have 
 in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight black households in the united
 states
 earned fifty nine cents for every dollar of income whites earned in
  of income that white families receive and the racial gaps in wealth are even more stunning  
 for every dollar of wealth that whites have black families have six pennies and latinos have seven pennies 
 the fact is racism
 is producing a truly rigged system that is systematically
 disadvantaging some racial groups in the united states 
 to paraphrase plato  there is nothing so unfair
 as the equal treatment of unequal people and that 's why i am committed to working to dismantle
  i deeply appreciate the fact that i am standing on the shoulders
 of those who have sacrificed even their lives to open the doors that i have walked through  
 i want to ensure that those doors remain open
 and that everyone can walk through those doors 
 robert kennedy said each time a man or woman i would add
 stands up for an ideal
 or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope  
 and those ripples can build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance 
 i am optimistic today
 because all across america
  have seen ripples of hope  the boston medical center has added lawyers to the medical team
 so that physicians can improve the health of their patients because the lawyers are addressing the nonmedical needs their patients have 
 loma linda university has built a gateway college in nearby san bernardino so that in addition to delivering
  medical care they can provide job skills and job training
 to a predominantly minority low income community members so that they will have the skills they need
 to get a decent job 
 in chapel hill north carolina the
 that they have lowered the risks for heart disease for blacks in their 
 by providing
  day care from birth to age five in after school centers across the united states wintley phipps and the us dream academy
 is breaking the cycle of
  to the children of prisoners and children who have fallen behind in school 
 in huntsville alabama  oakwood university a historically black institution 
 is showing how we can improve the health of black adults by including a health evaluation as a part of freshman orientation
 and giving those students the tools they need
  need to make healthy choices and providing them annually a health transcript so they can monitor their progress  
 and in atlanta georgia  purpose built communities has dismantled the negative effects of segregation
 by transforming
  of great community wellness and of full employment  
 and finally  there is the devine solution professor patricia devine
 of the university of wisconsin has shown us how we can attack our hidden biases head
  on and effectively reduce them each one of us
 can be a ripple of hope  this work
 will not always be easy but former supreme court justice thurgood marshall
 has told us we must dissent we must dissent from the
  we must dissent from the apathy we must dissent from the hatred and from the mistrust  we must dissent
 because america can do better because america has no choice but to do better
