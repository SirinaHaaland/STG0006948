  two thousand and thirteen  a band of al qaeda militants entered the ancient city of timbuktu on the southern edge of the sahara desert  
 there they set fire to a medieval library of thirty thousand manuscripts written in arabic and several african languages
 and ranging
  in subject from
 astronomy to geography history to medicine  including one book which records perhaps the first treatment for male erectile dysfunction 
 unknown in the west 
 this was the collected wisdom of an entire continent the voice of africa at a time when africa was thought not to have a voice at all 
 the mayor of bamako who witnessed the event  called the burning of the
  manuscripts a crime against world cultural heritage and he was right
 or he would have been if it weren 't for the fact that he was also lying 
 in fact
  just before african scholars had collected a random assortment of old books and left them out for the terrorists to burn  
 today the collection lies hidden in bamako the capital of mali  moldering in the high humidity
 what was rescued by ruse is now once again in jeopardy  this time by climate 
 but africa  and the far flung corners of the world are not the only places or even the main places
 in which manuscripts that could change the history of world culture
 are in jeopardy  several years ago i conducted a survey of european research libraries and discovered that at the barest minimum
  there are sixty thousand
 manuscripts pre 1500
 that are illegible because of water damage  
 fading mold and chemical reagents  the real number is likely double that 
 and that doesn 't even count
 renaissance manuscripts and modern manuscripts and cultural heritage objects such as maps
  what if there were a technology
 that could recover these lost and unknown works  
 imagine worldwide how a trove of hundreds of thousands of previously unknown
 texts could radically transform our knowledge of the past
  imagine what unknown classics we would discover which would rewrite the canons of literature  history philosophy music
 or more provocatively that could rewrite our cultural identities building new bridges between
 people and culture these are the questions that transformed me from a medieval scholar  a reader of texts into a textual scientist
  for me it conjures up images of passivity of someone sitting idly in an armchair waiting for knowledge to come to him in a neat little parcel 
 how much better to be a participant in the past
  an adventurer in an undiscovered country
 searching for the hidden text 
 as an academic  i was a mere reader  i read and taught the same classics that people had been reading and teaching for hundreds
  of years
 virgil  ovid chaucer petrarch
 and with every scholarly article that i published i added to human knowledge in ever diminishing slivers of insight 
 what i wanted to be was an archaeologist of the past  a discoverer of literature an indiana jones without the whip or actually with
  and i wanted it not just for myself but i wanted it for my students as well  
 and so six years ago i changed the direction of my career 
 at the time i was working on the chess of love the last important long poem of the european middle ages never to have been edited 
 and it wasn 't edited because it existed in only one manuscript which was so badly damaged during the firebombing of dresden
 in world war ii that generations of scholars had pronounced it lost for five years  i had been
 working with an ultraviolet lamp trying to recover traces of the writing and i 'd gone about as far as technology at the time
 could actually take me  and so i did what many people do  i went online  and there i learned about how multispectral imaging
 had been used to recover two lost treatises of the famed greek mathematician
  a palimpsest is a manuscript which has been erased and overwritten
 and so out of the blue i decided to write
 to the lead imaging scientist on the archimedes archimedes palimpsest project  professor roger easton 
 with a plan and a plea and to my surprise he actually wrote back
  with his help  i was able to win a grant from the us government to build a transportable multispectral imaging lab  and with this
  lab  i transformed what was a charred and faded mess into a new medieval classic 
 so how does multispectral imaging actually work well  the idea behind multispectral imaging is something that anyone who is familiar with infrared
 night vision goggles will immediately appreciate  that what we can see in the visible spectrum of light is only
  tiny fraction of what 's actually there the same is true with invisible writing our system uses
 twelve wavelengths of light between the ultraviolet and the infrared  
 and these are shown down onto the manuscript from above from banks of  leds and another multispectral light source which comes up through the individual leaves of the manuscript 
 up to thirty five images per sequence per
  digital camera equipped with a lens which is made out of quartz  there are about five of these in the world 
 and once we capture these images we feed them through statistical algorithms to further enhance and clarify them 
 using software which was originally designed for satellite images
 and used by people like geospatial geospatial scientists and the cia  
 the results can be spectacular you may already have heard of what 's been done for the dead sea scrolls
  which are slowly  gelatinizing using infrared we 've been able to read even the darkest corners of the dead sea scrolls  
 you may not be aware however of other biblical texts that are in jeopardy  here for example is a leaf
 from a a manuscript that we
 imaged which is
 perhaps the most valuable christian bible in the world the codex
 oldest translation of the gospels into latin and it dates from the first half of the fourth century
  this is the closest we can come to the bible at the time of the foundation of christendom under emperor constantine
 and at the time also of the council of nicaea when the basic creed of christianity was being agreed upon this manuscript  unfortunately has been very badly damaged
 it 's damaged because for centuries it had been used
 and handled in swearing in ceremonies in the church in fact that purple splotch that you see in the upper left hand corner
 is aspergillus
  which is a a fungus which originates in the unwashed hands of a person with tuberculosis 
 our imaging has enabled me to make the first
  transcription of this manuscript in two hundred and fifty years  
 having a lab that can travel to collections where it 's needed however is only part of the solution 
 the technology is expensive and very rare  and the imaging and image processing skills are esoteric  that means that mounting recoveries is
 beyond the reach of most researchers and all but the wealthiest institutions that 's why i founded the
  lazarus project a not for profit initiative to bring multispectral imaging
 to individual researchers and smaller institutions at little or no cost whatsoever 
 over the past five years our team of imaging scientists scholars and students has travelled to seven different countries and have recovered some of the world 's most valuable damaged manuscripts included the vercelli book which is the oldest book
  of english the black book of carmarthen the oldest book of welsh  and some of the most valuable
 earliest gospels
 located in what is now the former soviet georgia
  so  spectral imaging can recover lost texts more subtly though it can recover a a second story behind every object
  the story of how when and by whom a text was created and sometimes what the author was thinking at the time he wrote 
 take for example  a draft of the declaration of independence written in thomas jefferson 's own hand which some colleagues of mine imaged a few years ago at the library of congress  
 curators had noticed that one word throughout had been scratched out and overwritten the word
  perhaps you can guess what the word underneath was 
 subjects there ladies and gentlemen is american democracy evolving under the hand of thomas jefferson 
 or consider
 the one thousand four hundred and ninety one martellus map which we imaged at yale 's beinecke library this was the map that columbus likely consulted before he traveled to the new world and which gave him his idea of what
 asia looked like and where japan was located the
  problem with this map is that its inks and pigments had so degraded over time that this large nearly seven foot map made the world look like a giant desert  
 until now we had very little idea  detailed idea that is of what columbus knew of the world and how world cultures were represented 
 the main legend of the map was entirely illegible under normal light ultraviolet did very little for
  everything 
 in asia we learned of monsters with ears so long that they could cover the creature 's entire body 
 in africa about a snake who could cause the ground to smoke 
 like starlight which can convey images of the way the universe looked in the distant past 
 so multispectral light can take us back to the first stuttering moments of an object 's creation 
 through this
  lens we witness the mistakes  the changes of mind the navets the uncensored thoughts  the imperfections of the human imagination that allow these hallowed objects and their authors to become more real 
 that make history closer to us 
 what about the future there 's so much of the past
  few people with the skills to rescue it before these objects disappear forever
 that 's why i have begun to teach this new hybrid discipline that i call textual science textual science is a marriage of the traditional skills of a literary scholar the ability to read old 
  languages and old handwriting the knowledge of how texts are made in order to be able to place and date them with new techniques like
  chemistry of inks and pigments computer aided optical character recognition 
 last year  a student in my class  a freshman with a background in latin and greek was image processing a palimpsest
 that we had photographed at a famous library in rome as he worked  tiny greek writing began to appear from behind the text  
 everyone gathered around  and he read a line from a lost work
 comic dramatist menander 
 this was the first time in well over a thousand years that those words had been pronounced aloud 
 in that moment he became a scholar  
 ladies and gentlemen  that is the future of the past  thank you very much
