  we 're here to celebrate compassion but compassion from my vantage point  has a problem 
 as essential as it is across our traditions as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives 
  is hollowed out in our culture and it is suspect in my field of journalism 
 it 's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing 
 or it 's seen as potentially depressing  
 karen armstrong has told what i think is an iconic story of giving a speech in holland and after the fact the word compassion was translated as pity 
 now compassion when it enters the news too often comes in the form of
  pieces or sidebars about heroic people you could never be like or happy endings or examples of 
 that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic
  and so what i 'd like to do this morning for the next few minutes is
 perform a linguistic resurrection  
 and i hope you 'll come with me on my basic premise that words matter that they shape the way we understand ourselves the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others 
 when this country first encountered genuine diversity in the 1960s 
 we adopted tolerance as the core civic virtue with which we would approach that 
 now the word
  look at it in the dictionary connotes allowing indulging and enduring 
 in the medical context that it comes from it is about testing the limits of thriving in an unfavorable environment  
 tolerance is not really a lived virtue it 's more of a cerebral ascent  
 and it 's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior
 when the going gets rough and the going is pretty rough right now 
 i think that without perhaps being able to name it we are collectively experiencing that we 've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue 
 compassion is a worthy successor it is organic across our religious spiritual and ethical traditions and yet it transcends them
 compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others  both in our private and in our civic spaces  
 so what is it three dimensionally 
 what are its kindred and component parts what 's in its universe of attendant virtues to start simply i want to say that compassion
 is kind now kindness might sound like a very mild word and it 's prone to its own abundant
 cliche  
 but kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues  and it is a most edifying form of instant gratification  
 compassion is also
  cultivates and practices curiosity  i love a phrase that was offered me by two young women who are interfaith innovators in los angeles 
 aziza hasan and malka fenyvesi 
 they are working to create a new imagination about shared life among young jews and muslims 
 and as they do that they cultivate what they call curiosity without assumptions 
 well that 's going to be a breeding
  can be synonymous with empathy it can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation 
 but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence 
 it 's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there just showing up
  i think that compassion also is often linked to beauty
 and by that i mean a willingness to see beauty in the other not just what it is about them that might need helping  
 i love it that my muslim conversation partners often speak of beauty as a core moral value
  and in that light for the religious compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery
 encouraging
  us not just to see beauty 
 but perhaps also to look for the face of god in the moment of suffering in the face of a stranger 
 in the face of the vibrant religious other
  i 'm not sure if i can show you what tolerance looks like  but i can show you what compassion looks like because it is visible
  when we see it we recognize it
 and it changes the way we think about what is doable what is possible 
 it is so important when we 're communicating big ideas but especially a a big spiritual idea like compassion to root it as we present it to others
 in space and time and flesh and blood the color and complexity of life  and compassion
  i first started to learn this most vividly from matthew sanford  
 and i don 't imagine that you will realize this when you look at this photograph of him but he 's paraplegic he 's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was thirteen 
 in a car crash that killed his father and his sister 
 matthew 's legs don 't work and he 'll never walk again and and he does experience this as an and
  and he experiences himself to be healed and whole  
 and as a teacher of yoga  he brings that experience to others across the spectrum of ability and disability  health  illness and aging 
 he says that he 's just at an an extreme end of the spectrum we 're all on
  he 's doing some amazing work now
 with veterans coming back from iraq and afghanistan
  and matthew has made this remarkable observation that i 'm just going to offer you and let it sit  i can 't quite explain it and he can 't either  but he says that
 he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body 
 in all its frailty and its grace without at the same time  becoming more compassionate towards all of life 
 compassion
 also looks like this this is jean vanier
  helped found the l 'arche communities which you can now find all over the world communities centered around life with people with mental disabilities
 mostly down syndrome 
 the communities that jean vanier founded like jean vanier himself exude tenderness 
 tender is another word i would love to spend some time resurrecting
  we spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive
  a lot of time being those things too and compassion can also have those qualities 
 but again and again  lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness  
 jean vanier says that his work like the work of other people his great beloved late friend mother teresa
 is never in the first instance about changing the world it 's in the first instance about changing
  ourselves  he 's says that what they do with l 'arche is not
 a solution  but a sign 
 compassion is rarely a solution  
 but it is always a sign of a deeper reality of deeper human possibilities  and compassion is unleashed
 in wider and wider circles by signs and stories never by statistics and strategies
  we need those things too  but we 're also bumping up against their limits  and at the same time that we are doing that i think we are rediscovering
 the power of story that as human beings we need stories to survive to flourish to change 
 our traditions have always known this and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart and carried them forward in time for us
 there is of course a story behind the
 key moral longing and commandment of judaism to repair the world tikkun olam and i
 'll never forget hearing that story from dr rachel naomi remen who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her that in the beginning
 of the creation
 something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces
 it lodged as shards inside every aspect of the creation and that the highest human calling
 is to look for this light to point at it when we see it to gather it up and in so doing to repair the world 
 now this might sound like a fanciful tale some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way 
 rachel naomi remen says this is an important and
  empowering story for our time 
 because this story insists that each and every one of us  
 frail and flawed as we may be inadequate as we may feel has exactly what 's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch 
 stories like
  like this are practical tools in a world longing
 to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us 
 rachel naomi remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors
  this trend of what rachel naomi remen is doing how
 these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine the work fred luskin is doing
 i think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the 21st century that science in fact is taking
 a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism this is going to change
  i believe and it will change religion  but here 's a face from 20th century science
 that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion 
 we all know about the albert einstein who came up with e  =
 mc2 we don 't hear so much about the einstein who invited the african american opera singer marian anderson to stay in his home when she came to sing in princeton because the best hotel there was segregated and wouldn 't have her
 we don 't hear about the einstein who used his celebrity to advocate for political prisoners in europe or the scottsboro boys
 in the american south 
 einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions  
 but he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early
 he once said
 that science in his generation had become like a razor blade in the hands of a three year old 
 and einstein foresaw that as we grow more modern and technologically advanced  we need the virtues our traditions carry forward in time
 more not less  he liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages
  some of his favorites were moses  jesus  buddha st francis of assisi  gandhi he adored his contemporary gandhi  
 and einstein said and i think this is a quote again that has not been passed down in his legacy
 that these kinds of people are geniuses in the art of living more necessary to the dignity
 security and joy of humanity than the discoverers of objective knowledge 
 now invoking einstein might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us but actually it is 
 i want to show you
 the rest of this photograph because this photograph
 is analogous to what we do to the word compassion in our culture we clean it up
 and we diminish
  its depths and its grounding in life which is messy  so in this photograph you see
 a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral it 's not 
 this is the full photograph and you see a middle aged man wearing a leather jacket smoking a cigar 
 and by the look of that paunch he hasn 't been doing enough yoga  
 we put these two photographs side by side on our website and someone said when i look at the
  first photo i ask myself what was he thinking and when i look at the second i ask what kind of person was he what kind of man is this well he was complicated 
 he was incredibly compassionate in some of his relationships and terribly inadequate in others  
 and
 it is
 much harder often to be compassionate towards those closest to us which is another quality in the
  universe of compassion on its dark side that also deserves our serious attention and illumination  
 gandhi too was a real flawed human being so was martin luther king jr so was dorothy day  so was mother teresa so are we all 
 and i want to say that it is a liberating thing to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion
 following on what fred luskin says that these flaws just make us human 
 our culture is obsessed with perfection and with hiding problems  
 but what a liberating thing to realize that our problems in fact are probably our richest sources for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion 
 towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and joys of others
 rachel naomi remen is a better doctor because of her life long struggle with crohn 's disease einstein
 became a humanitarian not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter  
 but because he was a jew as germany grew fascist and karen armstrong i think you would also say
 that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that
  with a zigzag have led to the charter for compassion  compassion can 't be reduced to sainthood
 any more than it can be reduced to pity  so i want to propose
 a final definition of compassion this is einstein with paul robeson by the way
 and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology
 now our traditions contain vast wisdom about this and we need them to mine it for us now but
 compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious  
 so i will paraphrase einstein in closing
 and say that humanity the
  this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us
 and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race
