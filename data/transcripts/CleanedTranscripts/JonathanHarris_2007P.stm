 anyway it was a time when i was mainly interested in collecting imaginary stories so this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings i ever made and recently i 've been much more interested in collecting stories from reality so real stories and
 specifically i 'm interested in collecting my own stories stories from the internet and then recently stories from life which is kind of a new
 area of work that i 've been doing recently
  so i 'll be talking about each of those today
 so first of all my own stories these are two of my sketchbooks i have many of these books and i 've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years they accompany me wherever i go in my life
  and i fill them with all sorts of things records of of my lived experiences so watercolor paintings
  writings
 and in these books you can find these short little glimpses of moments and experiences and people that i meet and
 you know after keeping these books for a number of years i started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts but also the artifacts of other people so i started collecting found objects this is a photograph i found lying in a gutter in new york city about ten years ago
 on the front you can see the tattered black and white photo of a woman 's face
  and on the back it says to judy the girl with the bill bailey voice have fun in whatever you do
 and i really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody 's life as opposed to to knowing the whole story just knowing a little bit of the story and then letting your own mind fill in the rest
 and that idea of a partial glimpse is something that will come back in a lot of the work i 'll be showing later today
 so around this time i was studying computer science at princeton university and i noticed that it was suddenly possible
  to collect these sorts of personal artifacts not just from street corners but also from the internet
 and that suddenly people en masse were leaving scores and scores of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives
 blog posts photographs thoughts feelings opinions all of these things were being expressed by people online and leaving behind trails so i started to write computer programs that study very very large sets of these online
 one such project is about a year and a half old it 's called we feel fine this is a project that scans the world 's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes searching for occurrences of the phrases i feel and i am feeling
 and when it finds one of those phrases it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the
  author so their gender their age their geographic location and what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence it collects about twenty thousand such sentences a day and it 's been running for about a year and a half having collected over ten and a half million feelings now
 this is then how they 're presented these dots here represent some of the english speaking world 's feelings from the last few hours
 each each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger and the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside so the bright ones are happy and the dark ones are sad and
  the diameter of each dot corresponds to the length of the sentence inside so the small ones are short and the bigger ones are longer
 i feel fine with the body i 'm in there 'll be no easy excuse for why i still feel uncomfortable feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend from a twenty two year old in japan
 i got this on some trading locally but really don 't feel like screwing with wiring and crap also some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts and when that happens these montage
  compositions are automatically created which consist of the sentence and images being combined and any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside
 i feel good
 i feel rough now and i probably gained one hundred thousand pounds but it was worth it
  i love how they were able to preserve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature butterflies man made forests limestone caves and hey even a huge python
 so the next movement is called mobs this provides a slightly more statistical look at things this is showing the world 's most common feelings overall right now dominated by better then bad then good then guilty and so on weather
 causes the feelings to assume the physical traits of the weather they represent so the sunny ones swirl around the cloudy ones float along the rainy ones fall down and the snowy ones
  flutter to the ground you can also stop a raindrop and and open the feeling inside
 finally location causes the feelings to move to their spots on a world map giving you a sense of their geographic distribution so i 'll show you now some of my favorite montages from we feel fine these are 
  the images that are automatically constructed i feel like i 'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe
 i 've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn
  't felt good the kisses felt messy and wrong but kissing lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual
 i can feel my cancer grow
 i feel pretty i feel skinny but i 'm not
 i 'm twenty three and a recovering meth and heroin addict and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive i can 't wait to see them racing for the first time at daytona next month
  because i feel the need for speed
 i feel sassy
 i feel so sexy in this new wig
 as you can see we feel fine
 collects very very small scale personal stories sometimes stories as short as two or three words so really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story
 and recently i 've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story and that 's led me to doing some work
  with the physical world not with the internet and only using the internet at the very last moment as a presentation medium so these are some newer projects that actually aren 't even launched publicly yet the first such one 
  is called the whale hunt last may i spent nine days living up in barrow alaska the northernmost settlement in the united states with a family of inupiat eskimos documenting their annual spring
 whale hunt this is the whaling camp here we 're about six miles from shore camping on five and a half feet of thick frozen pack ice
 and that water that you see there is the open lead and through that lead bowhead whales migrate north each springtime and the eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here waits for a whale to 
  come close enough to attack and when it does it throws a harpoon at it and then hauls the whale up under the ice and cuts it up and that would provide the community 's food supply for a long time so i went up there and i lived with these guys out in their whaling camp here and photographed the entire
  experience beginning with the taxi ride to newark airport in new york and ending with the butchering of the second whale seven and a half days later i photographed that entire experience at five minute intervals so every five minutes i took a photograph
 when i was awake with the camera around my neck when i was sleeping with a tripod and a timer
 and then in moments of high adrenaline like when something exciting was happening i would up that photographic frequency to as many as thirty seven photographs in five minutes so what this created was a
  photographic heartbeat that sped up and slowed down more or less matching the changing pace of my own heartbeat
 that was the first concept here the second concept was to use this experience to think about the fundamental components of any story what are the things that make up a story so stories have characters stories have concepts 
 stories take place in a certain area they have contexts they have colors what do they look like they have time when did it take place dates when did it occur and in the case of the whale
  hunt also this idea of an excitement level the thing about stories though in most of the existing mediums that we 're accustomed to things like novels radio photographs movies even lectures like this 
  one we 're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position some kind of omniscient external body through whose eyes you see the story we 're very used to this but if you think about real life it 's not like that at all i mean in real life things are much more nuanced
  and complex and there 's all of these overlapping stories intersecting and touching each other and so i thought it would interesting to build a framework to surface those types of stories so in the case of the 
  whale hunt how could we extract something like the story of simeon and crawford involving the concepts of wildlife tools and blood taking place on the arctic ocean dominated by the color red happening around ten a m on may third with an excitement level of high
 order of narrative from
 from this larger story i built a a web interface
 for viewing the whale hunt that attempts to do just this so these are all three thousand two hundred and fourteen pictures taken up there
 this is my studio in brooklyn this is the arctic ocean and the butchering of the second whale seven days later you can start to see some of the story
  told by color so this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper in the basement apartment where i was staying and things go white as we move out onto the arctic ocean
 introduction of red down here when whales are being cut up
 you can see a timeline showing you the exciting moments throughout the story these are organized chronologically wheel provides a slightly more
 playful version of the same so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically
  and any of these can be clicked and then the narrative is entered at that position so here i am sleeping on the airplane heading up to alaska that 's moby dick
 this is the food we ate
 this is in the patkotak 's family living room in their house in barrow the boxed wine they served us cigarette break outside i don 't smoke
 this is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping
 this is out at whale camp on the arctic ocean this graph that i 'm clicking down here is meant to be
  reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph showing the the exciting moments of adrenaline
 this is the ice starting to freeze over the snow fence they built
 and so what i 'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub stories so here you see the cast these are all of the people in the whale hunt and the two whales that were killed down here
 and we could do something as arbitrary as say extract the story of
 rony involving the
  concepts of blood and whales and tools
 taking place on the arctic ocean at ahkivgaq camp
 with the heartbeat level of fast and now we 've whittled down that whole story to just twenty nine magic photographs and then we can enter the narrative at that position and you can see rony cutting up the whale here
 these whales are about forty feet long and weighing over forty tons and they provide the food source for the
  community for for much of the year skipping ahead a bit more here this is rony on the whale carcass
 they use no chainsaws or anything it 's entirely just blades and an incredibly efficient process
 this is the guys on the rope pulling open the carcass this is the muktuk or the blubber all lined up for community distribution its baleen
 moving on so what i 'm going to tell you about next
  is a very new thing it 's not even a project yet so just yesterday i flew in here from singapore and before that i was spending
 two weeks in bhutan the small
 himalayan kingdom nestled between tibet and india
 and i was doing a project there about happiness interviewing a lot of local people so bhutan has this really wacky
  base most of their high level governmental decisions around the concept of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product
 and they 've been doing this since the seventys and it leads to
 just a completely different value system it 's an incredibly non materialistic culture where people don 't have a lot but they 're incredibly happy so i went around and i talked to people about some of these ideas
 so i did a number of things i asked people a number of set questions and took a number of set photographs and interviewed them with audio and also took pictures i would start by
  asking people to rate their happiness between one and ten which is kind of inherently absurd and then when they answered i would inflate that number of balloons and give them that number of balloons to hold
 so you have some really happy person holding ten balloons and some really sad soul holding one balloon but you know even holding one balloon is like kind of happy
 and then i would ask them a number of questions like what was the happiest day in their life what makes them happy and
  then finally i would ask them to make a wish and when they made a wish i would write their wish onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it
 so i 'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that i did some of the people i spoke with this is an eleven year old student
 he was playing cops and robbers with his friends running around town and they all had plastic toy guns his wish was to become a police officer he was getting started early
 those were his hands i took pictures of everybody 's hands because i think you can often tell a lot from somebody about how their hands look i took a portrait of everybody
 and asked everybody to make a funny face a seventeen year old student her wish was to have been born a boy
 she thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in bhutan and it 's a lot easier if you 're a boy
  twenty eight year old cell phone shop owner if you knew what paro looked like you 'd understand how amazing it is that there 's a cell phone shop there
 he wanted to help poor people
 a fifty three year old farmer she was chaffing wheat and that pile of wheat behind her had taken her about a week to make
 she wanted to keep farming until she dies
 you can really start to see the stories told by the hands here
 she was wearing this silver ring that had the word love engraved on it and she 'd found it in the road somewhere
 a sixteen year old quarry worker this guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight but he just
  wanted to spend his life as a farmer
 a twenty one year old monk
 he was very happy
 he wanted to live a long life at the monastery
  this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face which i 'm told is very good luck
 he was kind of too shy to make a funny face a sixteen year old student
 she wanted to become an independent woman i asked her about that and she said she meant that she doesn 't want to be married because in her opinion when you get married in bhutan as a woman
 your chances to live an independent life kind of end and so she had no interest in that
 a twenty four year old truck driver
 there are these terrifyingly huge indian trucks that come careening around one lane roads with two lane traffic with three thousand foot drop offs right next to the road and he was driving one of these trucks
 but all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life like other
  a twenty four year old road sweeper i caught her on her lunch break she 'd built a little fire to keep warm right next to the road her wish was to marry someone with a car
 she wanted a change in her life she lives in a little worker 's camp right next to the road and she wanted a different lot on
  eighty one year old itinerant farmer i saw this guy on the side of the road and
 he actually doesn 't have a home he travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at
 so his wish was to come with me so that he had somewhere to live
  he had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho and started brandishing when i asked him to make a funny face it was all good natured
 a ten year old
 he wanted to join a school and learn to read but his parents didn 't have enough money to send him to school
 he was eating this orange sugary candy that he kept dipping his fingers into and since there was so much saliva on his hands
  this orange paste started to form on his palms
 a thirty seven year old road worker
 one of the more touchy political subjects in in bhutan is the
 use of indian cheap labor that they import from from india to build the roads and then they send these people home once the roads are built
  so these guys were in a worker 's gang mixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway
 his wish was to make some money and open a store a
 seventy five year old farmer she was selling oranges on the side of the road
 i asked her about her wish and she said you know maybe i 'll live maybe i 'll die but i don 't have a wish
 she was chewing betlenut which caused her
 teeth over the years to turn very red
 finally this is a twenty six year old nun i spoke to
 her wish was to make a pilgrimage to tibet
 i asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said well you know of course it 's impermanent but my plan is to live here until i 'm thirty and then
 enter a hermitage and i said you mean like a cave and she said yeah like a like a cave
 and i said wow and and how long will you live in the cave and she said well you know i
 i think i 'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave
 i just thought that was amazing i mean she spoke in a way with amazing english and amazing humor and amazing laughter that made her seem like somebody i could have bumped into on the streets of new york or in vermont where i 'm from but
  here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years
 i asked her a little bit more about the cave and
 what she planned would happen once she went there you know what if what if she saw the truth after just one year what would she do for the next thirty five years in her life and this is what she said
  long time yes
 not maybe one ten years maybe i can die within one year or something like that are you hoping to
 aah because you know it 's impermanent yeah
 but
 yeah ok do you hope would you prefer to live in the cave for forty years or to live for one year
 but i prefer for maybe forty to
  fifty forty to fifty yeah yes from then i 'm going to the heaven
 well i wish you the best of luck with it thank you i hope it 's everything that you hope it will be so
 thank you again so much you 're most welcome
 so if you caught that she said she hoped to die when she was around forty that was enough life for her so the last thing we did very quickly is i
  took all those wish balloons there were one hundred and seventeen interviews one hundred and seventeen wishes
 and i brought them up to a place called dochula which is a mountain pass in bhutan at ten thousand three hundred feet one of the more sacred places in bhutan and up there there are thousands of prayer flags that people have spread out over the years and we re
  to make some money and open a store
