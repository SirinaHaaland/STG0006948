  last month the encyclopaedia britannica announced that it is going out of print after two hundred and forty four years  which made me nostalgic because i remember playing a game 
 with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library back when i was a kid maybe twelve years old
  and i wondered if i could update that game not just for modern methods  but for the modern me  
 so i tried i went to an online encyclopedia wikipedia  and i entered the term earth you can start anywhere this time i chose earth 
 and the first rule of the game is pretty simple you just have to read the article until you find something you don 't know and preferably something your dad doesn 't even know and in this case
  i quickly found this the furthest point from the center of the earth is not the tip of mount everest like i might have thought  it 's the tip of this mountain mount chimborazo in ecuador 
 the earth spins of course as it travels around the sun so the earth bulges a little bit around the middle like some earthlings  and
 even though mount chimborazo isn 't the tallest
  one degree away from the equator  it 's riding that bulge and so the summit of chimborazo is the farthest point on earth from the center of the earth  and it is really fun 
  to say  so i immediately decided this is going to be the name of the game or my new exclamation you can use it at ted chimborazo right it 's like eureka and bingo had a baby  
  the next rule of the game is also pretty simple you just have to find another term and look that up  now in the old days that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically maybe getting sidetracked that was fun 
 nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from i can go literally anywhere in the world i think since i was already in ecuador  i just decided to click on the word tropical 
  north and the tropic of capricorn in the south that much i knew  but i was surprised to learn this little fact those are not cartographers ' lines like
 latitude or the borders between nations  they are astronomical phenomena caused by the earth 's tilt and they change  they move they go up they go down in fact 
 for years the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn have been steadily drifting towards the equator at the rate of about
  meters per year  and nobody told me that i didn 't know it chimborazo  so
 to keep the game going  i just have to find another term and look that one up since i 'm already in the tropics i chose tropical rainforest famous for its diversity  human 
  diversity there are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet they 're all over the globe but virtually all of them live
 in tropical rainforests this is the only place you can go nowadays and not get friended  the link
 that i clicked on here was
 exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end it mentioned leopards and
  and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then coleoptera
  out to be
 beetles  now i clicked on this on purpose but if i 'd somehow gotten here by mistake it does remind me for the band see the beatles for the car see volkswagon beetle but i am here
  for beetle beetles this is the most successful order on the planet by far something between twenty and twenty five percent of all life forms on the planet including plants are beetles that means the next time you are in the grocery store take a look at
  the four people ahead of you in line statistically one of you is a beetle  
 and if it is you 
 you are astonishingly well adapted there are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums 
 there are predator beetles that attack other insects and still look pretty cute to us
  are beetles that roll little balls of dung great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings 
 this reminded the ancient egyptians of their god khepri who renews the ball of the sun every morning which is how that dung rolling scarab became 
 that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the pharaoh tutankhamun beetles i was reminded have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom  fireflies are not flies fireflies are beetles
  fireflies are coleoptera  and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well like my next link  the chemical language of pheromones now the pheromone page
 took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex yeah 
 and the link to aphrodisiac now that 's something that
  increases sexual desire possibly
 chocolate  
 there is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine that might be an aphrodisiac  
 but as the article mentions because of enzyme breakdown it 's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally so those of you who only eat your chocolate  you might have to experiment
 the link i clicked on here
  mostly because i understand what both of those words mean  
 but not when they 're together like that i do like sympathy  i do like magic so when i click on sympathetic magic i get
 sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls this is the boy in me getting lucky again  sympathetic magic is imitation if you imitate something
  maybe you can have an effect on it that
 's the idea behind voodoo dolls and possibly also cave paintings the link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind i would love to see google maps inside some of these caves 
 we 've got 
 artwork common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands  usually the left hand we have been a
  for millenia 
 so even though i don 't know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand or blow pigment on it from a tube  i can easily picture how he did it and i really 
  don 't think it 's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar right there that i 'm going to use now to click on the term for hand 
  hand is formally called the opisthenar  
 now that 's embarrassing because up until now every time i 've said i know it like the back of my hand i 've really been saying i 'm totally familiar with that i just don 't know it 's freaking name right 
 and the link i clicked on here well  lemurs monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar  i click on chimpanzee
  i get our closest genetic relative 
 pan troglodytes the name we give him means cave dweller 
 he doesn 't he lives in rainforests and savannas  it 's just that we 're always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us evolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us  and in some cases  
 he gets places before us  like my next link the almost irresistible link
 i click on him and i really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice in fact he 's born in cameroon  which is smack in the middle of my tropics map  and 
  more specifically his skeleton wound up in the smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles in between those two landmarks in ham 's life 
  months before the first human being to do it  soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin 
 when i click on yuri gagarin 's page i get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature  huge in heroism  top estimates  soviet estimates put this guy at one point six five meters that is
 less than five and a half feet tall max possibly because he was malnourished as a child  germans occupied russia a nazi officer
  took over the gagarin household  and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut 
 years later the boy from that cramped mud hut would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule on the tip of a rocket who volunteered to be launched into outer space the first one of any of us to
 really physically
  he didn 't just leave it 
 he circled it once fifty years later as a tribute  the international space station which is still up there tonight  
 synced its orbit with gagarin 's orbit at the exact same time of day  and filmed it so you can go online and you can watch over one hundred minutes of what 
  must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride possibly a lonely one the first person to ever see such a thing and then when you 've had your fill of that
 you can click on one more link  you can come back to earth  you return to where you started you
 can finish your game  you just need to find one more fact that you didn 't know and for me  i quickly landed on this one 
 the earth has a tolerance of about 17 percent from the reference spheroid which is less than
  billiard balls this is the kind of fact i would have loved as a boy i found it myself  
 it 's got some math that i can do i 'm pretty sure my dad doesn 't know it  
 what this means is that if you could shrink the earth to the size of a billiard ball
 if you could take
 planet earth 
 with all its mountain tops and caves and rainforests astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees voodoo dolls fireflies chocolate
  sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea  you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball  it would be as smooth
 as a billiard ball presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle  
 that 's pretty cool  i didn 't know that chimborazo
