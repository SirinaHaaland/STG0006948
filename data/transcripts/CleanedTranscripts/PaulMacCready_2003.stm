  but that was just one thing that
 got me going in the sort of things that i 'm working in now as a
  youngster  i was very interested in model airplanes  ornithopters autogyros helicopters gliders 
 power planes  indoor models outdoor models  everything  which i just thought was a lot of fun  and
 wondered why most other people didn 't share my same enthusiasm with them  and then
  navy pilot
 training and after college i got into sailplane flying power plane flying  and
 considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun  but got tangled up with some great
 professor types who
 convinced me and everybody
  else in the field that this was a good way to get into
 really deep science while this was all going on  i was
 in the field of weather modification although getting
 a ph d in aeronautics  the weather modification subject was getting
  and as a graduate student i could go around to the various talks that were being given on a hitchhiker ride to the east coast and
 so on and everybody would talk to me but all the professionals in the field hated each other  and they wouldn 't communicate  and
 as a result i got the absolutely unique background in that
 field and started a company which did more research in weather modification than anybody
 and there are a lot of things that i just can 't go into but then
 companies on some big many year project  and
 so we did our small
 projects and the company slowly grew  the thing that is exciting was in one thousand nine 
 i
  made a loan to a friend
 of one hundred thousand dollars or i guaranteed the money at the bank he needed them he needed the money for starting a
 company the company did not succeed  and he couldn 't pay the money back and i was the guarantor of the note  so i
 had a $ one hundred thousand
  seventeen years at the time was fifty thousand pounds which at the exchange rate was just about one hundred thousand dollars  so suddenly i was interested in
 and did not
 the way i approached it  first
  thinking about ways to make the planes  was
 just like they 'd been doing in england 
 and not succeeding and i gave it up i
 figured nah there isn 't any simple easy way  but then got off on a vacation trip  and was studying bird flight just for the
 fun of it  and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles  and measure the time  and estimate the bank angle
  out its speed  and the turning radius and so on which i could
 do in the car as we 're driving along on a vacation trip with
 my three sons  young sons  helping me  but
 ridiculing the whole thing very much but that
 began thinking about how birds went around
  how airplanes would how hang gliders would fly  and then other planes  and the idea of the 
  airplane quickly emerged was so logical one should have thought of it in the first place but one didn 't and it was just keep the weight down
 seventy pounds was all it weighed but let the size swell up
 like a hang glider but three times the span three times the cord you 're down to a third of the speed a third of the power and
 a good bicyclist can put out that power and
 that worked  and we won the prize a year later we
  a lot of
 flying a lot of experiments a lot of things that didn 't work  and ones that did work and the plane kept getting a little better a little better got a good
 pilot brian allen to operate it  and finally  
 succeeded  but unfortunately about sixty five thousand dollars was spent on the project 
 and
 there was only about thirty to help retire the debt but fortunately henry kramer who put up the prize
  for that was a one mile flight
 put up a new prize for flying the english channel twenty one miles 
 and he thought it would take another eighteen years for somebody to win that we realized that if you just cleaned up
 our gossamer condor a little bit the power to fly would be decreased a little bit
  and if you decrease the power required a little the pilot can fly a much longer period of time  and brian allen was able in a miraculous flight to get the gossamer albatross across the
 english channel
 that giving the planes to the museum was worth much more than the the debt  so
 for five years  six years  i only had to pay one third income tax 
 so there were good economic reasons for the project
  done entirely for economic reasons  and we have not been involved in any human powered flight since then because
 the prizes are all over but
 that sure started me thinking about various things and immediately  
  because we felt solar power was going to be so important for the country and the world we didn 't want the
 small funding in the government to be decreased which is what the government was trying to do with it  and we thought
 a solar powered plane wouldn 't really make sense but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that
  i got a prize from the lindbergh foundation their annual prize and i
  to prepare a paper
 on it 
 which collected all my varied thoughts and varied interests over the years  this was the one chance that i had to focus on what i really was after and what was important and
 to my surprise  i realized the
 importance
  which charles lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to and preparing that paper
 did me a lot of good i thought back about
 if i was a space traveler and came and visited earth every five thousand years  and for
 a few thousand visits i would see the same thing
 every time the little differences in the earth  but this last time
 just coming round right now  suddenly there 'd be huge changes in the environment in the concentration of people  and it was just
 unbelievable the amount of all the the change in
  one of the biggest changes is two hundred years ago we began using
 coal from underground  which has a lot of pollution  and one hundred years ago began getting gasoline from underground with a lot of pollution  and
 gasoline consumption  or production will reach its limit in about ten years  and
 then go down  and we wonder
  what 's going to happen with transportation  i wanted to show the slide
 this slide  i think is the most important one any of you will see 
  the year two thousand you see there and
 this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on are the red line goes up 
 that 's the humans and
  the green line goes down that 's the wild nature portion humans livestock and pets are now ninety eight percent
 of the total world 's mass of vertebrates on land and air and
 you don 't know what the future will hold but it 's not going to get a
 a lower percentage ten thousand years ago  the humans and livestock and pets were not even one tenth of one percent and
  wouldn 't even have been visible on such a curve now they are  ninety eight percent and it 
 i think  shows human domination of the earth i give a talk to some
 remarkable high school students
  ask them after they 've asked me questions and i give them a talk and
 so on then i ask them questions what 's the population of the earth what 's the population of the earth going to be when you 're the age of your parents
 which i 'd never really they had never really thought about but now they think about it  and then what population of the earth
 would be an equilibrium
  and they form little groups all fighting with each other  and when i leave two hours later  most of them are saying about two billion
 people  and they don 't have any clue about how to get down to two billion nor do i but i think they 're right and this is
 a
  rachel carson was thinking of these and came out with silent spring way back 
 solar manifesto by hermann scheer in germany claims all energy on earth can be derived 
 for every country from
 solar
 energy and
 water
  and so on you don 't need to dig down for these chemicals  and
 we can do things much more efficiently 
 let 's have the next slide so this just summarizes it over billions of years on a unique sphere chance has painted a thin covering of life complex and probable wonderful 
  and fragile suddenly we humans a recently arrived species no longer subject
  the checks and balances inherent in nature have grown in population technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power 
 we now wield the paintbrush we 're in charge it 's
 frightening  and
 i do a painting every twenty or twenty five years  this is the
 last one 
 and [ it ] shows the earth in a time flag on the right in trilobites and dinosaurs and so on  and over the triangle 
 we now get to
 civilization and tv and traffic jams and so on  i have no idea of what comes next so i just
 used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future as a little
 warning and two weeks after this drawing was done we actually had our first
 project contract
  time went on  we stopped our environmental programs we focused more on the really serious energy problems of the future  and we produced products
 for the company  and we developed the impact car that general motors
 made the ev1 out of and
 got the air resources board to have the regulations that stimulated the electric cars but they 've
  we 've done a lot of
 things  small drone airplanes and so on  i have
 a helios
 we have the first video narrator with a wingspan of two hundred and forty seven feet this makes her larger than a boeing seven
  her designers ' attention to detail and her construction gives helios ' structure the flexibility and strength
 to deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere 
 this enables her to easily ride through the air currents as if she 's sliding along on the ocean waves paul maccready the wings could touch together on top and not break
  turning her back to the sun to maximize the power from her solar array 
 as the sky gets darker  and the outside air temperatures drop below minus one hundred degrees fahrenheit 
 the most environmentally hostile segment of helios 's journey has gone by without notice  except for
  being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems and their associated sensors
 approaching a peak radar altitude of  ninety six thousand eight hundred and sixty three feet  at four twelve  p m helios is standing on top of ninety eight percent of the earth 's atmosphere 
 this is more than ten thousand feet higher than the previous
  that plane has many purposes but it
 's aimed for communications  and it can fly so slowly that it 'll just stay up at sixty five thousand feet  
  will be able to have to stay up day night day night for six months at a time  acting like the synchronous satellite  but only ten miles above the earth let 's have the next video  this shows
  it sends high resolution video pictures back to the operator 
 with on board gps it can navigate autonomously  and it is rugged enough to self land without damage pm 
 okay and let 's have the next 
 applause that plane is widely used by the
  going to end our visit with paul maccready 's flying circus by meeting his son tyler who with his two brothers
  helped build the gossamer condor twenty five years ago tyler maccready you can
 chase it like this for hours aa 
 when they got bored with their father 's project 
 they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own tm and i can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing or on the other aa 
 they called it their walkalong glider 
  all got a couple of these in your gift bags and one of the first things  
 the production version seemed to dive a little bit and so i would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bit before you try flying it
  'll give you a demonstration of how it works the idea is that it it soars on the lift over your body  like a seagull soaring on a cliff 
 as the wind comes up it has to go over the cliff  so as you walk through the through the air  it goes around your body some has to go over you 
 and so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current  the launch
  got to hold it high up over your head  and you start walking forward and just let go of it  and you can control it like that
 and then also like it said in the video  you can turn it left or right just by putting the lift under one wing or another 
 so i can do it oops that was going to be a right turn okay this one will be a left
  so you can just control it  wherever you want and
 it 's just hours of fun and these are no longer in production so you have real collector 's items 
 laughter and this we just wanted to show you if we can get the video running on this yeah just an example
 of a little video surveillance 
 laughter this was flying around in the party last night and 
 you can see how it just can fly around and you can spy on anybody you want
