  that 's that i 'm a philosopher 
 when i go to a party and people ask me what do i do and i say i 'm
  their eyes glaze over when i go to an academic cocktail party
 and there are all the professors around they ask me what field i 'm in and i say philosophy their eyes glaze over 
 when i go to a philosopher 's party 
 and they ask me what i work on and i say consciousness their eyes don 't glaze over
 their lips curl into a snarl
 and i get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because
 they think that 's impossible you can 't explain consciousness the very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question 
 my late lamented friend bob
  they don 't accept the conclusion they die
 their heads explode the idea is to have an argument that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents  
 but in fact that doesn 't change people 's minds at all
 it 's very hard to change people 's minds about something like consciousness  and
 i finally figured out the reason for that the reason for that is that everybody 's an expert on
  consciousness  we heard the other day that everybody 's got a strong opinion about video games they all have an idea for a video game even if they 're not experts  but they don 't consider themselves 
 experts on video games they 've just got strong opinions i 'm sure that people here who work on say
  encounter people who have very strong opinions about
 what 's going to happen next  but they probably don 't think of these opinions as expertise they 're just strongly held opinions but with regard to consciousness people seem to think  
 each of us seems to think i am an expert simply by being conscious  i know all about this and so you tell them your theory
 confidence  
 and so what i 'm going to try to do today is to shake your confidence because i know the feeling i can feel it myself  i want to shake your confidence that you know
 your own innermost minds that you are  yourselves  authoritative about your own consciousness
  i think everybody understands what that means that 's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness  
 this is my favorite picture of consciousness that 's ever been done it 's a saul steinberg of course it was a new yorker cover  and this
 fellow here is looking at the painting by braque  that reminds him of the word baroque  barrack  bark poodle 
  a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along  you learn a lot about this man 
 what i particularly like about this picture too is that steinberg has rendered the guy in this sort of pointillist style  
 which reminds us as rod brooks was saying yesterday
  what we are what each of us is what you are what i am
 is approximately
 one hundred trillion little cellular robots
 that 's what we 're made of no other ingredients at all we 're just made of cells about one hundred trillion of them 
 not a single one of those cells is conscious not a single one of those cells knows who you are or cares 
 somehow we have to explain how when you put together teams armies  battalions of
 hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells not so different really from a
  bacterium each one of them
 the result
 is this i mean just look at it  the content there 's color  there 's ideas there 's memories there 's history  
 and somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons  how is that possible 
  many people just think it isn 't possible at all they think no  there can 't be any
 sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness this is a lovely book by a friend of mine
 named lee siegel who 's a professor of religion actually at the university of hawaii  and he 's an expert magician and an expert on the street magic of india
  which is what this book is about net of magic 
 and there 's a passage in it which i
 would love to share with you it speaks so eloquently to the problem
 i 'm writing a book on magic ' i explain and i 'm asked ' real magic '
 by ' real magic ' people mean miracles thaumaturgical acts and supernatural powers ' no ' i answer ' conjuring tricks  not real magic ' '
 real magic ' in other words refers to the magic that is not real while the magic
  a lot of people feel about consciousness 
 real consciousness is not a bag of tricks  if you 're going to explain this as a bag of tricks then it 's not real consciousness whatever it is 
 and as marvin said  and as other people
  consciousness is a bag of tricks this means that a lot of people are just left
 completely dissatisfied and incredulous when i attempt to explain consciousness  so this is the problem so 
 i have to do a little bit of the sort of work that
 a lot of you won 't like for the same reason that you don 't like to see a magic trick explained to you
  how many of you here  if somebody some smart aleck starts telling you
 how a particular magic trick is done you sort of want to block your ears and say no no i don 't want to know don 't take the thrill of it away  i 'd rather be mystified don 't tell me the answer 
 a lot of people feel that way about consciousness i 've discovered  and
 i 'm sorry if i impose some
  some understanding on you you 'd better leave now if you don 't want to know some of these tricks  but i 'm not going to explain it all to you 
 i 'm going to do what philosophers do 
 here 's how a philosopher explains
 the sawing the lady in half trick you know the sawing the lady in half trick  the philosopher says i 'm going to explain to you how that 's done  
  that 's not my department i 'm sorry 
 so now i 'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness  but i 'm going to try to also
 show you that consciousness isn 't quite as marvelous your own consciousness isn 't quite as
  wonderful as you may have thought it is this is something by the way that lee siegel talks about
 in his book he marvels at how he 'll
 do a magic show and afterwards people will swear they saw him do x y and z 
 he never did those things he didn 't even try to do those things people 's memories inflate what they think they saw 
 and the same is true of consciousness  
 now let 's see if this will work
 all right let 's just watch this 
 watch it carefully
 i 'm working with a young 
  documentarian named nick deamer  and this is a little demo that he 's done for me 
 part of a larger project some of you may be interested in we 're looking for a backer 
 documentary on consciousness  ok now you all saw what changed right
  how many of you noticed that every one of those squares
  just show you by running it again 
 even when you know
 that they 're all going to change color it
 's very hard to notice you have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all 
 now  this is an example one of many of a phenomenon that 's now being studied quite a bit
  it 's one that i predicted in in the last page or two of my 
 consciousness explained where i said
 if you did experiments of this sort you 'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes if there 's time at the end i 'll show you the much more dramatic case  
 now  how can it be
 that there are all those changes going on and that we 're not aware of them
 earlier today jeff hawkins mentioned
 the way your eye saccades the way your eye moves around three or four times a second 
 he didn 't mention the speed your eye is constantly in motion moving around looking at eyes noses 
 elbows looking at interesting things in the world  and where your eye isn 't looking you 're remarkably
 impoverished in your vision that 's because the foveal part of your eye which is the
 high resolution part is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length  that 's the detail part it doesn 't seem that way does it  
 it doesn 't seem that way but that 's the way it is you 're getting in a lot less information than you think 
 here 's a completely different effect  this is a painting by bellotto  
 it 's in the museum in north carolina  bellotto was a student of canaletto
 's and i love paintings like that the painting is actually about as big as it is right here and i love canalettos because canaletto has this fantastic detail and you can 
 get right up and and see all the details on the painting  and i started across the hall
 in north carolina because i thought it was probably a canaletto  and would have all that in detail  and i noticed that
  the bridge there  there 's a lot of people you can just barely see them walking across the bridge and i thought as i got closer i would be able to see all the detail of most people
 see their clothes and so forth  and as i got closer and closer i actually screamed  
 i yelled out because when i got closer i found the detail wasn 't there at all 
  were just little artfully placed blobs of paint  
 and as i walked towards the picture  
 i was expecting detail that wasn 't there  the artist had very cleverly suggested
 people and clothes and wagons and all sorts of things and my brain had taken the suggestion
  you 're familiar with
 a more
  you can get a better view of the blobs see when you get close they 're really just just blobs of paint 
 you will have seen something like this
  this is the reverse effect i 'll
  that to you one more time  now  what does your brain do
 when it takes the suggestion when an artful blob of paint or two by an artist 
 suggests
 a person say  one of
 marvin minsky 's little society of mind do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere  i don 't think so
  not a chance  but then how on earth is it done  well  
 remember the philosopher 's explanation of the lady it 's the same thing  
 the brain just makes you think that it 's got the detail there you think the detail 's there  but it isn 't there  the brain isn 't actually putting the detail
  in your head at all it 's just making you expect the detail  let 's just do this experiment very quickly is the shape on the left
 the same as the shape on the right rotated
  yes  how many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind 's eye to see if it matched up with the one on the right  how many of you rotated the one on the right  
 ok  
 how do you know that 's what you did 
 there 's in fact been a very interesting
  debate raging for over twenty years in cognitive science various experiments started by roger shepherd who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images  
 yes it 's possible to do  that  but the the details of the process are still
 in significant controversy  and
 if you read that literature one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is
  even when you 're the subject in the experiment you don 't know you don 't know how you do it you just know that you have certain beliefs  
 and they come in a certain order at a certain time  and what explains the fact that that 's what you think well that 's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician  
 this is a figure that i love bradley petrie and dumais you may think that i 've cheated that i 've put
 a little
 whiter than white boundary there how many of you see that sort of boundary with the necker cube floating in front of the circles  can you
 see it  
 well you know in effect the boundary 's really there  
 in a certain sense your brain is actually computing that boundary  the boundary that goes right there
 everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube  ok  can you see the four ways of seeing the cube  
 because there 's another way of seeing it  if you 're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles  some black circles  there 's another way of seeing it 
 as a cube on a black background as seen through a piece of swiss cheese 
 can you get it
 how many of you can 't get it that
 'll help 
 now you can get it  
 these are two very different phenomena  when you see the cube one way behind the screen 
 those boundaries go away  
  but there 's still a sort of filling in as we can tell if we look at this we don 't have any trouble seeing the cube but where does the color change 
 does your brain have to send little painters in there the purple painters and the green painters fight over who 's going to paint that bit behind the curtain no your brain just lets it go the
 brain doesn 't need to fill that
  in when i first started talking about the bradley petrie
 dumais example that you just saw i 'll go back to it this one i said
 that there was no filling in
 behind there  and i supposed that that was just a flat truth always true  but rob van lier has recently shown that it isn 't 
  look in the gray areas and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there yeah it
 's amazing there 's nothing there it 's no trick
  this is ron rensink 's work which was in some degree inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book let me
 just pause this for a second if i can this is change blindness what you 're going to see is two pictures 
 one of which is slightly different from the other you see here the red roof and the gray roof and in between them there will be a mask  
  just a blank screen for about a quarter of a second so you 'll see the first picture then a mask then the second picture then a mask  and this will just continue 
 and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change so 
 show the original picture for two hundred and forty milliseconds  
 blank show the next picture for two hundred and forty milliseconds  blank and keep going
  until the subject
 presses the button saying i see the change so now we 're going to be subjects in the experiment we 're
 going to start easy 
 some examples 
 no trouble there can everybody see
 took only a little bit more than a second to press the button can you
 see that one 
 two point nine seconds
  how many don 't see it still what 's on the roof of that barn
  is it a bridge or a dock
  are particularly striking this one because it 's so large
 and yet it 's pretty hard to see
  seconds is the median time for
 subjects in his experiment there  i love this one i 'll end with this one just because it 's such an obvious and important thing  
 how many still don 't see it  how many still don 't see it how
  many engines on the wing of that boeing right in the middle of the picture 
  thanks very much for your attention what i wanted to show you is that scientists  using their
  methods can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of and that in fact
  you 're not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are and we 're really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind jeff hawkins this morning was
 describing his attempt to get theory and a good big theory into the neuroscience and he 's right this is a problem
  harvard medical school once i was at a talk director of the lab said in our lab we have a saying 
 if you work on one neuron  that 's neuroscience 
 if you work on two neurons  that 's psychology 
 we have to have more theory and it can come as much from the top down thank you very much
