  i want to talk to you about is what we can learn from studying the genomes of living people and extinct humans  
 but before doing that i just briefly want to remind you about what you already know that our genomes our genetic material are stored in almost all cells
  in our bodies in chromosomes in the form of dna  which is this famous double helical molecule  
 and the genetic information is contained in the form of a sequence of four bases abbreviated with the letters a  t c and g 
 and the information is there twice one on each strand which is important
  because when new cells are formed these strands come apart new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates in an almost perfect process  
 but nothing of course in nature is totally perfect so sometimes an error is made and a wrong letter is built in  
 and we can then see the result of such mutations when we compare dna sequences among us here in the room for example  
 if we compare my genome to the genome of
  you approximately every one thousand two hundred one thousand three hundred letters will differ between us 
 and these mutations accumulate approximately as a function of time  
 so if we add in a chimpanzee here we will see more differences approximately one letter in a hundred will differ from a chimpanzee  
 and if you 're then interested in the history of a piece of dna or the whole genome you can reconstruct the
  history of the dna with those differences you observe  and generally we depict our ideas about this history in the form of trees like this 
 in this case it 's very simple the two human dna sequences go back to a common ancestor quite recently  farther back is there one shared with chimpanzees
  and because these mutations happen approximately as a function of time 
 you can transform these differences to estimates of time where the two humans typically will share a common ancestor about half a million years ago  
 and with the chimpanzees it will be in the order of five million years ago  
 so what has now happened in the last few years is that there are account technologies around that allow you to
  many pieces of dna very quickly  
 so we can now in a matter of hours  determine a whole human genome 
 each of us of course contains two human genomes one from our mothers and one from our fathers  
 and they are around three billion
 such letters long  
 and we will find that the two genomes in me or one genome of mine we want to use will have about three million differences in the order of that 
 and what you can then also begin to do is to say
  are these genetic differences distributed across the world 
 and if you do that you find a certain amount of genetic variation in africa  
 and if you look outside africa you actually find less genetic variation 
 this is surprising of course because in the order of six to eight times fewer people live in africa than outside africa
  people inside africa have more genetic variation  
 moreover almost all these genetic variants we see outside africa have closely related dna sequences that you find inside africa  
 but if you look in africa there is a component of the genetic variation that has no close relatives outside 
 so a model to explain this is that a part of the african variation
  but not all of it [ has ] gone out and colonized the rest of the world  
 and together with the methods to date these genetic differences this has led to the insight that modern humans
 humans that are essentially indistinguishable from you and me evolved in africa  quite recently between one hundred and two hundred thousand years ago
  hundred and fifty thousand years ago or so went out of africa to colonize the rest of the world  
 so what i often like to say is that from a genomic perspective  we are all africans we either live inside africa today  or in quite recent exile 
 another
 consequence of this recent origin of modern humans is that genetic variants are generally
  distributed widely in the world in many places  and they tend to vary as gradients from a bird  's eye perspective at least  
 and since there are many genetic variants and they have different such gradients  this means that if we determine a dna sequence a genome from one individual
 we can quite accurately
 estimate where that person comes from
 provided that its parents or grandparents haven 't moved around too much  
 but does this then mean as many people tend to think that there are huge genetic differences between groups of people on different continents for example  
 well we can begin to ask those questions also there is for example a project
 that 's underway to sequence a thousand individuals their genomes from different parts of the world
 they 've sequenced one hundred and eighty five africans from two populations in africa [ they 've ] sequenced approximately equally [ as ] many people
 in europe and in china  
 and we can begin to say how much variance do we find how many letters that vary in at least one of those individual sequences and it 's a lot
  but we can then ask are there any absolute differences between africans and non africans perhaps the biggest difference most of us would imagine existed  
 and with absolute difference and i mean a difference where people inside africa at a certain position where all individuals one hundred percent have one letter 
  and everybody outside africa has another letter  and the answer to that
  among those millions of differences is that there is not a single such position 
 this may be surprising  maybe a single individual is misclassified or so  so we can relax the criterion a bit and say how many positions do we find where ninety five percent of people in africa have one variant  ninety five
  percent another variant  and the number of that is twelve  
 so this is very surprising  it means that when we look at people and see a person from africa and a person from europe or asia  we cannot 
 for a single position in the genome with one hundred percent accuracy predict what the person would carry  and only for twelve positions can we hope to be ninety five percent right  
  this may be surprising because we can of course look at these people and quite easily say where they or their ancestors came from 
 so what this means now is that those traits we then look at and so readily see facial features skin color hair structure
 are not determined by single genes with big effects  
 but are determined by many different genetic variants that seem to vary in frequency between different parts of the world  
 there is another
 thing with those traits that we so easily observe in each other that i think is worthwhile to consider and that is that in a very literal sense  they 're really on the surface of our bodies  
 they are what we just said facial features  hair structure skin color there are also a number of features that vary
 between continents like that that have to do with how we metabolize food that we ingest 
 or that have to do with how our immune systems deal with microbes that try to invade our bodies  
 but so those are all parts of our bodies where we very directly interact with our environment in a direct
 confrontation if you like it 's easy to imagine how particularly those parts of our bodies
  were quickly influenced by selection from the environment and shifted frequencies of genes that are involved in them  
 but if we look on other parts of our bodies where we don 't directly interact with the environment our kidneys our livers our hearts there is no way to say by just looking 
  at these organs  where in the world they would come from  
 so there 's another interesting thing that comes from this realization that humans have a recent
  common
 origin in africa  
 and that is that when those humans emerged around one hundred thousand years ago or so they were not alone on the planet there were other forms of humans around 
 most famously perhaps neanderthals
 these robust forms of humans compared to the left here with
  modern human skeleton on the right
 that existed in western asia and europe since several hundreds of thousands of years 
 so an interesting question is what happened when we met what happened to the neanderthals 
 and to begin to answer such questions my research group since over twenty five years now works on methods to extract dna from remains of neanderthals 
 and extinct animals that are tens of thousands of years old 
  involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the dna how you convert it to a form you can sequence you
 have to work very carefully to avoid contamination of experiments with dna from yourself  
 and
 this then in conjunction with these methods that allow very many dna molecules to be sequenced very rapidly  allowed us last year to present
  the first version of the neanderthal genome so that any one of you can now look on the internet on the neanderthal genome or at least on the fifty five percent of it that we 've been able to reconstruct so far  
 and you can begin to compare it to the genomes of people who live today  
 and one question that you may then want to ask is what happened when we met  did we mix or not
  and the way to ask that question is to look at the neanderthal that comes from southern europe
 and compare it to genomes of people who live today  
 so we then look to do this with pairs of individuals 
 starting with two africans looking at the two african genomes finding places where they differ from each other
  and in each case ask what is a neanderthal like does it match one african or the other african 
 we would expect there to be no difference because neanderthals were never in africa  they should be equal have no reason to be closer to one african than another african 
  and that 's indeed the case  statistically speaking there is no difference in how often the neanderthal matches one african or the other
  but this is different if we now look at the european individual and an african then 
 significantly more often  does a neanderthal match the european rather than the african 
 the same is true if we look at a chinese individual versus an african the neanderthal will match the chinese individual more often 
 this may also be surprising because the neanderthals were never in china
 so the model we 've
 proposed to explain this
 is that when modern humans came out of africa sometime after one hundred thousand years ago  they met neanderthals  
 presumably they did so first in the middle east where there were neanderthals living 
 if they then mixed with each other there then those modern humans that became the ancestors of everyone outside africa carried with them this neanderthal component in their genome to the rest of the world
  so that today the people living outside africa have about two and a half percent of their dna from neanderthals  
 so having now a neanderthal genome on hand as a reference point and having the technologies to look at ancient remains and extract the dna we can
  begin to apply them elsewhere in the world  and the first place we 've done that is in southern siberia in the altai mountains
 at a place called denisova a cave site in this mountain here 
 where archeologists in two thousand and eight found a tiny little piece of bone this is a copy of it that they realized came from the last phalanx of a little finger of a pinky
  and it was well enough preserved so we could determine the dna from this individual even to a greater extent than for the neanderthals actually 
 and start relating it to the neanderthal genome and to people today  
 and we found that this individual shared a common origin for his dna sequences with neanderthals around six hundred and forty thousand years ago  
 and further back eight hundred thousand years ago is there a common origin with present day
  humans  
 so this individual comes from a population that shares an origin with neanderthals but far back and then have a long independent history 
 we call this group of humans that we then described for the first time from this tiny tiny little piece of bone the denisovans after this place where they were first described
  we can then ask for denisovans
 the same things as for the neanderthals  did they mix with ancestors of present day people 
 if we ask that question and compare the denisovan genome to people around the world  we surprisingly find no evidence of denisovan dna in any people living
 even close to siberia today  but we do find it in papua new guinea and in other islands in melanesia and the pacific
 so this presumably means that these denisovans had been more widespread in the past since we don 't think that the ancestors of melanesians were ever in siberia  
 so from studying these genomes of extinct humans  
 we 're beginning to arrive at a picture of what the world looked like when modern humans started
  coming out of africa 
 in the west there were neanderthals in the east there were denisovans maybe other forms of humans too that we 've not yet described  
 we don 't know quite where the borders between these people were but we know that in southern siberia  there were both neanderthals and denisovans at least at some time in the past  
 then modern humans emerged somewhere in africa  came out of africa  presumably in the middle east  they meet neanderthals mix with them
  to spread over the world  and somewhere in southeast asia they meet denisovans and mix with them and continue on out into the pacific  
 and then these earlier forms of humans disappear  
 but they live on a little bit today in some of us in that people outside of africa have two and a half percent of their dna from neanderthals 
 and people in
  melanesia actually have an additional five percent approximately from the denisovans  
 does this then mean that there is after all some absolute difference between people outside africa and inside africa in that people outside africa 
  have this old component in their genome from these extinct forms of humans  whereas africans do not  
  modern humans emerged somewhere in africa  they spread across africa also of course  
 and there were older earlier forms of humans there and since we mixed elsewhere i 'm pretty sure that one day when we will perhaps have a genome of also these earlier forms 
  in africa  we will find that they have also mixed with early modern humans in africa  
  have we learned from studying genomes of present day humans and
 extinct humans 
 we learn perhaps many things  but one thing that i find sort of important to mention is that i think
 the lesson is that we have always mixed we mixed with these earlier forms of humans  wherever we met them and we mixed with each other ever since
