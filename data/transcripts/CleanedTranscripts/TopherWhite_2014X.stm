  i visited the rainforests of borneo for the very first time
  and as you might imagine  it was the overwhelming sounds of the forest
 that struck me the most there
 's this constant cacophony of noise 
 some things actually do stick out for example this here is a big bird a rhinoceros hornbill  this buzzing is a cicada  
  actually singing to each other over a great distance 
 the place where this was recorded was in fact a gibbon reserve which is why you can hear so many of them  
 but in fact the most important noise that was coming out of the forest that time was one that i didn 't notice and in fact nobody there had actually noticed it 
 so as i said this was a gibbon reserve  they spend most of their time rehabilitating gibbons
  they also have to spend a lot of their time protecting their area from illegal logging that takes place on the side  and so if we take the sound of the forest
 and we actually turn down the gibbons the insects and the rest in the background the entire time in recordings you heard was the sound of a chainsaw
 at great distance  they had three full time guards who were posted posted around this sanctuary whose job was in fact to guard against
  illegal logging  and one day  we went walking again as tourists out into the forest and within five minutes ' walk  we stumbled upon
 somebody who was just sawing a tree down  five minutes ' walk a few hundred meters from the ranger station  
 they hadn 't been able to hear the chainsaws  because as you heard the forest is very very loud it
  as quite unacceptable
 that in this modern time just a few hundred meters away from a ranger station
 in a sanctuary that in fact nobody could hear it when someone who has a chainsaw gets fired up it sounds impossible  but in fact it was quite true  
 so how do we stop illegal logging it 's really tempting as an engineer always to come up with a 
  solution  but in fact you 're in the rainforest it has to be simple  it has to be scalable  and so what we also noticed while were there
  was that everything we needed was already there  we could build a system
 that would allow us to stop this using what 's already there 
 who was there what was already in the forest well  we had people  we had this group there that was dedicated three full time guards that was dedicated to go and stop it  
 but they just needed to know what was happening out in the forest 
  the real surprise this is the big one was that there was connectivity out in the forest there was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere we 're talking hundreds of kilometers from the nearest road there 's
  certainly no electricity  but they had very good cell phone service these people in the towns were on facebook all the time they 're surfing the web on their phones  
  because people can 't hear them  and send an alert  but you have to have a device to go up in the trees so if we can use
 some device to listen to the sounds of the forest  connect to the cell phone network that 's there  
 and send an alert to people on the ground  perhaps we could have a solution to this issue for them  
 but let 's take a moment to talk about saving the rainforest because it 's something that we 've definitely all heard about
 forever people in my generation have heard about saving the rainforest since
 we were kids
  and it seems that the message has never changed we 've got to save the rainforest it 's super urgent this many football fields have been destroyed  yesterday and yet here we are today about half of the rainforest remains  and we have potentially more urgent problems like climate change  
 but in fact  this is the little known fact that i didn 't realize at the time  deforestation accounts
  more greenhouse gas than all of the world 's planes trains cars trucks and ships combined it 's the second highest contributor to climate change 
 also according to interpol as much as ninety percent of the logging that takes place in the rainforest is illegal logging
  like the illegal logging that we saw  so if we can help people in the forest enforce the rules that are there 
 then in fact we could eat heavily into this seventeen percent
 and potentially have a major impact in the short term
  be the cheapest fastest way to fight climate change
 and so here 's the system that we imagine it looks super high tech the moment a sound of a chainsaw is heard in the forest the device picks up the sound of the chainsaw it sends an alert
 through the standard gsm network that 's already there to a ranger in the field
 who can in fact show up in real time and stop the logging it 's no more about going out and finding a tree that 's been cut
 it 's not about seeing a tree from a satellite in an area that 's been clear cut  it 's about real time intervention  
 so i said it was the cheapest and fastest way to do it but in fact  actually as you saw they weren 't able to do it so it may not be so cheap and fast 
 but if the devices in the trees were actually cell phones  it could be pretty cheap cell phones are thrown away
  the hundreds of millions every year hundreds of millions in the u s alone not counting the rest of the world which of course
 we should do  but in fact cell phones are great  they 're full of sensors  they can listen to the sounds of the forest  
 we do have to protect them we have to put them in this box that you see here and we do have to power them  
 powering them is one of the greater engineering challenges that we had to deal with because powering a cell phone under a tree canopy any sort of solar power under a tree canopy was
 as yet unsolved problem  and that 's this unique solar panel design that you see here  which in fact is built also from recycled byproducts of an industrial process these are strips
 that are cut down  so this is
 me putting it all together
 in my parents ' garage actually thanks very much to them for allowing me to do that as you can see  this is
 a device up in a tree what you can see from here
  that they are pretty well obscured up in the tree canopy at a distance that 's important  because although they are able to hear chainsaw noises up to a kilometer in the distance  allowing them to cover about three square kilometers if
 someone were to take them
  it would make the area unprotected  
 so
 does it actually work  well to test it  we took it back to
  not the same place but another place to another gibbon reserve
 that was threatened daily by illegal logging 
 on the very second day  it picked up illegal chainsaw noises  
 we were able to get a real time alert i got an email on my phone actually we had just climbed the tree everyone had just gotten back down all these guys are smoking cigarettes  and then i get an email  
 and they all quiet down  and in fact you can hear the chainsaw
 really really faint in the background but no one had noticed it until that moment
 and so then we took off to actually stop these loggers i was pretty nervous  
 this is the moment where we 've actually arrived close to where the loggers are this is the moment where you can see where i 'm actually regretting perhaps
 the entire endeavor i 'm not really sure what 's on the other side of this hill that guy 's much braver than i am 
  but he went so i had to go  walking up and in fact he made it over the hill  and interrupted the loggers
 in the act 
 for them it was such a surprise they had never ever been interrupted before that it was such an impressive event for them that we 've heard from our partners they have not been back since 
 they were in fact great guys they showed us how the entire operation works  and what they really convinced us on the spot was that if
  can show up in real time and stop people  it 's enough of a deterrent they won 't come back 
 so thank you 
 word of this spread  possibly because we told a lot of people
  and in fact  then some really amazing stuff started to happen people from around the world started to send us emails phone calls
  what we saw was that people throughout asia people throughout
 africa people throughout south america  they told us that they could use it too  and what 's most important what we 'd found that we thought might be exceptional 
 in the forest there was pretty good cell phone service that was not exceptional we were told  and that particularly is on the periphery of the forests that are most under threat  
 and then something really amazing happened which was that people started sending us their own old cell phones  
 so in fact what we have now is a system where we can use people on the ground people who are already there
 who can both improve and use the existing connectivity  and we 're using old cell phones that are being sent to us by people from around the world that want their phones to be doing something else in their afterlife so to speak  
 and if the rest of the device can be completely recycled then we believe it 's an entirely upcycled device 
 so again  this didn 't come because of any sort of
  just came from using what 's already there  and i 'm thoroughly convinced that if it 's not phones 
 that there 's always going to be enough there that you can build similar solutions that can be very effective in new contexts thank you very much
