  it 's not and the answer relies on a formula that all paleontologists use  and i 'm going to tell you the secret 
 first find rocks of the right age
  age  
 second  
 those rocks must be sedimentary rocks  
 and third  layers of those rocks must be naturally exposed  
 that 's it find those three things and get yourself on the ground  chances are good that you will find fossils  
 now let me break down this formula
  organisms exist only during certain geological intervals so you have to find rocks of the right age  depending on what your interests are 
 if you want to find trilobites you have to find the really really old rocks of the paleozoic rocks between a half a billion and a quarter billion years old now if
 you want to find dinosaurs 
 don 't look in the paleozoic you won 't find them they hadn 't evolved yet you have to find the younger rocks of the mesozoic and in the case of dinosaurs between two hundred and
 and sixty six million years ago 
 now it 's fairly easy to find rocks of the right age at this point because the earth is to a coarse degree geologically mapped 
 this is  hard won information  the annals of earth history are written in rocks one chapter upon the next such that the oldest pages are on bottom
 and the youngest on top now were it quite that easy
 geologists would rejoice  it 's not  
 the library of earth is an old one it has no librarian to impose order  
 operating over vast swaths of time  myriad geological processes offer every possible insult
 to the rocks of ages  most pages are
  pages that do find sanctuary under the advancing sands of time
 are never truly safe 
 unlike the moon our dead rocky companion the earth is alive pulsing with creative and destructive forces that power its geological
  lunar rocks brought back by the apollo astronauts all date back to about the age of the solar system  moon rocks
 are forever 
 earth rocks on the other hand face the perils of a living lithosphere 
 all will suffer ruination through some combination of mutilation compression folding tearing  scorching and baking  
 thus the volumes of earth history
  library is vast and magnificent
 but decrepit  
 and it was this tattered complexity in the rock record that obscured its meaning until relatively recently 
 nature provided no card catalog for geologists this would have to be invented 
 five thousand years after the sumerians learned to record their thoughts on clay tablets the earth 's volumes remained inscrutable
  to humans  we were geologically illiterate  unaware of the antiquity of our own planet
 and ignorant of our connection to deep time  it wasn 't until the turn of the  19th century
 that our blinders were removed first with the publication of
  theory of the earth in which he told us that the earth reveals no vestige of a beginning
 and no prospect of an end  
 and then with the printing of william smith 's map of britain  the first country scale geological map  giving us for the first time predictive insight into where certain types of rocks might occur 
 after that you could say things like if we go over there we should be in the jurassic
  if we go up over that hill we should find the cretaceous 
 so now  if you want to find trilobites get yourself a good geological map and go to the rocks of the paleozoic  
 if you want to find dinosaurs like i do find the rocks of mesozoic
 and go there  
 now of course  you can only make a fossil in a sedimentary rock a rock made by sand and mud  
 you can 't have a fossil in an igneous rock formed by magma like a granite or in a metamorphic
  rock that 's been heated and squeezed  and you have to get yourself in a desert  
 it 's not that dinosaurs particularly lived in deserts they lived on every land mass and in every imaginable environment  
 it 's that you need to go to a place that 's a desert today a place that doesn 't have too many plants covering up the rocks and a place where erosion is always exposing new bones at the surface 
 so find those three things
  rocks of the right age that are sedimentary rocks 
 in a desert  and get yourself on the ground  and you literally walk until you see a bone sticking out of the rock
 here 's a picture that i took in southern patagonia every pebble that you see on the ground there
 is a piece of dinosaur bone so when you 're in that right situation it 's not a question of whether you 'll find fossils or not
  to find fossils  the question is will you find something that is scientifically significant  
 and to help with that i 'm going to add a fourth part to our formula which is this 
 get as far away from other paleontologists as possible it
 's not that i don 't like other paleontologists when you go to a place that 's relatively unexplored  you have a much better chance of not only finding fossils but of
  something that 's new to science 
 so that 's my formula for finding dinosaurs and i 've applied it all around the world 
 in the austral summer of two thousand and four i went to the bottom of south america to the bottom of patagonia argentina to prospect for dinosaurs 
 a place that had terrestrial sedimentary rocks of the right age in a desert a place that had been barely visited by paleontologists 
 and we found this
 this is a femur a thigh bone 
 of a giant plant eating dinosaur that bone is two point two meters across that 's over seven feet long 
 now unfortunately that bone was isolated we dug and dug and dug 
 and there wasn 't another bone around but it made us hungry to go back the next year for more and on the first day of that next field season  i found this another
  only this time not isolated this time associated with one hundred and  forty five other bones of a giant plant eater  
 and after three more hard really brutal field seasons  the quarry came to look like this  
 and there you see the tail of that great beast wrapping around me
 the giant that
  feet from snout to tail it stood two and a half stories at the shoulder  and all fleshed out in life it weighed  sixty five tons  
 people ask me sometimes was dreadnoughtus bigger than a t rex that 's the mass of eight or nine t rex 
 now one of the really cool things about being a paleontologist is when you find a new species
  you get to name it  
 and i 've always thought it a shame that these giant plant eating dinosaurs are too often portrayed as passive lumbering platters of meat on the landscape they
 're not 
 big herbivores can be surly  and they can be territorial you do not want to mess with a hippo or a rhino or a water buffalo  the bison in yellowstone injure far more people
  than do the grizzly bears  so can you imagine a big bull 
 in the breeding season  defending a territory  that animal would have been incredibly dangerous a menace to all around and itself
 would have had nothing to fear and thus the name
 an animal like dreadnoughtus would 've had to have been a model of efficiency that long neck and long tail help it radiate heat into the environment  passively controlling its temperature 
 and that long neck also serves as a 
 feeding mechanism dreadnoughtus could stand in one place and with that neck clear out a huge envelope of vegetation taking in tens of thousands of calories while expending very few 
 and these animals evolved a
 stance  giving them immense stability  
 because when you 're sixty five tons when you 're literally as big as a house  the penalty for falling over
 is death  yeah these animals are big and tough but they won 't take a blow like that dreadnoughtus falls over ribs break and pierce lungs  
  you don 't get to fall down in life even once  now after this particular dreadnoughtus carcass was buried
 and de fleshed by a multitude of bacteria  worms and insects its bones underwent a brief metamorphosis exchanging molecules with the groundwater and becoming more and more like the entombing rock 
 as layer upon layer of sediment accumulated pressure from all sides weighed in like a stony glove whose firm and enduring
  grip
 held each bone in a stabilizing embrace  and then came the long nothing  
 epoch after epoch of sameness nonevents without number 
 all the while the skeleton lay everlasting and unchanging in perfect equilibrium
 within its rocky grave  meanwhile earth history
  unfolded above the dinosaurs would reign for another twelve million years before their hegemony was snuffed out
 in a fiery apocalypse  the continents drifted  the mammals rose the ice age came  
 and then in east africa an unpromising species of ape
 evolved the odd trick of sentient thought these brainy primates were not particularly
  fast or strong  
 but they excelled at covering ground 
 and in a remarkable diaspora surpassing even the dinosaurs ' record of territorial conquest they dispersed across the planet ravishing every ecosystem they encountered
 along the way inventing culture and metalworking and painting and dance and music
 and science and rocket ships that would eventually take twelve
 excellent apes to the surface of the moon 
 with seven billion peripatetic homo sapiens on the planet  
 it was perhaps inevitable that one of them would eventually trod on the grave of the magnificent titan buried beneath the badlands of southern patagonia  
  and standing there  
 alone in the desert  it was not lost on me that the chance of any one individual entering the fossil record is vanishingly small 
 but the earth is very very old and over vast tracts of time the improbable becomes the probable that 's the magic of the geological record 
  thus multitudinous creatures living and dying on an old planet leave behind immense numbers of fossils  each one a small miracle 
  collectively inevitable
 sixty six million years ago an asteroid hits the earth and wipes out the dinosaurs 
 this easily might not have been 
 but we only get one history and it 's the one that we have but this particular reality was not inevitable
 the tiniest perturbation of that asteroid far from earth would have caused it to miss our planet by a wide margin  
 the pivotal calamitous day
  during which the dinosaurs were wiped out setting the stage for the modern world as we know it didn 't have to be it could 've just been another day
 a thursday perhaps
 among the sixty three billion days already enjoyed
 by the dinosaurs  but over geological time improbable  nearly impossible events do occur  along the path from our
  ancestors to primates dressed in suits  innumerable forks in the road led us to this very particular
 reality  the bones of dreadnoughtus lay underground for 
  million years who could have imagined that a single species
 of shrew like mammal living in the cracks of the dinosaur world would evolve into sentient beings capable of characterizing and understanding the
  very dinosaurs they must have dreaded 
 i once stood at the head of the missouri river
 and bestraddled it there it 's nothing more than a gurgle of water that issues forth from beneath a rock
 in a boulder in a pasture  high in the bitterroot mountains  the stream next to it runs a few hundred yards
 and ends in a small pond
 those two streams
 they look identical  but one is an anonymous trickle of water  and the other is the missouri river 
 now go down to the mouth of the missouri near st louis and it 's pretty obvious that that river is a big deal  
 but go up into the bitterroots and look at the missouri
  does not allow us to see it as anything special  
 now go back to the cretaceous period and look at our tiny fuzzball ancestors you would never guess that they would amount to anything special and they probably wouldn 't have 
 were it not for that pesky asteroid 
 now make a thousand more worlds and a thousand more solar systems and let them run 
 you will never get the same result no doubt those worlds would be both amazing and amazingly improbable but they
  not be our world and they would not have our history there are an infinite number of histories that we could 've had we only get one and wow did we ever get a good one 
 dinosaurs like dreadnoughtus were real  sea monsters like the mosasaur were real  
 dragonflies with the wingspan of an eagle and pill bugs the length of a car
 car really existed  
 why study the ancient past  because it gives us perspective
 and humility
 the dinosaurs died in the world 's fifth mass extinction  snuffed out in a cosmic accident through no fault of their own 
 they didn 't see it coming and they didn 't have a choice  
  other hand 
 do have a choice  and the nature of the fossil record tells us that our place on this planet is both precarious and potentially fleeting 
 right now  our species is propagating an environmental disaster of geological proportions that is so broad and so severe it can rightly be called the sixth extinction 
 only unlike the dinosaurs we can see it coming  and unlike the dinosaurs
  do something about it that choice is ours
