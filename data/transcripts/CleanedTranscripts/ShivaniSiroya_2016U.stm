  how much do you need to know about a person before you 'd feel comfortable making a loan 
 suppose you wanted to lend one thousand dollars to the person sitting two rows behind you what would you need to know about that person
 before you 'd feel comfortable 
 my mom came to the us from india in her late thirties  
 she 's a doctor in brooklyn and she often lets friends and neighbors come to see her for health services whether they can pay right away or not 
 i remember running into her patients with her at the grocery store or on the sidewalk and sometimes they would come and pay her right on the spot for previous appointments 
 she would thank them and ask them about their families and their health 
 she gave them credit
 because she trusted them most of us are like my mom we would give credit to someone we know
 or that we live next to but most of us are probably not going to lend to a stranger unless we know a little something about them  
 banks credit card companies and other financial institutions
  't know us on a personal level but they do have a way of trusting us and that 's through our credit scores 
 our credit scores have been created through an aggregation and analysis of our public consumer credit data 
 and because of them we have pretty much easy access to all of the goods and services that we need from getting electricity to buying a home or taking a risk and starting a
  there are two point five billion people around the world that don 't have a credit score that 's a third of the world 's population 
 they don 't have a score because there are no formal public records on them
 no bank accounts no credit histories and no social security numbers  and because they don 't have a score  they don 't have access to the credit or financial products that can improve their
  lives they are not trusted  
 so we wanted to find a way to build trust and to open up financial access for these two point five billion 
 so we created a mobile application that builds credit scores for them
 using mobile data there are currently over one billion smartphones in emerging markets and
  people are using them the same way that we do 
 they 're texting their friends they 're looking up directions they 're browsing the internet and they 're even making financial transactions 
 over time this data is getting captured on our phones  and it provides a really rich picture of a person 's life 
 our customers give us access to this data and we capture it through our mobile application it helps us understand the
  creditworthiness of people like jenipher a small business owner in nairobi kenya
  years old and for decades has been running a food stall in the central business district 
 she has three sons who she put through vocational school  and she 's also the leader of her local chama  or
  's food stall does well  she makes just enough every day to cover her expenses  but she 's not financially secure  
 any emergency could force her into debt  
 and she has no discretionary income to improve her family 's way of living for emergencies or for investing into growing her business  
 if jenipher wants credit her options are limited
  she could get a microloan  but she 'd have to form a group that could help vouch for her credibility 
 and even then the loan sizes would be way too small to really have an impact on her business  averaging around one hundred and fifty dollars 
 loan sharks are always an option  but with interest rates that are well above three hundred percent  they 're financially risky 
 and because jenipher doesn 't have collateral or a credit history  she can 't walk into a bank and ask for
  business loan  but one day jenipher 's son convinced her to download our application and apply for a loan
 jenipher answered a few questions on her phone and she gave us access to a few key data points on her device  and here 's what we saw  
 so bad news first
  had a low savings balance and no previous loan history 
 these are factors that would have thrown up a red flag to a traditional bank  but there were other points in her history that showed us a much richer picture of her potential  
 so for one we saw that she made regular phone calls to her family in uganda 
 well it turns out that the data shows a four percent increase in repayment among people who consistently
  communicate with a few close contacts 
 we could also see that though she traveled around a lot throughout the day 
 she actually had pretty regular travel patterns  and she was either at home or at her food stall 
 and the data shows a six percent increase in repayment among customers who are consistent with where they spend most of their time  
 we could also
  see that she communicated a lot with many different people throughout the day and that she had a strong support network  
 our data shows that people who communicate with more than fifty eight different contacts tend to be more likely to be good borrowers 
 in jenipher 's case  she communicated with eighty nine different individuals which showed a nine percent increase in her repayment
 these are just some of the thousands of different data points that we look at to understand a person 's creditworthiness 
 and after analyzing all of these different data points we took the first risk and gave jenipher a loan 
 this is data that would not be found on a paper trail or in any formal financial record  but it proves trust
  by looking beyond income we can see that people in emerging markets that may seem risky and unpredictable on the surface are actually willing and have the capacity to repay 
 our credit scores have helped us deliver over two hundred thousand loans in kenya in just the past year  and our repayment rates are above ninety percent
 which by the way
  way is in line with traditional bank repayment rates 
 with something as simple as a credit score  we 're giving people the power to build their own futures 
 our customers have used their loans for family expenses emergencies travel and for investing back into growing their businesses  
 they 're now building better economies and communities where more
  people can succeed 
 over the past two years of using our product jenipher has increased her savings by sixty percent  she 's also started two additional food stalls and is now making plans for her own restaurant  
 she 's applying for a small business loan from a commercial bank because she now has the credit history to prove she deserves it 
 i saw
  in nairobi just last week  and she told me how excited she was to get started she said 
 only my son believed i could do this i didn 't think this was for me 
 she 's lived her whole life believing
 that there was a part of the world that was closed off to her our job now is to open the world to
  and the billions like her that deserve to be trusted thank you
