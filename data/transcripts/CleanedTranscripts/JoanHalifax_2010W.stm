  i want to address the issue of compassion  
 compassion has many faces  some of them are fierce some of them are wrathful  some of them are tender  some of them are wise a
  that the dalai lama once said he said love and compassion
 are necessities they are not luxuries  without them humanity cannot survive 
 and i would suggest it is not only humanity that won 't survive  but it is all species on the planet as we 've heard today 
 it is the big cats  and it 's the plankton  
 two weeks ago i was in bangalore in india
  so privileged to be able to teach in
 a hospice on the outskirts of bangalore and early in the morning  i went into the ward 
 in that hospice there were  thirty one men and women who were actively dying 
 and i walked up to the bedside of an old woman who was
 breathing very rapidly  fragile obviously in the
  latter phase of active dying  
 i looked into her face  i looked into the face of her son sitting next to her and his face was just riven with grief
 and confusion  and i remembered
 a line from the
  the most wondrous thing in the world  yudhisthira and yudhisthira replied the most wondrous thing in the world
 is that all around us people can be dying and we don 't realize it can happen to us
  i looked up 
 tending those thirty one dying people
 were young women from villages around bangalore  
 i looked into the face of one of these women and i saw in her face the strength
 that arises when natural compassion is really present i watched her hands
  as she bathed an old man my gaze went to another young woman
 as she wiped the face
 of another dying person 
 and it reminded me of something that i had just been present for every year or so i have the privilege of taking clinicians into the himalayas and the tibetan plateau and
  we run clinics in these very remote regions where there 's no medical care whatsoever  
 and on the first day at simikot in humla  far west of nepal the most impoverished region of nepal 
 an old man came in
 clutching clutching a bundle of rags  and he walked in and somebody said something to him we realized he was deaf
  and we looked into the rags and there was this pair of eyes 
 the rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned  
 again  the eyes and hands of avalokiteshvara  it was the
  the health aids 
 who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the the wounds 
 i know those hands and eyes  they touched me as well  they touched me at that time they have touched me throughout my sixty eight years 
 they touched me when i was four and i lost my eyesight and was partially paralyzed 
 and my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave
 to take care of me
  that woman
 did not have sentimental compassion  
 she had phenomenal strength 
 and it was really her strength  i believe that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur that has been a guiding light in my life 
 so we can ask
 what
 is compassion comprised of and there are various facets and there 's
 referential and non referential compassion but
 first compassion is comprised of that capacity
 to see clearly into the nature of suffering it is that ability to really stand strong
 and to recognize also that i 'm not separate from this suffering  but that is not enough because compassion which activates the motor cortex
  that we aspire 
 we actually aspire to transform suffering and if we 're so blessed we engage in activities that transform suffering  
 but compassion has another component and that component is really essential 
 that component is that we cannot be attached to
  i worked with dying people for over forty years  i had the privilege of working
 on death row in a maximum security [ prison ] for six years  and i realized so clearly in
 bringing my own life experience from working with dying people and training caregivers that any attachment to outcome
 would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the
  whole catastrophe  and when i worked in the prison system  it was so clear to me this that many of us
 in this room and almost all of the men that i worked with on death row the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered 
 that compassion is actually an inherent human quality 
 it is there within every human being
  but the conditions for compassion to be
 activated to be aroused 
 are particular conditions  i had that condition to a certain extent from my own childhood illness 
 eve ensler whom you 'll hear later 
 has had that condition
 activated amazingly in her
 through the various
 waters of suffering that she has been through and what is fascinating
 is that compassion has enemies and those enemies are things like pity  
 moral outrage 
 fear  and you know we have a society a world that is paralyzed by fear
 and in that paralysis of course our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed  the very word terror
 is global  
 the very feeling of terror is global 
 so our work in a certain way is to address this imago 
 this kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche of our entire globe
  now we know from neuroscience
 that compassion has some very extraordinary qualities for example 
 a person who is cultivating compassion  when they are in the presence of suffering  
 they feel that suffering a lot more than many other people do 
  they return to baseline a lot sooner this is called resilience many of us think that compassion drains us but i promise you
 it is something that truly enlivens us 
 another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what 's called neural integration it hooks up all parts of the brain 
  which has been discovered by
 various researchers at emory and at davis and so on is that compassion enhances our immune system 
 hey we live in a very noxious world most of us are shrinking
 in the face of  psycho social and physical poisons of the toxins of our world  but compassion the generation of compassion
 our immunity you
 know if compassion is so good for us  i have a question  
 why don 't we train our children in compassion 
 if compassion is so good for us  why don 't we
  train our health care providers in compassion so that they can do what they 're supposed to do  which is to really transform suffering  
 and if compassion is so good for us  why don 't we vote
 on compassion  why don 't we vote for
 people in our government based on compassion so that we can have a more caring world
 in buddhism 
 we say it takes a strong back and a soft front 
 it takes tremendous strength of the back to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions and that is the mental quality of equanimity  
 but it also takes a soft front the capacity to really be open to the world as it is to have an undefended heart 
 and the archetype of this in
  buddhism is avalokiteshvara kuan yin it 's a female archetype 
 she who perceives the cries of suffering
 in the world 
 she stands with ten thousand arms 
 and in every hand there is an instrument of liberation
  and in the palm of every hand there are eyes and these are the eyes of wisdom  i say that for thousands of years women
 have lived  exemplified  met in intimacy the archetype
 of kuan yin she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world
  women have manifested for thousands of years the strength
 arising from compassion in in an unfiltered unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is 
 they have infused societies with kindness  and we have really
 felt that
 as woman after woman has stood on this stage in the past day and a half  
 and they have actualized compassion through direct action  
 jody williams called it it
 's good to meditate i 'm sorry  you 've got to do a little bit of that jody step back give your mother a break okay 
 but the other side of the equation is you 've got to come out of your cave  you have to come into the world
  like asanga did who was looking to realize maitreya buddha after twelve years
 sitting in the cave he said i 'm out of here he 's going down the path  
 he sees something in the path  he looks it 's a dog he drops to his knees he sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg
  the wound is just filled with maggots  he puts out his tongue
 in order to remove the maggots so as not to harm them and at that moment the dog transformed
 into the buddha of love and kindness  
 i believe that women and girls today have to partner in a powerful way with men
 with their fathers
  with their sons with their brothers with the plumbers the road builders the caregivers the doctors the lawyers 
 with our president  and with all beings  
 the women in this room are lotuses in a sea of fire  may we actualize that capacity for women
