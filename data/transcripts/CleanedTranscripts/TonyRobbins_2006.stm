  tell you i 'm both challenged and excited  my excitement is i get
 a chance to give something back my challenge is the shortest seminar i usually do is fifty hours 
  i 'm not exaggerating i do weekends i do more obviously i also coach people but i 'm into immersion because how did you learn language
 not just by learning principles you got in it and you did it so often that it became real the bottom line of why i 'm here besides being a crazy mofo is that i 
  not here to motivate you you don 't need that obviously often that 's what people think i do and it 's the furthest thing from it what happens though is people say
  know why you do what you do what is your motive for action  
 what is it that drives you in your life today not ten years ago are you running the same pattern  because i believe that the invisible force of internal drive  
 activated is the most important thing i 'm here because i believe emotion is the force of life 
  we all know how to think with our minds we can rationalize anything we can make anything happen  i agree with what was described a few days ago that people work in their self interest but we know that that 's bullshit at times  
 you don 't work in your self interest all the time  
 because when emotion comes into it the wiring changes in the way it functions
 so it 's wonderful to think intellectually about how the life of the world is especially those who are very smart can play
  this game in our head but i really want to know what 's driving you what i would like to invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore where you are today for two reasons one so that you can contribute more 
 and two that hopefully we can not just understand other people more  but appreciate them more and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face today they 're only going to get
  magnified by the very technology that connects us 
 because it 's making us intersect  that intersection doesn 't always create a view of everybody now understands everybody and everybody appreciates everybody  
 i 've had an obsession basically for thirty years 
  what makes the difference in the quality of people 's lives 
 what in their performance i got hired to produce the result now i 've done it for thirty years  
 i get the phone call when the athlete is burning down on national television  and they were ahead by five strokes
  and now they can 't get back on the course i 've got to do something right now or nothing matters  i get the phone call when the child is going to commit suicide i 
  years i 'm very grateful to tell you i 've never lost one it doesn 't mean i won 't some day  but i haven 't yet the reason is an understanding of these human needs 
 when i get those calls about performance that 's one thing how do you make a change i 'm also looking to see
 what is shaping the person 's ability to contribute 
 to do something beyond themselves maybe the real question is i look at life and say there 's two master lessons one is 
 there 's the science of achievement which almost everyone here has mastered amazingly  how do you take the invisible and make it visible
 that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment  
 because science is easy right we know the rules you write the code  and you get the results once you know the game you just up the ante don 't you  
 but when it comes to fulfillment that 's an art  the reason is it 's about appreciation and contribution  you can only feel so much by yourself 
 i 've had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the real question
 those people that you 've given everything to like all the resources they say they need you gave not a 100 dollar computer but the best computer you gave them love joy were there to comfort them
 those people very often you know some of them end up the rest of their life with all this love education money and background going in and out of rehab
 and not always but often they become some of the people that contribute the most to society 
 the question we 've got to ask ourselves really is 
 what is it  what is it that shapes us we live in a therapy culture most of us don 't do that but the culture 's a therapy culture the mindset that we are our past 
 and  you wouldn 't be in this room if you bought that but most of society thinks biography is destiny  
 the past equals the future
  course it does if you live there  but what we know and what we have to remind ourselves because you can know something intellectually and then not use it not apply it
  ask people why didn 't you achieve something somebody who 's working for you
 or a partner or even yourself when you fail to achieve what 's the reason people say what do they tell you didn 't have the knowledge didn 't have the money didn 't have the time
 didn 't have the technology i didn 't have the
  including the supreme court have
  a claim to you missing resources  
 and they may be accurate you may not have the money or the supreme court  but that is not the defining factor 
 and you correct me if i 'm wrong
  the defining factor is never resources it 's resourcefulness and what i mean specifically
  just some phrase is if you have emotion human emotion something that i experienced from you the
 day before yesterday at a level that is as profound as i 've ever experienced and i believe with that emotion you would have beat his ass and won
  when we watched the debate at that time there were emotions that blocked people 's ability to get this man 's intellect and capacity and the way that it came across to some people on that day because i know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn 't  
 and i was upset  
 but there was emotion there do you know what i 'm talking about say aye audience aye tr 
 so emotion
  is it and if we get the right emotion  we can get ourselves to do anything if you 're creative playful fun enough can you get through to anybody yes or no  
 if you don 't have the money but you 're creative and determined you find the way this is the ultimate resource but this is not the story that people tell us
 they tell us a bunch of different stories they tell us we don 't have the resources but ultimately  if you take a look here
  but i appreciated the energy i 'll tell you that 
 what determines your resources we 've said decisions shape destiny which is my focus here 
 if decisions shape destiny what determines it is three decisions what will you focus on  you have to decide what you 're going to focus on consciously or unconsciously the minute you decide to focus you must give it a meaning 
 and that meaning produces emotion is this the end or the beginning
 is god punishing me or rewarding me or is this the roll of the dice an emotion creates what we 're going to do  or the action 
 so think about your own life the decisions that have shaped your destiny  
 and that sounds really heavy but in the last five or ten years have there been some decisions that if you 'd made a different decision your life would be completely different 
 how many can think
  so the bottom line is maybe it was where to go to work and you met the love of your life there a career decision i know the google geniuses i saw here
 i mean i understand that their decision was to sell their technology  what if they made that decision versus to build their own culture how would the world or their lives be different their impact 
 the history of our world is these decisions when a woman stands up and says
  standing in front of a tank or being in a position like lance armstrong you 've got testicular cancer that 's pretty tough for any male especially if you ride a bike 
 you 've got it in your brain you 've got it in your lungs  but what was his decision of what to focus on different than most people what did it mean it wasn 't the end it was the beginning he goes off and wins seven championships he never once won before the cancer because he got emotional fitness
 psychological strength that 's the difference in human beings that i 've seen of the three million i 've been around in my lab i 've had three million people from eighty countries 
  the last twenty nine years  and after a while patterns become obvious you see that south america and africa may be connected in a certain way
  it wasn 't your ability it was your state your model of the world is what shapes you long term your model of the world is the filter that 's what 's shaping
  us  it makes people make decisions to influence somebody we need to know what already influences them
 it 's made up of three parts first what 's your target what are you after  it 's not your desires you can get your desires or goals who has ever got a goal or desire and thought is this all there 
 it 's needs we have i believe there are six human needs
  once you know what the target that 's driving you is and you uncover it for the truth you don 't form it
 then you find out what 's your map what 's the belief systems that tell you how to get those needs some people think the way to get them is to destroy the world some people to build create something love someone
 there 's the fuel you pick  so very quickly six needs let me tell you what they are first one certainty
 these are not goals or desires these are universal  everyone needs certainty they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable now how do you get it control everybody  develop a skill give
  up  smoke a cigarette and
 if you got totally certain ironically even though we need that you 're not certain about your health or your children or money if
 you 're not sure the ceiling will hold up you won 't listen to any speaker 
 while we go for certainty differently if we get total certainty we get what what do you feel if you 're certain you know what will happen when and how it will happen what would you feel
  you like the surprises you want  
 the ones you don 't want you call problems but you need them 
 so variety is important have you ever rented a video or a film that you 've already seen who 's done this 
 get a fucking life
  it 's good because you read or saw it before but you 're hoping it 's been long enough you 've forgotten and there 's variety  
 third human need critical significance  we all need to feel important special unique you can get it by making more money or being more spiritual you can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places humans don 't want to know 
 whatever it takes
 fastest way
 to do this if you have no background no culture no belief and resources or resourcefulness is violence 
 if i put a gun to your head and i live in the ' hood  instantly i 'm significant zero to ten how high ten  how certain am i that you 're going to respond to me  ten  
 how much uncertainty who knows what 's going to happen next kind of exciting like climbing up into a cave and doing that stuff all the way down there total variety and uncertainty  and it 's significant isn 't it so
 you want to risk your life for it 
 so that 's why violence has always been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a
  species you can get significance a million ways but to be significant you 've got to be unique and different here 's what we really need connection and love fourth need  
 we all want it most settle for connection love 's too scary who here has been hurt in an intimate relationship  
 if you don 't raise your hand you 've had other shit too 
 and you 're going to get
  you glad you came to this positive visit
 here 's what 's true we need it  we can do it through intimacy friendship prayer through walking in nature if nothing else works for you don 't get a cat get a dog because if you leave for two minutes it 's like you 've been gone six months when you come back five minutes later 
 these first four needs every human finds a way to meet even if you lie to yourself
 and this is where fulfillment comes you won 't get it from the first four you 'll figure a way smoke drink do whatever  meet the first four  but number five you must grow  
 we all know the answer if you don 't grow you 're what if
 a relationship or business is not growing if you 're not growing doesn 't matter how much money or friends you have how many love you you feel like hell and i believe the
  is so we have something to give of value  
 because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves 
 because we all know corny as that sounds the secret to living is giving  
 we all know life is not about me it 's about we this culture knows that this room knows that it 's exciting  when you see nicholas talking about his $ one hundred computer the most exciting thing is here 's a genius 
 but he 's got a calling now you can feel the difference in him and it 's
  that calling can touch other people my life was touched because when i was eleven years old thanksgiving no money no food  
 we were not going to starve but my father was totally messed up my mom was letting him know how bad he messed up 
 and somebody came to the door and delivered food  
 my father made three decisions i know what they were briefly his focus was this is charity  what does it mean i 'm worthless what do i have to do  leave my family which he did it was
  the most painful experiences of life my three decisions gave me a different path i set focus on there 's food what a concept laughter
 but this is what changed my life shaped me as a human being somebody 's gift i don 't even know who it is my father always said no one gives a shit 
 and now somebody i don 't know they 're not asking for anything just giving us food looking out for us it made me believe this that strangers
  that made me decide if strangers care about me and my family i care about them i 'm going
 to do something to make a difference so when i was seventeen i went out on thanksgiving it was my target for years to have enough money to feed two families the most fun and moving thing i ever did in my life
 next year i did four then eight i didn 't tell anybody what i was doing i wasn 't doing it for brownie points  but after eight i thought i could use some help 
 so  i went out got my friends involved then i grew companies got eleven and i built the foundation
  eighteen years later i 'm proud to tell you last year we fed two million people in thirty five countries through our foundation all during the holidays thanksgiving christmas in different countries around the world thank you 
 i don 't tell you that to brag but because i 'm proud of human beings because they get excited to contribute once they 've had the chance to experience it not talk about
  about out of time  the target that shapes you
 here 's what 's different about people we have the same needs  but are you a certainty freak is that what you value most or uncertainty 
 this man couldn 't be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves 
 are you driven by significance or love  we all need all six but what your lead system is tilts you in a different direction and as you move in a direction you have a destination or destiny  
  the operating system tells you how to get there and some people 's map is i 'm going to save lives even if i die for other people and they 're a fireman and somebody else says i 'm going to kill people to do it 
 they 're trying to meet the same needs of significance  they want to
 honor god or honor their family  but they have a different map  and there are seven different beliefs i can 't go through them because i 'm done the last piece is
 emotion one of the parts of the map is like time some people 's idea of a long time is one hundred years somebody else 's is three seconds which is what i have
  and the last one i 've already mentioned that fell to you if you 've got a target and a map
 i can 't use google because i love macs and they haven 't made it good for macs yet so if you use mapquest how many have made this fatal mistake of using it you
 use this thing and you don 't get there imagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go laughter
  about emotion there are six thousand emotions that we have words for in the english language which is just a linguistic representation that changes by language  but
 if your dominant emotions if i have twenty thousand people or one thousand and i have them write down all the emotions that they experience in an average week  
 and i give them as long as they need and on one side they write empowering emotions the other 's disempowering guess how many emotions they experience less
  oh shit frustrated frustrated overwhelmed depressed how many of you know somebody who no matter what happens finds a way to get pissed off
  simultaneously for a program i was conducting for a week  the night before was called emotional mastery i got up had no plan for this and i said
 we had fireworks i do crazy shit fun stuff and at the end i stopped i had this plan but i never know what i 'm going to say  and all of a sudden i said when do people really start to live 
 when they face death and i went through this whole thing about if you weren 't going to get off this island if nine days from now you were going to die
  who would you call what would you say what would you do
 that night is when nine eleven happened 
 one woman had come to the seminar and when she came there her previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered
 her new boyfriend wanted to marry her and she said no he said if you go to that hawaii thing it 's over with us she said it 's over when i finished that night she called him and left a message at the top
 of the world trade center where he worked saying i love you
 want you to know i want to marry you it was stupid of me she was asleep  because it was three a m for us  when he called her back and said honey i can 't tell you what this means
  i don 't know how to tell you this but you gave me the greatest gift because i 'm going to die 
 and she played the recording for us in the room she was on larry king later  and he said you 're probably wondering how on earth this could happen to you twice all i can say is
 this must be god 's message
  to you from now on  every day  give your all love your all don 't let anything ever stop you 
 she finishes and a man stands up and he says i 'm from pakistan i 'm a muslim i 'd love to hold your hand and say i 'm sorry but frankly this is retribution 
 i can 't tell you the rest because i 'm out of time
  all i can tell you is i brought this man on stage with a man from new york who worked in the world trade center because i had about two hundred new yorkers there  more than fifty lost their entire companies friends
  marking off their palm pilots one financial trader woman made of steel bawling
 thirty friends crossing off that all died and i said what are we going to focus on  
 what does this mean and what are we going to do and
 i got the group to focus on if you didn 't lose somebody today  your focus is going to be how to serve somebody else
 then one woman stood up and was so angry  screaming and yelling i found out she wasn 't from new york she 's not an american doesn
  guilty people got guilty sad people got sad i took these two men and i did an indirect negotiation 
 jewish man with family in the occupied territory someone in new york who would have died if he was at work that day  
 and this man who wanted to be a terrorist and i made it very clear 
 this integration is on a film which i 'd be happy to send you instead of my verbalization but the two of them not only came together and changed their beliefs and models of the world but worked together to bring for almost four years now
  and synagogues the idea of how to create peace and he wrote a book called my jihad my way of peace so transformation can happen my invitation to you is 
 explore your web  the web in here
 the needs the beliefs the emotions that are controlling you for two reasons so there 's more of you to give and achieve
  but i mean give because that 's what 's going to fill you up and secondly so you can appreciate not just understand that 's intellectual that 's the mind but appreciate
 what 's driving other people it 's the only way our world 's going to change god bless you thank you
