  i was born
 on the last day of the last year of the ' 70s 
 i was raised on free to be you and me 
  my dad facetiously says we wanted to save the world and instead we just got rich
  we actually just got middle class in colorado springs colorado but you get the picture 
 i was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy 
 at this ripe old age of thirty i 've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up in this
 horrible  beautiful time  and
  for me it 's been a real journey and paradox the first paradox is that growing up is about rejecting the past and then promptly reclaiming it 
 feminism was the water i grew up in 
 when i was just a little girl  my mom started what is now the longest running women 's film festival in the world  
 so while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons i was watching very
  esoteric documentaries made by and about women
 you can see how this had an influence but she was not the only feminist in the house 
 my dad actually resigned from the male only business club in my hometown because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day welcome his son  but 
  not his daughter 
 he 's actually
  the trick here is my brother would become an experimental poet not a businessman but the intention was really good 
 in any case  i didn 't readily claim the feminist label even though it was all around me because i associated it with my mom 's women 's groups her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads
 none of which had much cachet in the hallways of palmer high school where i was trying
  to be cool at the time
  but i suspected there was something really important about this whole feminism thing so i started covertly tiptoeing into my mom 's bookshelves and picking books off and reading them never of course admitting that i was doing so 
 i didn 't actually claim the feminist label until i went to barnard college
 and i heard amy richards and jennifer baumgardner speak for the first time they were the co authors of a book called
  manifesta so what
 very profound epiphany you might ask was responsible for my feminist click moment
  fishnet stockings
  jennifer baumgardner was wearing them i thought they were really hot i decided okay i can claim the feminist label now i tell you this
 i tell you this at the risk of
  embarrassing myself because i think part of the work of feminism is to admit that aesthetics that beauty that fun do matter
  there are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness  
 anyone heard of these two guys as an example 
 so my feminism is very indebted to my mom 's but it looks very different my mom says
  things go into our experiences of what it means to be a woman pay equity yes absolutely a feminist issue  but for me so is immigration 
 thank you 
 my mom says
  read feminist publication ever
 and i tell you this because i think it 's really important to see that there 's a continuum 
 feminist blogging is basically the 21st century version of consciousness raising
  but we also have a straightforward political impact feministing has been able to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of
  we got a misogynist administrator sending us hate mail fired from a big ten school and
 one of our biggest successes is we get mail from
 teenage girls in the middle of iowa who say i googled jessica simpson and stumbled on your site i realized feminism wasn 't about man hating and birkenstocks so we 're able to
 pull in the next generation in a totally new way my mom says
  ann friedman jessica valenti vanessa valenti and on and on and on and on we don 't want one hero  we don 't want one icon we don 't want one face 
 we are thousands of women and men across this country doing online writing
  community organizing changing institutions from the inside out all continuing the
  which brings me to the second paradox  sobering up about our smallness
 and maintaining faith in our greatness all at once many in my generation because of well intentioned parenting and self esteem education
 were socialized to believe that we were special
  who were going to go out and save the world these are three words many of us were raised with 
 we walk across graduation stages high on our overblown expectations 
 and when we float back down to earth we realize we don 't know what the heck it means to actually save the world anyway 
 the mainstream media often paints my generation as apathetic and i think it 's much more accurate to say we are deeply overwhelmed
  and there 's a
  lot to be overwhelmed about to be fair an environmental crisis  wealth disparity in this country unlike we 've seen since 
 and globally 
 a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity xenophobia 's on the rise the trafficking of women and girls it 's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed
 i experienced this firsthand myself when i graduated from barnard college in two thousand and two i was fired up i was ready to
  make a difference i went out and i
 worked at a non profit i went to grad school i phone banked i protested i volunteered
  and none of it seemed to matter and
 on a particularly dark night of december of two thousand and four i sat down with my family  and i said
 that i had become very
  i admitted that i 'd actually had a fantasy kind of a dark fantasy of writing a letter about everything that was wrong with the world
 and then lighting myself on fire on the white house steps my mom
 took a drink of her signature sea breeze 
 her eyes really welled with tears and she looked right at me and she said i will not stand
 for your desperation
 she said you are smarter more creative and more resilient than that 
 which brings me to my third paradox  
 growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly and being fulfilled by failing really well 
 there 's a writer i 've been
 deeply influenced by parker palmer and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed between arrogant overestimation of ourselves and a servile underestimation of ourselves 
 you may have guessed by now i did not light myself on fire
 i did what i know to do in desperation which is write  i wrote the book i needed to read
 i wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work 
  the daughter of detroit and two civil rights activists who 's dedicating her life to environmental justice  i wrote about emily apt who initially became a caseworker in the welfare 
  system because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do but quickly learned not only did she not like it but she wasn 't really good at it instead what she really wanted to do was make films  so she made a film about the welfare system and had a huge impact  
  so she could afford college she was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp and went on 
 a group called the service women 's action network 
 what i learned from these people and others was that i couldn 't judge them based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals many of them are working in deeply intractable systems the military
  the education system etc  but what they managed to do within those systems was be a humanizing force  
 and at the end of the day what could possibly be more important than that 
 cornel west says of course it 's a failure but how good a failure is it 
 this isn 't to say we give up our wildest biggest dreams it 's to say we operate on two levels on one we really go after changing these broken systems of which we find ourselves a part 
 but on the other we root our
 our self esteem in the daily acts of trying to make one person 's day more kind more just etc  
 so when i was a little girl i had a couple of very strange habits one of them was
 i used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home and i would suck the thumb of my left hand and hold my mom 's cold toes with my right hand 
 i was listening to her talk on the phone which she did a lot she was
  talking about board meetings she was founding peace organizations
  she was coordinating carpools she was consoling friends all these daily acts of care and creativity  
 and surely at three and four years old i was listening to the soothing sound of her voice but i think i was also getting my first lesson in activist work 
 the activists i interviewed had nothing in common literally except for one thing which was that they all cited their mothers
 as their most looming and important activist influences so often particularly at a young age we look far afield
 for our models of the meaningful life and sometimes they 're in our our own kitchens  talking on the phone making us dinner doing all that keeps the world
 going around and around
  my mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory  or certainty  or security even 
 it 's about embracing the paradox it 's about acting in the face of overwhelm and it 's about loving people really well  
 and at the end of the day these things make for a lifetime of challenge and reward 
 thank you
