  most likely largest inventions of our generation
 are the internet and the mobile phone  they 've changed the world  
  largely to our surprise  they also turned out to be
 the perfect tools
 for the surveillance state  
 it turned out that the capability to collect data information and connections
 about basically any of us and all of us
 is exactly what we 've been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about western
  intelligence agencies  mostly u s intelligence agencies  watching over the rest of the world 
 we 've heard about these starting with the
 revelations from june six  edward snowden started leaking information  top secret classified information from
  and we started learning about things like prism
 and xkeyscore and others  
 and these are examples of the kinds of programs u s intelligence agencies
 are running right now against the whole rest of the world  
 and if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by george orwell 
 well it turns out that george orwell was an optimist
 we are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined 
 and this here is the infamous nsa data center in utah  due to be opened
  it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center you could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting  
 and it 's a pretty big building 
 how big well i can give you the numbers one hundred and forty thousand square meters but that doesn 't really tell you very much 
 maybe it 's better to imagine it as a comparison you think about the largest ikea store you 've ever been
  this is five times larger 
 how many hard drives can you fit in an ikea store right it
 's pretty big  we estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year  
 and this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data
 and keep it basically forever keep it for
  extended periods of time  keep it for years  keep it for decades  and this opens up completely new kinds of risks
 to us all and what this is is that it is wholesale wholesale blanket surveillance
 on everyone  
 well not exactly
  intelligence only has a legal right
 to monitor foreigners 
 they can monitor foreigners when foreigners ' data connections end up in the united states or pass through the united states  and monitoring foreigners doesn 't sound too bad until you realize
 that i 'm a foreigner and you 're a foreigner in fact ninety six percent of the planet
  it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us all of us who use telecommunications and the internet  
 but don 't get me wrong  there are actually types of surveillance that are okay  
 i love freedom  but even i agree that some surveillance is fine if the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer
 trying to catch
 a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting  
 and they have leads and they have suspects then it 's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect 's phone  and to intercept his internet communications i
 'm not arguing that at all but that 's not what programs like prism are about
  they are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings they 're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent  
 so the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this well the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations 
 there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations saying that we knew all this already we knew it was happening  there 's nothing new here
  that 's not true don 't let anybody tell you
 that we knew this already  because we did not know this already 
 our worst fears might have been something like this  but we didn 't know this was happening now we know for a fact it 's happening  we didn 't know about this  we didn 't know about prism we
  we did not know about skywriter all these different programs run by u s intelligence agencies  but now we do and
 we did not know
 that u s intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose  
 and what that means
 is that you take something which is secure an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file  nobody can decrypt that file even 
  if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file  it 's going to take millions of years  so that 's basically perfectly safe uncrackable you take something which is that good 
 and then you weaken it on purpose  making all of us
 less secure as an end result a real world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force
 some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because you know bad people might have house alarms but it will also make all of us
 less secure as an end result
  encryption algorithms just boggles the mind  
 but of course these intelligence agencies are doing their job this is what they have been told to do do signals intelligence monitor 
 telecommunications monitor internet traffic that 's what they 're trying to do and since most a very big part of the internet traffic today is encrypted  they 're trying to find ways around the encryption one way is to sabotage encryption algorithms which is a great example
  how u s intelligence agencies are running loose  they are completely out of control  and they should be brought back
 under control  
 so what do we actually know about the leaks everything is based on the files leaked by mr snowden 
 the very first
 prism slides from the beginning of june detail a
  collection program where the data is collected from service providers and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to they even have a specific date 
 on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers  so for example they name the collection from microsoft started on september eleven
 two thousand and seven
  and every single one of these companies denies  they all say
 that this simply isn 't true that they are not giving backdoor access to their data  yet
 we have these files so is one of the parties lying or is there some other alternative explanation
 and one explanation would be that these parties these service providers 
 are not cooperating  instead  they 've been hacked 
 that would explain it they aren 't cooperating they 've been hacked in this case they 've been hacked by their own government 
 that might sound
  but we already have cases where this has happened for example the case of the flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the u s government  
 and which to spread  subverted the security of the windows update network 
 meaning
 here the company was hacked
 by their own government  and there 's more evidence supporting this theory as well
  leaked
 more information about the operations run by
 the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies  inside nsa the unit is called tao tailored access operations  
 and inside gchq which is the u k equivalent it 's called nac network analysis centre
  and these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this gchq intelligence agency from the united kingdom targeting a telecom here in belgium  
 and what this really means
 is that an e u country 's intelligence agency
 is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow
  and they discuss it in their slides completely casually 
 business as usual here 's the primary target  here 's the secondary target  here 's the teaming they probably have a team building on thursday evening in a pub  
 they even use cheesy powerpoint clip art like you know success when they gain access to services like this what the hell
  then there 's the argument
 that okay yes this might be going on but then again other countries are doing it as well all countries spy  
 and maybe that 's true 
 many countries spy not all of them  but let 's take an example let 's take for example  sweden i 'm speaking of sweden because sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the united states
  when your data traffic goes through sweden their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic all right  how many swedish
  services like amazon web services or sales support  and the answer is every single swedish business leader does that every single day  and then we turn it around how many american 
 leaders use swedish  webmails and cloud services and the answer is zero  so this is not balanced it 's not balanced by any means not even close  
  do have the occasional european success story 
 even those then typically end up being sold to the united states like skype used to be secure it used to be end to end encrypted 
 then it was sold to the united states today it no longer is secure  so once again we take something which is secure
 and then we make it less secure on purpose making all of us less secure as an
  outcome  
 and then the argument that the united states is only fighting terrorists  it 's the war on terror you shouldn 't worry about it 
 well it 's not the war on terror  yes  part of it is war on terror and yes there are terrorists and they do kill and maim and we should fight them  but
  these leaks that they have used the same techniques
 to listen
 to phone calls of european leaders to tap the email of residents of mexico and brazil to read email traffic inside the united nations headquarters and e u 
  parliament and i don 't think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the e u parliament  
  terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them are the americans ready to throw away the constituion and throw it in the trash just because
 there are terrorists  and the same thing with the bill of rights and all the amendments and the universal declaration of human rights and the
  conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom do we really think
 terrorism is such an existential threat we are ready to do anything at all 
 but people are scared about terrorists  
 and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide  feel free to survey me if that helps  
 and whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn 't thought about this long enough
  because we have this thing called privacy  and if you really think that you have nothing to hide  please make sure that 's the first thing you tell me because then i know that i should not trust you with any secrets because obviously you can 't keep a secret
 but people are brutally honest with the internet and when these leaks
 started many people were asking me about this and i have nothing to hide i 'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal  
 yet i have nothing that i would in particular like to share with
  and if we indeed need a big brother i would much rather have a domestic big brother than a foreign big brother  
 and when the leaks started the very first thing i tweeted about this was a comment about how when you 've been using search engines you 've been potentially leaking
  and two minutes later i got a reply by somebody called kimberly from the united states challenging me like why am i worried about this  what am i sending to worry about this am i sending naked pictures or something 
 and my answer to kimberly was that what i 'm sending is none of your business  and it should be none of your government 's business either  
 because that 's what it 's about it 's about privacy  privacy is nonnegotiable it should be built in to all the systems we use
  and one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines 
  in five minutes we are more honest with search engines than we are with our families search engines know more about you than your family members know about you and
 this is all the kind of information we are giving away we are giving away to the united states  
 and surveillance changes history 
 we know this through examples of corrupt presidents like nixon imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available
  today  
 and let me actually quote the president of brazil of brazil  ms dilma rousseff she was one of the targets of nsa surveillance her email was read and she spoke
 at the united nations headquarters and she said if there is no right to privacy  there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion and
  that 's what it 's about privacy is the building block of our democracies  
 and to quote a fellow security researcher 
 he said that the united states is right now treating the internet as it would be treating one of its colonies  so we are back to the age of
  and we the foreign users of the internet we should think about americans as our masters 
 so mr snowden  
 he 's been blamed for many things some are blaming him for causing problems for the u s cloud industry and software companies with these revelations and blaming snowden for causing problems for the u s cloud industry would be the
  what is there to be done should we worry no we shouldn 't worry we should be angry  because this is wrong  and it 's
  and it should not be done  but that 's not going to really change the situation what 's going to change the situation for the rest of the world
 is to try to steer away from systems built in the united states  and that 's much easier said than done  how do you do that a
 single country any single country in europe cannot replace and build replacements for the u s made operating systems and cloud services  
 but maybe you don 't have to do it alone maybe you can do it together with other countries the solution
 is open source
 by building together open  free secure systems 
 we can go around such surveillance 
 and then one country doesn 't have to solve the problem by itself it only has to solve one little problem  
 and to quote a fellow security researcher  haroon meer
  one country only has to make a small wave  
 but those small waves together become a tide and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time  
 and the tide we will build with secure  free open source systems will become the tide that will lift all of us up
 and above the surveillance state  thank you very much
