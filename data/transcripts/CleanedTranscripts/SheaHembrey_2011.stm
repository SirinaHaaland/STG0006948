  with a bit of an unexpected background i was in my 20s before i ever went to an art museum  
 i grew up in the middle of nowhere on a dirt road in rural arkansas an hour from the nearest movie theater
  i think it was a great place to grow up as an artist because i grew up around quirky colorful characters who were great at making with their hands
  and my childhood is more hick than i could ever possibly relate to you and also
 more intellectual than you would ever expect for instance me and my sister when we were little we would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains but
 on the other side of that though we
 were big readers in our house and if the tv was on we were watching a documentary
  and my dad is the most voracious reader i know he can read a novel or two a day but
 when i was little i remember he would kill flies in our house with my bb gun  and
 what was so amazing to me about that well he would be in his recliner would holler for me to fetch the bb gun and i 'd go get it and
 what was amazing to me well it was pretty kickass he was killing a fly in the house with a gun but what was so amazing to
  me was that he knew just enough how to pump it 
 and he could shoot it from two rooms away and not damage what it was on because he knew how to pump it just enough to kill the fly and not
 damage what it landed on  so
 i should talk about art or we
 'll be here all day with my childhood stories  i love contemporary art
  i 'm often really frustrated with the contemporary art world and the contemporary art scene 
 a few years ago  i spent months in europe to see the major international art exhibitions that have the pulse of what is supposed to be going on in the art world 
 and
 i was struck by going to so many one after the other
  with some clarity of what it was that i was longing for
 and i was longing for several things that i wasn 't getting or not getting enough of  but two of the main things one of it i was longing for more work
 that was appealing to a broad public that was accessible and the second thing that i was longing for was some more exquisite craftsmanship
 and technique  so
 i started thinking and listing what all it was that i thought would make a perfect biennial so
  decided  i 'm going to start my own biennial  i 'm going to organize it and direct it and get it going in the world  so
 i thought  
 okay i have to have some criteria of how to choose work 
 so amongst all the criteria i have there 's two main things one of them i call my mimaw 's test  
 and what that is is i imagine explaining a work of art to my grandmother in five minutes
  and if i can 't explain it in five minutes then it 's too obtuse or
 esoteric and it hasn 't been refined enough yet it needs to worked on until it can speak fluently
  and then my other second set of rules
 i hate to say rules because it 's art my criteria would be
 the three h 's which is head  heart and hands  and great art would
  have head it would have
 interesting intellectual ideas and concepts it would have heart in that it would have passion and heart and soul  
 and it would have hand in that it would be greatly crafted  
 so i started
 thinking about how am i going to do this biennial how am i going to travel the world and find these artists  and then i realized one day there 's an easier solution to this
  going to make the whole thing myself and so
 this is what i did so i thought  a biennial needs artists i 'm going to do an international biennial i need artists from all around the world  so what i did was i invented
 a hundred artists
 from around the world  i figured out their bios their passions in life
  this is the kind of project that i could spend my whole life doing so i decided i 'm going to make this a real biennial it 's going to be two years of studio work  and i 'm going to create this in two years 
 and i have  so
 i should i should start to talk about these guys
  well the range is is quite a bit and i 'm such a technician so i loved this project getting to play with all the techniques so
 for example in realist paintings it ranges from this which is kind of old masters style to
 really realistic still life to this type of painting where i 'm painting with a single hair  
 and then at the other end there 's performance and short films and indoor installations like this indoor installation
 and this one
  and outdoor installations like this one and
 this one i know i should mention i 'm making all these things this isn 't photoshopped  i 'm under the river with those fish 
 so now let me introduce some of my fictional artists to you this is nell remmel nell is interested in agricultural processes  
 and her work is based in these practices this piece which is called flipped earth she was interested in
  taking the sky and using it to cleanse barren ground and by taking giant mirrors 
 and here she 's taking giant mirrors and and pulling them into the dirt
  and this is twenty two feet long and what i loved about her work is when i would walk around it
  and look down into the sky  looking down to watch the sky and it unfolded in a new way  and
 probably the best part of this piece is at dusk and dawn when the twilight wedge has fallen and the ground 's dark but there 's still the light above bright above and so you 're standing there and everything else is dark 
 but there 's this portal that you want to jump in this piece was great this is in my parents ' backyard in arkansas and
  the next artist is kay overstry  and she 's interested in ephemerality and transience and in her most recent project it 's called weather i made and she 's making weather
 on her body 's scale  and this piece is frost and what she did was she went out on a cold dry night and breathed back and forth on the lawn
 to leave
 to leave her
  life 's mark the mark of her life 
 and so this is 
  of frost that she left behind the sun rises and it melts away and that that was played by my mom
  so the next artist  this is a group of japanese
  in tokyo and they were interested in developing a new alternative art space and they needed funding for it so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects
  one of these is scratch off masterpieces  and
 so what they 're doing each of these artists on a 
 card which they sell for ten bucks they drew original works of art and you buy one and maybe you get a real piece and maybe not well this has sparked
 this has sparked a craze in japan because everyone 's wanting a masterpiece and the ones that are the most sought after are the ones that are only barely scratched off and all these works 
 in some way  talk about luck or fate or chance those first two are
 portraits of mega jackpot winners years before and after their win and in this one it 's called  
  this piece because i have a little cousin at home who introduced me which i think is such a great introduction to a friend one day as this is my cousin shea  he draws sticks real good 
 which is one of the best compliments ever 
 this artist is gus weinmueller and he 's doing a project  a large project called art for the peoples and within this project he 's doing a smaller
 project called artists in residence and what he does is
 he spends a week at a time with a family and he shows up on their porch their doorstep 
 with a toothbrush and pajamas  and he 's ready to spend the week with them
  and using only what 's present he goes in and makes a little abode studio to work out of  and he spends
 week talking to the family about what do they think great art is he has all these discussions with their family and he digs through everything they have and he finds
 materials to make work  and he makes a work that answers what they think great art is 
 for this family he made this still life painting and whatever he makes somehow references nesting and space and personal property 
 this next project  this is by jaochim parisvega and he 's interested in
 he believes art is everywhere waiting that it
  just needs a little bit of a push to happen  and he provides this push by harnessing natural forces like in his series where he used rain to make paintings
  this project is called love nests what he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him  so he put the material in places where the birds were going to collect them and they crafted his nests for him  and this one 's called lovelock
  next is sylvia slater sylvia 's interested in art training she 's a very serious swiss artist and
 she was thinking about her friends and family who work in chaos ridden places and developing countries and she was thinking what can i make that would be of value to them in case
  something bad happens and they have to buy their way across the border or pay off a gunman  and so she came up with creating these 
 artworks that are portraits of the person that would carry them and you would carry this around with you and if everything went to hell you could make payments and
 buy your life so this life price is
  so hopefully what happens is you never use it and it 's an heirloom that you pass down
  and she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments or they could be like these which are leaves that can be payments and so they 're valuable this is precious metals and gemstones  
 and this one had to get broken up he had to
 break off a piece to get out of egypt recently  
 this is by a duo michael abernathy and bud holland and they 're interested in creating culture just tradition
  so what they do is they move into an area and try to establish a new tradition in a small geographic area so
 this is in eastern tennessee and what they decided was that we need a positive
 tradition that goes with death so they came up with dig jigs and a dig jig
 a dig jig is where for a milestone anniversary or a birthday you gather all your friends and family
  together and you dance on where you 're going to be buried and we got a lot of attention when we
 did it i talked my family into doing this and they didn 't know what i was doing and i was like get dressed for a funeral we 're going to go do some work and
 so we got to the grave  and made this which was hilarious the attention that we got so what happens is you dance on the grave and after you you 've done your dance 
 everyone toasts you and tells you how great you are and you
  have a funeral that you get to be present for that 's my mom and dad  this is by jason birdsong he is interested in how we see as an animal how we
 are interested in mimicry and camouflage you know we look down a dark alley or a jungle path  trying to make out a face or a creature we just have that natural way of seeing  
 and he plays with this idea and this piece those aren 't actually leaves
  butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage so he pairs these up there 's another pile of leaves those are actually all real butterfly specimens  and he pairs these up with
 paintings like this is a painting of
 a snake in a box so you you open the box and you think whoa there 's a snake in there but it 's actually a painting 
 so he makes these interesting conversations about realism and mimicry and our drive to be fooled by great camouflage
 the next artist is
 hazel clausen hazel clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical and decided 
 you know i would learn a lot about culture if i created a culture that doesn 't exist from scratch so that 's what she did she created the swiss people named the uvulites and they have this distinctive yodeling
 song that they use the uvula for and also they reference how the uvula everything they say is is fallen because of the forbidden forbidden fruit and that 's the symbol of
 of their culture and
 this is from a documentary
 called sexual practices and populations control among the uvulites
 this is a typical angora embroidery for them  this is one of their founders
  this is my aunt irene it was so funny having a fake person who was making fake things  and i crack up at this piece because
 when i see it i know that 's french angora and all antique german ribbons and
 wool that i got in a nebraska mill and carried around for ten years and then antique
 chinese skirts the next is a collective of artists called the silver dobermans and their motto is to spread
  pragmatism one person at a time 
 they 're really interested in how over coddled we 've become  so this is one of their comments on how over coddled we 've become and what they 've done is
 they put a warning sign on every single barb on this fence
  really interesting south korean artist and he 's reworking a confucian art tradition of scholar stones  next is maynard sipes and i love maynard sipes but he he 's off in his own world and 
 bless his heart he 's so paranoid
  next is roy penig a really interesting kentucky artist and he 's the nicest guy 
 he even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese because the person wanted it so badly  
 next is an australian artist janeen jackson and this is from a project of hers called what an artwork does when we 're not
  next is by a lithuanian fortune teller jurgi petrauskas  
 next is ginger cheshire this is from a short film of hers called the last person and that 's my cousin and my sister 's dog gabby the next this is by
 sam sandy he 's an australian aboriginal elder and he 's also an artist  and this is from a large
 traveling sculpture project that he 's doing
  she heals with color  and she 's one of the most prolific of of all these hundred artists even though she 's going to be ninety next year 
 this is by  z zhou and he 's interested in stasis  
 next is by hilda singh and she 's doing a whole project called  social outfits next is by vera sokolova and i have to say  
 vera kind of scares me you can 't look her directly in the eyes because she 's kind of scary 
 it 's good that she 's not real she 'd be mad that i said that 
 and she 's an optometrist in st petersburg and she plays with optics 
 next this is by thomas swifton this is from a short film adventures with skinny 
 laughter and this is by cicily bennett  and it 's
 from a series of short films
