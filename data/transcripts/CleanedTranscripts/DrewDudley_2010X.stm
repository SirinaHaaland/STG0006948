  just start by asking everyone a question how many of you are completely comfortable with calling yourselves a leader 
 i 've asked that question all across the country and everywhere i ask it no matter where there 's
  a huge portion of the audience that won 't put up their hand  
 and i 've come to realize that we have made leadership into something bigger than us something beyond us we 've made it about changing the world we 've taken this title of leader and treat it as something 
 that one day we 're going to deserve  but to give it to ourselves right now means a level of arrogance or cockiness that we 're not comfortable with 
  every day we take moments where we truly are a leader and we don 't let ourselves take credit for it or feel good about it
 i 've been lucky enough over the last ten years to work with amazing people who 've helped me redefine leadership in a way that i think has made me happier with my short time today i want to share with you the one story that is probably most responsible for that redefinition
  little school called mount allison university in sackville new brunswick  and on my last day there a girl came up to me and said i remember the first time i met you 
 and she told me a story that had happened four years earlier  she said 
 on the day before i started university i was in the hotel room with my mom and dad and i was so scared and so convinced that i couldn 't do this that i wasn 't ready for university that i just burst into tears my mom and dad were amazing
  we know you 're scared  but let 's just go tomorrow go to the first day and if at any point you feel as if you can 't do this that 's fine tell us and we 'll take you home  we love you no matter what ' 
 she says so i went the next day i was in line for registration and i looked around and just knew i couldn 't do it  i wasn 't ready i knew i had to quit 
 i made that decision and as soon as i made it an incredible feeling of peace came over me
 i turned to my mom and dad to tell them we needed to go
  at that moment you came out of the student union building wearing the stupidest hat i 've ever seen in my life it was awesome  and you had a big sign
 promoting shinerama which is students fighting cystic fibrosis a charity i 've worked with for years and you had a bucketful of lollipops  you were handing the lollipops out
 to people in line and talking about shinerama all of the sudden  you got to me and you just stopped  and you stared it was
  then you looked at the guy next to me smiled reached into your bucket pulled out a lollipop held it out to him and said ' you need to give a lollipop to the beautiful woman next to you ' 
 she said i 've never seen anyone get more embarrassed faster in my life  
 he turned beet red he wouldn 't even look at me  he just kind of held the lollipop out like this laughter
 i felt so bad for this dude that i took the lollipop as soon as i did you got this incredibly severe look on your face
  looked at my mom and dad and said ' look at that look at that first day away from home  and already she 's taking candy from a stranger ' laughter
 she said everybody lost it twenty feet in every direction everyone started to howl 
 i know this is cheesy and i don 't know why i 'm telling you this  but in that moment when everyone was laughing  i knew i shouldn 't quit  i knew i was where i was supposed to be  i knew i was home  
 and i haven 't spoken to you once in the
  years since that day  but i heard that you were leaving  and i had to come and tell you you 've been an incredibly important person in my life  i 'm going to miss you good luck 
 and she walks away  and i 'm flattened 
 she gets six feet away turns around smiles and goes you should probably know this too i 'm still dating that guy four years later 
 a year and a half after i moved
  i got an invitation to their wedding 
 here 's the kicker  i don 't remember that 
 i have no recollection of that moment i 've searched my memory banks because that is funny and i should remember doing it and i don 't
 that was such an eye opening transformative moment for me to think that that maybe the biggest impact i 'd ever had on anyone 's life a moment that had a woman walk up to a stranger four years later and say you 've been an important person in my life was a moment that i didn 't even remember 
 how many of you guys have a lollipop moment a moment where someone said
  or did something that you feel fundamentally made your life better all right  how many of you have told that person they did it  
 see why not we celebrate birthdays where all you have to do is not die for three hundred and sixty five days laughter
 yet we let people who have made our lives better walk around without knowing it
 every single one of you has been the catalyst for a lollipop moment you 've made someone 's life better by something you said or did  if you think you
 haven 't think of all the hands that didn 't go up when i asked you 're just one of the people who hasn 't been told
 it 's scary to think of ourselves as that powerful frightening to think we can matter that much to other people as long as we make leadership something bigger than us as long as we keep leadership beyond us 
 and make it about changing the world  we give ourselves an excuse not to expect it every day from ourselves and from each other 
 it ] is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light and not our darkness that frightens us 
 my call to action today is that we need to get over our fear of how extraordinarily powerful we can be in each other 's lives we need to get over it so we can move beyond it and our little brothers and sisters and one day our kids
 or our kids right now can watch and start to value the impact we can have on each other 's
  than money and power and titles and influence  we need to redefine leadership as being about lollipop moments how many of them we create  how many we acknowledge how many of them we pay forward and how many we say thank you for 
 because we 've made leadership about changing the world  and there is no world there 's only six billion understandings of it and if you change one person 's understanding of it understanding of what they 're capable of understanding of how much people care about them
  understanding of how powerful an agent for change they can be in this world you 've changed the whole thing
