 that every point in time is really infinitely small and therefore somewhat meaningless so we don 't really have a place in the universe  as far as on a time line but nothing else does either therefore
 every moment really is the most important moment that 's ever happened

 somewhat like the
 curving of the universe  i don 't know what it is i get asked in interviews a lot my god you 're guitars are so gigantic 
 you must get them custom made special humongous guitars
