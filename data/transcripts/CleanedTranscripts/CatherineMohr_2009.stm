  a talk about surgical robots is also a talk about surgery  and
 while i 've tried to make my images not too graphic keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do 
 because after all what a surgeon does
  to a patient if it were done without consent would be a felony 
 surgeons are the tailors  the plumbers  the carpenters some would say the butchers of the medical world  
 cutting reshaping reforming  bypassing  fixing
  you need to talk about
 surgical instruments and the evolution of surgical technology together so in order to give you
 some kind of a perspective of where we are right now with surgical robots and where we 're going to be going in the future  i want to give you a little bit of perspective of how we got to this point  
 how we even came to believe that surgery was
  that this was something that was possible to do that this kind of cutting and reforming was ok so a little bit of perspective
 about ten thousand years of perspective this is a  trephinated skull and trephination is simply just cutting a hole in the skull  
 and many many hundreds of skulls like this have been found in archaeological sites all over the world  
 dating back five to ten thousand years
 five to ten thousand years now imagine this 
 you are a healer in a stone age village  
 and you have some guy that you 're not quite sure what 's wrong with him oliver sacks is going to be born way in the future  he 's got some seizure disorder and you don 't understand this but you think to yourself i 'm
 not quite sure what 's wrong with this guy  
 but maybe if i cut a hole in his head i can fix it
  now that is surgical thinking  now we 've got the dawn of interventional surgery here 
 what is astonishing about this is even though we don 't know really how much of this was intended to be
 religious or how much of it was intended to be therapeutic what we can tell is that these patients
  judging by the healing on the borders of these holes they lived days months years following trephination and so what we are seeing is evidence
 of a refined technique that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years all over the world  this arose independently at sites everywhere that had no communication to one another 
 we really are seeing the dawn of
  now we can fast forward many thousands of years into the bronze age and beyond  and we see
 new refined tools coming out but surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold trephinating ancestors 
 these guys confined their surgery to fairly superficial injuries and surgeons were tradesmen rather than
 physicians  this persisted all the way into and through the renaissance that may have
  saved the writers but it didn 't really save the surgeons terribly much they were still a mistrusted lot surgeons still had a bit of a pr problem 
 because the landscape was dominated by the itinerant barber surgeon these were folks that traveled from village to village town to town doing surgery sort of
 as a form of performance art  because we were in the age before anesthesia
  of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the surgery itself 
 one of the most famous of these guys  frere jacques shown here doing a lithotomy which is
 the removal of the bladder stone one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time had to take less than two minutes you had to have quite a flair
 flair for the dramatic and be really really quick  and so here you see him doing a lithotomy 
 and he is credited with doing over four thousand of these public surgeries wandering around in europe  
 which is an astonishing number when you think that surgery must have been a last resort i mean who would put themselves through that 
 until anesthesia  the absence of
  a whole new era of surgery was ushered in 
 anesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate anesthesia gave them the freedom to experiment to start to delve deeper into the body 
 this was truly a revolution in surgery  but
 was a pretty big problem with this  after these very long painstaking operations attempting to cure things they 'd never been able to touch before  
 the patients died 
 they died of massive infection 
 surgery didn 't hurt anymore but it killed you pretty quickly  and infection would continue to claim a majority of
  or sterility 's biggest advocate to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons 
 but eventually they did come around  the mayo brothers came out to visit lister in europe and they came back to their american clinic and they said they had learned it was as important to wash your hands
 before doing surgery as it was to
  wash up afterwards 
 something so simple  and yet  operative mortality dropped profoundly  these surgeries were actually now being effective 
 with the patient insensitive to pain 
 and a sterile operating field
 all bets were off the sky was the limit  you could now start doing surgery
  everywhere 
 on the gut  
 on the liver on the heart on the brain transplantation you could take an organ out of one person  you could put it in another person  and it would work 
 surgeons didn 't have a problem with respectability anymore they had become gods  the era of the big surgeon 
  at quite a cost because they are saving lives but not necessarily quality of life because healthy people
 don 't usually need surgery  and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that
 the question had to be asked well can we do these same surgeries
 but through little incisions
 is doing this kind of surgery  surgery with long instruments through small incisions  
 and it really changed the landscape of surgery  
 some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique until the 1980s when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that that allowed this to be done for real operations
  so what you see this is now the first surgical image as we 're coming down the tube this is a new entry into the body it looks very different from what you 're expecting surgery to look like 
 we bring instruments in from two separate cuts in the side and then you can start manipulating tissue  
 within ten years of the first gallbladder surgeries being done
 laparoscopically a majority of gallbladder
  surgeries were being done laparoscopically
 truly a
 pretty big revolution  
 but there were casualties of this revolution 
 these techniques were a lot harder to learn than people had anticipated the learning curve was very long and during that learning curve the complications went
 quite a bit higher surgeons had to give up their
  to give up their wrists they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments  
 this surgeon
 has over three thousand hours of laparoscopic experience now this is a particularly frustrating
 placement of the needle but this is hard and one of the reasons why it is so hard is because the external ergonomics
 are terrible you 've got these long instruments and you 're working off your centerline and the instruments are essentially working backwards 
 so what you need to do to take the capability of your hand  and put it on the other side of that small incision is you need to put a wrist
 on that instrument  and so i get to talk about robots the da vinci robot
 put just that wrist on the other side of that
 incision  and so here you 're seeing the operation of this wrist 
 and now in contrast to the laparoscopy you can precisely place the needle in your instruments 
 and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory  
 and the reason why this becomes so much easier is you can see
 on the bottom the hands are
  making the motions and the instruments are following those motions exactly now what you put between
 those instruments and those hands is a large fairly complicated robot the surgeon is sitting at a console and
 controlling the robot with these controllers and the robot is moving these instruments around and powering them down inside the body  you have a
  get a 3d view  and since this was introduced in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine 
 a lot of these robots have been out and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy  
 which is a prostate deep in the pelvis  and it requires fine dissection
 and
 delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical
  you can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart
 without cracking the chest this is all done in between the ribs  
 and you can go inside the heart itself and repair the valves from the inside 
 you 've got these technologies thank you 
 and so you might say wow this is really cool so smartypants why isn 't all surgery being done this way
  and there are some reasons some good reasons and cost is one of them 
 i talked about the large complicated robot with all its bells and whistles one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon 
 more useful than a solid gold surgeon but still it 's a fairly
 big capital investment but once you 've got it
  your procedure costs do come down 
 but there are other barriers  
 so something like a prostatectomy the prostate is small and it 's in one spot  and you can set your robot up very precisely to work in that one spot  
 and so it 's perfect for something like that and in fact if you or anyone you know had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years chances are it was done with one of these systems
  but if you need to reach more places than just one you need to move the robot  and you need to put some new incisions in there  and you need to re set it up 
 and then you need to add some more ports and more 
 and the problem is it gets 
 and cumbersome  and for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren 't being done with the da vinci 
 so we had to ask the question well how do we fix that
  what if we could change it so that we didn 't have to re set up each time we wanted to move somewhere different what if we could bring all the instruments in together in one place 
 how would that change the capabilities of the surgeon  
 and how would that change the experience for the patient now
 to do that we need to be able to bring a camera
 and instruments in together
  through one small tube like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video  or not so coincidentally like a tube like this 
 so what 's going to come out of that tube is the debut of this new technology this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere
  this is the camera and three instruments 
 and as you see it come out in order to actually be able to do anything useful it can 't all stay clustered up like this 
 it has to be able to come off of the centerline
 and then be able to work back toward that centerline he 's a cheeky little devil  but what this lets you do is gives you that
 counter traction so that you can dissect  so that you can sew so that you can do all the things that you need to do all the surgical tasks  but it 's all coming in through one incision it 's
 not so simple  but it 's worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we 're going around for the
  it 's transparent this is all they 're going to see 
 it 's very exciting to think where we get to go with this 
 we get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery as we take these capabilities  and we get to
 go to the next places we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be and i think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution
  need to not just take our hands in in new ways  
 we also need to take our eyes in in new ways  we need to see beyond the surface we need to be able to guide what we 're cutting
 in a much better way  
 this is a cancer surgery  one of the problems with this even for surgeons who 've been looking at this a lot is you can 't see the cancer
 especially when it 's hidden below the surface  and so what we 're starting to do
 is we 're starting to inject specially designed markers into the bloodstream that will target the cancer it
 will go bind to the cancer  and we can make those markers glow  and we can take special
  and we can look at it
 now we know where we need to cut even when it 's below the surface  
 we can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site  
 and we can follow where they flow out from that tumor site  so we can see the first places where that cancer might travel 
 we can inject these dyes into the bloodstream so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass
  a blockage on the heart we can see if we actually made the connection before we close that patient back up again something that we haven 't been able to do without radiation before 
 we can light up tumors like this kidney tumor  
 so that you can exactly see where the boundary is between the kidney tumor
 and the kidney you want to leave behind  or the liver tumor
 and the liver you want to leave behind  and we don 't even need to confine ourselves to
 this macro vision  we have flexible microscopic probes
 that we can bring down into the body  
 and we can look at cells directly 
 i 'm looking at nerves here so these are nerves you see down on the bottom  and the microscope probe that 's being held by the robotic hand up at the top
  prototypey at this point  but you care about nerves if you are a surgical patient because they let you keep
 continence 
 bladder control  and sexual function after surgery  
 all of which is generally fairly important to the patient 
 so with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all  and we can see it all
  all we can
 heal the disease  and we can leave the patient whole and intact and functional afterwards  
 now i 've talked about the patient as if the patient is somehow  someone abstract outside this room and that is not the case
  many of you all of you maybe 
 will at some point or have already faced a diagnosis of cancer  
 or heart disease  or some organ dysfunction that 's going to buy you a date with a surgeon  
 and
 when you get to that point
 i mean these maladies don 't care
 how many books you 've written how many companies you 've
  that nobel prize you have yet to win how much time you planned to spend with your children these maladies come for us all
