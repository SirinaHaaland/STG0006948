  the fbi is responsible for more terrorism plots in the united states than any other organization 
 more than al qaeda more than al shabaab more than the islamic state more than all of them combined 
 this isn 't likely how you think about the fbi
  you probably think of fbi agents gunning down bad guys like john dillinger or arresting corrupt politicians 
 after the nine eleven terrorist attacks the fbi became less concerned with gangsters and crooked elected officials 
 the new target became terrorists  and the pursuit of terrorists has consumed the fbi  
 every year the bureau spends three point three billion dollars on domestic counterterrorism activities  compare than to just
  two point six billion dollars combined for organized crime  financial fraud  public corruption and all other types of traditional criminal activity 
 i 've spent years pouring through the case files of terrorism prosecutions in the united states and i 've come to the conclusion that the fbi
 is much better at creating terrorists than it is at catching terrorists 
 in the fourteen years since nine eleven you can count about six real terrorist attacks in the united states
 these include the boston marathon bombings in two thousand and thirteen as well as failed attacks  such as the time when a man named faisal shahzad tried to deliver a
 car bomb to times square 
 in those same fourteen years the bureau however has bragged about how it 's foiled dozens of terrorism plots 
 in all the fbi has arrested more than one hundred and
  operations  which are usually led by an informant provide the means and opportunity  and sometimes even the idea for mentally ill and economically desperate people to become what we now term terrorists 
 after nine eleven the fbi was given an edict never again never another attack on american soil 
 fbi agents were told to find terrorists before they struck to do this agents recruited a network of more
  than fifteen thousand informants nationwide all looking for anyone who might be dangerous 
 an informant can earn one hundred thousand dollars or more for every terrorism case they bring to the fbi that
 's right the fbi is paying mostly criminals and con men six figures to spy on communities in the united states  but mostly muslim american communities 
  both are mentally ill 
 abdul latif had a history of huffing gasoline and attempting suicide mujahidh had schizoaffective disorder he had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy 
 in two thousand and twelve the fbi arrested these two men for conspiring to attack a military recruiting station outside seattle with weapons provided of course by the
  the fbi 's informant was robert childs a convicted rapist and child molester who was paid ninety thousand dollars for his work on the case 
 this isn 't an outlier in two thousand and nine  an fbi informant who had fled pakistan on murder charges led four men in a plot to bomb synagogues in the bronx  
 the lead defendant was james cromitie a broke walmart employee with a history of mental problems and the informant had offered him two hundred and fifty thousand dollars if he participated in that plot 
 there are many more examples
 today the intercept published my new story about a counterterrorism sting in tampa involving sami  osmakac a young man who was living near tampa florida 
 osmakac also had schizoaffective disorder  he too was broke  and he had no connections to international terrorist groups  
 nonetheless an fbi informant gave him a job  
 handed him money 
 introduced him to an undercover agent posing as a terrorist and lured him in a
  plot to bomb an irish bar  but here 's what 's interesting  the lead undercover agent you can see him in this picture with his face blurred
 would go back to the tampa field office with his recording equipment on behind closed doors fbi agents admitted that what they were doing was farcical 
 a federal judge doesn 't want you to hear about these conversations he sealed the transcripts and placed them under a protective order in an attempt to prevent someone like me from
  doing something like this  
 behind closed doors  the lead agent the squad supervisor described their would be terrorist as a retarded fool who didn 't have a pot to piss in 
 they described his terrorist ambitions as  wishy washy and
 a pipe dream scenario  but that didn 't stop the fbi  they provided sami  osmakac everything he needed  they gave him a car bomb they gave him
  they helped him make a  so called martyrdom video  and they even gave him money for a taxi cab so that he could get to where they wanted him to go 
 as they were working the sting  the squad supervisor tells his agents
 he wanted a hollywood ending  
 and he got a hollywood ending 
 when sami  osmakac attempted to deliver what he thought was a car bomb he was arrested convicted and sentenced to forty years in prison
  sami osmakac isn 't alone he 's one of more than one hundred and 
  for whom the fbi has created hollywood endings 
 u s government officials call this the war on terror it 's really just theater 
 a national security theater with mentally ill men like sami 
  unwitting actors in a carefully choreographed production brought to you by the fbi  
 thank you tom rielly 
 so those are some pretty strong accusations pretty strong charges 
  assistant and i put together a database of all terrorism prosecutions at the time during the first decade after nine eleven and we
 we used the court file to find out whether the defendants had any connections to international terrorist groups whether an informant was used and whether the informant played the role of an agent provocateur by providing the means 
  and opportunity and we submitted that to the fbi and we asked them to respond to our database if they believed there were any errors
  we asked them to tell us what they were and we 'd go back and check and they never challenged any of our findings later i used that data in a magazine article and later in my book  and
 on appearances on places like cbs and npr 
 they were offered that opportunity again to say trevor aaronson 's findings are wrong and they 've never come forward and said these are the problems with with those findings so the data
 has since been used by groups like human rights watch on its recent report on these types of sting operations and so
  far the fbi has never really responded
 to these charges that it 's really not catching terrorists so much as it 's catching mentally ill people that it can dress up as terrorists in these types of sting operations tr 
 so the intercept is that new investigative journalism website that 's cofounded by glenn greenwald  tell us about your article
  the intercept seemed to be the most logical place for this because my article is really leveraging the fact that a source had leaked to me transcripts of these private fbi conversations that a federal judge 
  had sealed based on the government 's claim that their release would irreparably damage the u s government 's law enforcement strategy  so a place like the intercept was set up to protect 
  journalists and publish their work when they 're dealing with very sensitive matters like this so my story in the intercept which was just published today  tells the story of how
  sami  osmakac was set up in this fbi sting and goes into much greater detail in this talk i could only highlight the things that they said such as calling him a retarded fool but it was much more elaborate 
  they went to great lengths to put money in sami osmakac 's hands  which he then used to purchase weapons from the undercover agent when he went to trial the central piece of evidence was that he paid for these weapons when in truth these transcripts show how the fbi orchestrated someone who was essentially
  mentally ill and broke
 to get money to then pay for weapons that they could then charge him in a conspiracy for tr 
 one final question  
 less than ten days ago  the fbi arrested some potential isis suspects in brooklyn saying that they might be headed to syria and
 were those real or examples of more of the same ta well so far we only know what 's come out in the court file but they seem to suggest it 's another example of the same these
  types of
 sting operations have moved from
 flavor to flavor so initially it was al qaeda plots and now the islamic state is the current flavor what 's worth noting about that case is that the three men that were charged only began the plot
  to go to syria after the introduction of the fbi informant and in fact the fbi informant had helped them with the travel documents that they needed in kind of a comical turn in that particular case one of the defendant 's mother had found out that he was interested
  in going to syria and had hid his passport so it 's unclear that even if he had showed up at the airport that he ever could have gone anywhere 
 so yes there are people who might be interested in joining the islamic state in the united states and those are people that the united states government should be looking at to see if they 're interested in violence here in this particular case given the evidence that 's so 
  far come out it suggests the fbi made it possible for these guys to move along in a plan to go to syria when they were never close to that in the first place tr thanks a lot that 's amazing
