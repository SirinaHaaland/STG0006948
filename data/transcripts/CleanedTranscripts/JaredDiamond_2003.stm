  all of us have been interested at one time or another in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed  such as the classic maya in the yucatan 
  fertile crescent society angor wat great zimbabwe and so on  
 and within the last decade or two archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems underlying many of these past collapses  but there were also plenty 
  of places in the world where societies have been developing for thousands of years without any sign of a major collapse  such as japan  java
  tonga and tikopea  
 so evidently societies in some areas are more fragile than in other areas 
 how can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies 
 the problem is obviously relevant to our situation today  because today as well there are some societies that have already collapsed  such as somalia and rwanda and the former
  are also societies today that
 may be close to collapse such as nepal  indonesia and columbia  
 what about ourselves what is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have 
 obviously the answer to this question is not going to be a single factor  if anyone
  explanation for societal collapses you know right away that they 're an idiot this is a complex subject  but how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject  
 in analyzing societal collapses i 've arrived at a 
  five point framework a checklist of things that i go through to try and understand collapses and i 'll illustrate that  five point framework by the extinction of the greenland norse society this is a european
  society with literate records so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation  in ad nine hundred and eighty four vikings went out to greenland settled greenland and around 
 one thousand four hundred and fifty they died out the society collapsed and every one of them ended up dead  why did they all end up dead 
 people inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend 
 and in the case of the viking norse the vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation which was a particular problem for them because 
 they required forests to make charcoal to make iron  so they ended up an iron age european society virtually unable to make their own iron 
 item on my checklist is climate change climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter in the case of the vikings in greenland the climate got colder in the late 1300s and especially in the 1400s 
 but a cold climate isn 't necessarily fatal because the inuit the eskimos inhabiting greenland at the same time did better rather than worse with cold climates so why
  didn 't the greenland norse as well  
 the third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring friendly societies that may prop up a society and if that friendly support is pulled away that may make a society more likely to collapse 
 in the case of the greenland norse they had trade with the mother country norway and that
  partly because norway got weaker  partly because of sea ice between greenland and norway  
 the fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies 
 in the case of norse greenland the hostiles were the inuit the eskimos sharing greenland with whom the norse got off to bad relationships 
 and we know that the inuit
  probably of greater importance may have blocked access to the outer fjords on which the norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year  
 and then finally the fifth item on my checklist is the political  economic social and cultural factors in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problems 
 in the case of the greenland norse cultural factors that made it difficult
  for them to solve their problems were their commitments to a christian society investing heavily in cathedrals  their being a 
 chiefly society and their scorn for the  inuit from whom they refused to learn  so that 's how the five part framework
 is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the greenland norse what about a society today
  for the past five years i 've been taking my wife and kids
 to southwestern montana where i worked as a teenager on the hay harvest  and montana at first sight seems like the most pristine
 environment in the united states but scratch the surface  and montana suffers from serious problems 
 going through the same checklist human environmental impacts  yes acute in montana  toxic problems
  from mine waste
 have caused damage of billions of dollars problems from weeds weed control  cost montana nearly two hundred million dollars a year 
 montana has lost agricultural areas from salinization problems of forest management problems of forest fires 
 second item on my checklist climate
  yes the climate in montana is getting warmer and drier  but montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation from the snow pack and as the snow is melting for example as 
  the glaciers in glacier national park are disappearing that 's bad news for montana irrigation agriculture 
  earned within montana but is derived from out of state transfer payments from social security  investments and so on
 which makes montana vulnerable to the rest of the united states fourth relations with 
 montanans have the same problems as do all americans in being sensitive to problems created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil
  last item on my checklist 
 question of how political economic social cultural attitudes play into this 
 montanans have long held values which today seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems
 long held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture and to no government regulation values that worked well in the past but they don 't seem to be working well today
  at these issues of collapses for a lot of past societies and for many present societies are there any general conclusions that arise  
 in a way just like tolstoy 's statement about every unhappy marriage being different every collapsed or endangered society is different they all have different details  but 
  nevertheless there are certain common threads that emerge from these comparisons of past societies that
  did or did not collapse and threatened societies today  
 one interesting common thread has to do with in many cases the rapidity of collapse after a society reaches its peak 
 there are many societies that don 't wind down gradually  but they build up get richer and more powerful and then within a short time within a few decades after their peak they collapse
  for example the classic classic lowland maya of the yucatan
 began to collapse in the early  800s literally a few decades after the maya were building their biggest monuments  and maya population was 
 greatest or again the collapse of the soviet union took place within a couple of decades maybe within a decade of the time when the soviet union was at its greatest power  
  would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish 
 these rapid collapses are especially likely where there 's a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential  
 in a petri dish bacteria grow  
 say they double every generation and five generations before the end the petri dish is fifteen
 16ths empty  and then the next generation 's three 4ths empty and the next generation half empty within one generation after the petri dish still being half empty 
  it is full there 's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed so this is a frequent theme societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power  what it means to put it mathematically is that if you 're concerned about a society today
  you should be looking not at the value of the mathematical function the wealth itself but you should be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives of the function 
 that 's one general theme a second general theme
 is that there are many often subtle environmental factors that make some societies more fragile than others  many of those factors are not well understood for example
  why is it that in the pacific of those hundreds of pacific islands why did easter island end up as the most devastating case of complete deforestation  
 it turns out that there were about nine different environmental factors some rather subtle ones that were working against the easter islanders 
 and they involve fallout of
  perhaps the most subtle of them is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients
 which protects island environments in the pacific is from the fallout of continental dust from central asia 
 easter of all pacific islands has the least input of dust from asia restoring the fertility of its soils  but that 's a factor that we didn 't even appreciate until
  reasons are more fragile than others  and then finally another generalization i 'm now teaching a course 
  undergraduates on these collapses of societies 
 what really bugs my ucla undergraduate students is how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing 
 how could the easter islanders have deforested their environment  what did they
 say when they were cutting down the last palm tree didn 't they see what they were doing how could societies not perceive
 their impacts on the environments and stop in time  
 and i would expect that if our human human civilization carries on then maybe in the next century
 people will be asking  why on earth did these people today in the year two thousand and three not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action 
 it seems incredible
  in the past in the future it 'll seem incredible what we are doing today  and so i 've been trying to develop a hierarchical
 set of considerations about why societies fail to solve their problems
 why they fail to perceive the problems or if they perceive them why they fail to tackle them or if they tackle them why do they fail to succeed in solving them i
 'll just mention two generalizations in this area
  area  one blueprint for trouble  making collapse likely 
 is where there is a conflict of interest between the short term interest of the decision making elites
 and the long term interest of the society as a whole  especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions 
 where what 's good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole there 's a real risk of the elite
  doing things that would bring the society down in the long run 
 for example among the greenland norse a competitive rank society what the chiefs really wanted is more followers and more sheep and more resources to outcompete the neighboring chiefs  
  and that led the chiefs to do what 's called flogging the land overstocking the land  forcing tenant farmers into
  in the short run  but led to the society 's collapse in the long run those same issues
 of conflicts of interest are acute in the united states today  especially because the decision makers in the united states
 are frequently able to insulate themselves from consequences by living in gated compounds by drinking bottled water and so on and
 within the last couple of years
  obvious that the elite in the business world correctly perceive that they can advance their short term interest by doing things that are good for them but bad for society as a whole  such as draining a few billion dollars out of enron and
 other businesses they are quite correct 
 that these things are good for them in the short term
  although bad for society in the long term  so that 's one general conclusion about why societies make bad
 decisions conflicts of interest and the other generalization that i want to mention
 is that it 's particularly hard for a society to make quote unquote good decisions when there is a conflict
 involving strongly held values that are good in many circumstances but are poor in other circumstances for example
 the greenland norse in this difficult environment were held together for four and a half centuries by their
 shared commitment to religion and by their strong social cohesion  
 but those two things commitment to religion and strong social cohesion also made it difficult for them to change at the end and to learn from the
  one of the things that enabled australia to survive in this remote outpost of european civilization for two hundred and fifty years has been their british identity 
  but today  their commitment to a british identity identity is serving australians poorly in their need to adapt to their situation in asia  so it 's particularly 
  difficult to change course when the things that get you in trouble are the things that are also the source of your strength
 what 's going to be the outcome today  well all of us
 know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs going on in the modern world time bombs that have fuses
  of a few decades to all of them not more than fifty years  and any one of which can do us in the time bombs of water of soil
  of climate change  invasive species  the photosynthetic ceiling population problems toxics etc etc listing about twelve of them 
 and while these time bombs none of them has a fuse beyond fifty years and most of them have fuses of a few decades some of them in some places have much shorter fuses at the rate at which we 're going
  the philippines will lose all its accessible
 loggable forest within five years and the solomon islands are only one year away from losing their loggable forest which is their major export and that 's going to be spectacular for the economy of the solomons 
 people often ask me jared what 's the most important thing that we need to do about the world 's environmental problems 
 and my answer is the most important thing we need to do is to forget about there being any single thing that is the most important thing we need to do instead there are a dozen things
  things any one of which could do us in and we 've got to get them all right because if we solve eleven we fail to solve the 12th we 're in trouble  for example if we solve our problems of water 
  and soil and population but don 't solve our problems of toxics then we are in trouble
  which means by definition that it cannot be maintained and the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades 
 that means that those of us in this room who are less than fifty or sixty years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved and those of us who are over the age of sixty 
 may not see the resolution but our children and grandchildren certainly will the resolution is going to achieve either of two forms
  either we will resolve these
 in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial remedial action 
 or else these conflicts are going to get settled in unpleasant ways not of our choice namely by war  disease or starvation  but what 's for sure is
  will get resolved in one way or another in a few decades in other words since the theme of this session is choices we have a choice  
 does that mean that we should get pessimistic and overwhelmed i draw the reverse conclusion
