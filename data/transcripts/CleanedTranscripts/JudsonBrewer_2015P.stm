  when i was first learning to meditate the instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath
 and when my mind wandered to bring it back 
 sounded simple enough yet i 'd sit on these silent retreats sweating through t shirts in the middle of winter i 'd take naps
  every chance i got because it was really hard work actually it was exhausting  the instruction was simple enough but i was missing something really important  
 so why is it so hard to pay attention well studies show
 that even when we 're really trying to pay attention to something like maybe this talk
 at some point about half of us will drift off into a daydream or have this urge to check our twitter feed
 so what 's going on here it turns out that we 're fighting one of the most
 learning processes currently known in science one that 's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man 
 this reward based learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement  and basically goes like this 
 we see some food that looks good our brain says
 we eat the food we taste it it tastes good  and especially with sugar our bodies send a signal to our brain that says remember what you 're eating and where you found it 
 we lay down this context dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time see food eat food feel good
  after a while our creative brains say you know what 
 you can use this for more than just remembering where food is 
 you know next time you feel bad why don 't you try eating something good so you 'll feel better 
 we thank our brains for the great idea try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we 're mad or sad we feel better 
 same process
  just a different trigger  instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach this emotional signal feeling sad triggers that urge to eat 
 maybe in our teenage years we were a nerd at school  
 and we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think hey i want to be cool so we start smoking 
 the marlboro man wasn 't a dork and that was no accident see cool smoke
  to be cool  feel good repeat trigger behavior  reward  
 and each time we do this we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit 
 so later feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet 
 now with these same brain
  we 've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves with these habits  
 obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world  
 so back to my breath 
 what if instead of fighting our brains or trying to force ourselves to pay attention we instead tapped into this natural reward based learning process
  but added a twist 
 what if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience
  you an example in my lab we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking  
 now  just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath  they could try to force themselves to quit smoking 
 and the majority of them had tried this before and failed on average six times 
 now with mindfulness training we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious in fact
  fact we even told them to smoke what yeah we said go ahead and smoke just be really curious about what it 's like when you do 
 and what did they notice  
 well here 's an example from one of our smokers she said mindful smoking  smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals yuck 
  cognitively that smoking was bad for her that 's why she joined our program what she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked
 was that smoking tastes like shit 
 now  she moved from knowledge to wisdom she moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her
  and the spell of smoking was broken she started to become disenchanted with her behavior  
 now  the prefrontal cortex that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn 't smoke 
 and it tries its hardest to help us change our behavior to help us stop smoking to help us stop eating that second that
  that fourth cookie  
 we call this cognitive control we 're using cognition to control our behavior  
 unfortunately this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline when we get stressed out which isn 't that helpful 
 now we can all relate to this in our own experience we 're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids when we 're stressed out or tired even though we know it 's not going to be helpful we just can 't help
  when the prefrontal cortex goes offline  we fall back into our old habits  which is why this disenchantment is so important  
 seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level
 to know it in our bones so we don 't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior  we 're just less interested in doing it in the first place  
 and this is what mindfulness is all about  seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors  becoming disenchanted
 on a visceral level
 and from this disenchanted stance naturally letting go 
 this isn 't to say that poof magically we quit smoking  but over time as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions we let go of old habits and form new ones 
 the paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with what 's actually happening in our bodies and minds
  from moment to moment this willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible 
 and this willingness to turn toward our experience
 is supported by curiosity  which is naturally rewarding what does curiosity feel like it feels good  and what happens when we
  we start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations oh  there 's tightness  there 's tension  there 's restlessness
 and that these body sensations come and go these are bite size pieces of experiences
 that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered by this huge scary craving that we choke on 
 in other words when we get curious  we step out of our old 
 fear based reactive habit patterns and
  step into being we become this inner scientist where we 're eagerly awaiting that next data point  now  
 this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior  but in one study we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking
  so it actually
  and when we studied the brains of experienced meditators  we found that parts of a neural network of self referential processing called the default mode network were at play 
 now one current hypothesis is that a region of this network called the posterior cingulate cortex 
 is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it when we get sucked in and it takes us for a ride 
 in contrast when we let go step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what 's happening this
  brain region quiets down 
 now we 're testing app and online based mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and ironically use the same technology 
  that 's driving us to distraction to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking of stress eating and other
  remember that bit about context dependent memory we can deliver these tools to peoples ' fingertips in the contexts that matter most so we can help them tap into their inherent capacity 
 to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises 
 from work or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you 're driving 
 see if you can tap into this natural capacity just be curiously aware of what 's happening in your body and mind in that moment it will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops 
 or step out of it 
 instead of see text message compulsively text back feel a little bit better
 notice the urge get curious  feel the joy of letting go and repeat
