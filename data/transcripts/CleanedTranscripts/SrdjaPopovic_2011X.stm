  proud to be here at tedxkrakow i 'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon which can and actually is changing the world  
 and whose name is people power i
  or for those of you who are monty python lovers a monty python type of sketch here it is 
 it is december fifteen two thousand and ten 
 somebody gives you a bet  you will look at a crystal ball  and you will see the future the future will be accurate  but you need to share it with the world  ok  curiosity killed the cat  
  you take the bet  you look at the crystal ball one hour later  you 're sitting in a building of the
  national tv in a top show  and you tell the story before the end of two thousand and eleven ben ali and mubarak and
 gaddafi would be down and prosecuted  
 saleh of yemen and assad of syria would be either challenged  or already on their knees  
 osama bin laden would be dead  and ratko mladic would be in the hague now
 the anchor watches you with a strange gaze on his face  and then on top of it you add
  people from athens madrid and new york will demonstrate for social justice claiming they are inspired by arabs 
 next thing you know  two guys in white appear they give you the strange t shirt 
 take you to the nearest mental institution so i would like to speak a little bit about the phenomenon
 which is behind what already
 seems to be a very bad year for bad guys  and this phenomenon is called people power well
 people power has been there for a while it helped gandhi kick the brits from india  it helped martin luther king win his historic racial struggle  
 it helped a local lech walesa to kick out one million soviet troops from poland and in beginning the end of the soviet union as we know it
  so what 's new in it what seems to be very new which is the idea i would like to share with you today is that there is a set of rules and skills
 which can be learned and taught in order to perform successful nonviolent struggle if this is true we can help these movements  
 well the first one analytic skills i 'll try where it all started in the middle east  and for so
  we were living with a completely wrong perception of the middle east  it was looking like the frozen region 
 literally a refrigerator  and there were only two types of meal there 
 steak  which stands for a mubarak ben ali type of military police dictatorship or a potato which stands for a tehran type of theocracies  
 and everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened and millions
  mainly secular people stepped out to do the change guess what they didn 't watch the demographics 
 what is the average age of an egyptian twenty four how long was mubarak in power thirty one so 
 this system was just obsolete  they expired  and young people of the arab world have awakened one morning  and understood that power lies in their hands  the rest is the year in front of us
  with their rules with their tools with their games and with their language which sounds a little bit strange to me i 'm  thirty eight now  and
 can you look at the age of the people on the streets of europe it seems that generation y is
 coming  now  
 let me set another example i 'm meeting different people throughout the world  and they are you know academics and professors and doctors  and they will always talk conditions  they will say
  people power will work only if the regime is not too oppressive they will say people power will work if the annual income of the country is between x and z they will say people power 
  will work only if there is a foreign pressure they will say people power will work only if there is no oil and i mean there is a set of conditions  
  the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions  namely the skills of unity planning and maintaining nonviolent discipline  let me give you an example  i 
 come from a country called serbia it took us ten years to unite eighteen opposition party leaders  with their big egos behind one single candidate against 
 the balkan dictator slobodan milosevic guess what that was the day of his defeat  
  get rid of their individual symbols  they appear on the street only with the flag of egypt  i will give you a counter example you see nine presidential candidates running against lukashenko  you all know the outcome  
 so unity is a big thing  and this can be achieved same with planning  somebody has lied to you about the successful and
 spontaneous nonviolent revolution 
 that thing doesn 't exist in the world whenever you see young people in front of the row trying to fraternize with the police or military somebody was thinking about it before  
 now at the end nonviolent discipline  and this is probably the game changer if you maintain nonviolent discipline  you 'll exclusively win  
 you have one hundred thousand people in a nonviolent march one idiot or
  guess what takes all the cameras that one guy one single act of violence can literally destroy
 your movement  now  
 let me move to another place it 's the selection of strategies and tactics there are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow first you start small second you pick the battles you can win  
 it 's only two hundred of us in this room we won 't call for the march of a million but what if we organized the spraying of graffiti throughout the night
  over krakow the city will know  so we pick tactics accommodated to the event  especially this thing we call the small
 tactics of dispersion they 're very useful
 in
 violent oppression we are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used it was on tahrir square
  international community was constantly frightened that you know the
 islamists will overtake the revolution what they organized
 christians protecting muslims where they are praying a coptic wedding cheered by thousands of muslims the world has just changed the picture but somebody was thinking about this previously 
  so there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place  shouting  and you know showing off in front of the security forces
  dynamic  and this is a dynamic that analysts normally don 't see this is the dynamic between fear and apathy on the one side  and enthusiasm and humor on another 
  side so it works like in a video game  you have the fear high  you have status quo  you have the enthusiasm higher  
  from the police in egypt  you can tell that something is happening there  and then it 's about the humor 
 humor is such a powerful game changer and of course it was very big in poland you know
 we were just a small group of crazy students in serbia when we made this big skit we put the big petrol barrel with a
 portrait of mr president on it in the middle of the main street there was a hole in the top so you could literally come put a coin
  in get a baseball bat and
 hit his face 
 sounds loud and within minutes  we were sitting in a nearby caf having coffee  and there was a queue of people waiting to do this lovely thing well 
 that 's just the beginning of the show the real show starts when the police appears 
 what will they do
  were nowhere to be seen we were like three blocks away observing it from our espresso bar
 arrest the shoppers  with kids doesn 't make sense of course you could bet  they did the most stupid thing  they arrested the barrel 
 and now the picture of the smashed face on the barrel with the policemen dragging it to the police car that was the best day for newspaper photographers that they will ever have 
 so i mean these are the things you can do  and you can always use humor there is also one big thing about humor
  really hurts  because these guys really are taking themselves too seriously when you start to mock them  it hurts  
 now  everybody is talking about his majesty the internet and it is also a very useful skill
 but don 't rush to label things like a facebook revolution twitter revolution don 't
  with the substance 
 it is true that the internet and the new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper they also make it a bit safer for the participants because they give partial anonymity  
 we 're watching the great example of something else the internet can do  it can put the price tag of state sponsored violence over a nonviolent protester this is the famous group we are all khaled said
  made by wael ghonim in egypt and his friend this is the mutilated face of the guy who was beaten by the police this is how he became known to the public  and this is what probably became the straw that broke the camel 's back  
 but here is also the bad news  the nonviolent struggle is won in the real world in the streets 
 you will never change your society towards democracy or you know the economy if you sit down and
  there are risks to be taken  and there are living people who are winning
 the struggle
  well the million dollar question what will happen in the arab world  
 and though young people from the arab world were pretty successful in bringing down three dictators  shaking the region  
 kind of persuading the clever kings from jordan and morocco to do substantial reforms  it is yet to be seen what will be the outcome  
 whether the egyptians and tunisians will make it through the transition
 or this will end in bloody ethnic and religious conflicts  whether the syrians
 will maintain nonviolent discipline
  faced with a brutal daily violence which kills thousands already or they will slip into violent struggle and make ugly civil war 
  the transitions and democracy or be overtaken by the military or extremists of all kinds  we cannot tell the
 same works for the western sector where you can see all these excited young people protesting around the world occupying this occupying that 
 are they going to become the world wave are they going to find their skills their enthusiasm and their strategy
 to find what they really want and push for the reform
 or will they just stay complaining about the endless list
 of the things they hate  
 this is the difference between the two paths now  what do the statistics have my friend maria stephan 's book
 talks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle and there are some shocking
  years and different social transitions from dictatorship to democracy  you will see that out of sixty seven different cases in fifty of these cases it was nonviolent struggle
 which was the key power this is one more reason to look at this phenomenon this is one more reason to look at generation y 
 enough for me to give them credit  
  and hope
 that they will find their skills
 and their courage to use nonviolent struggle and thus fix at least a part of the mess our generation is making in this world  thank you
