  have a question for you are you religious  please raise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religious person 
 let 's see i 'd say about three or four percent i had no idea there were so many believers at a ted conference
  okay here 's another question do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way shape or form  raise your hand  okay that 's the majority  
 my talk today is about the main reason or one of the main reasons  why most people consider themselves to be spiritual in some way shape or form my talk today is about 
  a basic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just melt away  
 and when that happens  the feeling is ecstatic
 and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings we talk about being uplifted or elevated 
 now it 's really hard to think about anything abstract like this without a good concrete metaphor  so here 's the metaphor i 'm offering today 
 think about the mind as being like a house with many
  rooms most of which we 're very familiar with  but sometimes it 's as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere
 and it opens onto a staircase we climb the staircase
 and experience a state of altered consciousness 
 in one thousand nine hundred and two the great american psychologist william james wrote about the many varieties of religious experience
  he collected all kinds of case studies he quoted the words of all kinds of people who 'd had a variety of these experiences one of the most exciting to me is
 this young man stephen bradley had an encounter he thought with jesus in one thousand eight hundred and twenty and here 's what bradley said about
 for about one second in the room with arms extended
 appearing to say to me 
 come 
 the next day i rejoiced with trembling my happiness was so great that i said i wanted to die 
 this world had no place in my affections  
 previous to this time i was very selfish and self righteous but now i desired the welfare of all mankind
 and could with a feeling heart forgive
  my worst enemies jh 
 so note how
 bradley 's petty moralistic self just dies on the way up the staircase and on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving 
 the world 's many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the staircase some shut down the self using meditation 
 others use psychedelic drugs this is from a
  from a 16th century aztec scroll showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god 
 others use dancing  spinning and circling to promote self transcendence but you don 't need a religion to get you through the staircase  lots of people find self transcendence in nature others overcome their self at raves  
 but here 's the weirdest place of all
 war 
 so many books about war say the same thing that nothing brings people together like war  and that bringing them together opens up the possibility of extraordinary 
  to play for you an excerpt from this book by glenn gray gray was a soldier in the american army in world war ii and after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers and wrote about the
  experience of men in battle here 's a key passage where he basically describes the staircase glenn gray 
 many veterans will admit that the experience of communal effort in battle has been the high point of their lives 
 i passes insensibly into a
  i believe that it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality
 that makes self sacrifice at these moments so relatively easy  
 i may fall but i do not die  for that which is real in me goes forward
 and lives on in the comrades for whom i gave up my life
 what all of these cases have in common is that the self seems to thin out or melt away  and it feels good it feels really good in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives it feels somehow uplifting 
 this idea that we move up was central in the writing of the great french sociologist emile durkheim durkheim even
  the lower level he called the level of the profane now profane is the opposite of sacred it just means ordinary or common and
 in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals we want to satisfy our individual desires  we pursue our individual goals  
 but sometimes something happens that triggers a phase change  
 individuals unite into a team a movement or a nation which is far more than the
  sum of its parts durkheim called this level the level of the sacred
 because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group into a moral community  
 durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness  and once people circle around some sacred object or value
  'll then work as a team and fight to defend it 
 durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of of e pluribus unum of making a group out of out of individuals 
 think of the collective joy in britain
 on the day world war ii ended 
 think of the collective anger in tahrir square which brought down a dictator 
 and think of the collective grief in the united states
 that we all felt that brought
  us all together after nine eleven  
 so let me summarize where we are 
 i 'm saying that the capacity for self transcendence is just a basic part of being human 
 i 'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind i 'm saying we are homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level
 to the level of the sacred when we climb that staircase
 self interest fades away we become just much less
 and we feel as though we are better  nobler and somehow uplifted  
 so here 's the million dollar question for social scientists like me 
 is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design 
 is it a product of natural selection like our hands 
 or
 is it a bug a mistake in the system
 this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience it 's just a mistake  
 well many scientists who study religion take this view  the new atheists for example  argue that religion is a set of memes sort of parasitic memes 
 that get inside our minds
 and make us do all
  of crazy religious stuff self destructive stuff like suicide bombing  and after all how could it ever be good for us to lose ourselves  
 how could it ever be adaptive
 for any organism
 to overcome self interest well let me show you in the descent of
  charles darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality where did it come from why do we have it 
 darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves  but they 're of great use to our groups 
 he wrote about the scenario in which two tribes of early humans would have come in in contact and competition he said if the one tribe included a great number of courageous 
 sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other this tribe would succeed
  better and conquer the other 
 he went on to say that selfish and contentious people will not cohere  and without coherence nothing can be effected 
 in other words  charles darwin
 believed in group selection  
 now this idea has been very controversial for the last forty years but it 's about to make a major comeback this year  especially after
  's book comes out in april making a very strong case that we and several other species are products of group selection but really the way to think about this is as multilevel selection
  so look at it this way 
 you 've got competition going on within groups and across groups  so here 's a group of guys on a college crew team  
 within this team
 there 's competition there are guys competing with each other the slowest
  rowers the weakest rowers are going to get cut from the team and only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport maybe one of them will make it to the olympics  
 so within the team their interests are actually pitted against each other  
 and sometimes it would be advantageous for one one of these guys to try to sabotage the other guys maybe he 'll badmouth his chief rival to the coach  
 but while that competition is going on
  within the boat 
 this competition is going on across boats  
 and once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat  now they 've got no choice but to cooperate because they 're all in the same boat  
 they can only win if they all pull together as a team i mean these things sound trite but they are deep evolutionary truths 
 the main argument against group selection has always been
  sure it would be nice to have a group of cooperators but as soon as you have a group of cooperators they 're just going to get taken over by
 individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others let me illustrate this for you 
 suppose we 've got a group of of little organisms they can be bacteria they can be hamsters it doesn 't matter what and let 's suppose that this little group here they evolved to be cooperative  well that 's great they graze they defend each other they work together
  generate wealth 
 and as you 'll see in this simulation as they interact they gain points as it were they grow  and when they 've doubled in size you 'll see them split and that 's how they reproduce and the population grows but suppose 
  then that one of them mutates there 's a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy it takes advantage of the others  and so when a green interacts with a blue you
  so here 's how things play out  we start with just one green and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food  
 and in short order the cooperators are done for the free riders have taken over if a group cannot solve the free rider problem
 then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation and group selection cannot get started  but there are
  solutions to the free rider problem  it 's not that hard a problem in fact nature has solved it many many times and nature 's favorite solution is to put everyone in the same boat 
 for example  why is it
 that the mitochondria
 in every cell has its own dna totally separate from the from the dna in the
  it 's because they used to be separate free living bacteria and they came together and became a superorganism 
 somehow or other maybe one swallowed another we 'll never know exactly why
 but once they got a membrane around them they were all in the same membrane now all the 
  division of labor all the greatness created by cooperation stays locked inside the membrane and we 've got a superorganism 
  and now let 's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free riders of defectors of cheaters and look what happens 
 a superorganism can basically take what it wants  it 's so big and powerful and efficient
 that it can take resources from the greens from the defectors the cheaters and pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new
  what i 've shown you here
 is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history 
 darwin 's laws don 't change  but now there 's a new kind of player on the field
 and things begin to look very different 
 now this transition was not a  one time freak of nature that just happened with some bacteria it happened again about one hundred and twenty or a one hundred and forty million years ago
 when some solitary wasps
 began creating little simple primitive
  nests or hives 
 once several wasps were all together in the same hive they had no choice but to cooperate because pretty soon they were locked into competition with other hives and the most cohesive hives won just as darwin said 
 these early wasps gave rise to the bees and the and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere  
 and it happened again
  even more spectacularly in the last half million years
 when our own ancestors became cultural creatures 
 they came together around a hearth or a campfire  they divided labor  
 they began painting their bodies they spoke their own dialects and eventually they worshiped their own gods 
 once they were all in the same tribe they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside and they
  unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet which is human cooperation
 a force for construction and destruction 
 of course human groups are nowhere near as cohesive as beehives 
 human groups may look like hives for brief moments  
 but they tend to then break apart we 're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are in fact often as we 've seen happen
  a lot of the arab spring revolts often those divisions are along religious lines  
 nonetheless when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement they can move mountains 
 look at the people in these photos i 've been showing you do you think they 're there pursuing their self interest 
 or are they pursuing communal interest which requires them to
  lose themselves and become simply a part of a whole  
 okay  so that was my talk delivered in the standard ted way  and now i 'm going to give the whole talk over again in three minutes in a more
 one of the most common is climbing the secret staircase
 and losing ourselves  the staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary
 upwards to the experience of life as sacred  or deeply interconnected we are homo duplex as durkheim explained 
 and we are homo duplex because we evolved by multilevel selection  as darwin
  i can 't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug  but if it is an adaptation then the implications are profound  
 if it is an adaptation then we evolved to be religious  
 i don 't mean that we evolved to join gigantic organized religions  those things came along too recently  
 i mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others
 circle around sacred objects people and ideas 
 this is why politics is so tribal politics is partly profane it 's partly about self interest
 but politics is also about sacredness it 's about joining with others to pursue moral ideas  
 it 's about the eternal struggle between good
  and most importantly if the staircase is real it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life 
 because human beings are to some extent hivish creatures like bees 
 we 're bees we busted out of the hive during the enlightenment we broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the
  we fly around like individual bees exulting in our freedom  but sometimes we wonder is this all there is what should i do with my life what 's missing 
 what 's missing is that we are homo duplex  but modern secular society was built to satisfy
 our lower profane selves  it 's really comfortable down here on the lower level come have a seat in my home entertainment center
 one great challenge of modern life is to find the staircase amid all the clutter
 and then
 to do something good and noble once you climb to the top 
 i see this desire in my students at the university of virginia they all want to find a cause or calling that they can throw themselves into they
 're all searching for their staircase 
 and that gives me hope
 because people are not purely selfish
 most people long to overcome pettiness and become part of something larger and this explains the extraordinary resonance of this simple metaphor
 conjured up nearly four hundred years ago no man is an island
 entire of itself every man is a piece of the continent a part of the main
