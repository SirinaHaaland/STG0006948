  it 's the study of the way in which human beings are shaped by things that they don 't see and they say
  how can i be a sociologist  how can i understand those invisible forces and i say empathy start
 with empathy  it all begins with empathy take yourself out of your shoes  put yourself into the shoes of another person here i 'll
 give you an example 
 so i imagine my life
 if a hundred years ago china had been the most powerful nation in the world and they came to the united states in search of coal  and they found it
  in fact they found lots of it right here and pretty soon they began shipping that coal 
 ton by ton railcar by railcar boatload by boatload back to china and elsewhere around the world 
 and they got fabulously wealthy in doing so and they built beautiful cities
 all powered
 on that coal  and back
  here
 in the united states  we saw economic despair deprivation this is what i saw i saw people struggling to get by 
 not knowing what was what and what was next  
 and i asked myself the question  how is it possible that we could be so poor here in the united states because coal is such a wealthy resource
  so much money and i realize because the chinese
 ingratiated themselves with a small ruling class here in the united states  who stole all of that money and all of that wealth for themselves  
 and the rest of us the vast majority of us  struggle to get by  
 and the chinese gave this small ruling elite loads of military weapons and sophisticated technology in order to ensure
 that people like me would not speak out against this relationship
  this sound familiar  
 and they did things like train americans to help protect the coal 
 and everywhere there were symbols of the chinese everywhere a constant reminder  
 and back in china 
 what do they say in china nothing
  i 'm not going to turn down my thermostat  you can 't expect that and so i get angry  and i get pissed as do
 lots of average people and we fight back and it gets really ugly and the chinese respond in a very ugly way 
 and before we know it they send in the tanks and they send in the troops  and lots of people are dying
  a very very difficult situation  can you imagine what you would feel
 if you were in my shoes  
 can you imagine walking out of this building and seeing a tank sitting out there  or a truck full of soldiers
 just imagine what you would feel because you know
  you know what they 're doing here and you just feel the anger and you feel the fear 
  if you can that 's empathy  that 's empathy  you 've left your shoes and you 've stood in mine and
 you 've got to feel that  ok so that 's the warm up that 's the warm up now we 're going to have
 the real radical experiment  so for the remainder of my talk what i want you to do
 is put yourselves in the shoes of an ordinary arab muslim
 living in the middle east in particular in iraq
  and so to help you 
 perhaps you 're a member of this middle class family in baghdad 
 what you want is the best for your kids you want your kids to have a better life  and you watch the news you pay attention  you read the newspaper you go down to the coffee shop with your friends you read the newspapers from around the world sometimes
  you even watch satellite cnn from the united states  you have a sense of what the americans are thinking  but really you just want a better life for yourself that 's what you want 
 you 're arab muslim
 living in iraq  you want a better life for yourself  so here  let me help you let me help you with some things that you might be thinking  number one 
 this incursion into your land
 these past twenty years and
  before the reason anyone is interested in your land and particularly the united states is oil
 it 's all about oil  you know that everybody knows that people back in the united states know it 's about oil
  it 's because somebody else has a design for your resource it 's your resource it 's not somebody else 's it 's your land
  it 's your resource somebody else has a design for it  
 and you know why they have a design you know why they have their their eyes set on it  because they have an entire economic system that 's dependent on that oil
 foreign oil oil from other parts of the world that they don 't own  
 and what else do you think about these people
  the americans they 're rich come on they live in big houses they have big cars they all have blond hair blue eyes  
 they 're happy you think that it 's not true of course but that 's the media impression and that 's what you get
 and they have big cities and the cities are all dependent on oil  
 and back home  what do you see  poverty despair  struggle 
 look you don 't live in a wealthy country  i mean this is iraq
  this is what you see  you see people
  not easy you see a lot of poverty and you feel something about this these people have designs for your resource and this is what you see 
 something else you see that you talk about americans don 't talk about this but you do there 's this thing this militarization of the world and it 's centered right in the united states and the united states
 is responsible for almost one half of the world 's military spending
  four percent of the world 's population and you feel it you see it every day it 's part of your life  and you talk about it
 with your friends you read about it  and back when saddam hussein was in power 
 the americans didn 't care about his crimes when he was gassing the kurds and gassing iran they didn 't care about it  when oil was at stake  
 somehow
  things mattered and what you see something else the united states  the hub of democracy around the world
 they don 't seem to really be supporting democratic countries all around the world 
 there are a lot of countries oil producing countries that aren 't very democratic but supported by the united states that 's
 odd oh
  these two wars the ten years of sanctions the eight years
 of occupation the insurgency that 's been unleashed on your people  the tens of thousands the hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths 
 all because of oil  you can 't help but think that you talk about it it 's in the forefront of your mind
 how is that possible and this man  he 's everyman
 your grandfather your uncle your father your son your neighbor your professor your student  
 once a life of happiness and joy
 and suddenly pain and sorrow 
 everyone in your country has been touched by the violence
  the bloodshed  the pain the horror everybody not a single person in your country has not been touched 
 but there 's something else there 's something else about these these people these americans who are there there 's something else about them that you see that they don 't see themselves and what do you see  
 they 're christians
  they 're christians  
 they worship the christian god they have crosses they carry bibles their bibles have a little insignia that says us army on them 
 and their leaders 
 their leaders  
 before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country and you know the reason before they send them off they go to a christian church  and they pray to their christian god and they
  when people die in the war  they are muslims  they are iraqis they
 're not americans you don 't want americans to die protect our troops and you feel something about that of course you do and they do wonderful things  
 you read about it you hear about it they 're there to build schools and help people that 's what they want to do they do wonderful things but they also do the bad things and you can 't tell the difference
  this guy you get a guy like  lt gen william boykin  here 's a guy who says that your god is a false god  your god 's an idol his god is the true god  the solution to the problem in the middle east according to him is to convert you all to christianity
 just get rid of your religion  and you know that americans don 't read about this guy they don 't know anything about him but you do
  you pass it around you pass his words around  i mean this is serious you 're afraid he was one of the leading commanders in the second invasion of iraq and you 're thinking my god 
 if this guy is saying that then all the soldiers must be saying that 
 and this word here george bush called this war a crusade man the americans
  them that 's what this is about and you 're thinking my god these christians are coming to kill us 
 this is frightening you feel frightened of course you feel frightened  
 and this man  terry jones  i mean here 's a guy who wants to burn  qurans right and
 the americans ah he 's a knucklehead he 's a former hotel manager he 's got three dozen members of his church they laugh him off  you don 't laugh him off 
 because in the context
  of everything else all the pieces fit  of course this is how americans think so people all over the middle east not just in your country are protesting 
 he wants to burn qurans our holy book  these christians who are these christians they 're so evil they 're so  mean this is what they 're about 
 this is what you 're thinking as an arab muslim as an iraqi of course you 're going to think this
 check out this website  you 've got to see this this bible boot camp these christians are nuts  they 're training their little kids to be soldiers for jesus
 they take little kids and run them through these things till they teach them how to say ' sir yes sir ' and things like ' grenade toss ' and ' weapons care and maintenance ' and go to the website it
 says ' us army ' right on it  i mean these christians they
  do this to their little kids and you 're reading this website and of course christians in the united states  or anybody says this is some little church in the middle of nowhere you don 't know that 
  for you this is like all christians it 's all over the web bible boot camp and look at this 
  richards i know who these guys are they 're my students my friends i know what they 're thinking  you don 't know when you see them  they 're something else  
 they 're something else  that 's what they are to you 
 we don 't see it that way in the united states  but you see it that way  
 so here of course you 've got it wrong
 you 're generalizing  it 's wrong  you don 't understand the americans  it 's not a christian invasion we 're not just there for oil we 're there for lots of reasons  you have it wrong  
 you 've missed it  and of course most of you don 't support the insurgency you don 't support killing americans you don 't support the terrorists of course you don 't very few
  so now here 's what we 're going to do  step outside
 of your shoes
 that you 're in right now and step back into your normal shoes so everyone 's back in the room  ok  now here comes the radical experiment so we 're all back home 
 this photo  this woman
 man  i feel her i feel her  she 's my sister my wife
 my cousin my neighbor she 's anybody to me these guys standing there everybody in the photo i feel this photo 
 man so here 's what i want you to do let 's go back to my first example of the chinese
  i want you to go there it
 's all about coal and the chinese are here in the united states  what i want you to do is picture her as a chinese woman receiving a chinese flag because her loved
  one has died in america in the coal uprising  and the soldiers are chinese and everybody else is chinese 
 as an american how do you feel about this picture what
 do you think about that scene 
 ok try this  bring it back this is the scene here  it 's an american american soldiers american woman
  who lost her loved one
 in the middle east in iraq or afghanistan   now  put yourself in the shoes go back to the shoes of an arab muslim living in iraq  
 what are you feeling and thinking about this photo about this woman
  now follow me on this
 because i 'm taking a big risk here 
 and so i 'm going to invite you to take a risk with me these gentlemen here  they 're insurgents  they were caught by the american soldiers trying to kill americans 
 and maybe they succeeded  
  put yourself in the shoes of the americans who caught them  
 can you feel the rage  can you feel that you just want to take these guys and wring their necks can you go there 
 it shouldn 't be that difficult you just
  patriotic defenders 
 which one  
 can you feel their anger their fear their rage
 at what has happened in their country  can you imagine that maybe one of them in the morning 
 bent down to their child and hugged their child and said
 'll be back later  i 'm going out to defend your freedom your lives  i 'm going out to look out
 for us  the future of our country can you imagine that  can you imagine saying that  
 can you go there 
  you see that 's empathy  
 it 's also understanding [ understand ]
 now 
 you might ask 
 ok sam so why do you do this sort of thing why would you use this example of all examples and i say  because you 're allowed to hate these people you 're allowed to just
 hate them with every
  fiber of your being and if i can get you to step into their shoes and walk an inch one tiny inch
 then imagine the kind of sociological analysis that you can do
 in all other aspects of your life you can walk a mile when it comes to
  understanding why that person 's driving forty miles per hour
 in the passing lane 
 or your teenage son 
 or your neighbor who annoys you by cutting his lawn on sunday mornings whatever it is you can go so far  
 and this is what i tell my students  step outside of your tiny  little world step inside of the tiny  little world of somebody
  and then do it again and do it again and do it again and suddenly all these tiny little worlds they come together in this complex web  and they build a big complex world 
 and suddenly  without realizing it you 're seeing the world differently  everything has changed  everything in your life has changed  
 and that 's of course  what this is about attend
 to other lives other visions
  people enlighten ourselves  i 'm not saying that i support the terrorists in iraq  
 but as a sociologist  what i am saying is i
 understand and now perhaps perhaps you do
