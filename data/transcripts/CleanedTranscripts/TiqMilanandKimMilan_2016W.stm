  our first conversation was on facebook and it was three days long 
 we shared over three thousand messages between us and it was during those seventy two hours that i knew she was going to be my
  we didn 't wait any prerequisite amount of time for our courtship we told each other the vulnerable truths up front 
 i am a transgender man which means the f on my birth certificate should have stood for false instead of female 
 laughter walking around as a woman in the world felt like walking with pebbles in my shoes
  it took the rhythm out of my swagger  it threw me off balance  it pained me with every step i took forward but
  means the gender i was assigned at birth is still and has always been female 
 this doesn 't make me natural or normal this is just one way of describing the many different ways that we exist in this world  
 and queer is a cultural term but in this case it refers to the way that i 'm not restricted by gender when it comes to choosing partners  
 i 've identified in a few different ways as a bisexual
  as a lesbian but for me queerness encompasses all of the layers of who i am and how i 've loved i 'm layers and not fractions  
 and for me the fact that he was queer meant that i could trust his courtship from the very beginning 
 as queer and trans people we 're so often excluded from institutions and traditions we create spaces outside of convention
  the conventions of time and in those three thousand messages between us  we collapsed time we queered it we laid it all on the table 
 with no pretense at all  and this meant that we were able to commit to each other in a profoundly different way 
 so often what we 're told is this idea
  that we should treat other people the way we want to be treated  
 but the problem with that is that it assumes that we are the standard for other people  and we 're not we need to treat other people the way they want to be treated  which means we had to ask  
 i couldn 't assume that the kind of love that tiq needed was the same kind of love that i needed so i asked him everything about his fears 
 his insecurities and we started from there tm 
 i didn 't know what kind of love i needed i had just come
  out of a year long fog of being rejected and utterly depleted  i had someone look me in my eyes and tell me that i was unworthy of their love because i was trans 
 and there 's a culture of lovelessness that we 've created around transgender people it 's reasoned  justified and often signed into law  and i was a heartbeat away from internalizing that message that i wasn 't worthy  but kim said that i was her ideal the heartbroken mess that i was
 kkm he totally was my ideal 
 in more ways than one 
 both poets writers creatives with a long history of community work behind us and big huge dreams of a family in front of us  
 we shared a lot of things in common but we were also incredibly different i 've been a lifelong traveler and a bit of an orphan
  whereas he comes from a huge family and definitely stays grounded 
 i often kind of sum up the differences in our strengths by saying keep me safe  and i 'll keep you wild tm 
 we have marginalized identities but we don 't live marginalized lives being queer and trans is about creating new ways of existing it
 's about loving people as they are not as
 supposed to be  
 kim is unapologetically feminine in a world that is often cruel and violent to women who are too proud and too freeing 
 and i didn 't enter into this union under the auspices that she was going to be my helper or my rib  
 but a fully complex kkm right that 's not right tm but
 a
 fully complex human being whose femininity wasn 't for me to rein in control or critique it 's her brilliance the way she leads with compassion and how she never loses sight of her empathy
  has been my hero since day one kkm 
 our relationship has always been about setting each other free one of the first questions i asked him was what dreams he had left to accomplish and how would i help him get there 
 his dreams to live as a poet to adopt and raise a family
  to live a life that he was proud of and one that would live up to his mother 's incredible legacy  
 and i really appreciated that we were able to start from that place and not from a place that was around figuring out how to make each other work together  
 and i think this really allowed us to grow into the people that we were in a way that was incredibly different  i love him whole
 now and in the future and it 's this love that had us committed to each other before we 'd even seen each other 's faces
 my mother 's biggest concern when i transitioned was who was going to love me as i am had being transgender somehow
 precluded me from love and monogamy because i was supposedly born in the wrong body but
 it 's this type of structuring that has to be reframed in order to let love in my body never betrayed me and my body was never wrong
  this restrictive binary thinking on gender that said that i didn 't exist  but when we met she loved me for exactly how i showed up 
 she would trace her fingers along the numb  keloid scars left by my top surgery  scars that run from the middle of my chest all the way out to my outer torso  
 she said that these were reminders of my strength and everything that i went through and nothing for me to be ashamed of so sprinting towards her hand in marriage was the
 queerest thing that i could do 
 it flew in the face of more conventional trajectories of love and relationships because god was never supposed to bless a union for folks like us and the law was never supposed to recognize it kkm 
 so on may five  two thousand and fourteen just about three months after meeting online we were married
 on the steps of city
  hall in manhattan  and it was beautiful
 in every conceivable way it
 's safe to say that we reimagined some traditions but we also kept some old ones that we worked in and we created something that worked for us my
 bouquet and corsage was actually filled with wildflowers from brooklyn also added in a little bit of lavender and sage to keep us grounded because we were so nervous
 it was put together by a sweet sister healer friend of ours  
 i never wanted a diamond ring because conflict and convention are not my thing so my ring is the deepest purple like the color of my crown chakra and set in place with my birthstones 
 the gift of queerness is options  i never had to choose his last name it was never an exception  but i did because i am my father 's bastard child someone who has always been an apology
 a secret an imposition  and it was incredibly freeing to choose the name of a man who chose me first tm 
 so we told some family and some close friends many of whom were still in disbelief
 we took our vows  fittingly we posted all of our wedding photos on facebook where we met and instagram of course
 and we quickly realized that our coming together was more than just a union of two people but was a model of possibility for the millions of lgbtq folks who have been sold this lie 
  that family and matrimony is antithetical to who they are for those of us who rarely get to see ourselves reflected in love and
  and the thing is absolutely we are marginalized because of our identities but it also emboldens us to be the people that we are  queerness is our major key  blackness 
  is our magic  it 's because of these things that we are able to be hopeful open receptive and shape shifting 
  not queer like gay  queer like escaping definition queer like some sort of fluidity and limitlessness all at once queer like a freedom too strange 
  to be conquered queer like the fearlessness to imagine what love can look like and to pursue it tm 
  we are part of a community of folks who are living their authentic selves all along the gender spectrum  despite the ubiquitous threat of violence  despite the undercurrent of anxiety that always is present for people who live on their own terms  
 globally a transgender person is murdered every
 and the united states has had more trans
 however our stories are much more than this rigid dichotomy of strength and resilience  we are expanding the human complexity on on these margins and we are creating freedom on these margins kkm 
 and we don 't have any blueprints we 're creating a world that we have literally never seen before  organizing families based on love and not by blood guiding by a compassion that
  of us have been shown ourselves so many of us have not received love from our families have been betrayed by the people that we trust most so what we do here is we create entirely new languages of love 
 ones that are about creating the space for us to be our authentic selves and not imposing this standard of what masculinity or femininity is supposed to be
  are interested in love and inclusion as a tool of revolutionary change  right  
 and the idea is simply if we drop all our preconceived notions about how somebody is supposed to be in their body in their gender in their skin if we take the intentional 
  steps to unlearn these deep seated biases and create space for people to be self determined and embrace who they are then we will definitely create a better world than the one we were born into
 we want to mark this time in history by leaving evidence of the fact that we were here 
 we open up little windows into our relationship for our community to bear witness  and we do this because we want to make maps to the future and not monuments to ourselves 
 our experience does not
  invalidate other peoples ' experience but it should and necessarily does complicate this idea of what love and marriage are supposed to be tm 
 ok  now for all the talking and inspiring
  and possibility modeling we 've done we 've been nowhere near perfect  
 and we 've had to hold a mirror up to ourselves  and i saw that i wasn 't always the best listener  and that my ego got in the way of our progress as a couple
 and i 've had to really assess these deep seated sexist ideas that i 've had about the value of a woman 's experience in the world i 've had to reevaluate what it means to be in allyship with my wife kkm 
 and i had to remind myself of a lot of things too what it means to be hard on the issues but soft on the person  while we were writing this we
  for so many different reasons  
 but based on the content about our values and our lived experiences and we were really hurt you know because what we do and how we love puts ourselves entirely on the line  
 but even though the fight lasted over the course of two days 
 we were able to
 come back together to each other and recommit to ourselves to each other and to our marriage and that really yielded some of the most passionate parts of what we share with you here today tm 
 i have had to interrogate masculinity  which i think doesn 't happen enough i
 've had to interrogate masculinity the toxic privileges that come with being a man don 't define me but i have to be accountable for how it shows up in my life every day 
 i have allowed my wife to do all of the emotional labor of prying open the lines of
  communication when i 'd rather clam up and run away 
 i 've stripped away emotional support instead of facing my own vulnerabilities particularly around the heartbreaking miscarriage we suffered last year  and i 'm sorry for that 
 sometimes as men we get to take the easy way out and so my my journey as a trans person is about reimagining masculinity 
 about creating a manhood that isn 't measured by the power
  it wields by the entitlements afforded to it or any simulacrum of control that it can muster but works in tandem with femininity and is guided by my spirit kkm y 'all 
 and this has created the space for my femininity to flourish in a way i had never experienced before 
 he never
  is threatened by my sexuality  he never polices what i wear or how i act  
 i cook but he does way more of the cleaning than i do and when we 're rushing to get out of the house and we have so much to handle he handles everything so i have time to do my hair and makeup 
 he understands that this is my armor and he never treats femininity as though it is frivolous or
  superficial  and this and him he grows my experience of gender every single day tm i love to watch her get dressed in the morning 
 watching her in the closet looking for something comfortable and colorful  and tight  and safe  
 laughter but it 's challenging to watch her negotiate her decisions looking for something that 's going to get the least amount of attention  but at the same time be an expression of the
  vibrant and sexy woman she is and all i want to do is celebrate her for her beauty and the things that make her beautiful and special and free from her long acrylic nails to her uncompromising black feminism
  get to hear  we constantly experience this retelling of history where we are conspicuously left out  
 and it 's really hard to not see ourselves there  
 and so living out loud for us is about that representation it 's about having possibility models and having hope that love is part of our inheritance in this
  the possibility that we are practicing is about reinventing time love and institutions  we are creating a future of multiplicity  we are expanding the spectrum of gender 
  and sexuality imagining ourselves into existence  imagining a world where gender is self determined and not imposed and where who we are is a kaleidoscope of possibility without the narrow minded limitations masquerading as science
  and i can 't lie  it is really really hard 
 it is hard to stand in the face of bigotry with an open heart and a smile on my face it is really hard to face the injustice that exists in the world while still believing 
  in the ability of people to really change that takes an enormous amount of faith and dedication  
 piles of dirty socks on the floor more boring sports shows than i ever thought possible 
 and fights that bring me to tears when it feels like we 're not speaking the same language  but there is not a day that goes by where i am not so grateful to be married 
  to this man where i 'm not so grateful for the possibility of changing minds and rewarding conversations
  and creating a world where love belongs to us all i think about our acronym
 a
 seemingly endless evolution of self and a community but also this really deep desire not to leave anyone behind  
 we 've learned how to love each other and we 've committed to loving each other throughout changes to gender
 and changes in spirit  and we learned this love in our chat rooms in our clubs in our bars and in our community centers  we 've learned how to love each other for the long haul
