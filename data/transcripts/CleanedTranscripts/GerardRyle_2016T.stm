  you do if you had to figure out
 the information behind eleven point five million documents  verify it and make sense of it 
 that was a challenge that a group of journalists had to face late last year  
 an anonymous person calling himself john doe had somehow managed to copy nearly forty
  years of records of the panamanian law firm mossack fonseca this is one of many firms around the world
 that specialize in setting up accounts in offshore tax havens like the british virgin islands for rich and powerful people who like to keep secrets 
 john doe had managed to copy every
  to the present day 
 it represented the biggest cache of inside information into the tax haven system that anyone had ever seen  
 but it also presented a gigantic challenge to investigative journalism 
 think about it eleven point five million
  containing the secrets of people from more than two hundred different countries where do you start with such a vast resource where do you even begin to tell a story
 that can trail off into every corner of the globe  and that can affect almost any person in any language sometimes in ways they don 't even know yet 
 john doe had given the information to two journalists at the german newspaper sddeutsche zeitung 
 he said he was motivated by
 and i quote the scale of the
  injustice that the documents would reveal 
 but one user alone can never make sense of such a vast amount of information so the sddeutsche zeitung reached out to my organization in washington dc 
 the international consortium of investigative journalists 
 we decided to do something that was the very opposite of everything we 'd been taught to do as journalists share
  by nature investigative reporters are lone wolves  we fiercely guard our secrets at times even from our editors because we know that the moment we tell them what we have they 'll want that story right away  
 and to be frank when you get a good story you like to keep the glory to yourself  
 but there 's no doubt that we live in a shrinking world and that the media has largely been slow to wake up to this
 the issues we report on are more and more transnational  giant corporations operate on a global level  
 environmental and health crises are global so too are financial flows and financial crises 
 so it seems staggering that journalism has been so late to cover stories in a truly global way  
 and it also seems staggering that journalism has been so slow to wake up to the possibilities
 that technology brings  rather than being frightened of it 
 the reason journalists are scared of technology is this  
 the profession 's largest institutions are going through tough times because of the changing way that people are consuming news  
 the advertising business models that have sustained reporting are broken and this has plunged journalism into crisis
  those institutions
 to reexamine how they function  
 but where there is crisis  there is also opportunity  
 the first challenge presented by what would eventually become known as the panama papers was to make the documents searchable and readable 
 there were nearly five million emails two million pdfs that needed to be scanned and indexed  and millions more files and other kinds of documents
  they all needed to be housed in a safe and secure location in the cloud  we next invited reporters to have a look at the documents in all reporters from
 more than one hundred media organizations in seventy six countries
 from the bbc in britain
 to le monde newspaper in france to the asahi shimbun in japan native eyes on native names we called it
  the idea being who best to tell you who was important to nigeria
 than a nigerian journalist who best in canada than a canadian 
 there were only two rules for everyone who was invited  we all agreed to share everything that we found with everybody else  
 and we all agreed to publish together on the same day  
 we chose our media partners based on trust that had been built up through previous smaller
  collaborations
 and also from leads that jumped out from the documents
 over the next few months my small nonprofit organization of less than twenty people was joined by more than three hundred and fifty other reporters from twenty five language groups 
 the biggest information leak in history had now spawned the biggest journalism collaboration in history 
  sets of native eyes
 doing what journalists normally never do working shoulder to shoulder sharing information but telling no one 
 for it became clear at this point that in order to make the biggest kind of noise  we first needed
 the biggest kind of silence 
 to manage the project over the many months it would take we built a secure virtual newsroom  we used encrypted communication systems  
 and we built a specially designed search engine
 inside the virtual newsroom  the reporters could gather around the themes that were emerging from the documents those interested in
 blood diamonds or exotic art for instance could share information about how the offshore world was being used to hide the trade in both of those commodities 
 those interested in sport
 could share information about how famous sports stars were putting their image rights into offshore companies
  likely avoiding taxes in the countries where they plied their trade but perhaps most exciting of all were the number of world leaders
 and elect politicians that were emerging from the documents
 figures like petro poroshenko in ukraine  close associates of vladimir putin in russia
 and the british prime minister
  who is linked through his late father  ian cameron  buried in the documents
 were secret offshore entities such as  wintris inc 
 a company in the british virgin islands that had actually belonged to the sitting icelandic prime minister  
 i like to refer to johannes kristjansson the icelandic reporter we invited to join the project as the loneliest man in the world for nine months
  he refused paid work and lived off the earnings of his wife 
 he pasted tarps over the windows of his home to prevent prying eyes during the long icelandic winter 
 and he soon ran out of excuses to explain his many absences  as he worked red eyed night after night month after month 
 in all that time he sat on information that would eventually bring down the leader of his country
 when you 're an investigative reporter and you make an amazing discovery such as your prime minster can be linked to a secret offshore company that that company has a financial interest in icelandic banks the very issue he 's been elected on
 well your instinct is to scream out very loud instead as one of the few people that
  reporters like johannes wanted to scream they did so inside the virtual newsroom  
 and then they turned those screams into stories by going outside the documents to court records
 official company registers  and by eventually putting questions
  those that we intended to name panama papers actually 
  allowed the reporters to look at the world through a different lens from everybody else  
 as we were researching the story  unconnected to us a major political bribery scandal happened in brazil 
 a new leader was elected in argentina  the fbi
 began to indict officials at fifa
  organization that controls the world of professional soccer 
 the panama papers actually had unique insights into each one of these unfolding events so you can imagine the pressure
 and the ego dramas that could have ruined what we were trying to do any of one of these journalists they could have broken the pact  but they didn 't and on april
  the panama papers quickly became one of the biggest stories of the year  this is the scene in iceland the day after we
  it was the first of many protests  the icelandic prime minister had to resign it was a first of many resignations  
 we spotlighted many famous people such as lionel messi   the most famous soccer player in the world
 and there were some unintended consequences these alleged members of a mexican drug cartel were arrested after we
 published details about their hideout they 'd been using the address
 to register their offshore company
 there 's a kind of irony in what we 've been able to do  the technology the internet
 that has broken the business model is allowing us to reinvent journalism itself  
 and this dynamic is producing unprecedented levels of transparency and impact we showed how a group of journalists can effect change across the world
 by applying new methods and old fashioned journalism techniques
 to vast amounts of leaked information  
 we put all important context around what was given to us by john doe  and by sharing resources we were able to dig deep
 much deeper
 and longer than most media organizations allow these days  because of financial concerns  
 now it was a big risk  and it wouldn 't work for every story but we showed with the panama papers that you can write about
  country from just about anywhere  and then choose your preferred battleground to defend your work  
 try obtaining a court injunction that would prevent the telling of a story in seventy six different countries  try stopping the inevitable  
 shortly after we published i got a three word text from johannes
  i guess you 're going to send that applause to the three hundred and fifty journalists
  in secrecy for over a year with
 colleagues from all over the world was there ever a moment when you thought that
 the leak may be leaked that the collaboration may just be broken by somebody publishing a story or somebody not in the group
 releasing some information that they got to know gerard ryle we had a series of of crises along the way including when something major was happening in the world
 the journalists from that country wanted to publish right away  we had to calm them down probably the biggest crisis we had was a week before publication  
 we 'd sent a series of questions to the associates of vladimir putin 
 but instead of responding  the kremlin actually held a press conference and denounced us and denounced the whole thing as being  i guess a plot from the west
  that point putin thought it was just about him  
 and of course a lot of editors around the world were very nervous about this they thought the story was going to get out you can imagine the amount of time they 'd spent the amount of resources money
 spent on this so i had to basically spend the last week calming everyone down a bit like a general where you 're holding your troops back 
 calm  remain calm and then eventually of course they all did bg 
 and then
  couple weeks ago or so you released
 a lot of the documents as an open database for everybody to search via keyword essentially gr
 we very much believe that that the basic information about the offshore world should be made public now we didn 't publish the underlying documents of the journalists we 're working with but the basic information such as
 the name of a person what their offshore company was and the name of that company is now all available online in fact the biggest resource of its kind basically is out there now
