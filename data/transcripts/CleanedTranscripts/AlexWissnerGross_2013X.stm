  if we take a look back at the history of how intelligence has been viewed one seminal example has been
  machine can think is about as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim 
 when he wrote this intended it as a criticism of the early pioneers of computer science like alan turing  however if you take a
  and think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build
 artificial machines that swim
 and artificial machines that [ fly ] 
 you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming
 and flight that we were able to build these machines  
 and so  several years ago  i undertook a program to try to understand the
  fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence  
 let 's take a step back 
 let 's first begin with a thought experiment 
 pretend that you 're an alien race that doesn 't know anything about earth biology or earth neuroscience or earth intelligence  
 but you have amazing telescopes
 and you 're able to watch the earth and you have amazingly long lives
  lives so you 're able to watch the earth over millions even billions of years 
 and you observe a really strange effect you observe
 that over the course of the millennia earth is continually bombarded with asteroids
 up until a point and that at some point  corresponding roughly to our year two thousand
  asteroids that are on a collision course with the earth that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get deflected
 or they detonate before they can hit the earth 
 now of course as earthlings we know the reason would be that we 're trying to save ourselves we 're trying to prevent an impact 
 but if you 're an alien race who doesn 't know any of this doesn 't have any concept of earth intelligence
  you 'd be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how up until a certain point in time 
 asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet
 mysteriously stop doing that  and so i claim
 that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence  so in this program that i undertook
  several years ago  i looked at a variety of different threads
 across science  across a variety of disciplines that were pointing i think  towards a single underlying mechanism for intelligence 
 in cosmology for example  
 there have been a variety of different threads of evidence that our universe appears to be finely tuned for the development of intelligence
  particular for the development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible futures 
 in game play  for example in go everyone remembers in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven when ibm 's deep blue beat garry kasparov at chess
 fewer people are aware that in the past ten years or so the game of go arguably a much more challenging game because it has a much
  higher branching factor has also started to succumb to computer game players for the same reason 
 the best techniques right now for computers playing go are techniques that try to maximize future options during game play  
 finally 
 in robotic motion planning there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to take advantage of abilities of robots
 to maximize future freedom of action in order to accomplish complex tasks  
 and so taking all of these different threads and putting them together  
 i asked  starting several years ago  
 is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different threads is there a single
  what you 're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an e = mc for intelligence that i 've seen 
 so what you 're seeing here is a statement of correspondence
 that intelligence is a force  f 
 that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action it acts to maximize future freedom of
  action or keep options open with some strength t 
 with the diversity of possible accessible futures s up to some future time horizon tau 
 in short intelligence doesn 't like to get trapped intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action and keep options open  
  given this one equation it 's natural to ask so what can you do with this how predictive is it does it predict human level intelligence does it predict artificial intelligence  so i 'm going to show you now a video
 that will i think demonstrate some of the amazing applications of just this single equation narrator 
 recent research in cosmology has suggested that
  over their lifetimes should tend to have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings such as ourselves  but what if that tentative cosmological connection between entropy 
  and intelligence hints at a deeper relationship what if intelligent behavior doesn 't just correlate with the production of long term entropy but actually emerges directly from it to find out we developed a software engine
  to maximize the production of long term entropy of any system that it finds itself in 
 amazingly entropica was able to pass multiple animal intelligence tests play human games  and even earn money trading stocks all without being instructed to do so 
  here are some examples of entropica in action just like a human standing upright without falling over here we see  entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart 
  a goal it simply decided on its own to balance the pole this balancing ability will have appliactions for humanoid robotics and human assistive technologies 
 just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into narrow spaces 
 here we see that entropica again on its own initiative was able to move a large disk representing an animal around so as to cause a small disk representing
  a tool to reach into a confined space holding a third disk and release the third disk from its initially fixed position this tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing 
 and agriculture in addition just as some other animals are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release food 
  for economic planning and a variety of other fields 
 entropica is broadly applicable to a variety of domains 
 for example here we see it successfully playing a game of pong against itself illustrating its potential for gaming 
 here we see entropica orchestrating new connections on a social network where friends are constantly falling out of touch and successfully keeping the network well connected 
 this same network
  orchestration ability also has applications in health care  energy and intelligence  
 here we see  entropica directing the paths of a fleet of ships successfully discovering and utilizing the panama canal to globally extend its reach from the atlantic to the pacific 
 by the same token  entropica is broadly
  on a simulated range traded stock successfully growing assets under management exponentially 
 this risk management ability will have broad applications in finance and insurance alex wissner gross 
 so what you 've just seen is that a variety of
 signature human intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tool use and walking upright
 and social cooperation all follow from a single equation  which drives a system
 to maximize its future freedom of action now there 's a profound irony
  going back to the beginning of the usage of the term robot the play
 there was always a concept that if we developed machine intelligence  there would be a cybernetic revolt 
 the machines would rise up against us 
 one major consequence of this work is that maybe all of these decades we 've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt in reverse
  reverse 
 it 's not that machines first become intelligent and then megalomaniacal and try to take over the world it 's quite the opposite 
 that the urge to take control of all possible futures is a more fundamental principle than that of intelligence that general intelligence may in fact emerge directly from this sort of
 control grabbing rather than vice versa
 another important consequence is goal seeking 
 i 'm often asked how does the ability to seek goals
 follow from this sort of framework and the answer is the ability to seek goals will follow directly from this in the following sense 
 just like you would travel through a tunnel
  bottleneck in your future path space in order to achieve many other diverse objectives later on 
 or just like you would invest in a financial security  reducing your short term liquidity in order to increase your wealth over the long term 
 goal seeking emerges directly from a long term drive to increase future freedom of action
  feynman famous physicist  once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed
 and you could pass only a single concept on to our descendants to help them rebuild civilization that concept should be that all matter around us is made 
  out of tiny elements that attract each other when they 're far apart but repel each other when they 're close together 
  on to descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence is the following 
 intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future 
 thank you very much
