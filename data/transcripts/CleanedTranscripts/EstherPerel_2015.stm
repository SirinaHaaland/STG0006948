  and why do happy people cheat  and when we say infidelity what exactly do we mean
  is it a hookup a love story paid sex a chat room a massage with a happy ending  
 why do we think that men cheat out of boredom and fear of intimacy  but women cheat out of loneliness and hunger for intimacy  
 and is an affair always the end of a relationship  
 for the past ten years
 traveled the globe and worked extensively with hundreds of couples who have been shattered by infidelity 
 there is one simple act of transgression that can rob a couple
 of their relationship their happiness and their very identity an affair
  and yet this extremely common act is so poorly understood  so this talk
 is for anyone who has ever loved  
 adultery has existed since marriage was invented  and so too the taboo against it  
 in fact infidelity has a tenacity that marriage can only envy so much so that this is
  the only commandment that is repeated twice in the bible 
 once for doing it  and once just for thinking about it 
 laughter so how do we reconcile what is universally forbidden  yet universally practiced  
  practically had a license to cheat with little consequence  
 and supported by a host of biological and evolutionary theories that justified their need to roam  
 so the double standard is as old as adultery itself  
 but who knows what 's really going on under the sheets there right because when it comes to sex the pressure for men is to boast and to exaggerate
  exaggerate  but the pressure for women
 is to hide  minimize and deny  which isn 't surprising when you consider that there are still nine countries where women can be killed for straying  
 now  monogamy used to be one person for life  
  i mean many of you probably have said i am monogamous in all my relationships 
 we used to marry  and had sex for the first time  but now we marry  and we stop having sex with others
  the fact is that monogamy had nothing to do with love  
 men relied on women 's fidelity in order to know whose children these are  
 and who gets the cows when i die  
 now  
 everyone wants to know what percentage of people cheat i 've been asked that question since i arrived at this conference 
 it applies to you  but the definition of
  infidelity keeps on expanding 
 sexting  
 watching porn  staying secretly active on dating apps so because there is no universally agreed upon definition of what even constitutes an infidelity 
 estimates vary widely from twenty six percent
  but on top of it 
 we are walking contradictions so ninety five percent of us will say that it is terribly wrong for our partner to lie about having an affair  but just about the same 
  amount of us will say that that 's exactly what we would do if we were having one 
  relationship  which is the core structure of an affair  an emotional connection to one degree or another  
 and a sexual alchemy  and alchemy is the key word here because the erotic frisson is such
 that the kiss that you only imagine giving can be as powerful and as enchanting
 as hours of actual lovemaking 
 as marcel proust said it 's our imagination that is responsible for love not the other person  
 so it 's never been easier
 to cheat  and it 's never been more difficult to keep a secret
  and never has infidelity exacted such a psychological toll 
 when marriage was an economic enterprise infidelity threatened our economic security  
 but now that marriage is a romantic arrangement infidelity threatens our emotional security  ironically 
 we used to turn to adultery
 that was the space where we sought pure love  but now that we seek love in
  marriage adultery destroys it  now there are three ways that i think infidelity hurts differently today 
 we have a romantic ideal
 in which we turn to one person
 to fulfill an endless list of needs to be my greatest lover my best friend the best parent my
  trusted confidant my emotional companion my intellectual equal  
 and i am it  i 'm chosen  
 i 'm unique  i 'm indispensable  i 'm irreplaceable  i 'm the one 
 and infidelity tells me
 i 'm not it is the ultimate betrayal infidelity shatters the grand ambition of love
 but if throughout history  infidelity has always been painful  
 today it is often traumatic because it threatens our sense of self  
 so my patient fernando  he 's plagued  he goes on i thought i knew my life  i thought i knew who you were who we were
  a violation of trust a crisis of identity can i ever trust you again he asks can i ever trust anyone again 
 and this is also what my patient heather
 is telling me when she 's talking to me about her story with nick married two kids nick just left on a business trip  
 and heather is playing on his ipad with the boys when she sees
 a message appear on the screen can 't wait to see you strange she thinks we just saw each other 
 and then another message can 't wait to hold you in my arms and heather realizes
 these are not for her she also tells me that her father
  she found one little receipt in the pocket  and a little bit of lipstick on the collar 
 heather 
 she goes digging  
 and she finds hundreds of messages  and photos exchanged and desires expressed the vivid details of nick 's two year affair unfold in front of her in real time  
 and it made me think affairs in the digital age are death by a
  cuts  
 but then we have another paradox that we 're dealing with these days because of this romantic ideal 
 we are relying on our partner 's fidelity with a unique fervor  
 but we also have never been more inclined to stray  and not because we have new desires today
  but because we live in an era where we feel that we are entitled to pursue our desires because this is the culture where i deserve to be happy  
 and if we used to divorce because we were unhappy  today we divorce because we could be happier  
 and if divorce carried all the shame  
 today  choosing to stay when you can leave is the new shame  
 so heather she can 't talk to her
  because she 's afraid that they will judge her for still loving nick and everywhere she turns  she gets the same advice leave him  
 throw the dog on the curb  
 and if the situation were reversed nick would be in the same situation  staying is the new shame  
 so if we can divorce why do we still have affairs
 now  the typical assumption is that if someone cheats  either there 's something wrong in your relationship or wrong with you 
 but millions of people can 't all be pathological 
 the logic goes like this if you have everything you need at home
  then there is no need to go looking elsewhere  
 assuming that there is such a thing as a perfect marriage that will inoculate us against wanderlust  
 but what if passion has a finite shelf life  
 what if there are things that even a good relationship can never provide 
 if even happy people cheat  what is it about 
 the vast majority of
  people that i actually work with are not at all chronic 
 they are often people who are deeply monogamous in their beliefs and at least for their partner  
 but they find themselves in a conflict between their values and their behavior  
 they often are people who have actually been
  but one day they cross a line that they never thought they would cross  and at the risk of losing everything  
 but for a glimmer of what 
 affairs are an act of betrayal  and they are also an expression of longing and loss 
 at the heart of an affair  you will often find
 a longing and a yearning for an emotional connection for novelty
  for freedom for autonomy for sexual intensity 
 a wish to recapture lost parts of ourselves or an attempt to bring back vitality in the face of loss and tragedy 
 i 'm thinking about another patient of mine priya 
 who is blissfully married  loves her husband and would never want to hurt the man
 she also tells me that she 's always done what was expected of her good girl good wife good mother  
 taking care of her immigrant parents  
 priya  
 she fell for the arborist who removed the tree from her yard after hurricane sandy 
 and with his truck and
  he 's quite the opposite of her 
 but at forty seven priya 's affair is about the adolescence that she never had and her story highlights for me
 that when we seek the gaze of another 
 it isn 't always our partner that we are turning away from  but the person that we have ourselves become  
 and it isn 't so much that we 're looking for another person as much as we are looking
 for another self  
 now all over the world there is one word that people who have affairs always tell me 
 they feel alive  
 and they often will tell me stories of recent losses of a parent who died  and a friend that went too soon and bad news at the doctor 
  and mortality often live in the shadow of an affair  because they raise these questions is this it 
 is there more am i going on for another twenty five years like this 
 will i ever feel that thing again  
 and it has led me to think that perhaps these questions are the ones that propel people to cross
  the line and that some affairs are an attempt to beat back deadness in an antidote to death 
 and contrary to what you may think 
 affairs are way less about sex  and a lot more about desire desire for attention  desire to feel special
  desire to feel important  
 and the very structure of an affair  the fact that you can never have your lover  keeps you wanting that in itself is a desire machine  
 because the incompleteness the ambiguity  keeps you wanting that which you can 't have 
 now some of you probably think that affairs don 't happen in open
  first of all the conversation about monogamy is not the same as the conversation about infidelity  
 but the fact is that it seems that even when we have the freedom to have other sexual partners we still seem to be lured by the power of the forbidden 
 that if we do that which we are not supposed to do then we feel like we are really doing what we want to
  i 've also told quite a few of my patients that if they could bring into their relationships
 one tenth of the boldness the imagination and the verve that they put into their affairs they probably would never need to see me 
 so how do we heal from an affair
  but it can be healed  
 and some affairs are death  knells for relationships that were already dying on the vine  
 but others will jolt us into new possibilities  the fact is the majority of couples who have experienced affairs stay together  
 but some of them will merely survive  and others will actually be able to turn a crisis into an opportunity
 they 'll be able to turn this into a generative experience and i 'm actually thinking even more so for the deceived partner who will often say you think i didn 't want more but i 'm not the one who did it 
 but now that the affair is exposed they too get to claim more  and they no longer have to uphold the status quo that may not have been working for them that well either
 've noticed
 that a lot of couples in the immediate aftermath of an affair because of this new disorder that may actually lead to a new order will have depths of conversations with honesty and openness that they haven 't had in decades 
 and partners who were sexually indifferent find themselves suddenly so lustfully voracious they don 't know where it 's coming from
  something about the fear of loss will rekindle desire  and make way for an entirely new kind of truth 
 so when an affair is exposed  what are some of the specific things that couples can do 
 we know from trauma that healing begins when the perpetrator acknowledges
  their wrongdoing 
 so for the partner who had the affair 
 for nick one
 thing is to end the affair but the other is the essential important act of expressing guilt and remorse for hurting his wife  
 but the truth is that i have noticed that quite a lot of people who have affairs may feel terribly guilty for hurting their partner
  but they don 't feel guilty for the experience of the affair itself  and that distinction is important  
 and nick  he needs to hold vigil for the relationship  
 he needs to become for a while the protector of the boundaries it 's his responsibility to bring it up because if he thinks about it  he can relieve heather from the obsession and from having to make sure that the affair isn 't forgotten
  and that in itself begins to restore trust 
 but for heather or deceived partners it is essential to do things that bring back
 a sense of  self worth to surround oneself with love and with friends and activities that give back joy and meaning and identity
  but even more important  
 is to curb the curiosity to mine for the sordid details where were you where did you do it  how often is she better than me in bed 
 questions that only inflict more pain and keep you awake at night  
 and instead switch to what i call the investigative questions the ones that mine the meaning and the motives what did this affair mean for you 
 what were you able to express
  or experience there that you could no longer do with me what was it like for you when you came home what is it about us that you value 
 are you pleased this is over 
 every affair will redefine a relationship  and every couple
 will determine what the legacy of the affair will be but
  affairs are here to stay  and they 're not going away 
 and the dilemmas of love and desire 
 they don 't yield just simple answers of black and white and good and bad and victim and perpetrator 
 betrayal in a relationship
 comes in many forms there are many ways that we betray our partner with contempt with neglect
  indifference with violence 
 sexual betrayal is only one way to hurt a partner in other words the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage  
 now you 've listened to me  and i know what you 're thinking she has a
  but because i think that good can come out
  i have often been asked this very strange question would i ever recommend it  
 now i would no more recommend you have an affair than i would recommend you have cancer  
 and yet we know that people who have been ill often talk about how their illness has yielded them a new perspective  
 the main question that i 've been asked since i arrived at this conference when i said i would talk
  i look at affairs from a dual perspective  hurt and betrayal on one side  growth and 
 on the other what it did to you and what it meant for me  and so when a couple comes to me
 in the aftermath of an affair that has been revealed
  i will often tell them this today in the west  most of us are going to have two or three
 relationships or marriages  and some of us are going to do it with the same person 
 your first marriage is over would you like to create a second one together  thank you
