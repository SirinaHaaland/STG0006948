  i want to talk about a tale of two cities 
  the united states and the
  the languages we speak in the future  
 the jobs we have the political systems we choose and of course the great questions of war and peace 
 you see that bloke  he 's french 
 his name is napoleon a couple of hundred years ago he made this extraordinary projection 
 china is a sleeping lion and when she awakes the world will shake
  got a few things wrong he got this one absolutely right because china is today not just
 woken up china has stood up and china is on the march and the question for us all
 is where will china go and how do we engage this giant of the 21st century
  you start looking at the numbers they start to confront you in a big way  it 's projected that china will become by whichever measure ppp market exchange rates
 the largest economy in the world over the course of the decade ahead
  they 're already the largest trading nation already the largest exporting nation already the largest manufacturing nation  
 and they 're also the biggest emitters of carbon in the world
  america comes second
 so
 if china does become the world 's largest economy think about this it 'll be the first time
 since this guy was on the throne of england george iii not a good friend of napoleon 's that
  and if you don 't think that 's going to affect the way in which the world happens in the future then personally i think you 've been smoking something and it doesn 't mean you 're from
 colorado  
 so in short the question we have tonight is how do we understand this
 mega change which i believe to be the biggest change for the first half of the 21st century  
 it 'll affect so many things 
 it will go to the absolute core it 's happening quietly it 's happening persistently  it 's happening in some senses under the radar as we are all preoccupied with
 what 's going in ukraine what 's going on in the middle east what 's going on with isis what 's going on with isil what 's happening with the future of our economies
  this is a slow and quiet revolution and with a 
  comes also a mega challenge and the mega challenge is this can these two great countries china and the united states
 china
  which in chinese by the way  means the beautiful country think about that that
 's the name that china has given this country for more than a hundred years 
 whether these two great civilizations these two great countries can in fact carve out a common future for themselves
 and for the world  in short  
 can we carve out a future which is peaceful and mutually prosperous or are we looking at a great challenge of war or peace 
 and i have fifteen minutes to work through war or peace  which is
 a little less time than they gave this guy to write a book
  why is it that a kid growing up in rural australia got interested in learning chinese well there are two reasons for that here 's the first of them 
 that 's betsy the cow 
 now betsy the cow
 was one of a herd of dairy cattle that i grew up with on a farm in rural australia see those hands there these are not built for farming  
 so very early on i discovered that in fact  working in a farm was
  not designed for me and china was a very safe remove from any career in australian farm life  here 's the second reason 
 that 's my mom anyone here ever listen to what their mom told them to do  
 everyone ever do what their mom told them to do i rarely did
  but what my mom said to me was one day she handed me a newspaper 
  just turned fourteen years of age  and she handed me this headline  
 and she said understand this learn this because it 's going to affect your future so being a very good student of history 
  i decided that the best thing for me to do was in fact to go off and learn chinese the great thing about learning chinese is that your chinese teacher gives you a new name  
 and so they gave me this name 
 k which means to overcome
 or to conquer and wn and that 's the character for literature or the arts k wn 
  it 's a major lift from being called kevin to be called conqueror of the classics 
 i 've been called kevin all my life have you been called kevin all your life  would you prefer to be called conqueror of the classics
  and so i went off after that and joined the australian foreign service but here is where pride before pride there always comes a fall 
 so there i am in the embassy in
  beijing off to the great hall of the people with our ambassador who had asked me to interpret for his first meeting in the great hall of the people  
 and so there was i if you 've been to a chinese meeting it 's a giant horseshoe at the head of the horsehoe are the really serious pooh bahs 
 and down the end of the horseshoe are the not so serious pooh bahs the junior woodchucks like me  
 and so the ambassador began with this inelegant phrase he said
  china and australia are currently enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness and
 i thought to myself that sounds clumsy  that sounds odd  
 i will improve it 
 note to file never do that 
 it needed to be a little more elegant a little more classical 
  there was a big pause on the other side of the room 
 you could see the giant 
  pooh bahs at the head of the horseshoe  the blood visibly draining from their faces  and the junior woodchucks at the other end of the horseshoe
 engaged in peals of unrestrained laughter  because when i rendered his sentence
  australia and china are enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness in fact what i said was that australia and china were now experiencing fantastic orgasm 
 that was the last time i was asked to interpret
 but in that little story there 's a wisdom which is as soon as you think you know something about this extraordinary civilization of five thousand years of continuing history there 's always something new
  to learn 
 history is against us when it comes to the u s and china forging a common future together 
 this guy up here he 's not chinese and he 's not american he 's greek his name 's thucydides he wrote the history of the peloponnesian wars  
 and he made this extraordinary observation about
  it was the rise of athens and the fear that this inspired in sparta that made war inevitable and hence a whole literature about something called the thucydides trap 
 this guy here  he 's not american and he 's not greek he 's chinese his name is sun tzu 
 he wrote the art of war and if you see his statement underneath it 's along these lines attack him where he is unprepared appear where
  not looking good so far
 for china and the united states 
 this guy is an american his name 's graham allison 
 in fact he 's a teacher at the kennedy school over there in boston 
 he 's working on a single project at the moment which is does the thucydides trap about the inevitably of war between rising powers and established great powers apply to the future of china u s relations  it 's a core question 
 and what graham has done is explore fifteen cases
  in history since the 
 to establish what the precedents are and in eleven out of fifteen of them let me tell you they 've ended in catastrophic war 
 you may say 
 but kevin
 or conqueror of the classics
 that was
  we live now in a world of interdependence and globalization it could never happen again guess what 
 the economic historians tell us that in fact  
 the time which we reached the greatest point of economic integration and globalization was in one thousand nine hundred and fourteen just before
 that happened world war i a sobering reflection from history  
 so if we are engaged in this great question of how china thinks feels
 and
 positions itself towards the united states and the reverse how do we get to the baseline of how these two countries and civilizations can possibly work together
 let me first go to in fact  china 's views of the u s and the rest of the west number one 
 china feels as if it 's been humiliated at the hands of the west through a hundred years of history beginning with the
  opium wars when after that  the western powers carved china up into little pieces so that by the time it got to the ' 20s and ' 30s signs like this one appeared on the streets of shanghai [ no dogs and chinese allowed ]
 how would you feel if you were chinese in your own country if you saw that sign appear china also believes and feels
  the peace conference in paris when germany 's colonies were given back to all sorts of countries around in the world what about german colonies in china they were in fact given to japan 
 when japan then invaded china in the 
 the world looked away and was indifferent to what would happen to china 
 and then on top of that the chinese to this day believe that the united states and the west do not accept the legitimacy of their political system because it 's so radically different
  from those of us who come from liberal democracies  and believe that the united states to this day is seeking to undermine their political system 
 china also believes that it is being contained
 by u s allies and by those with strategic partnerships with the u s right around its periphery 
 and beyond all that the chinese have this feeling in their heart of hearts and in their gut of guts
  that those of us in the collective west
 are just too damned arrogant  
 that is we don 't recognize the problems in our own system in our politics and our economics and are very quick to point the finger elsewhere  and believe that in fact 
 we in the collective west are guilty of a great bunch of hypocrisy 
  relations  
 it 's not just the sound of one hand clapping 
 there 's another country too  and that 's called the u s so how does the u s respond to all of the above the u s has a response to each of those 
 on the question of is the u s containing china they say no look at the history of the soviet union that was containment instead what we have done in the
  and the west is welcome china into the global economy and on top of that  welcome them into the world trade organization 
 the u s and the west say china cheats on the question of intellectual property rights  and through cyberattacks on u s and global firms  
 furthermore  the united states says that the chinese political system is fundamentally wrong because it 's at such fundamental variance 
 to the human rights democracy and rule of law that we enjoy in the u s and the collective west
 and on top of all the above what does the united states say  that they fear that china
 will when it has sufficient power establish a sphere of influence in southeast asia and wider east asia  boot the united states out and in time when it 's powerful enough unilaterally seek to change the rules of the global order 
  so apart from all of that it 's just fine and dandy the u s china relationship no real problems there 
 the challenge though is given those  deep rooted feelings those deep rooted emotions and thought patterns what the chinese call swi ways of thinking 
 how can we craft a basis for a common future between these two 
 i argue simply this we can do it on the basis on a framework
 of constructive realism for a common purpose
 what do i mean by that  be realistic about the things that we disagree on and a management approach that doesn 't enable any one of those differences to break into war or conflict until we 've acquired the diplomatic skills to solve them 
 be constructive in areas of the bilateral regional and global engagement between the two which will make a difference for all of
  a regional institution capable of cooperation in asia an asia pacific community  and worldwide  
 act further  like you 've begun to do at the end of last year
 by striking out against climate change
 with hands joined together rather than fists apart 
 of course all that happens if you 've got a common mechanism and political will to achieve the above these things are deliverable
  but the question is are they deliverable
 alone this is what our head tells us we need to do but what about our heart 
 i have a little experience in the question back home of how you try to bring together two peoples who frankly haven 't had a whole lot in common in the past 
 and that 's when i apologized to australia 's indigenous peoples 
 this was a day of reckoning in the australian government the australian parliament and for the australian people
 two hundred years of unbridled abuse towards the first australians  it was high time that we white folks said we were sorry  
 the important thing 
 the important thing that i remember is staring in the faces of all those from aboriginal australia as they came to listen to this apology  
 it was
  extraordinary to see for example old women
 telling me the stories of when they were five years old and literally ripped away from their parents like this lady here  
 it was extraordinary for me to then be able to embrace and to kiss aboriginal elders as they came into the parliament building and one woman said to me it 's the first time a white fella had ever kissed her in her life and she was over
 that 's a terrible story
  and then i remember this family saying to me 
 you know  we drove all the way from the far north down to canberra to come to this thing drove our way through redneck country on the way back stopped at a cafe
 after the apology for a milkshake and they walked into this cafe quietly
  gingerly a little anxious  i think you know what i 'm talking about but the day after the apology what happened
  everyone in that cafe every one of the white folks stood up
 and applauded something had happened
 in the hearts of these people in australia
  the white folks our aboriginal brothers and sisters  and we haven 't solved all these problems together but let me tell you there was a new beginning
 because we had gone not just to the head we 'd gone also to the heart  
 so where does that conclude in terms of the great question that we 've been asked to address this evening which is the future of u s china relations  
 the head says there 's a way
  the head says there is a policy framework there 's a common narrative there 's a mechanism through regular summitry to do these things and to make them better  but the heart must also find 
 a way to reimagine the possibilities of the america china relationship  and the possibilities of china 's future engagement in the world 
  china they now talk about the chinese dream  in america we 're all familiar with the term the american dream 
 i think it 's time across the world that we 're able to think also
 of something we might also call
 a dream for all humankind
 we might just change the way
 that we think about each other
 that 's my challenge to america that 's my challenge to china that 's my challenge to all of us but i think where there 's a will
 and where there is imagination we can turn this into a future
 driven by peace and prosperity and not once again repeat the tragedies of war i thank you
  sides kevin rudd well what we australians do best is organize the drinks so
 you get them together in one room and we suggest this and suggest that then we go and get the drinks  but no look for all of us who are friends of these two great countries america and china you can do something 
 you can make a practical contribution  and for all you good folks here
 next time you meet someone from
  sit down and have a conversation 
 see what you can find out about where they come from and what they think and my challenge for all the chinese folks who are going to watch this ted talk at some time is
 do the same two of us seeking to change the world can actually make a huge difference those of us up the middle we can make a small contribution
