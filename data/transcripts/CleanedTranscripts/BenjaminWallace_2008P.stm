  was sold for one hundred and five thousand pounds nine times the previous world record
 the buyer was kip forbes  son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century the original owner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the  18th century
 chteau lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world  the prince of any wine cellar benjamin wallace now that 's about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest running
 mystery in the modern wine
 and the mystery existed because of a gentleman named hardy rodenstock in one thousand nine hundred and eighty five he announced to his friends in the wine world that he had made this incredible discovery some workmen in paris had broken through a brick wall 
 and happened upon this hidden cache of
 wines apparently the property of thomas jefferson
  reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal
 exactly who owned the building the mystery persisted for about twenty years  it finally began to get resolved in two thousand and five because of this guy  
 bill koch is a florida billionaire who owns four of the jefferson bottles  and he became suspicious  and he ended up spending over a million dollars
  agents to
 try to get to the bottom of this  there 's now ample evidence that hardy rodenstock is a con man  and that the jefferson bottles
 were fakes  but for those twenty years an unbelievable number of really
 eminent and accomplished figures in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles  i think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world
 must be the best bottle of wine in the world must be the
  rarest bottle of wine in the world i became
 increasingly kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of you know  why do people spend these crazy amounts of money not only on wine but on
 on lots of things and are they living a better life than me so i decided to embark on a quest with the generous backing of a magazine i write
  i decided to sample the very best or most expensive or most coveted
 item in about a dozen categories which was a very grueling quest as you can imagine 
 this was the first one a lot of the kobe beef that you see in the u s is not the real thing  it may come from wagyu cattle but it 's not from the original appalachian hyogo prefecture 
  in japan there are very few places in the u s where you can try real kobe and one of them is wolfgang puck 's restaurant cut in los angeles  i went there
  and i ordered the eight ounce rib eye for one hundred and sixty dollars and it arrived  and it was tiny  and i was outraged it
 was like one hundred and sixty dollars for this and then i took a bite  and i wished that it was tinier 
 because kobe beef is so rich it 's like foie gras it 's not even like steak i almost couldn 't finish it i was really happy
  the photographer who took the pictures for this
 project for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them so that 's why you 're going to see this recurring character
  which i guess  you know  communicates to you that i did not think that one was really worth the price 
 white truffles one of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world to try this i went to a mario batali restaurant in
  manhattan del posto  the waiter you know  came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said you know 
 would signore like the truffles and the charm of white truffles is in their aroma it 's not in their taste really it 's not in their texture it 's in the smell these white pearlescent flakes 
  hit the noodles this haunting wonderful nutty  mushroomy smell wafted up ten seconds passed and it was gone
  and then i was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta
 that you know their purpose had been served and so i 'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me  there were several several of these items were disappointments 
 the magazine wouldn 't pay for me to go there 
 they did give me a tour though  
  it has four balconies it was designed by the architect i m pei  
 it comes with its own rolls royce and driver it comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from when i took the tour it actually included some opus one i
 was glad to see 
 thirty thousand dollars for a night in a hotel 
 this is soap that 's made from silver
  which have antibacterial properties  
 i washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this
  and it  you know tickled a little bit and it smelled good  but i have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today but
 then again nobody has complimented me on the jeans i 'm wearing 
 these ones gq did spring for i own these but i will tell you not only did i not get a compliment from any of you i have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months
  months that i have owned and worn these  i don 't think that whether or not you 're getting a compliment should be the test of something 's value but i think in the case of a fashion item an article of clothing that 's a reasonable benchmark
  that said a lot of work goes into these they are made from handpicked organic zimbabwean cotton
 that has been shuttle loomed
  armando manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil from an olive that grows on a single slope in tuscany  and he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from
 oxygen and light he uses tiny bottles  the glass is tinted he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas  
 and he actually once
  he releases a batch of it he regularly conducts
 molecular analyses and posts the results online so you can go online and look at your batch number and see how the phenolics are developing and  you know  gauge its freshness i did a blind taste 
  test of this with twenty people and five other olive oils  it tasted fine it tasted interesting it was very green it was very peppery but
 blind taste test it came in last the olive oil that came in first was actually a
 bottle of whole foods three hundred and sixty five olive oil
 which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months 
 a recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from japan you 'll start to notice  i don 't play golf so i couldn 't actually road test
  these but i did interview a guy who owns them  even the people who market these clubs i mean they 'll say these have four axis shafts
 which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther but they 'll say look you know you 're not getting fifty seven thousand dollars worth of performance from these clubs you 're paying for the bling 
 that they 're encrusted with gold and platinum the guy who i interviewed who owns them did say that he 's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them
 you know this one  this is a coffee made from a very unusual process  
 the luwak is an asian palm civet it 's a cat that lives in trees  and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee 
  plantations and apparently it 's a very picky eater and it  you know  hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries  
  tract leeches into the beans and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats ' leavings then go through the forest
 collecting the  you know  results and processing it into coffee although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form
  japan is doing crazy things with toilets 
 there is now a toilet that has an mp3 player in it there
 's one with a fragrance dispenser  
 there 's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl
 and transmits the results via email to your doctor it 's almost like a home
  medical center and that is the direction that japanese toilet technology is heading in 
 this one does not have those bells and whistles but for pure functionality it 's pretty much the best the neorest six hundred 
 and to try this i couldn 't get a loaner  but
 i did go into the manhattan showroom of the manufacturer toto  and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use which i used it 's fully automated you walk towards
  it and the seat lifts the seat is preheated  there 's a water jet that cleans you  there 's an air jet that dries you you get up it flushes by itself the lid closes 
 not only is it a technological leap forward but i really do believe it 's a bit of a cultural leap forward i mean a no hands no toilet paper toilet  and i want to get one
  this was another one i could not get a loaner of 
 tom cruise supposedly owns this bed  there 's a little plaque on the end that you know each buyer gets their name engraved on it 
 to try this one the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the manhattan showroom lights glaring in off the street and we had to hire a security guard
  and all these things but anyway  we had a great night 's sleep and
 you spend a third of your life in bed  i don 't think it 's that bad of a deal this was a fun one
  this is the fastest street legal car in the world and the most expensive production car 
 i got to drive this with a chaperone from the company a professional race car driver  and we drove around the canyons outside of los angeles and down on the pacific
  coast highway and you know when we pulled up to a stoplight
 the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods  
 and it was really amazing it was such a smooth ride most of the cars that i drive if i get up to eighty they start to rattle  i switched lanes on the highway and the driver  this chaperone said you know you were just going one hundred and ten miles an hour 
 and i had no idea that i was one of those obnoxious people you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic because it was just
 that smooth and if i was a billionaire i would get one 
 this is a completely gratuitous video i 'm just going to show of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology  this is tom cruise arriving at the
  was one object that i could not get my hands on and that was the one thousand nine hundred and forty seven cheval blanc the ' forty seven cheval blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the  20th century  
 and cheval blanc is kind of an unusual wine for bordeaux in having a
 significant percentage of
 the cabernet franc grape and
  a legendary vintage especially in the right bank of bordeaux and just together that vintage and that chateau
 took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it this this cultish following but it 's sixty years old  there 's not much of it left 
 what there is of it left you don 't know if it 's real it 's considered to be the most faked wine in the world not that many people are looking to pop open their one remaining bottle for
 a journalist
  'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these 
 i 'd put out feelers to retailers to auctioneers and it was coming up empty and then i got an email from a guy named bipin desai  bipin
 desai is a
 u c riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings and he said 
 i 've got a tasting coming up where we 're going to serve the ' forty seven cheval blanc and it was going to be a double vertical it was going to be
 thirty vintages of cheval blanc and thirty vintages of yquem and it was
 an invitation you do not refuse  i went it was
 three days four meals and at lunch on saturday we opened the ' forty seven and
 you know it had this fragrant softness and it smelled a little bit of
  had this kind of unctuous  porty richness which is characteristic of that wine that it sort of resembles port
 in a lot of ways  there were people at my table who thought it was  you know fantastic there were some people who were
 a little less impressed  and
 i wasn 't that impressed  and i don 't
 call my palate a philistine palate so so it doesn 't necessarily mean something that i wasn 't impressed  but
 i was not the only
  one there who had that reaction  and it wasn 't just to that wine any one of the wines served at this tasting if i 'd been served it at a dinner party it would have been you know 
 the wine experience of my lifetime and incredibly memorable but drinking sixty great wines over three days they all just blurred together and it became almost a
 a grueling experience 
  just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year
 from some researchers at stanford and caltech  and
 they gave subjects the same wine labeled with different price tags 
 a lot of people you know  said that they liked the more expensive wine more it was the same wine but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive 
 but what was unexpected was that
 these researchers did mri brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine and not only did they say
 they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag
