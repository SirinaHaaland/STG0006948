  before march two thousand and eleven  i was a photographic retoucher based in new york city  
 we 're pale gray creatures we hide in dark windowless rooms and generally
  we make skinny models skinnier perfect skin more perfect and the impossible possible  
 and we get criticized in the press all the time  but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography 
 on march eleven  two thousand and eleven  i watched from home as the rest of the world did as the tragic events unfolded in japan
 soon after an organization i volunteer with all hands volunteers were on the ground  within days  working as part of the response efforts 
 i along with hundreds of other volunteers knew we couldn 't just sit at home so
 i decided to join them for three weeks  on may the 13th i made my way to the town of funato it 's a small fishing town in
  about fifty thousand people one of the first that was hit by the wave  
 the waters here have been recorded at reaching over twenty four meters in height  
 and traveled over two miles inland as you can imagine the town had been devastated  
 we pulled debris from canals and ditches we cleaned schools we
  and gutted homes ready for renovation and rehabilitation we cleared tons and tons
 of stinking rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant  we got dirty  and we loved it 
 for weeks  all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things they 'd been finding photos
 and photo albums and cameras and sd cards and everyone was doing the same they were collecting them up  and handing them in to various places around the different
  towns for safekeeping  now it wasn 't until this point that
 i realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt 
 as they had run from the wave and for their lives absolutely everything they had everything had to be left behind 
 at the end of my first week there i found myself helping out in an evacuation center in the town i was helping clean
  the onsen  the communal communal onsen the huge giant bathtubs 
 this happened to also be a place in the town where the evacuation center was collecting the photos this is where people were handing them in 
 and i was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start hand cleaning them 
 now it was emotional and it was inspiring
  and i 've always heard about thinking outside the box but it wasn 't until i had actually gotten outside of my box
 that something happened 
 as i looked through the photos there were some were over a hundred years old some still in the envelope from the processing lab  
 i couldn 't help but think as a retoucher that i could fix that tear and mend that scratch and
 i knew hundreds of people who could do the same
  so that evening i just reached out on facebook and asked a few of them and
 by morning the the response had been so overwhelming and so positive i knew we had to give it a go so
 we started retouching photos 
 this was the very first  
 not terribly damaged  but where the water had caused that discoloration on the girl 's face had to be repaired with such
  accuracy and delicacy 
 otherwise that little girl isn 't going to look like that little girl anymore and surely that 's as tragic as having the photo damaged 
 over time more photos came in thankfully  
 and
 more retouchers were needed and so i reached out again on facebook and linkedin  and within five days  eighty people wanted to help from twelve
  different countries within two weeks i had one hundred and fifty people wanting to join in 
 within japan by july we 'd branched out to the neighboring town of rikuzentakata  further north to a town called yamada 
 once a week we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up where people were reclaiming their photos 
 the older ladies sometimes hadn 't seen a scanner before
  but within ten minutes of them finding their lost photo they could give it to us have it scanned  uploaded to a cloud server it would be downloaded
 by a gaijin  a stranger  somewhere on the other side of the globe and it 'd start being fixed  
 the time it took however to get it back is a completely different story and it depended obviously on the damage involved it could take an hour it could take weeks it could take
  months  
 the kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand drawn or pieced together picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn 't damaged 
 it was very time consuming 
 now all these photos had been damaged by water  submerged in salt water  covered in
  sometimes even in oil all of which over time is going to continue to damage them so hand cleaning them was a huge part of the project we couldn 't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned 
 dry and reclaimed now
 we were lucky with our hand cleaning we had an amazing local woman who who guided us it 's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos 
  as my team leader wynne once said it 's like doing a tattoo on someone you don 't get a chance to mess
  it up  
 the lady who brought us these photos was lucky as far as the photos go 
 she had started hand cleaning them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage she also had duplicates  
 areas like her husband and her face which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix we could just put them together in one good photo  and remake the whole photo
  when she collected the photos from us she shared a bit of her story with us her photos were found by her husband 's colleagues at a local fire department in the debris
 a long way from where the home had once stood  and they 'd recognized him  
 the day of the tsunami he 'd actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed  he had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded 
 her two little boys
  not so little anymore but her two boys
 were both at school separate schools one of them got caught up in the water it took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived  
 the day i gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son 's 14th birthday 
 for her despite all of this
  those photos were the perfect gift back to him  something he could look at again something he remembered from before that
 that wasn 't still scarred from that day in march when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed 
 after six months in japan one thousand one hundred volunteers had passed through all hands hundreds of whom had helped us 
  majority of which did actually find their home again importantly  
 over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get ninety families hundreds of photographs back fully restored and retouched
  during this time we hadn 't really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials  most of which was printer inks  
 we take photos constantly a photo is a reminder of someone or something a place a relationship a loved one 
 they 're our memory keepers and our histories  the last thing we would grab and the first thing you 'd go back to look for 
 that 's all this project was about about restoring those little bits of
  humanity  giving someone that connection back  when a photo like this
 can be returned to someone like this it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it 
 the project 's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers  for some of them it 's given them a
 connection to
 something bigger giving something back using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin 
 i would like to conclude by reading an email i got from one of them cindy  the day i finally got back from japan after six months
