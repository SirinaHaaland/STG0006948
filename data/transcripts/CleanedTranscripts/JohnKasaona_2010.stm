  god gave the white man a watch and gave the black man time 
 i think how is it possible for a man with so much time to tell his story in eighteen minutes
 be quite a challenge for me 
 most african stories these days  they talk about famine hiv and aids poverty
 or war but my story that i would like to share with you today is the one about success 
 it is about a country in the southwest of africa
 called namibia namibia
 has got two point one million people  but it is only twice the size of california  i come from a region
 in the remote northwest part of the country it 's called kunene region 
 and in the center of kunene region is the village of sesfontein this is where i was born this is where i 'm coming from
  most people that are following the story of angelina jolie
 and brad pitt
 will know where namibia is 
 they love namibia for its beautiful dunes 
 that are even taller than the empire state building  
 wind
 and time have twisted our landscape
 into very
  and these shapes are speckled with wildlife that has become so adapted to this harsh and strange land 
 i 'm a himba you might wonder why are you wearing these western clothes i 'm
 a himba and namibian a himba is one of the twenty nine ethnic groups in namibia  we live a very
 traditional lifestyle
  i grew up herding looking after our livestock goats sheep and cattle  
 and one day my father actually took me into the bush he said john  i want you to become
 a good herder  boy  if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah
 eating our goat
  and he will let go of the goat and run off 
 but then he said boy  if you run into a lion
  don 't move  don 't move  stand your
  imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after in this way
 in this way i actually started to learn about nature  in addition to being an ordinary namibian and
 in addition to being a himba i 'm also a trained conservationist 
 and it is very important
 if you are in the field to know what to confront
  the whites could farm  graze and hunt as they wished  but we black we were not regarded as responsible to to use wildlife  whenever we tried to hunt  
 we were called poachers  and as a result we were fined and
  and soviet interests
 fought for control over my country  
 and you know during war time  there are militaries  armies that are moving around  and the army hunted for valuable rhino horns
 and tusks  they could sell these things for anything between
  every himba had a rifle because it was wartime  the british  303 rifle was just all over the whole country  
 then in the same time around one thousand nine hundred and eighty we had a very big drought  it killed almost everything that was left 
 our livestock was was
  i remember a night when a hungry leopard
 went into the house of one of our
 neighbors and took a sleeping child out of the bed it 's a very sad story
 but even today that memory is still in people 's minds they can pinpoint the exact location where
  almost lost everything and my father said 
 why don 't you just go to school and they sent me off to school just to get busy somewhere there 
 and the year i went to school my father actually got a job with a non governmental organization called irdnc integrated rural development and nature conservation  
 they actually spend a lot of time
 a year in the communities they were trusted by the local communities
 like our leader joshua kangombe  joshua kangombe saw what was happening wildlife disappearing  poaching
 was skyrocketing  and the situation seemed very hopeless  death and despair surrounded joshua
 and and our entire communities  
  proposed to joshua what if we pay people that you trust
 to look after wildlife  do you have anybody in your communities  or people that know the bush very well
 and that know wildlife very well
 my father has been a poacher for quite a long time  instead of shooting poachers dead
 like they were doing elsewhere in africa irdnc has helped helped men reclaim their abilities
 to manage their peoples and their rights to own and
  people started feeling ownership over wildlife wildlife numbers started coming back and that 's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in namibia 
 with independence the whole approach of community getting involved was embraced by our new government 
 three things that actually help to build on this foundation the very first one is honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas  
 here is our tradition
 at every himba village  there is a sacred fire  
 and at this sacred fire  the spirit of our ancestors speak through the headman
 and advise us where to get water where to get grazings  and where to go and hunt  
 and i think this is the best way of regulating ourselves
 on the environment
  and here are the new ideas  
 transporting rhinos using helicopters i think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can 't see isn 't it 
 and these things we were taught by outsiders  we learned these things
 from outsiders we needed new boundaries to describe our
  we needed to learn more things like gps just to see whether
 can gps really reflect the true reflection of the land or is this just a thing made somewhere
 in the west  and we we then wanted to see whether we can match our ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world 
 and through this we actually started realizing our dreams  and we maintained honoring our
  traditions but we were still open to new ideas  
 the second element is that we wanted to have a life a better life where we can benefit through many things most poachers 
 like my father 
 were people from our own community they were not people from outside these were our own people 
 and sometimes once they were caught  they were treated with respect 
  back into the communities
 and they were made part of the bigger dreams  the best one like my father i 'm not campaigning for my father 
 laughter they were put in charge to stop others from from poaching  
 and
 when this thing started going on we started becoming one community renewing our connection to nature  and that was a very
  in namibia  
 the last element that actually helped develop these things was the partnerships
  our government has given legal status over our traditional lands  
 the other partners that we have got is business communities  
 business communities helped bring namibia onto the world map
 and they have also helped make
  wildlife a very
 valuable land use like any other land uses such as agriculture  
 and most of my conservation colleagues today that you find in namibia have been trained through the initiative through the involvement of world wildlife fund
 in the most  up to date conservation practices they have also given funding for two decades to this whole program
 and so far with the support of world wildlife fund we 've been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today  
 namibia  or sesfontein
 was no more an isolated village somewhere hidden away in namibia  with these assets we are now part of the global village  
 thirty years have passed since
  father 's first job as a community game guard it 's very unfortunate that he passed away
 and he cannot see the success as i and my children see it today  when i finished school in 
  were only twenty lions in the entire northwest in our area  but today  there are more than one hundred and thirty lions
 so please if you go to namibia make sure that you stay in the tents  don 't walk out at night 
 the black rhino
 they were almost extinct in
  they are now in big numbers but they are now far away from our village  because the natural plain has multiplied 
 like zebras  springboks and everything they stay very much far away
  this other thing has multiplied from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals
 what started as very small community rangers getting community involved 
 has now grown into something that we call conservancies conservancies
 are legally
 instituted institutions by the government  and these are run by the communities themselves for their benefit today we have got
 sixty conservancies
 that manage and protect over thirteen million hectares of land in namibia  
 we have already reshaped conservation in the
  conservancy generated five point seven million dollars this is our new
 economy an economy based on the respect of our natural resources  and we are able to use this money for many things very importantly we put it in education  
 secondly  we put it for infrastructure  food very important
  you know that africa is being affected by these viruses  
 and this is the good news from africa that we have to shout from the rooftops 
 and now what
  to help me and our partners
 take some of what we have learned in namibia
 to other places
 with similar problems places like
 mongolia 
 or even in your own backyards  the northern great plains where buffalo and other animals have suffered
 and many communities are in decline  i like that one 
 namibia serving as a model to africa 
 and africa serving as a model to the united states 
 we were successful in namibia
  because
 we dreamed of a future that was much more than just a healthy wildlife  we knew
 conservation would fail
 if 
 to improve the lives of the local communities 
 so 
 come and talk to me about namibia
  and better yet  come to namibia and see for yourself how we have done it and please  do visit our website
 to learn more and see how you can help cbnrm
 in africa and across the world  thank you very much
