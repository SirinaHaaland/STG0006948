  small farm in missouri  
 we lived on less than a dollar a day for about fifteen years  i got a scholarship went to university  studied international agriculture studied
  and decided i was going to give back i was going to work with small farmers  i was going to help alleviate poverty i was going to work on international development  
 and then i took a turn
 and ended up
 here  
 now if you get a ph d and you decide not to teach you don 't always end up in a place like this it 's a choice 
 you might end up driving a taxicab  you could be in new york  
 what i found was i started working with
  refugees and famine victims small farmers all or nearly all
 who had been dispossessed and displaced  now what i 'd been trained to do
 was methodological research on such people so i did it i found out how many women had been raped en route to these
  i found out how many people had been put in jail 
 how many family members had been killed 
 i assessed how long they were going to stay and how much it would take to feed them and i got really good at predicting how many body bags you would need
 for the people who were going to die in these camps  
 now this is god 's work  but it 's not my work it 's not the work i set out to do  
 so
 i was at a grateful dead benefit concert on the rainforests
 i met a guy the guy on the left  his name was ben  he said what can i do to save the rainforests i said well ben what do you do 
 i make ice cream so i said well you 've got to make
 a rainforest ice cream  and you 've got to use nuts from the rainforests to show that forests are worth more as forests than they are as pasture
  he said okay 
 within a year rainforest crunch was on the shelves 
 it was a great success  we did our first million dollars worth of trade by buying on thirty days and selling on twenty one 
 that gets your adrenaline going 
 then we had a four and a half million dollar line of credit because we were
  at that point 
 we had fifteen to twenty maybe twenty two percent of the global brazil nut market  
 we paid two to three times more than anybody else 
 everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of brazil nuts because we would buy it otherwise 
 a great success 
 fifty companies signed up two hundred products came out generated one hundred million in sales 
  why did it fail because the people who were gathering brazil nuts weren 't the same people who were cutting the forests and the people who made money from brazil nuts
 were not the people who made money from cutting the forests 
 we were attacking the wrong driver  we needed to be working on beef  we needed to be working on lumber  we needed to be working on soy
 things that we were not focused
  so let 's go back to sudan  
 i often talk to refugees why was it that the west didn 't realize that famines are caused by policies and politics not by weather 
 and this farmer said to me one day something that was very profound he said you can 't wake a person who 's pretending to sleep 
 laughter okay  fast forward  we live
 on a planet  there 's just one of them
 we 've got to wake up to the fact that we don 't have any more
 and that this is a finite planet  
 we know the limits of the resources we have 
 we may be able to use them differently we may have some innovative new ideas  but in general this is what we 've got  there 's no more of it  
 there 's a basic equation that we can 't get away from population times consumption has got to have some
  kind of relationship to the planet  and right now it 's a simple not equal 
 our work shows that we 're living at about one point three planets  since one thousand nine hundred and ninety we crossed
 the line of being in a sustainable relationship to the planet now we 're at one point three if we were farmers we 'd be eating our seed 
 for bankers we 'd be living off the principal not the interest
  this is where we stand today a
 lot of people like to point
 to some place else as the cause of the problem  it 's always population growth population growth 's important  
 but it 's also about how much each person consumes  
 so when the average american
 consumes
  times as much as the average african  we 've got to think that consumption is an issue  it 's not just about population 
 and it 's not just about them it 's about us  
 but it 's not just about people  it 's about lifestyles  
 there 's very good evidence again  we don 't necessarily have a  peer reviewed methodology that 's that 's bulletproof yet but there 's very good evidence
 that the average cat in europe
 has
  a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime than the average african 
 you think that 's not an issue going forward  
 you think that 's not a question as to how we should be using the earth 's resources let 's go back and visit our equation 
 in two thousand we had six billion people on the planet they were consuming what they were consuming let 's say one unit of consumption each we have six billion units of consumption
  by two thousand and fifty we
 're going to have nine billion people all the scientists agree they 're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do scientists again agree because
 income is going to grow in developing countries five times what it is today on global average about [ two point nine ] so we 're going to have eighteen billion units
  who have you heard talking lately that 's said we have to triple production of goods and services  
 but that 's what the math says we 're not going to be able to do that 
 we can get productivity up  we can get efficiency up  but we 've also got to get consumption down  
 we need to use less
 to make more and then we need to use less
  and then we need to consume less all of those things are part of that equation  
 but it basically raises a fundamental question should consumers have a choice about sustainability 
 about sustainable products  should you be able to buy a product that 's sustainable sitting next to one that isn 't 
 or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable 
 if they should all be sustainable on a finite
  how do you make that happen the average consumer takes one point eight seconds in the u s okay so let 's be generous let 's say it 's three point five seconds in europe 
 how do you evaluate all the scientific data around
 a product the data that 's changing on a weekly if not a daily basis how do you get informed 
 you don 't 
 here 's a little question from a greenhouse gas perspective is lamb
  produced in the   u k better than lamb produced in new zealand frozen and shipped to the  u k 
 is a bad feeder lot operation for beef
 better or worse than a bad grazing operation for beef do organic potatoes
 actually have fewer toxic chemicals used to produce them than conventional potatoes in every single case
  the answer is it depends it depends on who produced it and how 
 in every single instance and there are many others how is a consumer going to walk through this minefield  
 they 're not they may have a lot of opinions about it  but they 're not going to be terribly informed sustainability has got to be a
  it 's got to be something we all care about
  and we need collusion 
 we need groups to work together that never have we need cargill to work with bunge  we need coke to work with pepsi  
 we need oxford to work with cambridge  we need greenpeace to work with wwf everybody 's got to work together china and the u s 
 we need to begin to manage this planet as if our life depended on it because it does
 it fundamentally does  
 but we can 't do everything  even if we get everybody working on it we 've got to be strategic  
 we need to focus on the where  the what and the who 
 so the where 
 we 've identified thirty five places globally that we need to work these are the places that are the richest in biodiversity and the most important from an ecosystem function point of view 
 we have to work in these places we have
  to save these places if we want a chance in hell of preserving biodiversity as we know it 
 we looked at the threats to these places these are the fifteen commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places
 because of deforestation soil loss water use 
  so we 've got thirty five places we 've got fifteen priority commodities who do we work with to change the way those commodities are produced 
 are we going to work with six point nine billion consumers 
 let 's see that 's about seven thousand languages three hundred and fifty major languages a
 lot of work there i don 't see anybody actually being able to do that very effectively
 are we going to work with one point five billion producers 
 again a daunting task  there must be a better way  
 three hundred to five hundred companies
 control seventy percent or more
 of the trade of each of the fifteen commodities that we 've identified as the most
  if we work with those if we change those companies and the way they do business then the rest will happen automatically  
 so we went through our fifteen commodities  this is nine of them we lined them up side by side and we put the names of the companies that work
 on each of those and if you go through the first twenty five or thirty names of each of the of the commodities
  what you begin to see is gosh  there 's cargill here  there 's cargill there  there 's cargill everywhere in fact these names start coming up over and over again  
 so we did the analysis again a slightly different way 
 we said  if we take the top hundred companies what percentage
 of all fifteen
 commodities do they touch buy or sell 
  and what we found is it 's twenty five percent so one hundred companies
 control twenty five percent of the trade of all fifteen of the most significant commodities on the planet
  we can get our arms around a hundred companies a hundred companies we can work with  
 why is twenty five percent important  because if these companies demand sustainable products they 'll pull forty to fifty percent of production
  companies can
 push producers faster than consumers can by companies asking for this we can leverage production so much faster
 than by waiting for consumers to do it after forty years the global organic movement has achieved zero point seven of one percent of global food  
 we can 't wait that long we don 't have that kind of time we need
  change that 's going to accelerate  
 even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there  we need to begin to work with
 industries  so we 've started roundtables where we bring together the entire value chain from producers all the way to the retailers and brands  we bring in civil
  we bring in ngos we bring in researchers and scientists to have an informed discussion sometimes a battle royale to figure out what are the key impacts of these products  
 what is a global benchmark what 's an acceptable impact and design standards around that 
 it 's not all fun and games in salmon aquaculture  
  we kicked off a roundtable almost six years ago  eight entities came to the table  
 we eventually got i think sixty percent of global production at the table and twenty five percent of demand at the table 
 three of the original eight entities were suing each other and yet next week we launch globally verified vetted
 and certified standards for salmon
  so what brings the different entities to the table  
 it 's risk and demand 
 for the big companies it 's reputational risk but more importantly  they don 't care what the price of commodities is if they don 't have commodities they don 't have a business  
 they care about availability so the
  big risk for them is not having product at all 
 for the producers  
 if a buyer wants to buy something produced a certain way that 's what brings them to the table  so it 's the demand that brings them to the table  
 the good news is we identified a hundred companies two years ago 
 in the last eighteen months we 've signed agreements with forty of those hundred companies to begin to work with them on their supply chain 
 and in the next eighteen
 we will have signed up to work with another forty and we think we 'll get those signed as well  now what we 're doing is bringing the ceos of these eighty companies together
 to help twist the arms of the final twenty to bring them to the table  because they don 't like ngos they 've never worked with ngos they 're concerned about this they 're concerned about that
  but we all need to be in this together so we 're pulling out all the stops we 're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table 
 one company we 're working with that 's begun in baby steps perhaps but has begun this journey on sustainability is cargill 
 they 've funded research that shows
 that we can double global palm oil production without cutting a single tree in the next twenty years  and do it all in borneo alone by planting on land that 's already degraded 
 the study shows that the highest net present
  value for
 palm oil is on land that 's been degraded  
 they 're also undertaking a study to look at all of their supplies of palm oil to see if they could be certified and what they would need to change in order to become third party certified under a credible
 certification program  
 why is cargill important because cargill has twenty to twenty five percent of global palm oil
 if cargill makes a decision the entire palm oil industry moves or at least forty or fifty percent of it that 's not insignificant more importantly 
 cargill and one other company ship fifty percent of the palm oil that goes to china
  we don 't have to change the way a single chinese company works if we get cargill to only send sustainable palm oil to china
  it 's a pre competitive issue all the palm oil going there is good buy it 
 mars is also on a similar journey  
 now most people understand that mars is a chocolate company 
 but mars has made sustainability pledges to buy only certified product for all of its seafood it turns out mars buys more seafood than walmart because of pet food
  but they 're doing some really interesting things around chocolate 
 and it all comes from the fact that mars wants to be in business in the future and what they see is that they need to improve chocolate production 
 on any given plantation 
 twenty percent of the trees produce eighty percent of the crop so mars is looking at the genome they 're sequencing the genome of the cocoa plant 
 they 're doing it with ibm and the
  and they 're putting it in the public domain because they want everybody to have access to this data because they want everybody to help them make cocoa more productive and more sustainable 
 what they 've realized is that if they can
 identify the traits on productivity and drought tolerance they can produce three hundred and twenty percent as much cocoa
 on forty percent of the land the rest of the land can be used for something else
  it 's more with less and less again 
 that 's what the future has got to be and putting it in the public domain is smart  they don 't want to be an i p company 
 they want to be a chocolate company  but they want to be a chocolate company forever  
 now  the price of food many people complain about 
 but in fact the price of food is going down and that 's odd because in fact 
 consumers are not paying for the true cost of food  if you take a look just at water what we see is that
 with four very common products you look at how much a farmer produced to make those products  and then you look at how much water input was put into them  
 and then you look at what the farmer was paid  if you divide the amount
 of water into what the farmer was paid the farmer didn 't receive enough money to pay a decent price for water in any of
  an externality by definition this is the subsidy from nature 
 coca cola they 've worked a lot on water but right now  they 're entering into 17 year contracts with growers in turkey
 to sell juice into europe  and they 're doing that because they want to have a product that 's closer to the european market  
 but they 're not just buying the juice  they 're also buying the carbon in the trees to offset the shipment costs associated with carbon to get the product into europe
  there 's carbon that 's being bought with sugar with coffee with beef this is called bundling  it 's bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity  
 we need to take what we 've learned in private voluntary standards
 of what the best producers in the world are doing and use that to inform government regulation
  so we can shift the entire performance curve  we can 't just focus on identifying the best we 've got to move the rest 
 the issue isn 't what to think  
 it 's how to think these companies have begun to think differently  they 're on a journey  there 's no turning back we 're all on that same journey with them 
 we have
 to really begin to change the way we think
 about everything  whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine thank you
