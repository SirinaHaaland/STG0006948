  my name 's seth priebatsch i 'm the chief ninja of scvngr i 'm a proud princeton dropout also proud to have relocated here to boston where i actually grew up
 yeah boston  easy wins i should just name the counties that we 've
  i 'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world 
 this is sort of a new concept and it 's really important because while the last decade was the decade of social the decade where the framework in which we connect with other people was built  this next 
  decade will be the decade where the game framework is built where the motivations we use to actually influence behavior and the framework in which that is constructed 
  i say i want to build a game layer on top of the world but that 's not quite true because
 it 's already under construction it 's already happening
 and it looks like this right now  it looks like the web did back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven right it 's not very good  it 's cluttered  it 's filled with lots of different things that in short aren 't that fun  
 there are credit card schemes and airline mile programs coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes that actually do use game dynamics and are building the game layer
 they just suck
 so that 's unfortunate  but luckily
 as my favorite action hero bob the builder says 
 we can do better we can build this better and the tools the resources that we use to build a game layer are game dynamics themselves  and so the crux of this presentation is going to go 
  through four really important game dynamics really interesting things that if you use consciously you can
  use to influence behavior  both for good for bad for in between hopefully for good  but this is the the important stage in which that framework will get built and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now
 before we jump into that there 's a question of why is this important i 'm making this claim that there 's a game layer on top of the world  and it 's very important
  that we build it properly  
 the reason it 's so important is that in the last decade what we 've seen has been building the social layer has been this framework for connections  and construction on that layer is over
 it 's finished  there 's still a lot to explore still a lot of people trying to figure out social and how we leverage this and how we use this but the framework itself is done  
 and it 's called facebook
  and that 's
  a lot of people are very happy with facebook i like it quite a lot 
 they 've created this thing called the open graph and they own all of our connections they own half a billion people so when you want to build on the social layer the framework has been decided it is 
  the open graph api  and if you 're happy with that fantastic if you 're not too bad  there 's nothing you can do 
  and that 's a real thing i mean we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable and makes it productive down the road
  so the social layer is all about these connections  the game layer is all about influence it 's not about adding a social fabric to the web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere 
  you go it 's actually about using dynamics using forces to influence the behavior of where you are what you do there how you do it that 's really really powerful and it 's going to be more important than the social layer and affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly
 so it 's incredibly critical that at this moment while it 's just getting constructed  while the frameworks like facebook or open graph are being created for the game layer equivalent that we think about it 
  very consciously  and that we do it in a way that is open available and can be leveraged for good  so that 's what i want to talk about for game dynamics because construction has just begun and the more consciously we can think about this the better we 'll be able to use it for anything we want 
 like i said the way you go through and build on the game layer is not with
 glass and steel and cement and the resources we use are not this two dimensional swath of land that we have the resources are mindshare  and the tools the raw materials are these game dynamics with that
 a couple game dynamics to talk about back at scvngr we like to joke that with seven game dynamics you can get anyone to do anything
 today i 'm going to show you four because i hope to have a
  advantage at the end of this still 
 laughter so the first one it 's a very simple game dynamic it 's called the appointment dynamic it 's a dynamic in which to succeed players have to do something at a predefined time generally at a predefined place
 and these dynamics are a little scary sometimes because you think other people can be using forces that will manipulate how i interact what i do where i do it when i do it
  of free will that occurs in games can be frightening  so with each dynamic i 'm going to give three examples 
 one that shows how it 's already being used in the real world so you can rationalize it a bit one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game i think everything is a game but this is more
 what you 'd think of as a game played on a board or on a computer screen and one of how it can be used for good  so you can see that
  these forces can be very powerful  so the first one the most famous appointment dynamic in the world is something called happy hour
 so i had just recently dropped out of princeton and actually ended up
 for the first time in a bar and i saw these happy hour things all over the place  and this is simply an appointment dynamic  come here at a certain time get your drinks half off to win all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time
  this game dynamic is so powerful it doesn 't just influence our behavior it 's influenced our entire culture
  a really scary thought that one game dynamic can change things so powerfully  
 it also exists in more conventional game forms i 'm sure you 've all heard of farmville by now if you haven 't i recommend playing it you won 't do anything else for the rest of your day
  farmville has more active users than twitter  it 's incredibly powerful and it has this dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your fake
  or they wilt  
 and this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats when they say your crops wilt after eight hours or after six hours or after twenty four hours  it changes the life cycle 
 of some seventy million people during the day  they will return like clockwork at different times so if they wanted the world to end if they wanted productivity to stop  they could make it a 30 minute cycle and no one could do anything else right 
  that 's a little scary
 but this could also be used for good  this local company called vitality has created a product to help people take their medicine on time 
 that 's an appointment  it 's something that people don 't do very well they have these glowcaps which flash and email you and do cool things to remind you to take your medicine
  this isn 't a game yet but really should be you should get points for doing it on time and lose points for not doing it on time  they should recognize they 've built an appointment dynamic  and leverage the games then you can really achieve good in some interesting
  ways we 're going to jump onto the next one influence and status this is one of the most most famous game dynamics used all over the place
 it 's used in your wallets right now  we all want that credit card on the far left because it 's black and you see someone at cvs or not cvs like christian dior i don
 't know i don 't have a black card i 've got a debit card
  whip it out and you see that black card and i want that because it means they 're cooler than i am and i need that 
 and this is used in games as well modern warfare one of the most successful selling games of all time  
 i 'm only a level four but i desperately want to be a level ten because they 've got that cool red badge  and that means that i am somehow better
 than everyone else and that 's very powerful to me status is really good motivator  it 's also used in more
  settings  and can be used more consciously there school and remember i made it through one year so i think i 'm qualified to talk on school
 is a game  it 's just not a terribly well designed game  there are levels there are c there are b there 's  a there are statuses i mean what is valedictorian but a status  if we called valedictorian a 
 white knight paladin level twenty 
 i think people would probably work a lot harder
 applause so school is a game and there has been lots of experimentation on how we do this properly  but let 's use it consciously why have games you can lose why go from an a to an f or a b to a c that 
  sucks  why not level up at princeton they 've actually experimented experimented with this with quizzes where you gain experience points and you level up from b to an
  and it 's very powerful it can be used in interesting ways
  the third one i 'll talk about is the progression dynamic where you have to make progress move through different steps in a very granular fashion  this is used all over the place
 including linkedin where
 i am an unwhole individual i am only eighty five percent complete on linkedin and that bothers me  and this is this is so deep seated in our psyche that when we 're presented with a progress bar and presented with easy granular steps to take to
  try and complete that progress bar  we will do it we will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen
  this is used in conventional games as well i mean this is a paladin level ten and that 's a paladin level twenty
 and if you were going to fight
 orcs on the fields of mordor against the ra 's al ghul you 'd probably want to be the the bigger one right i would
 and so people work very hard to
  of warcraft is one of the most successful games of all time
 the average player spends some six six and a half hours a day on it their most dedicated players it 's like a full time job  it 's insane and they have these systems where you can
 level up and that 's a very powerful thing progression is powerful
  it can also be used in very compelling ways for good one of the things we work
  how do you use games to drive traffic and business to local businesses to something that is very key to the economy  and here we have a game
 that people play they go places do challenges earn points and we 've introduced a progression dynamic into it where by going to the same place over and over doing challenges engaging with the business you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right and unlock rewards
  this is powerful enough that we can see it hooks people into these dynamics pulls them back to the same local businesses  creates loyalty creates engagement
 and is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses these progression dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world  
 the final one i want to talk about and it 's a great one to end on is this concept of communal discovery 
 a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something
 communal discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems
  is used in some famous consumer web stories
 like digg which i 'm sure you 've all heard of
  digg is a communal dynamic to try to find and source the best news the most interesting stories  and they made this into a game  initially they had a leader board where if you recommended the best stories you would get points
 and that that really motivated people to find the best stories  but it became so powerful there was actually a cabal a group of people the top seven
 on the leader board who would work together to make sure they maintained that position recommending people 's stories  the game became more powerful than the goal they ended up shutting down the leader board 
  because while it was effective it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories  and started having people work to maintain leadership so we have to use this one carefully
  form to try and find boardwalk  there they 're just looking for a sticker that says boardwalk but it can also be used to find real things 
 this is the darpa balloon challenge where they hid a couple balloons all across the united states and said use networks try and find these balloons fastest and the winner will get $ forty thousand 
 the winner was a group out of mit where they created sort of a pyramid scheme a network where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got $ two thousand and anyone else
 to push that recommendation up also got a cut and in twelve hours  they were able to find all these balloons all across the country
  really powerful dynamic  and so i 've got about twenty seconds left  so if i 'm going to leave you with anything 
 last decade was the decade of social this next decade is the decade of games we use game dynamics to build on it we build with mindshare we can influence behavior  it 's very powerful it 's very exciting let 's all build it together let 's do it well and have fun playing
