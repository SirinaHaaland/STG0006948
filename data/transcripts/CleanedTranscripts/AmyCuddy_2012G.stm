  i want to ask you to
  body and what you 're doing with your body so how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller maybe you 're hunching
  crossing your legs maybe wrapping your ankles sometimes we hold onto our arms like this
  sometimes we
 spread out i see you so i want you to pay attention to what you 're doing right
  we 're going to come back to that in a few minutes  and i 'm hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit it could significantly change the way your life unfolds
 so we 're really fascinated with body language  and we 're particularly interested in other people 's body language you know we
 're interested in like you know 
 laughter an awkward interaction or a smile or a contemptuous glance or maybe a very awkward
  wink  or maybe even something like a handshake narrator here
 they are arriving at number ten this lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the president of the united states here comes the prime minister
  weeks and weeks and weeks even the bbc and the new york times so obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior or body language but we call it nonverbals as social scientists
 it 's language so we think about communication when we think about communication we think about interactions  so what is your body language communicating to me what 's mine communicating to
  this is a valid way to look at this so social scientists have spent a lot of time
 looking at the effects of of our body language or other people 's body language on judgments and we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language  
 and those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote 
 who we ask out on a date for
  nalini ambady a researcher at tufts university shows that when people watch 
  soundless clips of real 
 interactions their judgments of the physician 's niceness
 predict whether or not that physician will be sued  so it doesn 't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent but do we like that person and how they interacted
  even more dramatic
  alex todorov at princeton has shown us that
 judgments of political candidates ' faces in just one second predict seventy percent of u s senate and gubernatorial race outcomes
  and even let 's go digital emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead you to claim more value from that negotiation if you use them poorly bad idea
  when we think of nonverbals we think of how we judge others how they judge us and what the outcomes are we tend to forget though the other audience that 's influenced by our nonverbals and that 's ourselves 
  we are also influenced by our nonverbals our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology  so
  power dynamics i became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance
  and what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance well this is what they are so in the animal kingdom  they are about expanding so you make yourself big you stretch out  you take up space you 're basically
  it 's about opening up  and
 this is true across the animal kingdom it 's not just limited to primates 
 and humans do the same thing 
 so they do this both when they when they have power sort of chronically  
 and also when they 're feeling powerful in the moment and this one is especially interesting because it really shows us
 how universal and old these expressions of power are this expression which is known as pride jessica tracy has studied she
  shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind
 do this when they win at a physical competition  so when they cross the finish line and they 've won it doesn 't matter if they 've never seen anyone do it they do this  
 so the arms up in the v the chin is slightly lifted 
 what do we do when we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite
  we close up we wrap ourselves up we make ourselves small we don 't want to bump into the person next to us so again both animals and humans do the same thing  
 and this is what happens when you put together high and low power  so what we tend to do
 when it comes to power is that we complement the other 's nonverbals so if someone is being really powerful with us we tend to make ourselves smaller  we don 't mirror them we do the opposite of them
  so
 i 'm watching this behavior in the classroom
 what do i notice i notice that
 mba students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals so you have people who are like caricatures of alphas really coming into the room they get right into the middle of the room
 before class even starts like they really want to occupy space  when they sit down they 're sort of spread out they raise their hands like this
  you have other people who are virtually collapsing
  when they come in as soon they come in you see it  you see it on their faces and their bodies  and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny and they go like this when they raise their hand 
 i notice a couple of things about this one you 're not going to be surprised it seems to be related to gender so
 women are much more likely to do this kind of
  than men women feel chronically less powerful than men so this is not surprising
  but the other thing i noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating and how well they were participating and this is really important in the mba classroom because participation counts for half the grade 
 so
 business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap you get these equally qualified women and men coming in
 and then you get these differences in grades and it
  to be partly attributable to participation 
 so i started to wonder  you know okay  
 so you have these people coming in like this and they 're participating is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more so
 my main collaborator dana carney who 's at berkeley  and i really wanted to know
  can you fake it till you make it  like can you do this just for a little while
 and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful  so we know that our nonverbals
 govern how other people think and feel about us there 's a lot of evidence but our question really was do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves  
 there 's some evidence that they do so for example
  we smile when we feel happy but also when we 're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this  
 it makes us feel happy  so it goes both ways  when it comes to power 
 it also goes both ways  so when you when you feel powerful you 're more likely to do this  but it 's also possible that
 when you when you pretend to be powerful you are more likely to actually feel powerful
  question really was  you know  so we know that our minds change our bodies but is it also true that that our bodies change our minds 
 and when i say minds in the case of the powerful what am i talking about so i 'm talking about thoughts
 and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings and in my case that 's
  i look at hormones  so what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like  so powerful people
 tend to be not surprisingly more assertive and more confident more optimistic  they actually feel they 're going to win even at games of chance
  they also tend to be able to think more abstractly so there are a lot of differences they take more risks there are a lot of
 differences between powerful and powerless people 
 physiologically there also are differences on two key hormones  testosterone which is the dominance hormone  
 and cortisol which is the stress hormone  
 so
 what we find is that
 alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol  and
 powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol
  so what does that mean when you think about power people tended to think only about testosterone because that was about dominance  
 but really power is also about how you react to stress so do you want the high power leader
 that 's dominant high on testosterone but really stress reactive probably not right you want the person who 's powerful and assertive and dominant  but not very stress reactive the person who 's laid back
  we know that
 in primate hierarchies if an alpha needs to take over
  if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly 
 within a few days that individual 's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly  so we have this evidence  both that the body can shape the mind at least at the facial level
  that role changes can shape the mind  so what happens okay you take a role change 
 what happens if you do that at a really minimal level like this tiny manipulation this tiny intervention for two minutes you say i want you to stand like this and it 's going to make you feel more powerful 
 so
 this is what we did  we decided to bring
  just going to show you five of the poses although they took on only two so here 's one a
 couple more  this one has been dubbed the wonder woman by the media  here are a couple more  
  so you can be standing or you can be sitting and here are the low power poses so you 're folding up you 're making yourself small  
 this one is very low power when you 're touching your neck you 're really protecting yourself  so
 this is what happens they come in they spit into a vial for two minutes we say you need to do this or this they don 't look at pictures of the poses we don 't want to prime them with a concept of power we want them to be feeling power so two minutes they do this  
 we then ask them
 how powerful do you feel on a series of items  and then we give them an opportunity to gamble 
 and then we take another saliva sample that 's it that 's the whole experiment  so this is what we find risk tolerance which is the gambling
 we find that when you are in the high power pose condition eighty six percent of you will gamble when you 're in the low power pose condition only sixty percent and that 's a whopping significant difference
 here 's what we find on testosterone from their baseline when they come in high power people experience about a 20 percent increase 
 and low power people experience about a 10 percent decrease  so again two minutes  and you get these changes 
 here 's what you get on cortisol high power people experience about a
  so two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive confident and comfortable or really 
 and feeling sort of shut down and we 've all had the feeling right  
 so it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves so it 's not just others but it 's also ourselves
 also our bodies change our minds  
 but the next question of course is can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways  this is in the lab it 's this little task it 's
 just a couple of minutes
  where can you actually apply this  which we cared about of course
  and so we think
 situations where are you being evaluated either by your friends for teenagers it 's at the lunchroom table for some people it 's speaking at a school board meeting it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or
 doing a job interview we decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through was the job interview  so
 we published these
  and the media are all over it and they say  okay so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview right you know 
 so we were of course horrified and said oh my god no that 's not what we meant at all for numerous reasons no don 't do that again this is not about you talking to other people it 's you talking to yourself what do you do before you go into a job interview you
  you 're sitting down you 're looking at your iphone or your android not trying to leave anyone out
 you 're looking at your notes you 're hunching up making yourself small when really what you should be doing maybe is this like in the bathroom right do that find two minutes  so that 's what we want to test okay so 
  we bring people into a lab and they do either high or low power poses again they go through a very stressful job interview
  it 's five minutes long they are being recorded they 're being judged also and the judges
 are trained to give no nonverbal feedback  so they look like this imagine this is the person interviewing you 
 so for five minutes  nothing  and this is worse than being heckled people hate this it 's what marianne lafrance calls standing in social quicksand 
  so this really spikes your cortisol  so this is the job interview we put them through because we really wanted to see what happened
 we then have these coders look at these tapes four of them they 're blind to the hypothesis  they 're blind to the conditions they have no idea who 's been posing in what pose  
 and they they end up
 looking at these sets of tapes and they say we want to hire these people all the high power posers we don 't want to hire these people 
  we also evaluate these people much more positively overall 
 but what 's driving it  it 's not about the content of the speech  it 's about the presence that they 're bringing to the speech because we rate them on all these variables related to competence 
 like  how well structured is the speech how good is it what are their qualifications no effect on those things this is what 's affected these kinds of things 
  residue over them  so this is what 's driving the effect or mediating mediating the effect  so
 when i tell people about this that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior and our behavior can change our outcomes they say to me
  it feels fake right so i said fake it till you make it  it 's not me  i don 't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud
  feel like an impostor  i don 't want to get there only to feel like i 'm not supposed to be here  and that really resonated with me because i want to tell you a little story about
 being an impostor and feeling like i 'm not supposed to be here when i was nineteen  i was in a really bad car accident i was thrown out of a car  
 rolled several times i was thrown from the car  and i woke up in a head injury rehab ward  and i had been
  withdrawn from college  and i learned that my iq had dropped by two standard deviations  which was
 very traumatic  i knew my iq because i had identified with being smart and i had been called gifted as a child 
 so i 'm taken out of college i keep trying to go back  they say you 're not going to finish college  just
  there are other things for you to do but that 's not going to work out for you 
 so i really struggled with this and i have to say  having your identity taken from you your core identity and for me it was being smart 
 having that taken from you there 's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that 
 so i felt entirely powerless i worked and worked and i got lucky and worked and got lucky and worked  eventually i graduated from college it
 took me four years longer than my peers  and i convinced someone my
  angel advisor susan fiske to take me on and so i ended up at princeton and i was like i am not supposed to be here  i am an impostor 
 and the night before my first year talk and the first year talk at princeton is a 20 minute talk to twenty people that 's it 
 i was so afraid of being found out the next day that i called her and said i 'm
  because i took a gamble on you and you 're staying you 're going to stay  and this is what you 're going to do 
 you are going to fake it  you 're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do you 're just going to do it and do it and do it  even if you 're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out of body experience until you have this moment where you say '
 oh my gosh i 'm doing it like i have become this i
  so that 's what i did five years in grad school a few years you know i 'm at northwestern i moved to harvard  
 i 'm at harvard i 'm not really thinking about it anymore  but for a long time i had been thinking not supposed to be here 
 so at the end of my first year at harvard
  a student who had not talked in class the entire semester who i had said look you 've gotta participate or else you 're going to fail came into my office i really didn 't know her at all
  she said i 'm not supposed to be here 
 and that was the moment for me because two things happened one was that i realized
  oh my gosh i don 't feel like that anymore
  i don 't feel that anymore but she does and i get that feeling and the second was she is supposed to be here like she can fake it she can become it
  supposed to be here  and tomorrow you 're going to fake it you 're going to make yourself powerful and you know and you 're going to go
 into the classroom  and you are going to give the best comment ever you know  and she gave the best comment ever and people turned around and were like oh my god i didn 't even notice her sitting there
  she comes back to me months later and i realized that she had not just faked it till she made it she had actually faked it till she became it so she had changed
  and so i i want to say to you don 't fake it till you make it  fake it till you become 
  it do it enough until you actually become it and internalize 
  last thing i 'm going to leave you with is this tiny tweaks
 can lead to big changes  
 so 
 this is two minutes  two minutes  two minutes two minutes  before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation 
 for two minutes  try doing this in the elevator in a bathroom stall at your desk behind closed doors that 's what you want to do  configure your brain to cope the best in that situation 
 get your testosterone up get your cortisol down don 't leave that situation feeling like
  didn 't show them who i am leave that situation feeling like i really feel like i got to say who i am and show who i am  so i want to ask you first  you know  
 both to try power posing  
 and also i want to ask you to share the science because this is simple  i don 't have ego involved in this give it away
  share it with people because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power give it to them because they can do it in private they need their bodies  privacy and two minutes  
 and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life thank you
