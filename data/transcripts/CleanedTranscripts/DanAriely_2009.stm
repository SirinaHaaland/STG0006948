  i want to talk to you today a little bit about predictable irrationality  and
 my interest in irrational behavior started many years ago in the hospital i
  i was burned
 very badly and if you spend a lot of time in hospital you 'll see a lot of
 types of irrationalities  and the one that
 particularly bothered me in the
 burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me 
 now you must have all taken a band aid off at some point and you must have wondered what 's the right approach do you rip it off quickly
 short duration but high intensity or do you take your
 band aid off slowly you take a long time but each second is not as painful
 which one of those is the right approach the nurses in my department
 thought that the right approach was the ripping one so they would grab hold and they would rip and they would grab hold and they would rip  and because i had seventy percent of my body burned it would take about an
  as you can imagine
  i hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity  
 and i would try to reason with them and say why don 't we try something else why don 't we take it a little longer maybe two hours instead of an hour and have less of this intensity 
 and the nurses told me two things  they told me that they had the right model of the patient that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain
 and they also told me that the word patient doesn 't mean to make
  suggestions or to interfere or 
 this is not just in hebrew by the way it 's in every language i 've had experience with so far and you know there
 's not much there wasn 't much i could do and they kept on doing what what they were doing and about three years later when i left the hospital
 i started studying at the university and one
 of the most interesting lessons i learned
  method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way  and you can try to examine this question maybe learn something about the world 
 so that 's what
 i did i was still interested in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients  so originally i didn 't have
 much money  so i went to a hardware store and i bought a carpenter 's vice  and i would bring people to the lab and i would
  put their finger in it and i would crunch it a little bit 
 and i would crunch it for long periods and short periods and pain that went up and pain that went down  and with breaks and without breaks all kinds of versions of pain 
 and when i finished hurting people a little bit i would ask them so how painful was this or how painful was this or if you had to choose between the last two
  i kept on doing this for a while 
 and then like all good academic projects i got more funding  i moved to sounds electrical shocks
 i even had a pain suit that i could get people to feel much more pain  
 but at the end of this process what i learned was that the nurses were wrong
  people with good intentions and plenty of experience and nevertheless they were getting things wrong
 predictably all the time  
 it turns out that because we don 't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity  i would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity
 was lower  it turns out it would have been better to start with my face which was much more painful  and move toward my legs  giving me a trend of improvement over
  time that would have been also less painful and
 it also turns out that it would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain all of these would have been great things to do  and my nurses had no idea  and from that point on i started thinking 
 are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision or is it a more general
  you one example of one of these irrationalities and
 i want to talk to you about cheating  and the reason i picked cheating is because it 's interesting but also it tells us something i think about
 the stock market situation we 're in 
 so  
 my interest in cheating started when enron came on the scene exploded all of a sudden 
 and i started thinking about what is happening here is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are
 capable of doing
  things or are we talking a more endemic situation that many people are actually capable of behaving this way  
 so like we usually do i decided to do a simple experiment and here 's how it went if you were in the experiment i would pass you a sheet of paper with twenty simple math problems that everybody could solve but i wouldn 't give you enough time  
 when the five minutes were over  i would say pass me the sheets of paper and i 'll pay you a dollar per question
  people did this i would pay people four dollars for their task on average people would solve four problems 
 other people i would tempt to cheat  
 i would pass their sheet of paper  when the five minutes were over i would say please shred the piece of paper  put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack and tell me how many questions you got correctly 
 people now solved seven questions on average
  't as if
 there was a few bad apples a few people cheated a lot instead what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit  
 now in economic theory cheating is a very simple cost benefit analysis you say  what 's the probability of being caught how much do i stand to gain from cheating  and how much punishment would i
  and you weigh these options out you do the simple cost benefit analysis and you decide whether it 's worthwhile to commit the crime or not 
 so we try to test this 
 for some people we varied how much money they could get away with how much money they could steal  we paid them ten cents per correct question  fifty cents a dollar five dollars ten dollars per correct question 
 you would expect that as the amount of money on the on the table
  people would cheat more but in fact it wasn 't the case  we got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit  
 what about the probability of being caught 
 some people shredded half the sheet of paper so there was some evidence left some people shredded the whole sheet of paper  
 some people shredded everything went out of the room and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over one hundred dollars 
 you would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down people would cheat more  but again this was not
  the case again a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit  and they were insensitive to these economic incentives  
 so we said if people are not sensitive to the economic rational theory explanations to these forces  
 what could be going on 
 and we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces at one hand we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves  so we don 't want to cheat on the other hand we can cheat a little
  and still feel good about ourselves  so maybe what is happening is that there 's a level of cheating we can 't go over  but we can still benefit from cheating
 at a low degree as long as it doesn 't change our impressions about ourselves  we call this like a personal fudge factor  
 now how would you test
 a personal fudge factor  initially we said what can we do to shrink the fudge factor  
  we got people to the lab and we said we have two tasks for you today 
 first we asked half the people to recall either ten books they read in high school or to recall the ten commandments and then we tempted them with cheating  
 turns out the people who tried to recall the ten commandments and in our sample nobody could recall all of the ten commandments
 but those people who tried to recall the ten commandments  given the opportunity to cheat did not cheat at all 
 it wasn 't that the more religious people the people who remembered more of the commandments cheated less  and the less religious people
  the people who couldn 't remember almost any commandments cheated more 
 the moment people thought about trying to recall the ten commandments they stopped cheating  in fact even when we gave self declared atheists the task of swearing on the bible and we give them a chance 
 to cheat  they don 't cheat at all  
 now  ten commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system so we said why don 't we get people to sign the honor code
  to sign i understand that this short survey falls under the mit honor code then they shredded it no cheating whatsoever 
 and this is particularly interesting because mit doesn 't have an honor code 
 so all this was about decreasing the fudge factor  
 what about increasing the fudge factor 
 the first experiment i walked around mit and i
  distributed six packs of cokes in the refrigerators these were common refrigerators for the undergrads  and i came back to measure what we technically call the half lifetime of coke
 how long does it last in the refrigerators as you can expect it doesn 't last very long people take it 
 in contrast i took a plate with six one dollar bills  and i left those plates in the same refrigerators no bill ever disappeared now this is not a good
  science experiment so to do it better
 i did the same experiment as i described to you before a third of the people we passed the sheet they gave it back to us a third of the people we passed it to they shredded it  they came to us and said mr experimenter 
  i solved x problems give me x dollars a third of the people when they finished shredding the piece of paper  
 tokens we did not pay them with dollars we paid them with something else  and then they took the something else they walked twelve feet to the side  and exchanged it for dollars 
 think about the following intuition how bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home  
 compared to how bad would you feel about taking ten cents from a petty cash box these things feel very differently would being a step removed from cash for a few
  seconds by being paid by token make a difference our subjects doubled their cheating i 'll tell you what i think about this and the stock market in a minute  
 but this did not solve the the big problem i had with enron yet  because in enron there 's also a social element people see each other behaving in fact every day when we open the news
 we see examples of people cheating  what does this cause us  so we did
  another experiment we got a big group of students to
 be in the experiment and we prepaid them so everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment and we told them that at the end  we asked them to pay us back the money they didn 't make 
 ok the same thing happens when we give people the opportunity to cheat they cheat they cheat just by a little bit  all the same  
 but in this experiment we also hired an acting student 
 this acting student stood up
  up after thirty seconds and said i solved everything  what do i do now 
 and the experimenter said if you 've finished everything  go home that 's it the task is finished so now we had a student an acting student that was a part of the group nobody knew it was an actor
  and they clearly cheated in a
  what would happen to the other people in the group  will they cheat more or will they cheat less
  here is what happens  it turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they 're wearing 
 here is the thing we ran this at carnegie mellon and pittsburgh
 and at pittsburgh there are two big universities carnegie mellon and university of pittsburgh 
 all of the subjects sitting in the experiment were carnegie mellon students  when the actor who was getting up was
  a carnegie mellon student
 he was actually a carnegie mellon student but he was
 a part of their group  cheating went up  
 but when he actually had a university of pittsburgh sweatshirt cheating went down 
 now this is important because remember when the moment the student stood up it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating
 because the experimenter said you 've finished everything go home and they went with the money  so it wasn 't so much about the probability of being caught again  
 it was about the norms for cheating if
 somebody from our in group cheats and we see them cheating  we feel it 's more appropriate as a group to behave this way  but if it 's somebody from another group these terrible people i mean not terrible in
 this but somebody we don 't want to associate ourselves with from another university another group
 of a sudden people 's awareness of honesty goes up a little bit like the ten commandments experiment and people cheat even
 even less 
 so what have we learned from this about cheating 
 we 've learned that a lot of people can cheat  they cheat just by a little bit  when we remind people about their
  they cheat less  when we get bigger distance from cheating  
 from the object of of money for example people cheat more  and when we see cheating around us particularly if it 's a part of our in group cheating goes up 
 now if we think about this in terms of the stock market think about what happens  
 what happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way 
 would they not be able to see it this way
 of course they would 
 what happens when you do other things like you remove things from money you call them stock or stock options derivatives mortgage backed securities could it be that with those more distant things 
 it 's not a token for one second it 's something that is many steps removed from money for a much longer time could it be that people will cheat
 i think all of those forces worked in a very bad way
 in the stock market more generally  i want to tell you something about
 behavioral economics  
 we have many intuitions in our life  and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong the question is are we
  to test those intuitions we can think about how we 're going to test this intuition in our private life in our business life  and most particularly when it goes to policy when we think about things like no 
  child left behind when you create new stock markets when you create other policies taxation health care and so on 
  things one was that my favorite nurse ettie 
 told me that i did not take her pain into consideration 
 she said of course you know it was very painful for you but think about me as a nurse  
 taking removing the bandages of somebody i liked and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time  creating so much torture was not something that was good for me too and she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her
  interesting than that because she said i did not think that your intuition was right i felt my intuition was correct so if you think about all of your 
  it 's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong  and she said given the fact that i thought my intuition was right she thought her intuition was right it was very difficult
 for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong 
 but in fact this is the situation we 're all in all the time  we have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things
 our own ability how the economy works 
 how we should pay school teachers  
 but unless we start testing those intuitions we 're not going to do better 
 and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more
 systematic experimentation of our intuitions
