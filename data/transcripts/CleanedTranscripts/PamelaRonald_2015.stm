  i am a plant geneticist  i study genes that make plants resistant to disease and tolerant of stress  
 in recent years millions of people around the world have come to believe that there 's something sinister about genetic modification
 today  i am going to provide a different perspective  
 first let me introduce my husband raoul he 's an organic farmer 
 on his farm he plants a variety of different crops 
 this is one of the many ecological farming practices he uses to keep his farm healthy  
 imagine some of the reactions we get
 an organic farmer and a plant geneticist can you agree on anything 
 well we can and it 's not difficult because we have the same goal 
 we want to help nourish the growing population without further destroying the environment  
 i believe this is the greatest challenge
  genetic modification is not new virtually everything we eat
 has been genetically modified in some manner  let me give you a few examples on the left
 is an image of the ancient ancestor of modern corn you see a single roll of grain that 's covered in a hard
  isn 't good for making tortillas  
 now take a look at the ancient ancestor of banana 
 you can see the large seeds and unappetizing brussel sprouts  and eggplant  so beautiful 
 now to create these varieties  breeders have used
  different genetic techniques over the years some of them are quite creative  like mixing two different species together using a process called grafting
 to create this variety that 's half tomato
 and half potato  
 breeders have also used other types of genetic techniques such as random mutagenesis  which induces uncharacterized mutations into
  the rice in the cereal that many of us fed our babies
 was developed using this approach 
 now today breeders have even more options to choose from some of them are extraordinarily precise  
 i want to give you a couple examples from my own work 
 i work on rice  which is a staple food for more than half the world 's people 
 each year forty percent of the potential
 is lost to pest and disease 
 for this reason farmers plant rice varieties that carry genes for resistance  
 this approach has been used for nearly one hundred years 
 yet when i started graduate school no one knew what these genes were it wasn 't until the
  that scientists finally uncovered the genetic basis of resistance  
 in my laboratory we isolated a gene for immunity to a very serious bacterial disease in asia and africa 
 we found we could engineer the gene into a conventional rice variety that 's normally susceptible and you can see the two leaves on the bottom here are highly resistant to
  the same month that my laboratory published our discovery on the rice immunity gene my friend and colleague dave mackill stopped by my office  
 he said seventy million rice farmers
 are having trouble growing rice 
 that 's because their fields are flooded  and these rice farmers are living on less than two dollars a day  
 although rice grows well in standing
  water most rice varieties will die if they 're submerged for more than three days  
 flooding is expected to be increasingly problematic as the climate changes 
 he told me that his graduate student kenong xu and himself were studying an ancient variety of rice that had an amazing
  it could withstand
 two weeks of complete submergence he asked
 if i would be willing to help them isolate this gene  
 i said yes i was very excited because i knew if we were successful we could potentially help millions of farmers grow rice even when their fields were flooded
 kenong spent ten years looking for this gene then one day he
  said come look at this experiment you 've got to see it i went to the greenhouse and i saw that the conventional variety
 that was flooded for eighteen days had died 
 but the rice variety that we had genetically engineered with a new gene we had discovered called sub1 was alive 
 kenong and i were amazed and excited that a single gene could have this dramatic effect
 but this is just a greenhouse experiment would this work in the field 
 now i 'm going to show you a four month time lapse video taken at the international rice research institute  
 breeders there developed a rice variety carrying the sub1 gene using another genetic technique called precision breeding on the left you can see the
  on the right is the conventional variety  
 both varieties do very well at first  but then the field is flooded for seventeen days 
 you can see the sub1 variety does great  
 in fact it produces three and a half times more grain than the conventional variety 
 i love this video because it shows the power of plant genetics
  to help farmers 
 last year with the help of the bill and melinda gates foundation three and a half million farmers grew sub1 rice thank you 
 now  
 many people don 't mind genetic modification when it comes to moving rice genes around rice genes in rice plants
  or even
 when it comes to mixing species together through grafting or random mutagenesis  but
 when it comes to taking genes from viruses and bacteria and putting them into plants a lot of people say yuck 
 why would you do that the reason is that sometimes it 's the cheapest safest and most effective
  technology
 for enhancing food security and advancing sustainable agriculture  i 'm going to give you three examples  
 first take a look at papaya it 's delicious right  but now  look at this papaya 
 this papaya is infected with papaya  ringspot virus 
  this virus nearly wiped out the entire production
 of papaya on the island of oahu in hawaii 
 many people thought that the hawaiian papaya was doomed  
 but then 
 a local hawaiian a plant pathologist named dennis gonsalves decided to try to fight this disease using genetic engineering  
 he took a snippet of viral dna and he inserted it into the papaya
  genome  this is kind of like a human getting a vaccination  
 now take a look at his field trial 
 you can see the genetically engineered papaya in the center it 's immune to infection 
 the conventional papaya around the outside is severely infected with the virus  
 dennis  ' pioneering work is credited with rescuing the papaya industry
  today twenty years later there 's still no other method to control this disease there 's no organic method there 's no conventional method  
 eighty percent of hawaiian papaya is genetically engineered 
 now  some of you may still feel a little queasy about viral genes in your food  but consider this 
 the genetically engineered papaya carries just a trace amount of the
  virus if you bite into an organic or conventional papaya
 that is infected with the virus you will be chewing on tenfold more viral protein  
 now take a look at this pest feasting on an eggplant  the brown you see is frass 
 what comes out the back end of the insect 
 to control this serious pest
  which can devastate the entire eggplant crop in bangladesh  bangladeshi farmers spray insecticides
 two to three times a week  sometimes twice a day when pest pressure is high  but we know that some insecticides are very harmful
  when farmers and their families cannot afford proper protection like these children 
 in less developed countries it 's estimated that three hundred thousand people die every year because of insecticide misuse and exposure  
 cornell and bangladeshi scientists decided to fight this disease
 using a genetic technique that builds on an organic farming approach
  organic farmers like my husband raoul spray an insecticide called b t which is based on a bacteria 
 this pesticide is very specific to caterpillar pests and in fact it 's nontoxic to humans fish and birds it 's less toxic than table salt  
 but this approach does not work well in bangladesh that 's because these insecticide sprays are
  difficult to find they 're expensive and they don 't prevent the insect from getting inside the plants 
 in the genetic approach scientists cut the gene out of the bacteria and insert it directly into the eggplant genome 
 will this work to reduce insecticide sprays in bangladesh  
 definitely last season farmers reported they were able to reduce their insecticide use by a huge amount  
 almost down to
  zero they 're able to harvest and replant for the next season  
 now i 've given you a couple examples of how genetic engineering can be used to fight pests and disease and to reduce the amount of insecticides 
 my final example is an example where genetic engineering can be used
 to reduce malnutrition in less developed countries
 five hundred thousand children go blind every year because of lack of vitamin a more than half will die 
 for this reason scientists supported by the rockefeller foundation
 genetically engineered a golden rice to produce beta carotene which is the precursor of vitamin a this is the same pigment that we find in carrots  
 researchers estimate that just one
  cup of golden rice per day
 will save the lives of thousands of children  
 but golden rice is virulently opposed by activists who are against genetic modification 
 just last year activists invaded and destroyed a field trial in the philippines 
 when i heard about the destruction  i wondered if they knew that they were destroying much more than a scientific
  research project that they were destroying medicines that children desperately needed to save their sight and their lives 
 some of my friends and family still worry how do you know genes in the food are safe to eat 
 i explained the genetic engineering the process of moving genes between species has been used for more than forty
  in wines in medicine in plants  in cheeses  
 in all that time there hasn 't been a single case of harm to human health or the environment  
 but i say look i 'm not asking you to believe me science is not a belief system 
 my opinion doesn 't matter  let 's look at the evidence 
 after twenty years of careful study and rigorous peer review by thousands of independent scientists
 every major scientific organization in the world has concluded that the crops currently on the market are safe to eat and that the process of genetic engineering is no more risky than older methods of genetic modification 
 these are precisely the same organizations that most of us trust when it comes to other important scientific issues such as global climate change or the safety of vaccines
 raoul and i believe that instead of worrying about the genes in our food we must focus on how we can help children grow up healthy we must ask 
  if farmers in rural communities can thrive  and if everyone can afford the food  we must try to minimize environmental degradation 
  the poorest people who most need the technology may be denied access because of the vague fears and prejudices of those who have enough to eat 
 we have a huge challenge in front of us  
 let 's celebrate scientific innovation and use it it 's our responsibility to do everything we can to help
  the core piece comes from two things one complexity and unintended consequence  nature is this incredibly complex machine if we put out these brand new genes that
  been challenged by years of evolution  
 and they started mixing up with the rest of what 's going on 
 couldn 't that trigger some kind of cataclysm or problem  
 especially when you add in the commercial incentive that some companies have to put them out there the fear is that those incentives mean that the decision is not made on
  purely scientific grounds and even if it was that there would be unintended consequences how do we know that there isn 't a big risk of some unintended consequence
 do lead to big unintended consequences and chain reactions pamela ronald 
 okay so on the commercial aspects one thing that 's really important to understand is that in the developed world 
 farmers in the united states almost all farmers whether they 're organic or conventional they buy seed produced by seed companies so there 's definitely a commercial interest to sell a lot of seed but hopefully they 're selling seed that the farmers want to buy  it 's different in the less developed world
  farmers there cannot afford the seed these seeds are not being sold these seeds are being distributed freely
 through traditional kinds of certification
 groups  so it is very important in less developed countries that the seed be freely available ca wouldn 't some activists say that this is actually part of the conspiracy this is the heroin strategy
  the stuff and people have no choice but to be hooked on these seeds forever pr there are a lot of conspiracy theories for sure
 but it doesn 't work that way for example the seed that 's being distributed the flood tolerant rice this is distributed freely through
 indian and bangladeshi seed certification agencies so there 's no commercial interest at all the golden rice was developed through support of the rockefeller foundation again it 's being freely distributed there are no commercial profits
 in  this situation 
 and now to address your other question about well mixing genes aren 't there some unintended consequences absolutely every time we do something different there 's an unintended consequence 
 but one of the points i was trying to make is that we 've been doing kind of crazy things to our plants  mutagenesis using radiation
  chemical mutagenesis this induces
 thousands of uncharacterized mutations 
 and this is even a higher risk of unintended consequence than many of the modern methods  and so it 's really important not to use the term gmo because it 's scientifically 
  meaningless i feel it 's very important to talk about a specific crop and a specific product and think about the needs of the
  of what 's happening here is that there 's a mental model in a lot of people that nature is nature and it 's pure and pristine  and to tinker with it 
 it 's making something that 's pure dangerous in some way  and i think you 're saying that that
 that whole model just misunderstands how nature is nature is a much more chaotic interplay of genetic changes that have been happening all the time anyway pr that 's absolutely 
  true and there 's no such thing as pure food i mean you could not spray eggplant with
  insecticides or not genetically engineer it  but then you 'd be stuck eating frass so there 's no purity there
