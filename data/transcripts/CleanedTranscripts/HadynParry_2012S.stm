  by focusing on the world 's most dangerous animal 
 now when you talk about dangerous animals most people might think of lions or tigers or sharks  but of course the most dangerous animal is the mosquito 
 the mosquito has killed more humans than any other creature
 in human history in fact probably adding them all together the mosquito has killed more humans  and the mosquito has killed more humans than wars and plague  
 and you would think would you not that with all our science with all our advances in society with better towns better civilizations better
  we would get better at controlling mosquitos and hence reduce this disease  
 and that 's not really the case  
 if it was the case we wouldn 't have between two hundred and three hundred million cases of malaria every year  and we wouldn 't have
 a million and a half deaths from malaria  and we wouldn 't have
  a disease that was relatively unknown fifty years ago
 now suddenly turned into the largest mosquito borne virus threat that we have and that 's called dengue fever  
 so fifty years ago  pretty much no one had heard of it no one certainly in the european environment  
 but dengue fever now according to the world health organization infects between fifty and one hundred million people every year so that 's equivalent to the whole of the population of the  u k being infected every year
 other estimates put that number at roughly double that number of infections and
 dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally in the last fifty years the incidence of dengue has grown thirtyfold 
 now let me tell you a little bit about what dengue fever is for those who don 't know now let 's assume you go on holiday let 's assume you go to the caribbean
 or you might go to mexico you might go to latin america asia africa
  anywhere in saudi arabia you might go to india  the far east it doesn 't really matter it 's the same mosquito and it 's the same disease you 're at risk 
 and let 's assume you 're bitten by a mosquito that 's carrying that virus  well  you could develop
  they could be quite mild  you could develop nausea  headache your muscles could feel like they 're contracting  and you could actually feel
 like your bones are breaking  and that 's the nickname given to this disease it 's called breakbone fever  because that 's how you can feel 
 now the odd thing is is that once you 've been bitten by this mosquito and you 've had this disease your body develops antibodies 
 so if you 're bitten again
 with that strain
 it doesn 't affect you 
 but it 's not one virus it 's four  and the same protection that gives you the antibodies and protects you from the same virus that you had before
 actually makes you much more susceptible to the other three  
 so the next time you get dengue fever if it 's a different strain  you 're more susceptible you 're likely to get worse symptoms
  and you 're more likely to get the more severe forms
  fever or shock syndrome  so you don 't want dengue once and you certainly don 't want it again  so why is it spreading
 so fast 
 and the answer is this thing this is aedes aegypti now this is a mosquito that came like its name suggests out of north africa  
 and it 's spread round the
  in fact a single mosquito will only travel about two hundred yards in its entire life they don 't travel very far 
 what they 're very good at doing is hitchhiking particularly the eggs they will lay their eggs in clear water any pool any puddle 
 any birdbath any flower pot  anywhere there 's clear water they 'll lay their eggs  and if that clear water is near freight it 's near a port 
 if it 's anywhere near transport those eggs will then get transported around the world
 and that 's what 's happened mankind has transported these eggs all the way around the world 
 and these insects have infested over one hundred countries and there 's now two point five billion people living in countries where this mosquito resides 
 to give you just a couple of examples how fast this has happened in the
  about a billion dollars now a year trying to get rid of it trying to control it just one one species of mosquito 
 two days ago or yesterday i can 't remember which
 i saw a reuters report that said madeira had had their first cases of dengue about fifty two cases with about four hundred
  first got the insect in two thousand and five 
 and here we are a few years later first cases of dengue  so the one thing you 'll find is that where the mosquito goes dengue will follow 
 once you 've got the mosquito in your area  anyone coming into that area with dengue mosquito will bite them mosquito will bite somewhere else  somewhere else
  we must be good at killing mosquitos i mean that can 't be very difficult well there 's two principle ways
  the first way is that you use larvicides you use chemicals you put them into water where they breed 
 now in an urban environment that 's extraordinarily difficult you 've got to get your chemical into every puddle every birdbath every tree trunk it
 's just not practical the second way you can do it
 trying to kill the insects as they fly around this is a picture of fogging 
 here what someone is doing is mixing up chemical in a smoke and basically spreading that through the environment  
 you could do the same with a space spray this is really unpleasant stuff  and if it was any good we wouldn 't have this massive increase in mosquitos and we wouldn 't have this massive increase in
  so it 's not very effective  but it 's probably the best thing we 've got at the moment  having said that actually your best form of protection and my best form of protection is a long sleeve shirt
 and a little bit of deet to go with it so let 's
 start again let 's design a product right from the word go  and decide what we want 
 well we clearly need something that is effective at reducing the mosquito population there
  point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there we want something that gets that population right the way down so it can 't get the disease transmission 
 clearly the product you 've got has got to be safe to humans we are going to use it in and around humans it has to be safe 
 we don 't want to have a lasting impact on the environment  we don 't want to do anything that you can 't undo
  maybe a better product comes along in twenty thirty years  
 fine  we don 't want a lasting environmental impact 
 we want something that 's relatively cheap
 or cost effective because there 's an awful lot of countries involved and some of them are emerging markets some of them emerging countries  low income 
 and finally you want something that 's species specific you want to get rid of this mosquito that spreads dengue  but you don 't really want to get all the other insects some are quite beneficial some are important to your
  ecosystem this one 's not it 's invaded you but you don 't want to get all all of the insects you just want to get this one 
 and most of the time you 'll find this insect lives in and around your home so this
 whatever we do has got to get to that insect it 's got to get into people 's houses into the bedrooms into the kitchens now there are two
 features of mosquito biology that really help us in this project
  and that is firstly males don 't bite it 's
 only the female mosquito that will actually bite you the male can 't bite you won 't bite you doesn 't have the mouth parts to bite you it 's just the female  
 and the second is a phenomenon
 that males are very very good at finding females if there 's a male mosquito that you release and if there 's a female around that male will find the female
 so basically we 've used those two factors  
 so here 's a typical situation 
 male meets female lots of offspring a single female will lay about up to one hundred eggs at a time up to about five hundred
 in her lifetime now if that male is carrying a gene which causes the
  of the offspring then the offspring don 't survive and instead of having five hundred mosquitos running around you have none  
 and if you can put more i 'll call them sterile that
 the offspring will actually die at different stages but i 'll call them sterile for now if you put more sterile males out into the environment  
 then the females are more likely to find a sterile male than a fertile one  
 and you will bring that population down
  so the males will go out they 'll look for females they 'll mate if they mate successfully then no offspring if they don 't find a female  
 then they 'll die anyway they only live a few days  
 and that 's exactly where we are 
 so this is technology that was developed in oxford university a few years ago  the company itself oxitec we 've been working for the last ten years very much on a sort of similar
  development pathway that you 'd get with a pharmaceutical company so about ten years of internal
 evaluation testing to get this to a state where we think it 's actually ready  
 and then we 've gone out into the big outdoors  always with local community consent always with the necessary permits  
 so we 've done field trials now in the cayman islands a small one in malaysia  and
 two more
 now in brazil
 and what 's the result  well the result has been
 very good in about four months of release we 've brought that population of mosquitos
  about two thousand three thousand people that sort of size starting small we 've taken that mosquito
  the numbers after that get those get very difficult to count because there just aren 't any left  
 so that that 's been what we 've seen in cayman it 's been what we 've seen in brazil
  in those trials  
 and now what we 're doing is we 're going through a process to scale up to a town of about fifty thousand so we can see this work at big scale  
 and we 've got a production unit in oxford or just south of oxford where we actually produce these mosquitos
  we can produce them in a space a bit more than this red carpet i can produce about twenty million a week 
 we can transport them around the world it 's not very expensive  because it 's a coffee cup something the size of a coffee cup will hold about three million eggs 
 so freight costs aren 't our biggest problem 
  we 've got that you could call it a mosquito factory  
 and for brazil where we 've been doing some trials the brazilian government themselves have now built their own mosquito factory far bigger than ours and we 'll use that
 for scaling up in brazil 
 there you are we 've sent mosquito eggs we 've separated the males from the females the males have been put in little pots
 and the truck is going down the road and they are releasing males as they go it 's actually
  little bit more precise than that you want to release them so that you get good coverage of your area  so you take a google map you divide it up work out how far they can fly  and make sure you 're releasing such that you get coverage of the area  
 and then you go back and within a very short space of time you 're bringing that population right the way down 
 we 've also done this in agriculture 
 we 've got several different species of
  coming along  and i 'm hoping that soon we 'll be able to get some funding together so we can get back
 and start looking at malaria  so that 's where we stand at the moment  and i 've just got a few final thoughts which is that
 this is another way in which biology is now coming in to supplement chemistry in some of our societal advances in this area
  these biological approaches are coming in
 in very different forms  
 and when you think about genetic engineering we 've now got enzymes for industrial processing enzymes genetically engineered enzymes in food 
 we have g m crops  we have pharmaceuticals  we have new vaccines all using roughly the same technology but with very different outcomes  
 and i 'm in favor actually of course i am
  favor  of particularly where the older technologies don 't work well or have become unacceptable and
 although the techniques are similar the outcomes are very very different and if you take our approach for example and you compare it to say g m crops  
 both techniques are
 trying to produce a massive benefit  both have a side
  which is that we reduce pesticide
 use tremendously
  but whereas a g m crop is trying to protect the plant for example  and give it it an advantage what we 're actually doing
 is taking the mosquito
 and giving it the biggest disadvantage it can possibly have rendering it unable to reproduce effectively  so for the mosquito it 's a dead end
