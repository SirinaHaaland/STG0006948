  we have public leaders  
 public officials who are out of control  they are writing bills that are unintelligible  and out of these bills are going to come maybe forty thousand pages of
  which has a dramatically negative impact on our life if you 're a veteran coming back from iraq or vietnam
 you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits if you 're trying to get a small business loan you face a blizzard of paperwork what are we going to do about it 
 i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity  transparency and empathy
  building humanity into communications  i 've been simplifying things for thirty years  
 i come out of the advertising and design business my focus is understanding
 you people  and how you interact with the government to get your benefits  how you interact with corporations to decide whom you 're going to do business with  
 and how you view brands so very quickly  when president obama said i don 't see why we can
 one page plain english consumer credit agreement so i locked myself in a room  figured out the content  
 organized the document  and wrote it in plain english  i 've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country this is a real thing  
 now
  i went one step further and said why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have
 a paper document let 's go online
  online and many people might need help in computation working with the harvard business school 
 you 'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment  if you spent sixty two dollars for a meal the longer you take to pay out that loan you see over a period of time using the minimum payment it 's

 perhaps a stealth thing define it in context tell people what it means  when you put it in plain english you almost force the institution to give the people a way a default out of that and not put themselves at
  plain english is about
 changing the content  and one of the things i 'm most proud of is this agreement for ibm 
 it 's a grid it 's a calendar at such and such a date  ibm has responsibilities you have responsibilities  received very favorably by by business  
 and there is some good news to report today  each year one in ten taxpayers receives a notice from
  there are two hundred million letters that go out running through this typical letter that they had  i ran it through my simplicity lab it 's pretty unintelligible all the
 parts of the document in red are not intelligible  we looked at doing over one thousand letters that cover seventy percent of their transactions in plain english they have been tested in the laboratory  when i run it through my lab  
 this 
  are a couple of things going on right now that i want to bring to your attention there is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency how to mandate simplicity we see all this complexity  
 it 's incumbent upon us  and this organization i believe to make clarity
 and empathy a national priority  there is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate there is no way we should do business with companies that 
 have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible  so  how are we going to change the world make
