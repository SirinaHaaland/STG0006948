  of all post conflict situations historically have reverted back to conflict within a decade  
 in fact they 've accounted for half of all civil wars  
 why has the record been so poor  well the conventional approach to post conflict situations
 has rested
  on kind of three principles the first principle is 
 it 's the politics that matters  
 so the first thing that is prioritized is politics try and build a political settlement first 
 and then the second step is to say the situation is admittedly dangerous  but only for a short time so get peacekeepers there but get them home as soon as possible 
 so
 and thirdly what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers  it 's an election 
 that will produce a legitimate and accountable government  so that 's the conventional approach  
 i think that approach denies reality 
 we see that there is no quick fix there 's certainly no quick security fix
  've tried to look at the the risks of reversion to conflict during our post conflict decade  and the risks stay high throughout the decade  
 and they stay high regardless of the political
 innovations  does an election produce an accountable and
  what an election produces is a winner and a loser  and the loser is unreconciled 
 the reality is that we need to reverse the sequence  it 's not the politics first it 's actually the politics last 
 the politics become easier as the decade progresses if you 're building on a foundation of security and
 economic development
 the rebuilding of prosperity 
 why does the politics get easier  and why is it so difficult initially  because after years of stagnation and decline  
 the mentality
 of politics is that it 's a zero sum game  
 if the reality is stagnation i can only go up if you go down  and that
 doesn 't produce a
  productive politics  and so the mentality has to shift from zero sum to 
 before you can get a productive politics
 you can only get positive that mental shift if the reality is that prosperity is being built  and in order to build prosperity  we need
  so that is what you get when you face reality but the objective of facing reality is to change reality
 and so now let me suggest two
 complimentary approaches to changing the reality of the situations 
 the first is to recognize the interdependence of three key actors who
  and at the moment are uncoordinated  
 the first actor is the security council  the security council typically has the responsibility for providing the peacekeepers
 who build the security 
 and that needs to be recognized  first of all that peacekeeping works it is a cost effective approach  it does
 increase security  but it needs to be done long term it needs to be a
  than just a couple of years 
 that 's one actor the security council the second actor different cast of guys is the donors the donors provide
 typically in the past the donors have been interested in the first couple of years  and then they got bored they moved on to some other situation
  recovery is a slow process there are no quick processes in economics except
 except decline  you can do that quite fast 
 laughter so the donors have to stick with this situation for at least a decade  
 and then the third key actor is the
  there are two key things it 's got to do one is it 's got to do economic reform not fuss about
 the political constitution it 's got to reform economic policy why because during conflict
 economic policy typically deteriorates  governments snatch short term opportunities
  by the end of the conflict  the chickens have come home to roost so this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy 
 so there is a reform agenda  and there is an inclusion agenda  the inclusion agenda doesn 't come from elections elections
 produce a loser who is then excluded  so the the inclusion agenda means genuinely bringing people inside
  over a long term  if the
 security council doesn 't commit to security over the course of a decade  you don 't get the reassurance which produces private investment  
 if you don 't get the policy reform
 and the aid  you don 't get the economic recovery which is the true exit strategy for the peacekeepers  so we should recognize that
  interdependence 
 by formal mutual commitments  
 the united nations actually has a language for these mutual commitments the recognition of mutual commitments  it 's called the language of compact  
 and so we need a post conflict compact the
 united nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts it 's called the peace building commission
  be ideal to have a
 standard set of norms where when we got to a post conflict situation there was an expectation of these mutual commitments from the three parties  
 so that 's idea one recognize interdependence  
 and now let me turn to the second approach which is complimentary
  and that is to focus on a few critical objectives 
 typical  post conflict situation
 is a zoo of different actors with different priorities  and indeed unfortunately if you navigate by needs
 you get a very unfocused agenda  because in these situations needs are
 everywhere  but the capacity to implement change is very limited  so we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical and
 i want to suggest that in the typical post conflict situation three things are critical 
 one is jobs  one is improvements in basic services especially health which is a disaster
 during conflict so jobs
 health  and clean government 
 those are the three critical priorities so i 'm going to talk a little about each of them jobs 
 what is a distinctive approach to generating jobs in post conflict situations  and why are jobs so important 
 jobs for whom especially jobs for young men
  in post conflict situations  the reason that they so often revert to conflict 
 is not because elderly women get upset  it 's because young men get upset
  and why are they upset  because they have nothing to do  
 and so
 we need a process of generating
  often respond by puffing up the civil service that is not a good idea  it 's not sustainable
  in fact you 're building a long term liability
 by inflating civil service but getting the private sector to expand
  is also difficult because any activity which is
 open to international trade is basically going to be uncompetitive in a post conflict situation these are not environments where you can
 build export manufacturing there 's one sector
 which
 isn 't exposed to international trade  and which can generate a lot of jobs  and which is in any case a sensible sector to expand
 the construction sector
 has a vital role obviously in reconstruction 
 but typically that sector has withered away during conflict during conflict people are doing destruction there isn 't any construction going on  and so the sector shrivels away  
 and then when you try and expand it because it 's shriveled away  
 you encounter a lot of bottlenecks
  basically prices soar
 and crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector  but it doesn 't generate any jobs and so the policy priority is to break the bottlenecks in expanding the construction sector  
 what might the bottlenecks be just think what you have to do successfully to build a
  using a lot of labor
  first you need access to land often the legal system is broken down so you can 't even get access to land  
 secondly you need skills  the mundane skills of the construction sector 
 in post conflict situations we don 't just need doctors without borders  we need bricklayers without borders to rebuild the skill set 
 we need firms  the firms have gone away so we need to encourage the growth of local firms  if we do that
  that we not only get the jobs  we get the improvements in public infrastructure the restoration of public infrastructure 
 let me turn from jobs
 to the
 to the second objective which is improving basic social services and to date there has been
 a sort of a schizophrenia
 in the donor community as to how to build
 basic services in
 on the one hand it pays lip service to the idea of rebuild an effective state
 in the image of scandinavia in the 1950s lets develop
 line ministries of this that and the other that deliver these services  and it 's schizophrenic because
 in their hearts donors know that 's not a realistic agenda  and so
  so what they also do is the total bypass just fund ngos  
 neither of those approaches is sensible  
 and so what i 'd suggest is
 what i call independent service authorities  it 's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three 
 the planning function and policy function stays
  with the ministry 
 the delivery of services on the ground  you should use whatever works churches ngos  local communities 
 whatever works  and in between  
 there should be a public agency the independent service authority which channels public money  and especially donor money to
 the retail providers
  part of a public government system  rather than independent of it 
 one advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently  another is you can make ngos accountable 
 you can use yardstick competition  so they have to compete against each other
 for the resources  the good ngos  like oxfam are very keen on this idea they want to have
  the discipline and accountability  
 so that 's a way to get basic services scaled up and because  the government would be funding it it would be co branding these services  so they wouldn 't be
 provided
 thanks to the united states government and some ngo
 so jobs basic services  finally clean government 
 clean means follow their money the typical 
 government is so short of money that it needs our money just to be on a life support
  you can 't get the basic functions of the state done unless we put money into the core budget
 of these countries but 
 if we put money into the core budget we know that there aren 't the budget systems
 with integrity that mean that money will be well spent 
 and if all we do is put money in and close our eyes it 's not just that the money is wasted that 's the least of the problems it
  's that the money is captured  it 's captured by
 the crooks who are at the heart of the political problem  and so inadvertently we empower the people who are the problem  
 so building clean government means yes provide money
 to the budget  but also provide a lot of scrutiny which means a lot of
  technical assistance that follows the money  paddy ashdown who was the
 grand high nabob of bosnia to the united nations in his book about his experience he said i realize
 what i needed was accountants without borders to follow that money 
  that 's the let me wrap up this is the
  they wouldn 't be
