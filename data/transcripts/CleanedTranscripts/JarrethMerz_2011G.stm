  i was born in switzerland
 and raised in ghana west africa ghana felt safe to me as a child  i was free i was happy  
  marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in ghana but then by the end of the decade the country had fallen back into political instability
 and mismanagement in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine i witnessed my first
 military coup 
 we the children had gathered at a friend 's house  
 it was a dimly lit shack there was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background and
 a former head of state and general was being blindfolded
 and tied to the pole  the firing squad aimed  fired
 the general was dead now this was being broadcast live  
 and shortly after  we left the country and we returned to switzerland  
 now europe came as a shock to me  and
 i think i started feeling the need to
 to shed my skin in order to fit in i wanted to blend in like a chameleon i think it was a tactic of survival  and it worked 
 or so i believed  so here i was in two thousand and eight
 wondering where i was in my life  and i felt i was being typecast as an actor i was always playing the exotic african
 the violent african the african terrorist  
 and i was thinking how many terrorists could i possibly play before turning into one myself and i
 had become ashamed of the other the african in me  
 and fortunately i decided in two thousand and eight to return to ghana after twenty eight years of absence
  i wanted to document on film the two thousand and eight presidential elections 
 and there i started by searching for the for the footprints in my childhood  and
 before i even knew it i was suddenly on a stage
 surrounded by thousands of cheering people during a political
 rally  and i realized that when i 'd left the country free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a
 were a dream 
 and now that i 'd returned that dream had become reality  though a fragile reality  and i was thinking was ghana searching for its identity
 like i was looking for my identity was what was happening in ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me  and
 it was as if through the standards of my
  lived up to my full potential  i mean nor had ghana even though we had been trying very hard  now in 
  ghana was the first sub saharan country to gain its independence 
 in the late 50s ghana and singapore had the same gdp  
 i mean today singapore is a first world country and ghana is not 
 but maybe it was time
 to prove to myself yes it 's important to understand the past it is important
 to look at it in a different light but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture
 and build on those foundations in the present so here i was december 7th two thousand and eight 
 the polling stations opened to the to the voters at seven
  but voters  eager to take their own political fate into their hands 
 were starting to line up at four zero am in the morning  
 and they had traveled from near they had traveled from far because they wanted to make their voices heard  
 and i asked one of the voters i said whom are you going to vote for and he said i 'm sorry i can 't tell you 
 he said that his vote was in his heart and i understood this was their election and
  weren 't going to let anyone take it away from them 
 now the first round of the voting didn 't bring forth a clear winner so nobody had achieved the absolute majority so voting went into a second round three weeks later 
 the candidates were back on the road they were campaigning  the rhetoric of the candidates of course changed the heat was on and then
 the cliche came to haunt us
 there were claims of intimidation at the polling stations of ballot boxes being stolen  
 inflated results started coming in
 and the mob was starting to get out of control we witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets people were being beaten brutally
  the army started firing their guns people were scrambling it was complete chaos  
 and my heart sank  because i thought here we are again here is another proof
 that the african is not capable of governing himself  
 and not only that i am documenting it documenting my own cultural shortcomings 
 so when the echo of the gunshots
  it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob and i didn 't believe what i was hearing they were chanting we want peace  we want peace 
 and i realized it had to come from the people 
 after all they decide  and they did so the sounds that were before
 distorted and loud were suddenly a melody the sounds of the voices were harmonious so it could happen
 a democracy could be upheld peacefully 
 it could be by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace  
 now here 's an interesting
 comparison we in the west we preach the
  the golden light of democracy that we are the shining example of how it 's done  but when it comes down to it ghana
 found itself in the same place
 in which the u s election stalled in the two thousand presidential elections bush versus gore  but instead of the unwillingness
 of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide
  and its people it didn 't leave it up to the supreme court to decide the people did now
 the second round of voting did not bring forth a clear winner either  i mean it was so incredibly close  the electoral commissioner
 declared with the consent of the parties to run an
  so the people
 went back to the polls
 to determine their own president not the legal system and guess what it worked  
 the defeated candidate
 gave up power and made way for ghana to move into a new democratic cycle  
 i mean at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy  they did not abuse their power
 the belief in true democracy
 and in the people runs deep proving that the african is capable of governing himself  now the uphill battle for ghana and for africa
 is not over  but i have proof that the other side of democracy exists and that we must not take it for granted 
 now
 i have learned that my
  place is not just in the west or in africa  and i 'm still searching for my identity  but
 i saw ghana create democracy better ghana taught me
 to look at people differently and to look at myself differently and yes  we africans can thank you
