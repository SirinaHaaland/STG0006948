  i 'm a veteran of the starship enterprise  i soared through the galaxy
 driving a huge starship
 with a crew made up of people from all over this world many different races many different cultures
  many different heritages all working together  and our mission
 was to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no one has gone before
  am the grandson
 of immigrants from japan who went to america  
 boldly going to a strange new world  seeking new opportunities 
 my mother was born in sacramento california  my father was a san franciscan  
 they met and married in los angeles  and i was born there
  i was four years old when pearl harbor was bombed on december seven one thousand nine 
  by japan  and overnight  the world was plunged into a world war 
 america suddenly was swept up by
  american citizens of japanese ancestry were looked on with suspicion and fear
 and with outright hatred simply because we happened to look like the people that bombed pearl harbor 
 and the hysteria grew and grew
  the president of the united states  franklin delano roosevelt ordered all 
  on the west coast of america to be summarily rounded up
 with no charges with no trial with no due process due process this is a core pillar of our justice
  that all disappeared  we were to be rounded up and imprisoned in ten barbed wire prison camps
 in some of the most desolate places in america  the blistering hot desert of arizona  
 the sultry swamps of arkansas  
 the wastelands of wyoming idaho  utah  colorado  and two of the most desolate places in california
  april 20th i celebrated my fifth birthday  
 and just a few weeks after my birthday  
 my parents got my younger brother my baby sister and me up very early one morning  and they dressed us hurriedly 
 my brother and i were in the living room looking out the front window  and we saw two soldiers
  marching up our driveway  they carried bayonets on their rifles  
 they stomped up the front porch and banged on the door  
 my father answered it  and the soldiers ordered us out of our home 
 my father gave
  and we walked out and stood on the driveway waiting for our mother to come out and when my mother
 finally came out she had our baby sister in one arm a huge duffel bag in the other  
 and tears were streaming down both her cheeks  
  never be able to forget
 that scene it is burned into my memory we were taken from our home
 and loaded on to train cars with other japanese american families 
 there were guards stationed at both ends of each car 
 as if we were criminals  we were taken two thirds of the way across the country  
 rocking on that train for four days
  days and three nights to the swamps of arkansas  
 i still remember the barbed wire fence that confined me  i remember the tall sentry tower
 with the machine guns pointed at us  
 i remember the searchlight that followed me when i made the night runs from my barrack to the latrine  but to
 five year old me i thought it was kind of nice that they 'd lit the way for me to pee  
 i was a child  too young to understand the circumstances of my being there 
 children are amazingly adaptable what would be grotesquely abnormal
 became my normality in
  the prisoner of war camps 
 it became routine for me to line up three times a day to eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall 
 it became normal for me to go with my father to bathe in a mass shower 
 being in a prison a
  my normality 
 when the war ended  we were released  
 and given a one way ticket to anywhere in the united states  
 my parents decided to go back home to los angeles  
 but los angeles was not a welcoming place 
 we were penniless everything had been taken from us  and the hostility was intense
  first home was on skid row
 in the lowest part of
 our city  living with derelicts drunkards and crazy people 
 the stench of urine all over on the street 
 in the alley in the hallway  
  it was a horrible experience and for us kids it was terrorizing  i remember once
 a drunkard came staggering down fell down right in front of us  and threw up 
 my baby sister said mama  let 's go back home 
 because behind barbed wires
 was for us
  my parents worked hard to get back on their feet  we had lost everything they were at the middle of their lives
 and starting all over  they worked their fingers to the bone  and
 ultimately they were able to get the capital together to buy a three bedroom home in a nice neighborhood  and i was
  and i became very curious about my childhood imprisonment  
 i had read civics books that told me about the ideals of american democracy  
 all men are created equal 
 we have an inalienable right
 to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness  
 and i couldn 't quite make that fit with what i knew to be my childhood imprisonment
  history books  and i couldn i couldn 't find anything about it and so i engaged my father
 after dinner in long sometimes heated conversations we had many many conversations like that 
 and what i got from them
 was my father 's wisdom 
  he was the one that suffered the most under those
 conditions of imprisonment  and yet he understood american democracy 
 he told me that our democracy is a people 's democracy 
 and it can be as great as the people can be but it is also
 as fallible as people are he told me that american democracy
 democracy is vitally dependent on good people
 who cherish the ideals of our system
 and actively engage in the process of making our democracy work  and he took me to
 a campaign headquarters
 the governor of illinois was running for the presidency and introduced me to american
  and he also told me about young 
 during the second world war  when pearl harbor was bombed young 
  like all young americans rushed to their draft board to volunteer to fight for our country that act of patriotism
 was answered with a slap in the face we were denied service
 and categorized as enemy
 it was outrageous to be called an enemy when you 're volunteering to fight for your country  but that was compounded with the word
  took the word citizen away from us and imprisoned
 them for a whole year and then the government realized that there 's a wartime manpower shortage  
 and as suddenly as they 'd rounded us up they opened up the military for
  it was totally irrational  but the amazing thing  
 the astounding thing is that thousands of young japanese american men and women
 again went from behind those barbed wire fences  put on the same uniform as that of our guards  leaving their families in
  to fight for this country  they said that they were going to fight
 not only to get
 their families out from behind those barbed wire fences  but because they cherished the very ideal of what our government stands for should stand for 
 and that was being abrogated by what was being done 
 all men are created equal  and they went to fight for
  this country  they were put into a segregated all 
  unit
 and sent to the battlefields of europe  and they threw themselves into it 
 they fought with amazing incredible courage and valor  
 they were sent out on the most dangerous missions and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate of any
  proportionally 
 there is one battle that illustrates that 
 it was a battle for the gothic line  
 the germans were embedded in this mountain hillside  rocky hillside in impregnable caves 
 and three allied battalions had been pounding away at it for six months  and they
  were stalemated the 442nd was called in
 to add to the fight but the men of the 442nd came up with
 a unique
 but dangerous idea the backside of the mountain was a sheer rock cliff  
 the germans thought thought an attack from the backside would be impossible
 the men of the 442nd decided to do the impossible 
 on a dark  moonless night they began scaling that
 rock wall a drop of more than one thousand feet in full combat gear
  all night long on that sheer cliff 
 in the darkness some lost their handhold or their footing
 and they fell to their deaths in the ravine below  they all fell
 silently not a single one cried out so as not to give their position away 
 the men climbed for eight hours
  straight  and those who made it to the top
 stayed there until the first break of light  and as soon as light broke  
 they attacked  the germans were surprised  and they took the hill
 and broke the gothic line 
  it was an amazing act 
 and when the war ended
 the 442nd returned to the united states as the most decorated unit of the entire second world war  
 they were greeted back on the white house lawn by president truman who said to them
  only the enemy but prejudice  and you won 
 they are my heroes they clung
 to their belief in the shining ideals of this country  and they proved that being an american
 is not just for some people that race is not
  how we define being an american  they expanded what it means to be an american  including 
 that were feared and suspected and hated  they were change agents  and they left for me
 a legacy
  they are my heroes
 and my father is my hero who understood democracy and and guided me through it 
 they gave me a legacy and with that legacy comes a responsibility  and i am dedicated
 to making my country an even better america to making our government
 an even truer democracy
 and because of the heroes that i have
 and the struggles that we 've gone through i can stand before you as a gay
 but even more than that i am a proud american  thank you very much
