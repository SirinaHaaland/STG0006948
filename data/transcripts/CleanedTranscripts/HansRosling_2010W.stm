  years old when i saw my mother load a washing machine for the very first time in her life that was a great day for my mother 
 my mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine  and the first day it was going to be used even grandma
  grandma was invited to see the machine
  and grandma was even more excited  
 throughout her life she had been heating water with firewood and she had hand washed laundry for seven children and now she was going to watch
 electricity do that work my mother
 loaded the laundry into the machine  
 like this  and then when she closed the door grandma said no no no no let me  let me
 push the button 
 and grandma pushed the button  and she said oh  fantastic i want to see this give me a chair  give me a chair i want to see it and she sat down in front of the machine
 and she watched the entire washing program she was mesmerized 
 to my grandmother the washing machine was a miracle  
 today 
 in sweden and other rich countries people are using so many so many different machines look the homes are full of machines i can 't even name them all
 and they also when they
 when they want to travel  they use flying machines that can take them to remote destinations  
 and yet in the world there are so many people who still heat the water on fire  and they cook their food on fire sometimes they don 't even have enough food 
 and they live below the poverty line there are two billion fellow human beings who live on less than two dollars a day
  the richest people over there there 's one billion people and they live above what i call the air line 
 because they spend more than  $ eighty a day
 on their consumption but this is just one two three billion people and obviously there are seven billion people in the world so there must be one two three
  four billion people more who live in between the poverty and the air line  they have electricity but the question is  how many have washing machines  
 i 've done the scrutiny of market data and i 've found that indeed the washing machine has penetrated below the air line  and today there 's an additional one billion people out there who live above the wash line
 so two billion have access to washing machines and the remaining five billion 
 how do they wash 
 or to be more precise  how do most of the women in the world wash because it remains hard work for women to wash 
 they wash like this  by hand 
  which they have to do for hours every week and sometimes they also have to bring water from far away to do the laundry at home or they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off and they want the washing machine  
 they don 't want to spend such a large part of their life doing this hard work with so relatively low productivity
  and there 's nothing different in their wish than it was for my grandma look here two generations ago in sweden picking water from the stream 
 heating with firewood and washing like that 
 they want the washing machine in exactly the same way  but when i lecture to 
  students they tell me no everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines how can we tell this woman that she
  going to have a washing machine  
 and then i ask my students i 've asked them over the last two years i 've asked how many of you doesn 't use a car and some of them proudly raise their hand
 and say i don 't use a car 
 and then i put the really tough question how many of you hand wash your jeans and your bed sheets and no one raised their hand 
 even the hardcore in the green movement
  something that everyone uses and they think others will not stop it what is special with this i had to do an analysis about the energy used in the world here we are look here you see the seven billion 
  people up there the air people the wash people  the bulb people and the fire people 
  of electricity and the energy in the world is and it 's twelve units used in the entire world and the richest one billion they use six of them 
 half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world 's population and these ones who have washing machines but not a house full of other machines  they use two 
 this group uses three one each
 and they also have electricity and over there they don 't even use one each
 that makes twelve of them but the main concern for 
  the environmentally interested students and they are right is about the future  
 what are the trends if we just prolong the trends without any real advanced analysis to two thousand and fifty there are two things that can increase the energy use first population
  economic growth 
 population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here because they have high child mortality and they have many children per woman and [ with ] that you will get two extra but that won 't change the energy use 
  very much what will happen is is economic growth  the best of here in the emerging economies i call them the new east they will jump the air line wopp they will say and they will start to use as much
  as the old west are doing already  
 and these people they want the washing machine i told you they 'll go there and they will double their energy use and we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light and they 'll get a two child
  family without a stop in population growth  but the total energy consumption will increase to twenty two units and these 
  units still the richest people use most of it so what needs to be done because the risk the high
  probability of climate change is real it 's real of course they must be more 
 they must change behavior in some way  they must also start to produce green energy much more green energy but until they have the same energy consumption per person they shouldn 't give advice to others what to do and what not to do
 more green energy all over this is what we hope may happen it 's a real challenge in the future  
 but i can assure you that this woman in the favela in rio she wants a washing machine  
 she 's very happy about her minister of energy that provided electricity to everyone so happy that she even even voted for her  and she became dilma rousseff the 
  of one of the biggest democracies in the
 moving from minister of energy to president  
 if you have democracy people will vote for vote for washing machines they love them  
 and what 's the magic with them my mother explained the magic with this machine the very very first day she said now
  we have loaded the laundry the machine will make the work and now we can go to the library 
 because this is the magic you load the laundry  and what do you get out of the machine  you get books
 out of the machines  children 's books and mother got time to read for me  she loved this i got the abc 's this is where i started my career as a professor when my mother had
  time to read for me  and she also got books for herself she managed to study english and learn that as a foreign language  and she read so many novels so many different novels here
  and we really we really loved this machine  
 and what we said my mother and me thank you industrialization thank you steel mill  thank you
  and thank you chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books thank you very much
