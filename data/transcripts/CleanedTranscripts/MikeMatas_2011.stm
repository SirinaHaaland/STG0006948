  the past year and a half my team at push pop press and charlie melcher and melcher media have been working on creating the first feature length interactive book 
 it 's called our choice and the author is al
  it 's the sequel to an inconvenient truth and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis 
 the book starts like this this is the cover 
 as the globe spins we can see our location and we can open the book
 and swipe through the chapters to browse the book  
 or we can scroll through the pages
  and if we wanted to zoom into a page we can just open it up and anything you see in the book  you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page
 and open up 
 and if you want to go back and read the book again  you just fold it back up and put it back on the page 
 and so this works the same way you pick it up and
  and so throughout the whole book al gore will walk you through and explain the photos this photo you can you can even see on an interactive map 
 zoom into it and see where it was taken  
 and throughout the book there 's over an hour of
  starts playing immediately  and while it 's playing we can pinch and peak back at the page and the movie keeps playing  or we can zoom out to the table of contents  
 and the video keeps playing
  but one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics this one shows the
  wind potential all around the united states  but instead of just showing us the information we can take our finger
 and explore and see state by state  exactly how much wind potential there is 
 we can do the same for geothermal energy
 and solar power
  this is one of my favorites so this shows 
 when the wind is blowing  
 any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery  and as the wind starts dying down any excess energy will be diverted back into the house
  the lights never go out 
 and this whole book it doesn 't just run on the ipad it also runs on the iphone  
 and so you can start reading on your ipad in your living room and then pick up where you left off
 on the iphone and it works the exact same way you can pinch into any page 
  so that 's push pop press  ' first title al gore 's our choice
  do you want to be a publisher a technology licenser  what is the business here is this something that other people can do mm 
 yeah we 're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content so
 melcher media 's team who 's on the east coast and we 're on the west coast building the software
