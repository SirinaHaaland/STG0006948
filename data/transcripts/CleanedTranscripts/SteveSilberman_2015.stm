  just after christmas last year one
 hundred and thirty two kids in california got the measles by either visiting disneyland or being exposed to someone who 'd been there 
 the virus then hopped the canadian border  infecting more than one hundred children in quebec
 one of the tragic things about this outbreak
 is that measles which can be fatal to a child with a weakened immune system is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world 
 an effective vaccine against it has been available for more than half a century  
 but many of the kids involved in the disneyland outbreak had not been vaccinated
 because their parents
  were afraid of something allegedly even worse autism but wait
 wasn 't the paper that sparked the controversy about autism and vaccines debunked  retracted  and branded a deliberate fraud by the british medical journal 
 don 't most science savvy people know that the theory that vaccines cause autism is
  of you do but millions of parents worldwide continue to fear that vaccines put their kids at risk for autism why  
 here 's why 
 this is a graph of autism prevalence estimates rising over time 
 for most of the 20th century autism was considered an incredibly rare condition  
 the few psychologists and pediatricians
  who 'd even heard of it
 figured they would get through their entire careers without seeing a single case 
 for decades the prevalence estimates remained stable at just three or four children in ten thousand  but then 
 the numbers started to skyrocket  fundraising organizations like autism speaks routinely refer to autism as an epidemic
  if you could catch it from another kid at disneyland 
 so what 's going on if it isn 't vaccines what is it 
 if you ask the folks down at the centers for disease control in atlanta what 's going on 
 they tend to rely on phrases like broadened diagnostic criteria and better case finding
  to explain these rising numbers  
 but that kind of language doesn 't do much to allay the fears of a young mother who is searching her two year old 's face for eye contact 
 if the diagnostic criteria had to be broadened why were they so narrow in the first place why were cases of autism so hard to find before the 
 five years ago  i decided to try to uncover the answers to these questions  i learned that
  what happened has less to do with the slow and cautious progress of science
 than it does with the seductive power of storytelling 
 for most of the 20th century  clinicians told one story about what autism is and how it was discovered  
 but that story turned out to be wrong and the consequences of it are having a devastating impact on global public health
  there was a second more accurate story of autism
 which had been lost and forgotten in obscure corners of the clinical literature 
 this second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go next 
 the first story starts with a child psychiatrist at johns
  kanner published a paper describing eleven young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds  ignoring the people around them 
 even their own parents 
 they could amuse themselves for hours by flapping their hands in front of their faces  but they were panicked by little things like their favorite toy being moved from its
  without their knowledge based on the patients who were brought to his clinic kanner speculated that autism is very rare by the 
 as the world 's leading authority on the subject he declared that he had seen less than one hundred and fifty true cases of his syndrome while fielding referrals from as far away as south africa 
 that 's actually not surprising
  kanner 's criteria for diagnosing autism
 were incredibly selective for example
  he discouraged giving the diagnosis to children who had seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism 
 he once bragged that he had turned nine out of ten kids referred to his office as autistic by other clinicians without giving them an autism diagnosis
  kanner was a smart guy  but a number of his theories didn 't pan out he classified autism as a form of infantile psychosis
 caused by cold and and unaffectionate parents 
 these children he said had been kept neatly in a refrigerator that didn 't defrost at
 the same time however kanner noticed that some of his young patients had special abilities that clustered in certain areas like music  math and memory
 one boy in his clinic could distinguish between eighteen symphonies before he turned two 
 when his mother put on one of his favorite records he would correctly declare beethoven 
 but kanner took a dim view of these abilities  claiming that the kids were just regurgitating things
  they 'd heard their pompous parents say  desperate to earn their approval 
 as a result autism became a source of shame and stigma for families  
 and two generations of autistic children were shipped off to institutions for their own good  becoming invisible to the world at large  
 amazingly  it wasn 't until the 
 that researchers began to test kanner 's theory that autism was rare
  wing was a cognitive psychologist in london who thought that kanner 's theory of refrigerator parenting were bloody stupid as she told me  
 she and her husband john were warm and affectionate people and they had a profoundly autistic daughter named susie 
 lorna and john knew how hard it was to raise a child like susie without support services special education
  and the other resources that are out of reach without a diagnosis to make the case to the national health service
 that more resources were needed for autistic children and their families lorna and her colleague judith gould decided to do something that should have been done thirty years earlier 
 they undertook a study of autism prevalence in the general population they pounded the
  pavement in a london suburb called camberwell to try to find autistic children in the community 
 what they saw made clear that kanner 's model was way too narrow 
 while the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse 
 some kids couldn 't talk at all  while others waxed on at length about their fascination with astrophysics
 or the genealogy of royalty 
 in other words these children didn 't fit into nice neat boxes as judith put it and they saw lots of them 
 way more than kanner 's monolithic model would have predicted 
 at first they were at a loss to make sense of their data how had no one noticed these children
  but then lorna came upon a reference to a paper that had been published in german in one thousand nine 
 the year after kanner 's paper and then forgotten buried with the ashes of a terrible time that no one wanted to remember or think about 
 kanner knew about this competing paper but scrupulously avoided mentioning it in his own work 
 it had never even been translated into english  but luckily  lorna 's husband spoke german
 and he translated it for her 
 the paper offered an alternate story of autism 
 its author was a man named hans asperger who ran a combination clinic and residential school in vienna in the 
 asperger 's ideas about teaching children with learning differences were progressive even by contemporary standards  
 mornings at his clinic began with exercise
  classes set to music  and the children put on plays on sunday afternoons  
 instead of blaming parents for causing autism 
 asperger framed it as a lifelong polygenetic disability that requires compassionate forms of support and accommodations over the course of one 's whole life  
 rather than treating the kids in his clinic like patients asperger called them his
  little professors  and enlisted their help in developing methods of education that were particularly suited to them  
 crucially 
 asperger viewed autism as a diverse continuum that spans an astonishing range of giftedness and disability 
 he believed that autism and autistic traits are common
 and always have been seeing aspects
  of this continuum in familiar archetypes from pop culture
 like the socially awkward scientist and the absent minded professor 
 he went so far as to say it seems that for success in science and art a dash of autism is essential 
 lorna and judith realized that kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare
 as he had been about parents
  causing it 
 over the next several years they quietly worked with the american psychiatric association to broaden the criteria for diagnosis to reflect the diversity of what they called the autism spectrum 
 in the late ' 80s and early 
 their changes went into effect  swapping out kanner 's narrow model
  for asperger 's broad and inclusive one 
 these changes weren 't happening in a vacuum 
 by coincidence as lorna and judith worked behind the scenes to reform the criteria 
 people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time 
 before rain man came out in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight only a tiny ingrown circle of experts knew what autism looked like  
 but after dustin hoffman 's unforgettable performance as raymond babbitt
 earned rain man four academy awards pediatricians psychologists teachers and parents all over the world knew what autism looked like 
 coincidentally at the same time  the first easy to use clinical tests for diagnosing autism were introduced 
 you no longer had to have a connection to that tiny circle of experts to get your child
  evaluated 
 the combination of rain man the changes to the criteria  and the introduction of these tests created a network effect 
 a perfect storm of autism awareness  
 the number of diagnoses started to soar just as lorna and judith predicted  indeed hoped
  enabling autistic people and their families to finally get the support and services they deserved 
 then andrew wakefield came along to blame the spike in diagnoses on vaccines a simple  powerful and seductively believable story
 that was as wrong as kanner 's theory that autism was rare  if the cdc 's current
  that one in sixty eight kids in america are on the spectrum is correct  autistics are one of the largest minority groups in the world 
 in recent years autistic people have come together on the internet to reject the notion that they are puzzles to be solved by the next medical breakthrough 
 coining the term 
 to celebrate the varieties of human cognition
  to think in terms of human operating systems just because a p c is not running windows doesn 't mean that it 's broken 
 by autistic standards  the normal human brain is easily distractable obsessively social and suffers from a deficit of attention to detail 
 to be sure autistic people have a hard time living in a world not built for them
  still catching up to asperger who believed that the cure for the most disabling aspects of autism
 is to be found in understanding teachers  accommodating employers  supportive communities and parents who have faith in their children 's potential 
 an autistic [ man ] named zosia zaks once said we need all hands on deck to right the ship of humanity
  as we sail into an uncertain future 
 we need every form of human intelligence on the planet working together to tackle the challenges that we face as a society  
 we can 't afford to waste a brain
