  his wife 's hand 
 quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor with her brooch i 'm not sure it seems a bit extreme to me that image was the start of the x ray technology and i 'm still fundamentally using the same principles today
 i 'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner  the
 first shot i ever did was of a soda can which was to promote a brand that we all know so i 'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it 
 but the second shot i did was my shoes i was wearing on the day and i do really like this shot because
 it shows all the detritus that 's sort of embedded in the sole of the sneakers
  time moving on to something a bit larger this is an x ray of
 a bus and the bus is full of people it
 's actually the same person it 's just one skeleton  and back in the ' 60s they used to teach student radiographers to take x rays thankfully not on you and i but
 on dead people  so i 've still got access to one of these dead people called frieda she 's falling apart i 'm afraid because she 's very old and fragile  but everyone on
  that bus is frieda and the bus is taken with a
 which is the sort of machine you have on borders which
 checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things 
 fairly obvious what that is 
 so using large scale objects does sort of create drama because you just don 't see x rays of big things that often technology is moving ahead and
 these large cargo scanner
  that work with the digital system are getting better and better and better  
 again though to make it come alive you need somehow to add the human element  and i think the reason this image works again is because frieda is driving the bulldozer 
 quite a difficult brief make a pair of men 's pants look beautiful but i think the process in itself  shows how exquisite they are 
 fashion now i 'm sort of anti fashion because i don 't show the surface i show what 's within
  don 't really like me because it doesn 't matter if kate moss is wearing it or if i 'm wearing it it looks the same 
 we all look the same inside believe me  the creases in the material and the
 sort of nuances and
 i show things for really what they are what they 're made of i peel back the layers and expose it  and if it 's well made i show it if it 's badly made i show it  and i 'm sure ross can associate that with design the design comes from within
  it 's not just topshop i get some strange looks when i go out getting my props here i was fumbling around in the ladies ' underwear department of a department store  almost got escorted from the premises  
 i live opposite a farm and this was the runt of the litter a piglet that died and what 's really interesting is if you look at the legs you 'll notice that the bones haven 't fused and should that pig have grown unfortunately it was dead it would have certainly been dead after i x rayed it with the amount of radiation i used anyway
 but once the bones had fused together it would have been healthy 
 so that 's
 an empty parka jacket but i quite love the way it 's posed nature is my greatest inspiration 
 and to carry on with a theme that we 've already touched with is how nature is related to architecture  if you look at the roof of
 the eden project or the british library it 's all this honeycomb structure  and i 'm sure those architects are
  inspired as i am by what surrounds us by nature this in fact is a victoria water lily leaf that floats on the top of a pond 
 an amaryllis flower looking really three dimensional seaweed ebbing in the tide  
 now how do i do this and where do i do this and all of that sort of thing this is my new
  one thousand two hundred and fifty kilograms and
 the only exercise i get is opening and closing it 
 the walls are seven hundred millimeters thick of solid dense concrete so i 'm using quite a lot of radiation 
 a lot more than you 'd get in a hospital or a vet 's and there i am this is a quite high powered x ray machine what 's interesting really about
  really is if you think about it is that that technology is used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs or looking for contraband or whatever and i use that sort of technology to create things that 
 are quite beautiful  so  still working with film i 'm afraid technology in 
  apart from these large cargo scanning machines hasn 't moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resolution to be good enough for what i want to do with it which is show
  was designed in the days when everyone shot
 photographs on film they scan each individual x ray 
 and this shows how i do my process of same size x rays so this is  again my daughter 's dress still has the tag in it from me buying it so i can take it back to the shop if she didn 't like it  
 but there are four x ray plates you can see them overlapping  
 so  when you move forward
  something fairly small a dress which is this size onto something like that which is done in exactly the same process you can see that that is a lot of work 
 in fact that is three months solid x raying there is over five hundred separate components  
 boeing sent me a seven hundred and forty seven in containers  and i sent them back an x ray 
 i kid you not okay so frieda is my dead skeleton this  unfortunately is basically two pictures  one on the
  is a photograph of an american footballer the one on the left is an x ray 
 but this time i had to use a real body because i needed all the skin tissue to make it look real to make it look like it was a real athlete 
 so here i had to use a recently deceased body  and getting a hold of that was
 extremely difficult and laborious but people do donate their bodies to art and science and when they do i 'm in the queue so i like to use them 
  more organic more natural  it 's whatever takes my fancy really  it 's not accurately colored to how it is in real life that flower doesn 't come in bright orange i don 't think 
 but i just like it in bright orange 
 and also with something technical like these are dj decks it sort of adds another level it makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional
  the most difficult things to
  the most technically challenging things to x ray are the lightest things  the most delicate things to get the detail in a feather  believe me if there is anyone out here who knows anything about x rays that 's
 quite a challenge  i 'm now going to show you
 a short film i 'll step to the side
  if you touch that you could possibly die through radiation poisoning in my career i 've had two exposures to radiation which is two too
  a child 's toy that we all recognize  but also it looks like it 's a robot
  which is used on the borders between countries looking for contraband and illegal immigrants the lorry goes in front of it and it takes slices
 of x rays through the lorry  and that 's how this was done
 bit like a ct scanner in a hospital slices and then if you look carefully there is all little things he 's got headphones on reading
 the newspaper got a hat on glasses got a bag  so these little details
 help to make it work make it real 
  the problem with using living people is that to take an x ray if i x ray you you get exposed to radiation so to avoid that
 i have to
 avoid it somehow is i use dead people 
 now that 's a variety of things from recently deceased bodies to a skeleton that was used by student radiographers to train
 in taking x rays of the human body at different densities
 i have
 very high tech equipment of gloves scissors and a bucket 
 music i will show how the capillary action works how it feeds i 'll be able
 to get all the cells
 inside that stem  because it transfers
 food from its roots to its leaves look at this monster
  be not that that is particularly beautiful when you look at it with the human eye  
 the way the leaves form 
 they 're curling back on each other 
 so the x ray will show the overlaps in these little corners
  the thicker the object  the more radiation it needs  and the more time it needs the lighter the object  the less radiation sometimes you keep the time up 
 because the time gives you detail the longer the exposure goes on for the more detail you get
  get a bit darker in the tube  but everything else would suffer so these leaves at the edge would start to disappear what i like is how hard the
  for what it 's worth for what it 's really made of how it really works but also i find that
 i 've got the benefit of taking away all the surface  which is things that people are used to seeing and that 's the sort of thing i 've been
 doing i 've got the opportunity now to show you
 what i 'm going to be doing in the future this is a commercial application of my most recent work  and what 's good about this i
  think is that it 's like a moment in time like you 've turned around you 've got x ray vision and you 've
 taken a picture with the x ray camera  unfortunately i haven 't got x ray vision i do dream in x ray i see my projects in my sleep and i know what they 're going to look like in x ray
 and i 'm not far off so what am i doing in the future  well this year is the 50th anniversary of issigonis 's mini  which is one of my favorite
  i 've taken it apart  component by component months and months and months of work  
 and with this image i 'm going to be displaying it in the victoria and albert museum
 as a light box  which is actually attached to the car so i 've got to saw the car in half down the middle not an easy task in itself  
 and then so you can get in the driver 's side  sit down and up against you is a wall  and if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car you see
  light box of the car showing you how it works
