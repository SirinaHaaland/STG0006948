  great creativity in times of need we need great creativity  discuss 
 great creativity is astonishingly absurdly  rationally irrationally powerful 
 great creativity can spread tolerance  champion freedom make education
 seem like a bright idea 
 great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation or show that deprivation ain 't necessarily so 
 great creativity can make politicians electable or parties unelectable  it can make war seem like tragedy
 or farce creativity is the meme maker that puts slogans on our
  phrases on our lips it 's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze  
 science is clever but great creativity is something less knowable more magical 
 and now we need that magic this is a time of need our climate is changing quickly  too quickly  
 and great creativity is needed to do what it does so well to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative
  statements to tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps 
 here is one such scrap from an initiative i 'm involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener man 
 you know rather than drive today i 'm going to walk narrator and so he walked 
 and as he walked he saw things strange
 strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen a deer with an itchy leg a flying motorcycle a
 father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall  and then he stopped  walking in front of him was her
 the woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart  
 sure  she had aged a little in fact she had aged a lot  but he felt all his old passion for her return
 don 't say another word gusty she said for that was his name i know a tent next to a caravan exactly three hundred yards from here let 's go there and
 make love in the tent ford undressed
 she spread one leg  and then the other gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically
 while she filmed him because she was a keen amateur pornographer the earth moved for both of them
 and they lived together happily ever after  and all because he decided to walk that day
