  embryonic stem cells are really
 incredible cells  they are our body 's own repair kits  
 and they 're pluripotent which means they can morph into all of the cells in our bodies  soon  we actually will be able to use
  stem cells to replace cells that are damaged or diseased
  but that 's not what i want to talk to you about  
 because right now there are some really extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells that are completely changing the way we look and model 
  disease our ability to understand why we get sick and even develop drugs 
  going to
 allow our children to look at alzheimer 's and diabetes and other major diseases
 the way we view polio today  which is as a preventable disease 
 so here we have this incredible field  which has
 enormous hope for
  the birth of a healthy baby louise this field has been under siege politically and financially  
 critical research is being challenged instead of supported  
 and we saw that it was really essential to have private safe haven laboratories where this work could be
  and so in two thousand and five we started the new york stem cell foundation laboratory so that we would have a small organization that could
 do this work and and support it what we saw very quickly is the world of both medical research but also
 developing drugs and treatments is dominated by as you would expect large organizations but in a
  new field sometimes large organizations really have trouble getting out of their own way and sometimes they can 't
 ask the right questions and there is an enormous gap that 's just gotten larger between academic research on the one hand and pharmaceutical companies and biotechs 
  that are responsible for delivering all of our drugs and many of our treatments  and so we knew that to really accelerate cures and
  we were going to have to address this
 with two things new technologies and also a new research model 
 because if you don 't close that gap you really are exactly where we are today  
 and that 's what i want to focus on we 've spent the last couple of years pondering this making a list of the different things that we had to do  and so we developed
 a new technology it 's software and hardware that actually can generate thousands and thousands of
 genetically diverse stem cell lines
  to create a global array essentially avatars of ourselves  
 and we did this because we think that it 's actually going to allow us to realize the potential the promise of all of the sequencing of the human genome  
 but it 's going to allow us in doing that to actually do clinical trials in a dish
  with human cells not animal cells to generate
 drugs and treatments that are much more effective much safer 
 much faster and at a much lower cost so let me put that in perspective for you and give you some context this is
 an extremely new field in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight human embryonic stem cells were first
  and just nine years later a group of scientists
 in japan were able to take skin cells and reprogram them with very powerful viruses to create a kind of pluripotent stem 
  cell called an induced pluripotent stem cell or what we refer to as an ips cell 
  disease and potentially for drug discovery  
 so a few months later in two thousand and eight one of our scientists built on that research he took skin biopsies this time from people who had a disease als or as you call it in the u k motor neuron disease he turned them into the ips
 cells that i 've just told you about and then he turned those ips cells into the motor neurons that actually were dying in the disease  
 so basically what he did was to take
 a healthy cell and turn it into a sick cell and he recapitulated the disease over and over again in the dish  and
 this was extraordinary because it was the first time that we had a model of a disease from a living patient in living human cells and as he watched the disease unfold 
  he was able to discover that actually the motor neurons were dying in the disease in a different way than the field had previously thought
  there was another kind of cell that actually was sending out a toxin
 and contributing to the death of these motor neurons and you simply couldn 't see it until you had the human model  so you could really say that researchers trying to understand the cause of disease
 without being able to have human stem cell models
  were much like
 investigators trying to figure out what had gone terribly wrong in a plane crash
 without having a black box or a flight recorder they could hypothesize about what had gone wrong  but they really had no way of knowing what led to the terrible events 
 and stem cells really have given us the black box
 for diseases and it 's an unprecedented window it really is extraordinary because you can recapitulate
  many many diseases in a dish you can see what begins to go wrong in the cellular conversation
 well before you would ever see symptoms appear in a patient 
 and this opens up the ability  which hopefully will will become something that
 is routine in the near term of using human cells to test for drugs right now
 the way we test for drugs is pretty problematic to bring a successful drug to market it takes on average thirteen years that 's one drug
 with a sunk cost of four billion dollars 
 and only one percent of the drugs that start down that road are actually going to get there 
 you can 't imagine other businesses that you would think of going into that have these kind of numbers
  it 's a terrible business model  but it is really a worse social model because of
 what 's involved and the cost to all of us so the way we develop drugs now
 is by testing promising compounds on we didn 't have disease modeling with human cells  so we 'd been testing them on cells of mice or other creatures or cells that that we engineer
 but they don 't have the characteristics of the diseases that we 're actually trying to cure you know we 're not mice  and you can 't go into
 a living person with an illness and just pull out a few brain cells or cardiac cells and then start fooling around in a lab to test for you know a
 promising drug  but what you can do with human stem cells now is actually create
  avatars  and you can create the cells  whether it 's the live motor neurons or the beating cardiac cells or liver cells or other kinds of cells 
 and you can test for drugs promising compounds on the actual cells that you 're trying to affect and this is now  and it 's
 absolutely extraordinary and you 're going to know at the beginning the very
  early stages of doing your assay development and your testing  you 're not going to have to wait thirteen years until you 've brought a drug to market only to find out 
 that actually it doesn 't work or even worse harms people  
  we 've got to look at the big picture 
 look around this room we are all different  and a disease that i might have if i had alzheimer 's disease or parkinson 's disease 
 it probably would affect me differently than if one of you had that disease and if we both had
 parkinson 's disease and we took the same medication  but we had different genetic makeup
 we probably would have a different result  and it could well be that a drug that worked wonderfully for me was actually ineffective for you 
 and similarly it could be that a drug that is harmful for you is safe for me  
 and you know this seems totally obvious  but unfortunately it is not the way that
 the pharmaceutical industry has been developing drugs
  because until now  it hasn 't had the tools  and so we need to move away from this 
  model 
 the way we 've been developing drugs is essentially like going into a shoe store no one asks you what size you are or if you 're going dancing or hiking  they just say well you have feet here are your
  it doesn 't work with shoes  and our bodies are many times more complicated than just our feet  so we really have to change this 
 there was
 a very sad example of this in the last decade there 's a wonderful drug and a class of drugs actually but
 the particular drug was vioxx  and for people who were suffering from severe arthritis pain  the drug was an absolute lifesaver
  for another subset of those people they suffered
 pretty severe
 heart side effects and for a subset of those people the side effects were so severe the cardiac side effects that they were fatal  
 but imagine a different
 scenario where we could have had an array a genetically diverse array of cardiac cells
  and we could have actually tested that drug  vioxx  in petri dishes  and figured out well  okay people with this genetic type are 
  going to have cardiac side effects people with these genetic subgroups or
  it was a lifesaver could have still taken their medicine the people for whom it was a disaster
  or fatal would never have been given it  and you can imagine a very different outcome for the company who had to withdraw the drug  
 so
 that is terrific  and we thought all right as we 're trying to solve this problem  clearly we have to think about genetics we have
  to think about human testing  
 but there 's a fundamental problem because right now stem cell lines as extraordinary as they are and lines are just groups of cells  
 they are made
 by hand  one at a time  and it takes a couple of months this is not scalable  and also when you do things
 by hand even in the best laboratories you have variations in techniques  
 and you need to know  if you 're making a drug that the aspirin you 're going to take out of the bottle on monday is the same as the aspirin that 's going to come out of the bottle on wednesday  
 so we looked at this  and we thought  okay  artisanal is wonderful in you know your clothing and your bread and crafts but
 artisanal really isn 't going to work in stem cells so we have to deal with this
  but even with that there still was another big hurdle  and that actually brings us back to the mapping of the human genome because
 we 're all different  we know from the sequencing of the human genome that it 's shown us all of the a 's c 's g 's and t 's that make up our genetic
  that code by itself our dna 
 is like looking at the ones and zeroes of the computer code without having a computer that can read it it 's like having an app without having a smartphone 
 we needed to have a way of bringing the biology to that incredible data 
  that could contain all of the genetic information  but have it be arrayed in such a way as it could be read together and actually create this incredible avatar 
 we need to have stem cells from all the genetic sub types that represent who we are 
 so this is what we 've built
  it 's an automated robotic technology  it has the capacity to produce thousands and thousands of stem cell lines it 's
 genetically arrayed  it has massively parallel processing capability  
 and it 's going to change the way drugs are discovered  we hope  and i think eventually what 's going to happen is that we 're going to want to re screen drugs on arrays like this that
  all of the drugs that currently exist  and in the future you 're going to be taking drugs and treatments that have been tested for side effects on all of the relevant cells on brain cells and heart cells and liver cells
  and that 's what i
