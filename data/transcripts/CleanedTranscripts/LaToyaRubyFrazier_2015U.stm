  along the ancient path of the monongahela river 
 braddock pennsylvania sits in the eastern region of allegheny county  
 approximately nine miles outside of pittsburgh  
 an industrial suburb
  braddock is home to andrew carnegie 's first steel mill the edgar thomson works operating since 
 it is the last functioning steel mill in the region 
 for twelve years  i have produced collaborative portraits
  and aerial views in order to build a visual archive to address
 the intersection of the steel industry the environment and the health care system 's impact
 on the bodies
 of my family and community 
 the tradition and grand narrative of braddock is mostly comprised of stories of industrialists
 and trade unions
 currently the new narrative about braddock 
 a poster child for rust belt revitalization is a story of urban pioneers
 discovering a new frontier mass media has omitted the fact
 that braddock is predominantly black  
  and erased fourth generation
 in a lineage of women  i was raised under the protection and care of grandma ruby off 8th street
 at eight hundred and five washington avenue  she worked as a manager
 for goodwill mom was a nurse 's aid she watched the steel
  mills close and white flight to suburban developments 
 by the time my generation walked the streets  disinvestment
 at the local  state
 and federal level  eroded infrastructure and the war on drugs
 dismantled my family and community 
 grandma ruby 's stepfather
  gramps
 was one of few black men to retire from carnegie 's mill with his pension  
 he worked in high temperatures tearing down and rebuilding furnaces cleaning up spilt metal and slag 
 the history of a place is written
 on the body
 and the landscape  
 areas of heavy truck traffic
 exposure to benzene and atomized metals  risk cancer and lupus 
 one hundred twenty three licensed beds  six hundred
  lawsuit against allegheny county removed where the projects talbot towers once stood  
 recent rezoning for more light industry has since appeared 
 google maps and google earth  pixelations
 conceal the flammable waste being used to squeeze the bunn family off their home
  and land 
 in two thousand and thirteen i chartered a helicopter
 with my cameras to document this aggressive dispossession 
 in flight my observation reveals thousands of plastic white bundles owned by a conservation industry
 that claims it 's
 eco friendly and recycles millions of tires to preserve people 's lives
 and to improve people 's lives 
 my work spirals from the micro to the macro level  excavating hidden histories  
 recently  at the seattle
  isaac bunn and i mounted this exhibition and the exhibition was used as a platform to launch his voice  
 through reclamation of our narrative  we will continue to fight historic erasure
 and socioeconomic inequality  thank you
