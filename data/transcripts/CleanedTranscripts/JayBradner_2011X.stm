  ten years ago from chicago with an interest in cancer
 and in chemistry you might know that chemistry is the science of making molecules or to my taste new drugs for
  and you might also know that for science and medicine boston is a bit of a candy store
  you can 't roll a stop sign in cambridge without hitting a graduate student the bar is called the miracle of science the
 billboards say lab space available and it 's fair to say that in these ten years we 've witnessed
 absolutely the start of a scientific revolution that of genome medicine  we know more about the patients that enter our clinic now than ever
  before and we 're able finally to answer the question that 's been so pressing for so many years  why do i have cancer  
 this information is also pretty staggering 
 you might know that so far in just the dawn of this revolution we know that there are perhaps forty thousand unique mutations
 affecting more than ten thousand genes and that there are five hundred of these genes that
  cancer  yet comparatively  we have about a dozen targeted medications  and this inadequacy of cancer medicine really hit home
 when my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer  we didn 't fly him to boston we didn 't sequence his genome  it 's been known for decades what
  this is old information we 've known since about the 80s yet there 's no medicine i can prescribe to a patient with this or any of the of the numerous solid tumors caused by these three
  horsemen of the apocalypse that is cancer  there 's no ras no myc no p53 drug and you might fairly ask  why is that 
 and the very unsatisfying yet scientific answer is
  too hard that for whatever reason these three proteins have entered a space in the language of our field that 's called the undruggable genome
 which is like calling a computer unsurfable or the moon unwalkable it 's a horrible term of trade  
 but what it means is that we 've failed to identify a greasy pocket in these proteins into which we like molecular locksmiths can fashion an active small
  or drug substance 
 now as i was training in clinical medicine and hematology and oncology and stem cell transplantation what we had instead  
 cascading through the regulatory network at the fda were these substances arsenic 
 thalidomide and this chemical derivative of nitrogen mustard
  and so i guess you 'd say dissatisfied with the performance and quality of these medicines i went back to school in chemistry 
 with the idea that perhaps by learning the trade of discovery chemistry and approaching it in the context of this brave new world of the open source  the crowd source  
 the collaborative network that we have access to within
  that we might more quickly bring
 powerful and targeted therapies
 to our patients  
 and so  please consider this a work in progress but i 'd like to tell you today a story about a very rare cancer called midline carcinoma 
 about the undruggable protein target that causes this cancer called brd4 and about a molecule developed at my lab at dana farber cancer institute
  which we affectionately named for jun qi the chemist that made this molecule  
 now brd4 is an interesting protein you might ask with all the things cancer 's trying to do to kill our patient how does it remember it 's cancer  
 when it winds up its genome  divides into two cells and unwinds again  
 why does it not turn into an eye into a liver as it has all the genes necessary to do this it remembers that it 's cancer 
 and the reason is that cancer  like every cell in the body places little molecular
  bookmarks little post it notes that remind the cell i 'm cancer  i should keep growing 
 and those post it notes involve this and other proteins of its class so called bromodomains 
 so we developed an idea a rationale that perhaps if we made a molecule that prevented the post it note from sticking by entering into the little pocket at the base of this spinning protein 
 then maybe we could convince cancer cells certainly
  those addicted to this brd4 protein that they 're not cancer  
 and so we started to work on this problem we developed libraries of compounds and eventually arrived at this and similar substances called  jq1 
 now not being a drug company we could do certain things we had certain flexibilities that
 i respect that a pharmaceutical industry doesn 't have we just started mailing it to our friends  i have a small lab
  we thought we 'd just send it to people and see how the molecule behaves we sent it to oxford england where a group of talented crystallographers provided this picture which helped us understand exactly how this molecule 
  is so potent for this protein target it 's what we call a perfect fit of shape complementarity or hand in glove now 
  and so we worked with samples of material that were collected by young pathologists at brigham and women 's hospital and as we treated these cells with this molecule  we observed something really striking 
 the cancer cells small round and rapidly dividing 
 grew these arms and extensions they were changing shape 
 in effect  the cancer cell
 was forgetting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell this got us very excited
  next step would be to put this molecule into mice the only problem was there 's no mouse model of this rare cancer  
 and so at the time we were doing this research i was caring for a 29 year old firefighter from connecticut
 who was very much at the end of life
 with this incurable cancer 
 this brd4 addicted cancer was growing throughout his left lung  and he had a chest tube in that was draining little bits of debris and every nursing shift we would throw this
  material out  and so we approached this patient
 and asked if he would collaborate with us could we take this precious and rare cancerous material from this chest tube
 and drive it across town and put it into mice and try to do a clinical trial at a stage that with a prototype drug well that would be of course impossible and rightly illegal to do in
  and he obliged us 
 at the lurie family center for animal imaging our colleague andrew kung  
 grew this cancer successfully in mice without ever touching plastic  and you can see this pet scan of a mouse what we call a pet pet 
 the cancer is growing as this red huge mass in the hind limb of this animal 
 and as we treat it with our compound 
 this addiction to sugar this rapid growth faded and on the animal on the right you see that the cancer was responding 
  completed now clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease and every time we see the same thing the mice with this cancer that get the drug live  and the ones that don 't rapidly perish 
 so we started to wonder what would a drug company do at this point well they probably would keep this a secret until they turn the prototype drug into an active pharmaceutical substance 
 so we did just the opposite
  published a paper
 that described this finding at the earliest prototype stage  
 we gave the world the chemical identity of this molecule  typically a secret in our discipline we told people exactly how to make it 
 we gave them our email address suggesting that if they write us we 'll send them a free molecule 
 laughter we basically tried to create the most competitive environment for our lab as possible and this was unfortunately successful
 because now  we 've shared this molecule just since december of last year with forty laboratories in the united states and thirty more in europe
 many of them pharmaceutical companies seeking now to enter this space to target this rare cancer that  thankfully right now
  is quite desirable to study in that industry  
 but the science that 's coming back from all of these laboratories
  about the use of this molecule
 has provided us insights we might not have had on our own  leukemia cells treated with this compound turn into normal white blood cells 
 mice with multiple myeloma an incurable malignancy of the bone marrow  respond dramatically
 to the treatment with this drug you might know that
  in fact this molecule prevents this
 adipocyte this fat stem cell from remembering
 how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet  like the folks in my hometown of chicago 
 fail to develop fatty liver  which is a major medical problem 
 what this research taught us not just my lab  but our institute  and harvard medical school more generally is
  that we have unique resources in academia for drug discovery that our center which has tested perhaps more cancer molecules in a scientific way than any other 
 never made one of its own 
 for all the reasons you see listed here we think there 's a great opportunity for academic centers to participate in this earliest 
 conceptually tricky and creative discipline of prototype drug discovery
 so what next we have this molecule but it 's not a pill yet it 's not orally 
 we need to fix it so we can deliver it to our patients and everyone in the lab  especially following the interaction with these patients feels quite compelled to deliver a drug substance based on this molecule  
 it 's
 's here where i 'd say that that we could use your help and your insights your collaborative participation unlike a drug company  
 we don 't have a pipeline that we can deposit these molecules into we don 't have a team of salespeople and marketeers to tell us how to position this drug against the other 
 what we do have is the flexibility of an academic center to work with competent 
 motivated enthusiastic  hopefully well funded people to carry these molecules forward into the clinic while preserving our ability to share the prototype drug worldwide
 this molecule will soon leave our benches and go into a small start up company called tensha therapeutics and really this is the fourth of these molecules to kind of graduate from our little pipeline of drug discovery 
 two of which
 a topical drug
 for lymphoma of the skin and an oral substance for the treatment of multiple myeloma will actually come to the
  trial in july of this year for us a major and exciting milestone 
 i want to leave you with just two ideas
 the first is if anything is unique about this research  it 's less the science than the strategy this for us was a social experiment
 an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and honest at the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research as we
  could be this string of letters and numbers and symbols and parentheses
 that can be texted i suppose or twittered worldwide 
 is the chemical identity of our pro compound it 's the information that we most need from pharmaceutical companies the information on how
 these early prototype drugs might work yet this information is largely a secret and so we
  seek really to download from the amazing successes of the computer science industry two principles that of open source and that of crowdsourcing
 to quickly responsibly
 accelerate the delivery of targeted therapeutics to patients with cancer  now the business model
 involves all of you this research is funded by the public  it 's funded by foundations
  one thing i 've learned in boston is that you people will do anything for cancer and i love that you bike across the state you walk up and down the river 
 laughter i 've never seen really anywhere this unique support for cancer research  and so i want to thank you
 for your
 participation your collaboration and most of all for your confidence in our ideas
