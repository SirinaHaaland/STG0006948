  i promise there won 't be too much of me talking and a lot of derek playing but i thought it would just be nice to recap on how derek got to where he is today 
 it 's amazing now because he 's so much bigger than
 but when derek was born he could have fitted on the palm of your hand he was born three and a half months premature  and
 really it was a fantastic fight for him
 to survive he had to have a lot of oxygen and that affected your eyes derek and also the way you understand language and the way you understand the world 
 but that was the end of the bad news because when derek
 came came home from the hospital
  his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny
 who was going to look after you derek really for the rest of your childhood 
 and nanny 's great insight really was to think 
 here 's a child who can 't see music must be the thing for for derek and sure enough she sang  or as derek called it warbled 
 to him
 for him for his first few years of life and i think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after
  every day that made him think maybe you know in his brain something was stirring some sort of musical
 gift  here 's a little picture of derek going up now when you were
 with your nanny now nanny 's great other insight was to think perhaps we should get derek something
  and sure enough she dragged this little
 keyboard out of the loft  
 never thinking really that anything much would come of it  
 but derek your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bashed it  bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break but
 out of all the bashing after a few months emerged the most fantastic music  and
 i think there was just a miracle moment really derek when you realized that all the sounds you hear
  hear in the world out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard that was the great eureka moment 
 now not being able to see meant of course that you taught yourself derek paravicini i taught myself to play ao you did teach yourself to play and
 as a consequence playing the piano for you derek was a lot of knuckles and karate chops and even a bit of nose going on in there  and now here 's what
  nanny did also do was to press the record button on one of those little
 early tape recorders that they had  and this is a wonderful tape now of derek playing when you were four years old
  little child who can 't see can 't really understand much about the world
  has no one in the family who plays an instrument and yet he taught himself to play that and as you can see from the picture there was quite a lot of body action going on while you were playing derek 
 now  along
 derek and i met when he was four and a half years old and
 at first derek i thought you were mad to be honest because when you played the piano you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard  and also you had this little habit of
 hitting me out of the way so as soon as i tried to get near the piano
  shoved off and having said to to your dad nic that i would try to teach you i was then slightly confused as to how i might go about that if i wasn 't
 allowed near the piano  
 but after a while i thought well the only way is to just pick you up 
 shove derek over to the other side of the room  and in the ten seconds that i got before derek came back  i could just play something very quickly for him to learn  
 and in the end
  i think you agreed that we could actually have some fun playing the playing the piano together as you can see there 's me in my
 my early pre marriage days with a brown beard  and little derek concentrating there 
 i just realized this is going to be recorded isn 't it right okay 
 now then by the age of ten derek really had taken the world by storm  this is a photo of you
  playing at the barbican with the royal philharmonic pops basically it was it was just
 an exciting journey really and in those days derek you didn 't speak very much and so
 there was always a moment of tension as to whether you 'd actually understood what it was we were going to play and whether you 'd play the right piece in the right key and all that kind of thing but
 the orchestra were wowed as well and the press of the world were fascinated by your
 to play these fantastic pieces now the question is how do you do it derek and hopefully we can show the audience
 now how it is you do what you do 
 i think that one of the first things that happened when when you were very little derek was that
 by the time you were two your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults  
 and so whenever you heard
  any note at all if i just play a random note
 you knew instantly what it was and you 'd got the ability as well to find that note
 on the piano  now that 's called perfect pitch and
 some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes in the middle of the piano
  your ear is so much more than that if i just put the microphone down for a bit i 'm going to play a cluster of notes 
 those of you who can see will know how many notes but derek of course can 't not only
 can you say how many notes it 's being able to play them all at the
  that ability that ability to hear simultaneous sounds not only just single sounds but when a whole orchestra is playing derek you can hear
  through all those hours and hours of practice reproduce those on the keyboard that makes you  i think is the basis of all your ability  
 now then 
 it 's no use having
 that kind of raw ability without the technique  and luckily derek you decided that once we did start learning you 'd let me help you learn all the scale fingerings so for
  and in the end you got so quick that things like flight of the bumblebee
 playing things like this
 the
  thing was with all those scales derek  you could not
  in your brain derek is this amazing musical computer that can instantly
 recalibrate  recalculate all the pieces in the world that are out there most pianists would have a heart attack if you said 
 sorry do you mind playing ' flight of the bumblebee ' in b minor instead of a minor 
 as we went on in fact  the first time derek  you played that with an orchestra  you 'd learned the version that you 'd learned and then the orchestra
  did have a different version so
 while we were waiting in the two hours before the rehearsal and the concert derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to
 play it with the orchestra  fantastic chap the other
 wonderful thing about you is memory dp memory ao your memory is truly amazing and every concert we do we ask the audience
  not brave at all because if you ask for something that derek doesn 't know  you 're invited to come and sing it first and then he 'll pick it up 
 so just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish  but seriously would anyone like to
 the
  you may think thirteen hours is a long time to keep talking but derek does it effortlessly  now then 
 laughter but in america they 've coined this term the human ipod for derek  which i think is just missing the point really because derek
  much more than an ipod you 're a fantastic creative musician  and i think that was nowhere clearer to see really than when we went to slovenia  
 and someone
 in a longer concert we we tend to get people joining in and this person very very nervously came onto the stage
  i should really get derek 's manager to come and play it he 's sitting there
  okay
 the
 thought that all the world was a piano so whenever art tatum plays something it sounds like there 's three pianos in the room  and here is derek 's take on art tatum
