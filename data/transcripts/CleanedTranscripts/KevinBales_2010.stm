  you know for me the
 interest in contemporary forms of slavery started with a leaflet that i picked up in london it was the early ' 90s 
 and i was at a public event  i saw this leaflet and it
  there are millions of slaves in the world today and i thought no way 
 no way and i 'm going to admit to hubris 
 because i also i 'm going to admit to you i also thought how can i be like a  hot shot young full professor who teaches human rights and not know this so it can 't be true 
 well  if you teach if you worship in the temple of learning do not mock the gods because they will take you
 fill you with curiosity and desire  and drive you drive you with a passion to change things  
 i went out and did a lit review three thousand articles on the key word slavery two turned out to be about contemporary only two 
 all the rest were historical they were press pieces and they were full of outrage  they were full of speculation they were anecdotal
  no solid information  
 so i began to do a research project of my own i went to five countries around the world i looked at slaves i met slaveholders  and i looked very deeply into 
  businesses because this is an economic crime people do not enslave people
 to be mean to them they do it to make a profit  and i 've got to tell you what i found out in the
  world in
 in four different continents was depressingly familiar like this  
 agricultural workers in africa  whipped and beaten  showing us how they were beaten in the fields before they escaped from slavery and met up with our film crew 
  and i want to be very clear  
 i 'm talking about real slavery  this is not about lousy marriages this is not about jobs that suck this is about people who can not walk away people who 
  are forced to work without pay people who are operating twenty four seven under a threat of violence
  history  
 now  where is it well 
 this map in the sort of redder  yellower colors are the places with the highest densities of slavery 
 but in fact that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can 't find any cases of slavery and you might notice that it 's only iceland and greenland
 where we can 't find any cases of enslavement around the world  we 're also particularly interested and looking
  very carefully at places where
 slaves are being used to perpetrate extreme environmental destruction 
 around the world  slaves are used to destroy the environment cutting down trees in the amazon destroying
 forest areas in west africa  mining and spreading mercury around in places like ghana and the congo  destroying the coastal
 ecosystems in south asia  it 's a pretty harrowing linkage between what 's happening to our environment and what 's happening to our human rights 
 now how on earth did we get to a situation like this where we have twenty seven million people in slavery in the year two thousand and ten  that 's double the number that came out of africa in the entire transatlantic slave trade  
 well  it builds up with these
  factors they are not causal they are actually supporting factors  one we all know about the population explosion the world goes from two billion people to almost seven billion people in the last fifty years 
 being numerous does not make you a slave add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world 
 caused by civil wars ethnic conflicts  kleptocratic governments disease you
  it you know it  we understand how that works in some countries all of those things happen at once like sierra leone a few years ago 
 and push enormous parts about a billion people in the world in fact as we know live on the edge  live in situations where they don 't have
 any opportunity and are usually even destitute but that doesn 't make you a slave either what it takes to turn a person who is
  destitute and vulnerable into a slave is the absence of the rule of law  
 if the rule of law is sound it protects the poor and it protects the vulnerable 
 but if corruption creeps in and people don 't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law then if you can use violence if you can use violence with impunity you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery
  that is precisely what has happened around the world  though for a lot of people
 the people who step into slavery today don 't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head  
 they come into slavery because someone has asked them this question 
 all around the world i 've been told an almost identical story people say i was home
  home someone came into our village  they stood up in the back of a truck they said ' i 've got jobs who needs a job ' and they did exactly what you or i would do in the same situation  
 they said that guy looked sketchy  i was suspicious  but my children were hungry  
 we needed medicine i knew i had to do anything i could to earn some money to support the people i care
 they climb into the back of the truck they go off with the person who recruits them 
 ten miles one hundred miles one thousand miles later  they find themselves in dirty dangerous demeaning work  
 they take it for a little while  but when they try to leave  bang the hammer comes down and they discover they 're enslaved 
  that kind of slavery is again pretty much what slavery has been all through human history  
 but there is one thing that is particularly remarkable and novel about slavery today  
 and that is a complete collapse
 in the price of human beings
 expensive in the past  dirt cheap now  even the business programs have started picking up on this  i just want to share a little clip for you
  guaranteed here as always as we get macro and talk commodities continuing here in the studio with our guest michael o 'donohue head of commodities at four continents capital management  and we 're also joined by brent lawson from lawson frisk securities brent lawson 
 happy to be here d 
 good to have you with us brent now gentlemen  
 where is your money going this year bl 
 well daphne we 've been going short on gas and oil recently and casting our net just a little bit wider  we really like the human being story a lot 
 if you look at a long term chart 
 prices are at historical lows and yet global demand for forced labor is still real strong  so that 's a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on d 
 michael what 's your take on the people story are you interested michael o 'donoghue oh definitely non voluntary labor 's greatest advantage as an asset is the endless supply
  not about to run out of people no other commodity has that bl daphne if i may draw your attention to one thing that is that private equity has been sniffing around and that tells me that this market is about to explode 
 africans and indians as usual south americans and eastern europeans in particular are on our buy list d interesting  micheal bottom line what do you
  recommending to our clients a buy and hold strategy there 's no need to play the market there 's a lot of vulnerable people out there it 's
 very exciting d exciting stuff indeed gentlemen thank you very much kevin bales 
 okay you figured it out that 's a spoof though i enjoyed watching your jaws drop
 drop  drop  until you got it mtv europe
 worked with us and made that spoof and they 've been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction
  which i think is kind of fun here 's the reality 
 the price of human beings across the last four thousand years in today 's money has averaged about forty thousand dollars  capital purchase items you can see that the lines cross 
  when the population explodes  the average price of a human being today around the world is about ninety dollars
  more expensive in places like north america  slaves cost between three thousand to eight thousand dollars in north america  but i could take you places in india or nepal where human beings can be acquired for five or ten dollars
 they key here is that
 people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like styrofoam cups you buy them cheaply you use them you crumple them up
  and then when you 're done with them you just throw them away  
 these young boys are in nepal  
 they are basically the transport system on a quarry run by a slaveholder there are no roads there  so they carry loads of stone on their backs often of their own weight up and down the himalaya mountains 
 one of their mothers said to us you know we can 't survive here  but we can 't even seem to die either
  it 's a horrible situation and if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this it 's that there are also in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved there are ex slaves who are now working to free others 
 or we say  frederick douglass is in the house  i don 't know if you 've ever had a daydream about wow what would it be like to meet harriet tubman what would it be like to meet frederick douglass i 've got to say one of the most exciting parts about my job is that i get to
  and i want to introduce you to one of those his name is james kofi annan he was a slave child in ghana enslaved in the fishing industry and he now  after escape and 
  building a new life has formed an organization that we work closely with to go back and get people out of slavery  
  james and our
 country director in ghana  emmanuel otoo are now receiving regular death threats because the two of them managed to get convictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers
  for the very first time in ghana for enslaving people from the fishing industry for enslaving children 
  everything i 've been telling you i admit is pretty
 disheartening  
 but there is actually a very positive side to this  
 and that is this the twenty seven million people who are in slavery today  that 's a lot of people but it 's also the smallest fraction of the global population to ever be in slavery 
 and likewise the forty billion dollars that they generate into the global economy each year is
  tiniest proportion of the global economy to ever be represented by slave labor 
 slavery illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our global society  
 and
 in a way without us even noticing has ended up standing on the precipice of its own extinction  waiting for us to give it a big boot
 and knock it
  and get rid of it 
 and it can be done now  if we do that if we put the resources and the focus to it what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery  
 well  first before i even tell you the cost i 've got to be absolutely clear  we do not buy people out of slavery  
 buying people out of slavery is like paying a burglar to get your television back  it 's abetting a crime 
  costs some money 
 liberation and more importantly all the work that comes after liberation  it 's not an event  it 's a process  it 's about helping people to build lives of dignity stability economic autonomy citizenship  
 well  
 amazingly in places like india where costs are very low  that family that three generation family that you see there
 who were in hereditary slavery so that granddad there
 was born a baby into slavery
 but the total cost amortized across the rest of the work was about one hundred and fifty dollars to bring that family out of slavery and then take them through a two year process to build a stable life of citizenship and education 
 a boy in ghana rescued from fishing slavery  about four hundred
  in the united states north america much more expensive legal costs medical costs we understand that it 's expensive here about thirty thousand dollars but most of the people
 in the world in slavery live in those places
 where the costs are lowest  and in fact the global average is about what it is for
 ghana and that means when you multiply it up the estimated cost of not just freedom but sustainable freedom
 for the entire
  people on the planet in slavery is something like ten point eight billion dollars
 what americans spend on potato chips and pretzels what seattle is going to spend on its light rail system 
 usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans or in the last holiday period when we bought gameboys and ipods and other tech gifts for people we spent
 ten point eight billion dollars
 intel 's fourth quarter earnings ten point eight billion  
 it 's not a lot of money at the global level in fact  it 's peanuts 
 and the great thing about it is that it 's not money down a hole there is a freedom dividend when you let people out of slavery to work for themselves are they motivated  
 they take their kids out
  going to have stuff we 've never had before like three squares 
 medicine when we 're sick  clothing when we 're cold they become consumers and producers and local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly  
 that 's important all of that about how we rebuild sustainable freedom because we 'd never want to repeat what happened in this country in
  up out of slavery and then dumped dumped without political participation  decent education 
 any kind of real opportunity in terms of economic lives and then sentenced to generations of violence and prejudice and discrimination and america is still paying the price for the botched emancipation of
 that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch  and end up as second class citizens it 's just not going to happen
  this is what
 liberation really looks like 
 children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in ghana
 reunited with their parents and then taken with their parents back to their villages to rebuild their economic well being so that they become
 absolutely
 now  this woman lived in a village in nepal we 'd been working there about a month  they had just
 begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery  
 they 'd just begun to light up a little bit open up a little bit  but when we went to speak with her when we took this photograph  
 the slaveholders were still menacing us from the sidelines they hadn 't been really pushed back i was frightened we were frightened 
 we said to her are you worried are you upset she said no 
 because we 've got hope now  
 how could we not
  succeed she said when people like you from the other side of the world are coming here to stand beside us 
 okay  we have to ask ourselves are we willing to live in a world with slavery
  if we don 't take action we just leave ourselves open to have someone else jerk the strings that tie us to slavery in the products we buy and in our
  policies and yet if there 's one thing that every human being can agree on i think it 's that slavery should end
