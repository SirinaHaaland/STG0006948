  this is actually
 a painting that hangs at the countway library at harvard medical school 
 and it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted in the front you see actually joe murray getting the patient ready for the transplant while in the back room
 you see hartwell harrison the chief of
  urology at harvard actually harvesting the kidney the kidney was indeed the first organ ever to be transplanted to the human that was back in 
  years ago 
 yet we 're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges as many decades ago certainly many advances many lives saved  
 but we have a major shortage of organs
  last decade the number of patients waiting for a transplant has doubled  
 while at the same time the actual number of transplants has remained almost entirely flat 
 that really has to do with our aging population we 're just getting older  medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive  
 but as we age our organs tend to fail more so that 's a challenge not
  just for organs but also for tissues  trying to replace pancreas  trying to replace
 nerves that can help us with parkinson 's these are major issues this is actually
 a very stunning statistic every thirty seconds a patient dies from diseases
 that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement
 so  what can we do about it we 've talked about stem cells tonight 
 that 's a way to do it  
 but still ways to go to get stem cells into patients in terms of actual therapies for organs  
 wouldn 't it be great if our bodies could regenerate  
 wouldn 't it be great if we could actually harness the power of our bodies to actually heal ourselves
 's not really that foreign of a concept actually it happens on the earth every day  
 this is actually a picture of a salamander  
 salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate  you see here a little video  this is actually a limb injury in this
  and this is actually real photography  timed photography showing how that limb regenerates in a period of days  you see the scar form  
 and that scar actually grows out a new limb 
 so salamanders can do it  why can 't we  why can 't humans regenerate 
 actually we can regenerate your body
 has many organs and every single organ in your body
  body has a cell population that 's ready to take over at the time of injury it
 happens every day as you age  
 as you get older  your bones regenerate every ten years your skin regenerates every two weeks so your body is constantly regenerating  the challenge occurs when there is an injury
  at the time of injury or disease the body 's first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body
 it basically wants to fight off infection  and seal itself whether it 's organs inside your body or your skin 
 the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in to seal itself off from the outside 
 so how can we harness that power one of the ways that we do that is actually by
  using smart biomaterials 
 how does this work well on the left side here you see a urethra which was injured this is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body  
 and you see that it is injured  
 we basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials that you can actually use as a
  if you build that bridge  and you close off
 from the outside environment then you can create that bridge  and cells that regenerate in your body can then
 cross that bridge  and take that path that 's exactly what you see here it 's actually a smart biomaterial that we used to actually treat this patient  this was an injured 
  urethra on the left side we used that biomaterial in the middle  and then six months later on the right hand side you see this reengineered
  urethra turns out your body can regenerate  but only for small distances  
 the maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter 
 so we can use these smart biomaterials but only for about one centimeter to bridge those gaps so we do regenerate
  but for limited distances 
 what do we do now  if you have injury for larger organs  
 what do we do when we have injuries for structures which are much larger than one centimeter 
 then we can start to use cells  the strategy here is if a patient comes in to us with a diseased or injured organ you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ  less
  than half the size of a postage stamp 
 you can then tease that tissue apart and look at its basic components the patient 's own cells 
 you take those cells out grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities  and then we then use scaffold materials to the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse or your shirt  
 but actually these materials are fairly
  are designed to degrade once inside the body  it disintegrates a few months later it 's acting only as a cell delivery vehicle it 's bringing the cells into the body it 's allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue 
 and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away  
 and that 's what we did for this piece of muscle  this is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle we take the cells  we expand them we place the cells on the scaffold  and we then place
  scaffold back into the patient  
 but actually before placing the scaffold into the patient  we actually exercise it we want to make sure that we condition this muscle so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient that 's what you 're seeing here you 're seeing this muscle 
 actually exercising the muscle back and
  these are flat structures
 that we see here the muscle 
 what about other structures  this is actually an engineered blood vessel 
 very similar to what we just did but a little bit more complex here we take a scaffold  and we basically scaffold can be like a piece of paper here  
 and we can then tubularize this scaffold  and what we
  made up of two different cell types  we take muscle cells we paste or coat the outside with these muscle cells  very much like baking a layer cake if you will  
 you place the muscle cells on the outside  you place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside 
 you now have your fully seeded scaffold
  it has the same conditions as a human body thirty seven degrees centigrade 
 ninety five percent oxygen you then exercise it as what you saw on that tape  
 and on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered this is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain  and this is an x ray showing you the patent  functional blood vessel 
 more complex structures such as blood vessels urethras which i showed
  you they 're definitely more complex because you 're introducing two different cell types  but they are really acting mostly as conduits you 're allowing fluid or air to go through at steady states 
 they are not nearly as complex as hollow organs  hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity because you 're asking these organs to act on demand  
 so  the bladder is one
  same strategy we take a very small piece of the bladder less than half the size of a postage stamp  we then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components muscle and these 
 bladder specialized cells  we grow the cells outside the body in large quantities it takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ  we then take a scaffold that we shape like 
  a bladder  we coat the inside with these bladder lining cells we coat the outside with these muscle cells  we place it back
 time you take that piece of tissue  six to eight weeks later you can put the organ right back into the patient 
 this actually shows the scaffold the material is actually being coated with the cells  when we did the first clinical trial for these patients
 we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient we brought patients in six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery
  did x rays and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient 's size
 pelvic cavity for the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes small medium large and extra large 
 laughter it 's true  and i 'm sure everyone here wanted an extra large right 
  are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures  
 but there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it this is actually a heart valve which we engineered  
 and the way you engineer this this heart valve is the same strategy we take the scaffold we seed it with cells and you can now see here  the valve leaflets opening and closing  we exercise these prior to implantation 
 same strategy
  and then the most complex are the solid organs  for solid organs  they 're more complex because you 're using a lot more cells per centimeter  
 this is actually a simple solid organ like the ear it 's now being seeded with cartilage that 's the oven like device  once it 's coated it gets placed there and 
  then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold  this is actually digits that we 're engineering these are being layered one layer at a time first the bone we fill in the gaps
  with cartilage  we then start adding the muscle on top  and you start layering these solid structures again  fairly more complex organs but by far the most complex 
  solid organs are actually the vascularized  highly vascularized  a lot of blood vessel supply organs such as the heart 
  this is actually an example several strategies to engineer solid organs this is actually one of the strategies we use a printer  and instead of using ink  we use you just saw an inkjet cartridge 
 we just use cells  this is actually your typical desktop printer it 's actually printing this
 applause this technology was developed by tao 
  ju who worked at our institute and this is actually still of course experimental not for use in patients
  and we then can use very mild detergents to take all the cell elements out of these organs so for example on the left panel top panel you see a liver  
 we actually take the donor liver we use very mild detergents  and we by using these mild detergents we take all the cells out of the liver
  two weeks later
  we basically can lift this organ up it feels like a liver  we can hold it like a liver it looks like a liver  but it has no cells  
 all we are left with is the skeleton  if you will of the liver  all made up of collagen a material that 's in our bodies that will not reject we can use it from one patient to the next we then take this vascular structure
 and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply you can see actually that 's a fluoroscopy
  the organ 
 now you can see it start we 're injecting the contrast into the organ into this decellularized liver and you can see the vascular tree that remains intact  
 we then take the cells the vascular cells blood vessel cells we perfuse the vascular tree with the patient 's own cells  we perfuse the outside of the liver with the patient 's own liver cells  and we can then create functional livers and that 's actually what you 're seeing this
  still experimental  but we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure experimentally 
 for the kidney kidney as i talked to you about the first painting that you saw the first slide i showed you  
 ninety percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a kidney  
  another strategy we 're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together like an accordion if you will so we stack these wafers together using the kidney cells  and 
  then you can see these miniature kidneys that we 've engineered they are actually making urine  again small structures our challenge is how to make them larger  and that is something we 're working on right now at the institute 
  that i wanted to summarize for you then is what is a strategy that we 're going for in regenerative medicine 
 if at all possible  we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs  we are limited with distances right now but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time 
 if we cannot use smart biomaterials then we 'd rather use your very own
  because they will not reject we can take cells from you create the structure put it right back into you they will not reject and if possible we 'd rather use the cells from your very specific 
 organ  if you present with a diseased wind pipe we 'd like to take cells from your windpipe if you present with a diseased
  we don 't need to teach it to become another cell type so we prefer organ specific cells and today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body except for several which we still 
  need stem cells for like heart liver  nerve and pancreas and for those we still need stem cells  
  that will not reject
 and will not form tumors and we 're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago stem cells from the amniotic fluid  and the placenta which have those properties  
 so  at this point  i do want to tell you that
 some of the major challenges we have you know i just showed you this presentation everything looks so good everything works
  really are not that easy  some of the work you saw today was performed by over seven hundred researchers at our institute across a 20 year time span  so these are very 
  tough technologies once you get the formula right you can replicate it but it takes a lot to get there  
  he finally stops the runaway stage  and those are usually the basic scientists  the bottom is usually the surgeons 
 i 'm a surgeon so that 's not that funny 
 but actually method a is the correct approach and what i mean by that is that anytime we 've launched one of these technologies to the clinic
  sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients  and when we launch these technologies to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question 
 are you ready to place this in your own loved one your own child your own family member  and then we proceed because our main goal of course is first to do no harm 
 i 'm going to show you now
  a very short clip it 's a five second clip of a patient who received one of the engineered organs  we started implanting some of these structures over fourteen years ago 
  so we have patients now walking around with organs  engineered organs for over ten years as well i 'm going to show a clip of one young lady  she had a spina bifida defect a spinal cord abnormality she did not have a normal bladder this is a segment from cnn
  five seconds this is a segment that sanjay gupta actually took care of
