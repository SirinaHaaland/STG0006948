  we always hear that texting is a scourge 
 the idea is that texting spells the decline and fall of any kind of serious literacy or at least writing ability among young people in the united states and now the whole world today  
 the fact of the matter is
  that it just isn 't true  
 and it 's easy to think that it is true  but in order to see it in another way in order to see that actually texting is a miraculous thing not just energetic  but a miraculous 
  thing a kind of emergent complexity that we 're seeing happening right now we have to pull the camera back for a bit and look at what language really is in which case one thing that we see
 is that texting is not writing at all what do i mean by that 
 basically if we think about language language has existed for perhaps one hundred and fifty thousand years at least eighty thousand years  and what it arose as
  is speech people talked  that 's what we 're probably genetically specified for that 's how we use language most writing
  is something that came along much later and as we saw in the last talk there 's a little bit of controversy as to exactly when that happened but according to traditional estimates if 
 humanity had existed for twenty four hours then writing only came along at about eleven  seven  p m that 's how much of a latterly thing writing is  so first there 's speech and then writing
  comes along as a kind of artifice now don 't get me wrong writing has certain advantages when you write because it 's a conscious process because you can look 
  backwards you can do things with language that are much less likely if you 're just talking 
  engagement lasted above twelve hours till the graduate retreat of the persians was changed into a disorderly flight of which the shameful example was given by the principal leaders and the surenas himself that 's beautiful  but let 's face it  nobody talks that way 
 or
 at least they shouldn 't if they 're interested in reproducing
  human being speaks casually casual speech is something quite different linguists have actually shown that when we 're speaking casually in an unmonitored way we tend to speak in 
 word packets of maybe seven to ten words you 'll notice this if you ever have occasion to record yourself or a group of people talking that 's what speech is like speech is much looser  it 's much more telegraphic
  it 's much less reflective very different from writing  so we naturally tend to think because we see language written so often that that 's what language is  but actually what language is is speech they are two things 
 now of course as history has gone by  it 's been natural for there to be a certain amount of bleed between speech and writing
  distant era now it was common when one gave a speech to basically talk like writing  so i mean the kind of speech that you see someone giving in an old movie where they clear their throat and they go 
 ahem ladies and gentlemen and then they speak in a certain way which has nothing to do with casual speech  it 's formal it uses long sentences like this gibbon one  it 's basically talking like you write
  and so for example we 're thinking so much these days about lincoln because of the movie the gettysburg address was not the main meal of that event for two hours before that 
 edward everett spoke on a topic that frankly  cannot engage us today and barely did then the point of it was to listen to him speaking
  like writing ordinary people stood and listened to that for two hours it was perfectly natural that 's what people did then speaking like writing well if you can speak like writing then 
 logically it follows that you might want to also sometimes write like you speak the problem was just that in the material mechanical sense that was harder 
 back in the day for the simple reason that materials don 't lend themselves to it it 's almost impossible to do that with your hand except in shorthand and then communication
  is limited on a manual typewriter it was very difficult and even when we had electric typewriters or then computer keyboards the fact is that even if you can type easily enough to keep up with 
  the pace of speech more or less you have to have somebody who can receive your message quickly once you have things in your pocket that can receive that message then you have the conditions that allow that we can write like we speak 
  's where texting comes in and so texting is very loose in its structure no one thinks about capital letters or punctuation when one texts 
 but then again do you think about those things when you talk no and so therefore why would you when you were texting what texting is  despite the fact that it involves the
 brute mechanics of something that we call writing is fingered speech that 's what texting is now we can write the way we talk  
 and it 's a very interesting thing  but nevertheless easy to think that still it represents some sort of decline we see this general bagginess of the structure 
 the lack of concern with rules and the way that we 're used to learning on the blackboard
 so we think that something has gone wrong  it 's a very natural sense  
 but the fact of the matter is that what is going on is a kind of emergent complexity that 's what we 're seeing in this fingered 
  speech and in order to understand it what we want to see is the way in this new kind of language
  we generally think of as meaning laughing out loud and of course  theoretically it does and if you look at older texts then people used it to actually indicate laughing 
  out loud  but if you text now or if you are someone who is aware of
  the substrate of texting the way it 's become you 'll notice that lol does not mean laughing out loud anymore it 's evolved into something that is much subtler 
 this is an actual text that was done by a non male person of about twenty years old not too long ago i love the font you
  gmail is being slow right now now if you think about it that 's not funny no one 's laughing 
 and yet there it is  so you assume there 's been some kind of hiccup then susan says lol i know again more guffawing than we 're used to when you 're talking about
 these inconveniences  so julie
 says i just sent you an email susan lol i see it very funny people if that 's what lol means this julie says
  so what 's up susan lol i have to write a ten page paper she 's not amused let 's think about it 
 lol is being used in a very particular way it 's a marker of empathy it 's a marker of accommodation we linguists call things like that pragmatic particles any spoken language that 's used by real people has them if you happen to speak
  that you use at the end of a lot of sentences if you listen to the way black youth today speak think about the use of the word yo whole dissertations could be written about it and probably are being written about it 
 a pragmatic particle  that 's what lol has gradually become  it 's a way of using the language between actual people 
 party slash networking session that 's kind of like what we 're at slash is used in a very different way in texting among young people today  
  it 's used to change the scene so for example this sally person says so i need to find people to chill with and jake says haha you could write a dissertation about haha too but we don 't have time for that haha so you 're going by yourself why
  program at nyu jake haha slash i 'm watching this video with suns players trying to shoot with one eye the slash is interesting i don 't really even know what jake is talking about after that but you notice that
 he 's changing the topic now that seems kind of mundane but think about how in real life if we 're having a conversation and we want to change the topic there are ways of doing it gracefully you don 't just zip right into it
  pat your thighs and look wistfully off into the distance or
 you 'll say something like hmm makes you think when it really didn 't but what you 're really 
 what you 're really trying to do is change the topic  you can 't do that while you 're texting and so ways are developing of doing it within this medium all spoken languages have what a linguist calls a new information marker or
  two or three texting has developed one from this slash so we have a whole battery of new constructions that are developing 
 and yet it 's easy to think  well something is still wrong there 's a lack of structure of some sort it 's not as sophisticated as the
  language of the wall street journal well the fact of the matter is look at this person in one thousand nine hundred and fifty six and this is when texting doesn 't exist i love lucy is still on the air 
  many do not know the alphabet or multiplication table  cannot write grammatically we 've heard that sort of thing before not just in 
  seventeen connecticut schoolteacher one thousand nine hundred and seventeen this is the time when we all assume that everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect because the people on downton abbey are articulate
  like that so 
 from every college in the country goes up the cry ' our freshmen can 't spell can 't punctuate ' and so on  you can go even further back than this it 's the president of harvard it 's 
  there 's no electricity people have three names bad spelling incorrectness as well as inelegance of expression in
  and he 's talking about people who are otherwise well prepared for college studies you can go even further back 
  some long lost superintendent of schools is upset because of what he has for a long time noted with regret the almost entire neglect of the original blah blah blah blah blah  or you can go all the way 
 and there 's this poor man who doesn 't like the way people are speaking latin as it happens he was writing about what had become french and so  there are
  always 
 there are always people worrying about these things and the planet somehow seems to keep spinning  and so
 the way i 'm thinking of texting these days is that what we 're seeing is a whole new way of writing that young people are
  which they 're using alongside their ordinary writing skills and that means that they 're able to do two things increasing evidence is that being bilingual is 
  cognitively beneficial  that 's also true of being bidialectal that 's certainly true of being bidialectal in terms of your writing  and so texting actually is evidence 
 of a balancing act that young people are using today not consciously of course but it 's an expansion of their linguistic repertoire
  simple if somebody from one thousand nine hundred and seventy three looked at what was on a dormitory message board in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three the slang would have changed 
  a little bit since the era of love story but they would understand what was on that message board take that person from one thousand nine hundred and ninety three not that long ago this is bill and ted 's excellent
  those people take those people and they read a very typical text written by a 20 year old today often they would have no idea what half of it meant because a whole 
 new language has developed among our young people doing something as mundane as what it looks like to us when they 're batting around on their little devices  so in closing
  first thing i would ask is whether david simon had done a sequel to the wire i would want to know and
 i really would ask that
 and then i 'd want to know actually what was going on on downton abbey that 'd be the second thing  and then the third thing would be please show me a sheaf of texts written by 16 year old girls
 i would want to know where this language had developed since our times and ideally i would then send them back to you and me now so we could examine this linguistic miracle happening right under our noses  thank you very much
