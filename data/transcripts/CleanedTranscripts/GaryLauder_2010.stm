  i only have three minutes so i 'm going to have to talk fast and it will use up your spare mental cycles so multitasking may be hard 
 so twenty seven years ago i got a traffic ticket that got me thinking i 've had some
  think it over  and
 energy efficiency is more than just about the vehicle it 's also about the road road design makes a difference particularly intersections of which there are two types signalized and unsignalized which means stop signs 
 fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections  roundabouts are much better a study of of twenty four intersections has found
 crashes drop forty percent from when you convert a traffic light into a
  fatal crashes down ninety percent
 but that 's just safety what about time and gas so traffic keeps flowing so that means less braking which means less accelerating less gas and less pollution  
 less time wasted and that partly accounts for europe 's better efficiency than we have in the united states  
 so  unsignalized intersections meaning stop signs they save many lives  but there 's an
  excessive proliferation of them  small roundabouts are starting to appear
 this is one in my neighborhood and they are much better better than traffic lights better than four way stop signs they 're expensive to install  but they are more expensive not 
  to so we should look at that but they are not applicable in all situations so take for example the three way intersection 
  here 's one there 's another one which i studied cars rarely appear on that third road  
 and so the question is what does that cost us that intersection i looked at had about three thousand cars per day in each direction and so that 's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of that 's five cents each  and times three 
  thousand cars per day that 's $ fifty one thousand per year that 's just the gasoline cost there is also pollution wear on the car and time what 's that time worth well 
  an hour 
 that is sixty thousand per year add that together with the gas and it 's $ one hundred and twelve thousand per year just for that sign in each direction  discount that back to the present  at five percent 
 over two million dollars for a stop sign in each direction  now 
 if you look at what that adjacent property is
  you could actually buy the property cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line and then
 sell it off again and you 'd still come out ahead 
 so it makes one wonder why is it there i mean  why is there that stop sign in each direction  because it is saving lives so is there a better way to accomplish that goal the answer is to enable cars 
  to come in from that side road safely because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they 're waiting forever a long queue could form
 signs so there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs stop signs were invented in one thousand nine hundred and fifteen yield signs in one thousand nine hundred and fifty but that 's all we got  
 so  why not use a yield sign well the meaning of yield is you must yield the right of way that means that if there are five cars waiting you have to wait till they all go  then you go it lacks the notion of alternating or taking turns  
 and it 's always on the
  allowing the major one to have primacy so it 's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign you couldn 't suddenly tell everyone ok remember what you used to do at yield signs now do something different that would not work  
 so
  what the world needs now is a new type of sign 
 so
 you 'd have a little instruction below it you know for those who didn 't see the public service announcements  and it merges the stop sign and yield signs it 's kind of shaped like a t as in taking turns and
  uncertainty results in caution when people come to an unfamiliar situation they don
