  thank you so much everyone from ted and chris and amy in particular i cannot believe
 i 'm here i have not slept in weeks neil and i were sitting there comparing how little we 've slept
 in anticipation for this i 've never been so nervous and i do this when i 'm nervous i just realized
 so 
 i 'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called eight hundred and twenty six valencia and then i 'm going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things back in about two thousand  i was
 was living in brooklyn  i was trying to finish my first book i was wandering around dazed every day because i wrote from
  to five a m so i would walk around in a daze during the day i had no mental acuity to speak of during the day  but i had
 flexible hours in the brooklyn neighborhood that i lived in park slope there are a lot of writers it 's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to
 normal people  meanwhile i had
 grown up around a lot
  my mom was a teacher my sister became a teacher
 and after college so many of my friends went into teaching and so
 i was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were and they were really sort of the most hard working and constantly inspiring people i knew but i knew so many of the things they were up against so many of the
 the struggles they were dealing with and one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools
 were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level
  in their reading and writing in particular  now so many of these students had come from households where english isn 't spoken in spoken in the home  where
 a lot of them have different special needs learning disabilities
 and of course they 're working in schools which sometimes and very often are under funded and so
 they would talk to me about this and say you know what we really need is just more people more bodies more
  one on one attention more hours more
 expertise from people that have
 skills in english and can work with these students one on one now i would say well  why don 't you just work with them one on one and they would say well  we have five classes of thirty to forty students each 
 this can lead up to one hundred and fifty one hundred and eighty two hundred students
  how can we possibly give each student even one hour
 a week
 of one on one attention you 'd have to greatly
 multiply the workweek and clone the teachers and so
 we started talking about this and at the same time i thought about this massive group of people i knew writers editors journalists
 graduate students assistant professors you name it all these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the english word
  i hope to have an
 interest in the english language but i 'm not speaking it well right now i 'm
 trying that clock has got me but everyone that i knew had an interest in
 the primacy of the written word in terms of
 nurturing a democracy nurturing an enlightened life and so
  and their interest but at the same time there wasn 't a conduit that i knew of in my community to bring these two communities together so when i moved back to
 san francisco  we rented this building and the idea was to put mcsweeney 's
 mcsweeney 's quarterly that we published twice or three times a year and a few other magazines we 
 were going to move it into an office for the first time it used to be in my kitchen in brooklyn  we were going to move it into an office
 and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center so we thought we
 'll have all these writers and editors and everybody sort of a writing community coming into the office every day anyway  why don 't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school 
  get extra help on their written homework so you have basically no border between these two
  thirty p m the students flow in and you put down what you 're doing or you trade or you work a little bit later or whatever it is you give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood so 
 we had this place  we rented it the landlord was all for it we did this mural that 's a chris ware mural that basically
 explains the entire history of the printed word in mural form it takes a long time to
 digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road
  so we rented this space and everything was was great except the landlord said well the space is zoned for retail you have to come up with something you 've gotta sell something you can 't just
 have a tutoring center so we thought ha ha 
 really and we couldn 't think of anything necessarily to sell but we we did all the necessary research it used to be a weight room so there were rubber floors below acoustic tile ceilings and
 fluorescent lights we took all that down
  we found
 beautiful wooden floors whitewashed beams and it had the look while we were renovating this place somebody said you know it
 really kind of looks like the hull of a ship   and we looked around and somebody else said well you should sell
 supplies to the working buccaneer and so
 this is what we did so it made everybody laugh and we said there 's a point to that let 's sell
 pirate supplies 
 this is the pirate supply store  
 you see  this is sort of a sketch i did on a napkin a great carpenter built all this stuff and you see  we made it look sort of
 pirate supply like here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy
  we have the peg legs
 there that are all handmade
 and fitted to you up at the top you see the
 eyepatch display which is the the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch 
 and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night
 special occasions  bar mitzvahs and whatever  so we we opened this place 
 and this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in this is
  replacement eyes in case
 you lose one these are some signs that we have all over the place practical joking with pirates 
 while you 're reading the sign we pull a rope
 behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head that was just my one thing i said we had to have something that drops on people 's heads
  it became mop heads  and this is the fish theater  which is just a saltwater tank with three seats
 and then right behind it we set up this this space  which was the tutoring center so right there is the tutoring center and then behind the curtain were the mcsweeney 's offices where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that
 the kids would come in
 or we thought they would come in i should back up
 we opened up we spent months and months renovating this place  
 we had tables chairs computers everything i went to a dot com auction at a holiday inn in palo alto and i bought eleven  g4s with a stroke of a paddle
 people that i had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood  and we sat and at two thirty p m we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said free tutoring for your
 english related and writing related needs just come in  it 's all free and we thought oh they 're going to storm the gates they 're gonna love it 
  we sat at the tables we waited and waited and everybody was
 becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited really where nobody came in and then somebody
 alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a a trust gap because
 we were operating behind a pirate supply store 
 we never put it
  a woman named nineveh caligari a longtime san francisco educator she was teaching in mexico city 
 she had all the experience necessary knew everything about education  was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood
 i convinced her to move up from mexico city where she was teaching  she took over as executive director immediately  she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything and so suddenly it was actually full
 every day  and what we were trying to offer every day was one on one attention  the goal was to have a one to one ratio with every one of these students you know it 's been proven that thirty five to forty hours a year with one on one attention a student can get one grade level higher and so
 most of these students english is not spoken in the home  they come there many times their parents you can 't see
 but there 's a church pew that i bought in a berkeley auction right there the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored so that was the basis of it was one on one attention  and
 we found ourselves full every day with kids if you 're on valencia street within those few blocks
 at around two p m two thirty p m you will get run over often by the kids and their big backpacks or whatever actually running to this space  which is very strange
  because it 's school in a way 
 but there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different and the other thing was there was no stigma  kids weren 't going into the 
 or something like that it was eight hundred and twenty six valencia first of all it was a pirate supply store which is insane  and then secondly  
 there 's a publishing company in the back and so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often and
  so it became a tutoring center
 publishing center is what we called it and a writing center  they go in and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel because we had very gifted kids too so 
  there 's no stigma they 're all working next to each other it 's all a creative endeavor they 're seeing adults they 're modeling their behavior these adults they 're working in their field  they can lean over ask a question of one of these adults
  feeds on each other there 's a lot of cross pollination the only problem especially for the adults
 working at mcsweeney 's who hadn  't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up was that there was just the one bathroom 
 with like sixty kids a day this is a problem  but you know there 's something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day  working
  they go home they 're finished  they don 't stall  they don 't do their homework in front of the tv  they 're allowed to go home at five thirty p m enjoy their family  enjoy other hobbies get outside play 
 and that makes a happy family a bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community a bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world  so the key to it all is homework
  off with about twelve volunteers and then we had about
 fifty and then a couple hundred and we now have one thousand four hundred volunteers on our on our roster and we make it incredibly easy to volunteer the key thing is even if you only have a couple of hours 
  a month those two hours  shoulder to shoulder next to one student  concentrated attention shining this beam of light on their work on their
  because so many of the students have not had that ever before so we said even if you have two hours one sunday every six months it doesn 't matter that 's going to be enough so that 's partly why
  the tutor corps grew so fast then we said well what are we going to do with the space during the day because it has to be used before two thirty p m so we started bringing in classes during the day so every day there 's a field trip where they together create a book you can see it being typed
  is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing you just point a camera at a class and it always looks like this so
 this is one of the books that they do notice the title of the book the book that was never checked out titanic and
 the first line of that book is 
  once there was a book named cindy
 that was about the titanic so  meanwhile there 's an adult in the back typing this up  taking it completely seriously which
 blows their mind so then we still had more tutors to use  this is a shot of just some of the tutors during
 one of the events the teachers that we work with and everything is different to teachers they tell us what to do we went
  completely malleable you 're going to tell us the neighborhood 's going to tell us the parents are going to tell us the teachers are going to tell us how we 're most useful so then they said why don 't you come into the schools because
 what about the students that wouldn 't come to you necessarily who don 't have really active parents that are bringing them in 
 or aren 't close enough so then we started saying well we 've got one thousand four hundred people on our
 tutor roster let 's just put out the word a teacher will say i need twelve tutors for
  so we put that out on the wire one thousand four hundred tutors whoever can make it signs up  they go in about a half an hour before the class the teacher tells them what to do how to do it what their training is what their project is so far they work under the the teacher 's guide and it 's all in one big room  
 and that 's actually the brunt of what we do is people going straight from their workplace straight from home  straight into the classroom and working directly with the students so then we 're able to work with
 thousands and thousands of more students  then another school said
  if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day so this is the everett middle school
 writers ' room where we decorated it in buccaneer style  it 's right off the library  and there we serve all five hundred and twenty nine kids in this middle school
 this is their newspaper the straight up news that has an ongoing column
 from mayor gavin newsom in both languages english and spanish  so then
  day isabel allende wrote to us and said hey  why don 't you assign a book with high school students  i want them to write about how how to achieve peace in a violent world and so we went into thurgood marshall high school which is a school that we had worked with on some other things
 and we gave that assignment to the students and we said isabel allende is going to read all your essays at the end she 's going to
  going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form it 's going to be available
 in all the bookstores in the bay area and throughout the world on amazon and you name it so these kids worked harder than they 've ever worked on anything in their lives because there was that outside audience there was 
 isabel allende on the other end i think we had about one hundred and seventy tutors that worked on this book with them
  this is a book that you can find anywhere  so that led to a series of these you can see amy tan sponsored
 the next one i might get somewhere and this became an ongoing thing more and more books  now
 we 're sort of addicted to the book thing the kids will work harder than they 've ever worked in their life if they know it 's going to be permanent  know it 's going to be on a shelf know that nobody can diminish what they 've thought and said  
 that we 've honored their words honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of
 five drafts six drafts all this attention that we
  give to their thoughts and once they achieve that level once they 've written at that level they can never go back it 's absolutely transformative and so then they 're all sold in the store
 this is near the planks  we sell all the student books  where else would you put them right 
 so we sell ' em and then something weird had been happening
  with the stores the store actually even though we started out as just a gag the store actually made money  so
 it was paying the rent
 and maybe this is just a san francisco thing i don 't know i don 't want to judge  but people would come in and
 this was before the pirate movies and everything it was making a lot of money not a lot of money but it was paying the rent paying a full time staff member there there 's the ocean maps you can see
  it became a gateway to the community people would come in and say what the what is this i don 't want to swear on the web 
 is that a rule i don 't know they would say what is this and people would come in
 and and learn more about it and then right beyond there 's usually a little chain there right
  they would see the kids being tutored this is a field trip going on  and so they would be shopping  and they might be more likely to buy some lard or millet for their parrot or you know
 a hook or hook protector for nighttime all of these things we sell  
 so the store actually did really well but it brought in so many people teachers donors volunteers everybody because it was street level it was open to the public it wasn 't a non profit buried  you know on  the 30th floor of some building downtown
 was right in the neighborhood that it was serving and it was open all the time to the public so it became this sort of weird happy accident so all the people i used to know in brooklyn they said well why don 't we have a 
  place like that here and a lot of them had been former educators or would be educators so they combined with a lot of local designers local writers and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing they didn 't want to sell pirate supplies
  community in new york they opened the brooklyn superhero supply company 
 this is sam potts ' great design that did this and this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith 's shops that has to have every service they 've ever offered you know all over there 
 so they opened this place inside it 's like a costco for for superheroes
 all the supplies in kind of basic form  these
  all handmade these are all sort of repurposed other products or whatever all the packaging is done by sam potts  so then you have the villain containment unit where kids put their parents 
 you have the office this is a
 little vault you have to put your product in there it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism which you do  if you want to buy anything 
 and it limits really their sales
  some of the products 
 these are all handmade  
 this is a secret identity kit if you want to take on the identity of sharon boone one american female marketing executive from hoboken new jersey it 's a full dossier on everything you would need to know about sharon boone  
 so this is the capery
 where
 you get fitted for your
  and then you walk up these three steel graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans
 from every side and then you can see the the cape in action  there 's nothing worse than you know getting up there and
 the cape is bunching up or something like that 
 so then the secret door this is one of the shelves you don 't see when you walk in but it slowly opens you can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks it opens
  this is i just want to emphasize locally funded locally built all the designers all of the builders everybody was local all the time was pro bono i just came and visited and said yes you guys are doing great or whatever that was it  you can see the time in all five boroughs of new york in the back
  hours it 's very busy same principles one on one attention  complete devotion to the students ' work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas and
 this switch is flicked in their heads when they walk through those eighteen feet of this bizarre store right so it 's school but it 's not school it 's clearly not school even though they 're working shoulder to shoulder on tables
  this is one of the students khaled hamdan  you can read this quote addicted to video games and tv couldn 't concentrate at home  came in
 got this concentrated attention  and he couldn 't escape it  so  soon enough
  he was writing he would finish his homework early got really addicted to finishing his homework early it 's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it and to have it checked and to know he 's going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next
  so he got hooked on that and then he started doing other things he 's now been published in five books he co wrote a mockumentary about
 failed superheroes called super has beens he wrote a series
 on penguin balboa which is a fighting a
 boxing penguin
  and then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to five hundred people at symphony space at a benefit for eight hundred and twenty six new york so he 's there every day  he 's evangelical about it he brings his cousins in now there 's four family members that come in every day
 so i 'll go through really quickly this is l a the echo park time travel mart whenever you are we 're already then 
 this is sort of a 7 eleven for time travelers  so you see everything it 's exactly as a 7 eleven would be 
 leeches  mammoth chunks  they
  i 'm going to jump ahead 
 these are spaces that are only affiliated with us doing this same thing word st in pittsfield massachusetts  ink spot in cincinnati youth speaks san francisco california  which inspired us
 studio st louis
  austin bat cave in austin fighting words in dublin ireland started by roddy doyle this will be open in april now i 'm going to the ted wish
 is that okay all
 right i 've got a minute
 so the ted wish i wish that you you personally and every creative individual and organization you know will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you 'll then tell the story of how you got involved  so that within a year we have a thousand examples a thousand
  of transformative partnerships  profound leaps forward and these can be things that maybe you 're already doing i know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things i know that for a fact so  tell us these stories and inspire others on on the
 website  we created a website  i 'm going to switch to we and not i hope we hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools we hope that you will take the lead in partnering
  your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community always let the teachers lead the way they will tell you how to be useful i hope that you 'll step in and and 
  help out there are a million ways you can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers they 'll always tell you how to help so this is with  hot studio in san francisco they did this phenomenal job this website is already up  it 's already got a bunch of stories a lot of ideas  it 's called
  upon a school which is a great title i think this site will document every story every project that comes out of this conference
 and around the world  so you go to the website you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started
 hot studio did a great job in a very tight deadline  so  visit the site  if you have any questions you can ask this guy
