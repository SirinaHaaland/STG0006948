  you a little bit about irrational behavior not yours of course other people 's so
 after being at mit for for a few years i realized that
 writing academic papers
  how many of those you read but it 's not fun to read and often not fun to write even worse to write  so i decided to try and write something more fun and i
 came up with an idea that i would write a cookbook
  and the title for my cookbook was going to be dining without crumbs the art of eating over the sink 
 and it was going to be a look at life through the kitchen i was quite excited about this i was going to talk a little bit about research a little bit about the kitchen
 we do so much in the kitchen i thought this would be interesting i wrote a couple of chapters and took it to mit press and they said  
 cute but not for us go and find somebody else i tried other people and everybody said the same thing cute  not for us 
 until somebody said  look if you 're serious about this you have to write about your research first you have to publish something then you 'll get
 the opportunity to write something else if you really want to do it you have to do it 
 i said i don 't want to write about my research i do it all day long i want to write something a bit more free less constrained 
 and this person was very
 forceful and said look that 's the only way you 'll ever do it so i said okay if i have to do it i had a sabbatical 
  about my research if there 's no other way and then i 'll get to do my cookbook so i wrote a
 a book on my research and it turned out to be quite fun in two ways first of all i enjoyed
 writing but the more interesting thing was that i started learning from people
 it 's a fantastic time to write because there 's so much feedback you can get from people  people write to me about their personal experience and about their
  and even being here i mean the last few days  i 've known heights of obsessive behavior i never
 thought about 
 which i think is just fascinating  i will tell you a little bit about irrational behavior and i want to start by giving you some examples of visual illusion as a metaphor for rationality 
 so think about these two tables  and you must have seen this illusion  if i asked you what 's longer  the vertical line on the table on the left  or the horizontal
  line on the table on the right  which one seems longer  can anybody see anything but the left one being longer no right it 's impossible
 but the nice thing about visual illusion is we can easily demonstrate mistakes  so i can put some lines on it doesn 't help i can animate the lines and to the extent you believe
  i didn 't shrink the lines which i didn 't i 've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you 
  interesting thing about this is when i take the lines away  it 's as if you haven 't learned anything in the last minute  
 you can 't look at this and say now i see reality as it is right it 's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer our intuition is really 
  fooling us in a repeatable predictable consistent way and there is almost nothing we can do about it  aside from taking a ruler and starting to measure it
  's another one it 's one of my favorite illusions  what color is the top arrow pointing to audience brown dan ariely brown thank you the bottom one
 yellow  turns out they 're identical 
 can anybody see them as identical  very very hard i can cover the rest of the cube up  if i cover the rest of the cube you can see that they are
  if you don 't believe me you can get the slide later and do some arts and crafts and see
 that they 're identical  
 but again it 's the same story that if we take the background away  the illusion comes back
  there is no way for us not to see this illusion i guess maybe if you 're colorblind i don 't think you can see that 
 i want you to think about illusion as a metaphor 
 vision is one of the best things we do we have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision bigger than dedicated to anything else  we use our vision more hours of the day
 than anything else  we 're evolutionarily designed to use vision and if we have these predictable repeatable mistakes in vision  which we 're so good at 
 what are the chances we won 't make even more mistakes in something we 're not as good at 
 for example financial decision making 
 something we don 't have an evolutionary reason to do we don 't have a specialized part
  and we don 't do that many hours of the day the argument is in those cases it might be that we actually make many more mistakes  
 and worse not having an easy way to see them because in visual illusions we can easily demonstrate the mistakes in cognitive illusion it 's much much harder to demonstrate the mistakes to people 
 so i want to show you some cognitive
 in the same way  and this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences  it 's from
  paper by johnson and goldstein it basically shows the percentage of people who indicated they would be interested in donating their organs
 these are different countries in europe you basically see two types of countries 
 countries on the right that seem to be giving a lot and countries on the left that seem to giving very little or
  much less the question is why why do some countries give a lot and some countries give a little  
 when you ask people this question they usually think that it has to be about culture how much do you care about people  giving organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society how linked you are or maybe it 's about religion but if you look at this plot 
 you can see that countries that we think about as very similar  actually exhibit very different
  sweden is all the way on the right  and denmark which we think is culturally very similar is all the way on the left germany is on the left  and austria
 is on the right  the netherlands is on the left and belgium is on the right and finally depending on your particular version of
 european similarity you can think about the u k and france as either similar culturally or not
  but it turns out that with organ donation they are very different by the way the netherlands
  an interesting story you see the netherlands is kind of the biggest of the small group it turns out that they got to to twenty eight percent
 after mailing every household in the country a letter begging people to join this organ donation program
 you know the expression begging only gets you so far it 's twenty eight percent in
  but whatever the countries on the right are doing they 're doing a much better job than begging so what are they doing  
 turns out the secret has to do with a form at the dmv  
 and here is the story  
 the countries on the left have a form at the dmv that looks something like this check the box below if you want to participate in the organ donor program 
 and what happens 
 people don 't check
  and they don 't join  
 the countries on the right  the ones that give a lot have a slightly different form 
 it says check the box below if you don 't want to participate interestingly enough when people get this they again don 't check  but now they join 
 now think about what this means you
 know we wake up in the morning and we feel we make decisions we wake up in the morning and we open the closet we feel that we decide what to wear we open the refrigerator and we feel that we
  decide what to eat what this is actually saying is that many of these decisions are not residing within us  they are residing in the person who is designing that form
 when you walk into the dmv the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you 'll end up doing now
 it 's also very hard to intuit these results think about it for yourself how many of you believe that if you went to renew your license tomorrow  and you went to the dmv
  and you encountered one of these forms that it would actually change your own behavior  
 very hard to think that it would influence us we can say oh these funny europeans of course it would influence them but when it comes to us  
 we have such a feeling that we 're in the driver 's seat such a feeling that we 're in control and we are making the decision that it 's very hard to even accept the idea that we actually have an illusion of making a decision rather than an actual
  decision  now you might say 
 these are decisions we don 't care about in fact by definition these are decisions about something that will happen to us after we die  
 how could we care about something less than about something that happens after we die  
 so a standard economist somebody who believes in rationality would say you know what the cost of lifting the pencil and marking a v is higher than the possible benefit of the decision
 so that 's why we get this effect 
 but in fact  it 's not because it 's easy it 's not because it 's trivial  it 's not because we don 't care it 's the opposite  
 it 's because we care  it 's difficult and it 's complex and it 's so complex that we don 't know what to do  and because we have no idea what to do  we just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us i 'll
 give you one more example this is from a paper by redelmeier and
 and they said would this effect also happens to experts people who are well paid 
 experts in their decisions and who make a lot of them and they took a group of physicians  they presented to them a case study of a patient they said here is a patient
  farmer he 's been suffering from right hip pain for a while and
  they said to the physicians you decided a few weeks ago that nothing is working for this patient all these medications nothing seems to be working so you refer the patient for hip replacement therapy
  hip replacement okay so the patient is on a path to have his hip replaced 
 then they said to half of the physicians yesterday you reviewed the patient 's case and you realized that you forgot to try one medication you did not try ibuprofen  
 what do you do do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen or do you let him go and have hip
  replacement 
 well  the good news is that most physicians in this case decided to pull the patient and try ibuprofen  
 very good for the physicians to the other group of physicians they said  yesterday when you reviewed the case you discovered there were two medications you didn 't try out yet
 ibuprofen and piroxicam you have two medications you didn 't try out yet what do you do you let him go  or you pull him back and if you pull him back do you try ibuprofen or piroxicam which one
  now think of it this decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement but pulling him back all of the sudden it becomes more complex there is one more decision  
 what happens now the majority of the physicians now choose to let the patient go for a hip replacement  i hope this worries you by the way 
 when you go to see your physician the thing is that no physician would ever say
  piroxicam ibuprofen hip replacement let 's go for hip replacement but the moment you set this as the default it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing i 'll give you
 a couple of more examples on irrational decision making imagine i give you a choice do you want to go for a weekend to rome all expenses paid hotel
  a continental breakfast everything
 or a weekend in paris now  weekend in paris weekend in rome these are different things they have different food different culture different art
 imagine i added a choice to the set that nobody wanted  
 imagine i said a weekend in rome a weekend in paris  or having your car stolen 
 laughter it 's a funny idea because why would having your car stolen in this set influence anything
  but what if the option to have your car stolen was not exactly like this what if it was a trip to rome all expenses paid transportation breakfast but it
 doesn 't include coffee in the morning if you want coffee you have to pay for it yourself it 's two euros fifty 
 now in some ways  given that you can have rome with coffee
  why would you possibly want rome without coffee it 's like having your car stolen it 's an inferior option 
 but guess what happened  the moment you add rome without coffee rome with coffee becomes more popular  and people choose it  
 the fact that you have rome without coffee makes rome with coffee look superior and not just to rome without coffee even superior to paris 
  two examples of this principle 
 this was an ad in the economist a few years ago that gave us three choices 
 an online subscription for fifty nine dollars a print subscription for one hundred and twenty five dollars 
 or you could get both for one hundred and twenty five 
 now i looked at this and i called up the economist and i tried to figure out what they were thinking and they passed me from one person to
  until eventually i got to the
 person who was in charge of the website and i called them up and they went to check what was going on the next thing i know the ad is gone no explanation 
  so i decided to do the experiment that  i would have loved the economist to do with me  i took this and i gave it to one hundred mit students  i said what would you choose 
 these are the market shares
 most people wanted the combo deal  thankfully nobody wanted the dominant option that means our students can read
  but now if you have an option that nobody wants you can take it off right 
 so i printed another version of this where i eliminated the middle option i gave it to another one hundred students here is what happened 
 now the most popular option became the least popular and the least popular became the most popular
  what was happening was the option that was useless in the middle was useless in the sense that nobody
  wanted it  but it wasn 't useless in the sense that it helped people figure out what they wanted in fact  relative to the option in the middle  which was
 get get only the print for one hundred and twenty five the print and web for one hundred and twenty five looked like a fantastic deal  and as a consequence people chose it  
 the general idea here by the way is that we actually don 't know our preferences that well  and because we don 't know our preferences that
  susceptible to all of these influences from the external forces the defaults the particular options that are presented to us and so on 
 one more example of this 
 people believe that when we deal with physical attraction we see somebody and we know immediately whether we like them or not if we 're attracted or not this is why we have these  four minute dates
  so i decided to do this experiment with people
  was with people  i showed some people a picture of tom and a picture of jerry and i said who do you want to date  tom
 or jerry but for half the people i added an ugly version of jerry  i took photoshop and i made jerry
 slightly less attractive for the other people i added an ugly version of tom
  and the question was will ugly jerry and ugly tom help their respective 
 more attractive brothers  the answer was absolutely yes  when ugly jerry was around jerry was popular when ugly tom was around  tom was popular 
 this of course has two very clear implications for
 for life in general  if you ever go bar hopping who do you want to take with you
  what is the general point the general point is that when we think about economics we have this beautiful view
  of human nature 
 what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason we have this view of ourselves of others
  the behavioral economics perspective is slightly less 
 generous to people in fact in medical terms that 's
 our view 
 laughter but there is a silver lining the silver lining is i think kind of the
  reason that behavioral economics is interesting and and exciting 
 are we superman or are we homer simpson
 when it comes to building the physical world  we kind of understand our limitations  we build steps and we build these things that not everybody can use obviously 
 we understand our limitations
  and we build around them 
 but for some reason when it comes to the mental world when we design things like healthcare and retirement and stock markets we somehow forget the idea that we are limited 
 i think that if we understood our cognitive limitations in the same way we understand our physical limitations even though they don 't stare us in the face the same way we could design a better world and that i think is the hope
 of this thing
