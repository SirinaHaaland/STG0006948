  approximately thirty years ago  
 when i was in oncology at the children 's hospital in philadelphia 
 a father and a son walked into my office and they both had their right eye missing  
 and as i took the history it became apparent
 that the father and the
  son had a rare form of inherited eye tumor  retinoblastoma  and the father knew that he had passed that fate on to his son 
 that moment changed my life 
 it propelled me to go on and
 to co lead a team that discovered the first cancer susceptibility gene  and in the intervening decades since then there
  a seismic shift in our understanding of what goes on what genetic variations are sitting behind various diseases in fact for thousands of 
 human traits a molecular basis that 's known for that and for thousands of people every day there 's information that they gain about the risk of going on to get this disease or that disease 
  time if you ask has that impacted the efficiency how we 've been able to develop drugs the answer is not really 
 if you look at the cost of developing drugs how that 's done it basically hasn 't budged that 
 and so
 it 's as if we have the power to diagnose yet not the power to fully treat and there are two commonly given reasons for why that happens
  one of them is
 it 's early days we 're just learning the
 words the fragments the letters in the genetic code we don 't know how to read the sentences we don 't know how to follow the narrative 
 the other reason given is that most of those changes are a loss of function and it 's actually really hard to develop
 develop drugs that restore function  
 but today i want us to step back and ask a more fundamental question and ask what happens if we 're thinking about this maybe in the wrong context 
 we do a lot of studying of those who are sick
 and building up long lists of altered components 
 but maybe if what we 're trying to do is to develop therapies for prevention maybe what we should be doing
 is studying those who don 't get sick
 maybe we should be studying those that are well 
 a vast majority of those people are not necessarily carrying a particular genetic load or risk factor they 're not going to help us 
 there are going to be those individuals who are carrying a potential future risk they 're going to go on to get some symptom that 's not what we 're
  asking and looking for is are there a very few set of individuals who are actually walking around with the
 risk that normally would cause a disease but something in them  something hidden in them is actually protective and keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms  
 if you 're going to do a study like that you can imagine you 'd like to look at lots and lots of people
  have to go and have a pretty wide study  and we realized that actually one way to think of this is let us look at adults who are over forty years of age  
 and let 's make sure that we look at those who were healthy as kids they might have had individuals in their families who had had a childhood disease  but not necessarily  
  and let 's go and then screen those to find those who are carrying genes for childhood diseases  
  up going uh a little odd  
 what 's your evidence that this could be feasible i want to give you two examples 
 the first comes from san francisco  it comes from the 1980s and the 1990s and you may know the story where there were individuals who had very high levels of the virus hiv  they went
  but there was a very small set of individuals who also had very high levels of hiv  
 they didn 't get aids  
 and astute clinicians tracked that down and what they found was they were carrying mutations notice 
 they were carrying mutations from birth that were protective that were protecting them from going on to get aids you may also know that actually a line of therapy has been coming along based on that fact  
 second example more recent
  is elegant work done by helen hobbs 
 who said i 'm going to look at individuals who have very high lipid levels and i 'm going to try to find those people with high lipid levels
 who don 't go on to get heart disease and again what she found was some of those individuals had mutations that were protective
 from birth that kept them even though they had high lipid levels and you can see this is an
 interesting way of thinking about how you could develop preventive therapies 
 the project that we 're working on is called the resilience project a search for unexpected heroes because what we are interested in doing is saying can we find those rare individuals who might have these hidden protective
  in some ways think of it as a decoder ring a sort of resilience decoder ring that we 're going to try to to build  
 we 've realized that we should do this in a systematic way so we 've said  let 's take every single childhood inherited disease let 's take them all  and let 's pull them back a little bit by those 
 that are known to have severe symptoms where the parents the child those around them would know that they 'd gotten sick 
  of the genes where we know that there is a particular alteration
 that is known to be highly  penetrant to cause that disease  
 where are we going to look well we could look locally that makes sense but we began to think maybe we should look all over the world  maybe we should look not just here but in remote places where their might be a distinct
 genetic context there might be environmental
  factors that protect people and
 let 's look at a million individuals 
 now the reason why we think it 's a
 good time to do that now is in the last couple of years  there 's been a remarkable plummeting in the cost to do this type of analysis this type of data generation to where it actually costs less to do the data generation and analysis
 than it does to do the sample
  processing and the collection the other reason is that in the last five years there have been awesome tools things about network biology systems 
  biology that have come up that allow us to think that maybe we could decipher those positive outliers  
 this is interesting i would be glad to join your effort i would
 be willing to participate and they didn 't say where 's the mta they didn 't say where is my authorship they didn 't say 
 is this data going to be mine am i going to own it they basically said let 's work on this in an open
  at the icahn mount sinai school of medicine in new york and his team locked in that decoder key ring  and we began looking for
  because what we realized is 
 maybe we could just go and look at some existing samples to get some sense of feasibility maybe we could take two three percent of the project on and see if it was there and so we started asking 
  people such as hakon at the children 's hospital in philadelphia  we asked leif up in finland we talked to anne wojcicki at 
 and wang jun at bgi  and again
  often we 've analyzed them and we would be glad to go into our anonymized samples and see if we could find those that you 're looking for and instead of being twenty thousand or thirty thousand 
 last month we passed one half million samples that we 've already analyzed 
 so you must be going
  or two  we found dozens of these strong candidate unexpected heroes  
 so we think that the time is now to launch the beta phase of this project and actually start getting prospective individuals 
 basically all we need is information we need a swab of dna and a willingness to say what 's inside me
  i 'm willing to be
  most of us spend our lives  when it comes to health and disease  acting as if we 're voyeurs  
 we delegate the responsibility for the understanding of our disease for the treatment of our disease  
 to anointed experts 
 in order for us to get this project to work  we need individuals to step up in a different
  role
 and to be engaged 
 to realize this dream  this open  crowd sourced project 
 to find those unexpected heroes  
 to evolve from the current concepts of resources and constraints 
 to design those preventive therapies and to extend it beyond childhood diseases to go all
  to ways that we could look at alzheimer 's or parkinson 's we 're going to need us
 to be looking inside ourselves and asking what are our roles 
 what are our genes and looking within ourselves for information we used to say we should go to the outside to experts  and
 to be willing to share that with others  thank you very much
