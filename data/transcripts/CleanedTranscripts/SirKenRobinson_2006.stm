  been blown away by the whole thing in fact i 'm leaving
  there have been three themes running through the conference
 which are relevant to what i want to talk about one is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity
 in all of the presentations that we 've had and and in all of the people here  just the variety of it and the range of it
  the second is that it 's put us in a place where we have no idea what 's going to happen in terms of the future no idea
 how this may play out  i have an interest in education actually  what i find is everybody has an interest in education don 't you 
 i find this very interesting if you 're at a dinner party  and you say you work in education
 actually you 're not often at dinner parties
  you say you work in education you can see the blood run from their face
 because it 's one of those things that goes deep with people am i right like religion and money and other things so
 i have a big interest in education and i think we all do we have a huge vested interest in it  
 partly because it 's education that 's meant to take us into this future that we can 't grasp  
 if you think of it children
  nobody has a clue despite all the expertise that 's been on parade for the past four days what the world will look like in five years ' time 
 and yet we 're meant to be educating them for it  so the unpredictability i think is extraordinary  and the third part of this is that we 've all agreed nonetheless on the
 really
 extraordinary capacities that children have their capacities for
  innovation  i mean sirena last night was a marvel wasn 't she just seeing what she could do  and
 she 's exceptional  but i think she 's not
  so to speak exceptional in the whole of of childhood  what you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent 
 and my contention is all kids have tremendous talents  and we squander them pretty ruthlessly
  so i want to talk about education
  and i want to talk about creativity my contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy  
 and we should treat it with the same status
  a great story recently
 of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson she was six and she was at the back drawing and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention and in this drawing lesson she did
 the teacher was fascinated she went
  and the girl said i 'm drawing a picture of god 
 and the teacher said but nobody knows what god looks like 
 and the girl said they will in a minute 
 when my son was four
  being strict about it wherever he went he was four that year he was in the nativity play do you remember the story no it was big it
 was a big story  mel gibson did the sequel you may have seen it 
 nativity ii but
 james got the part of joseph which we were thrilled about we considered this to be one of the lead parts  we had the place crammed full of agents in
  joseph 
 he didn 't have to speak but you know the bit where the three kings come in
 they come in bearing gifts gold frankincense and myrrh this really happened we were sitting there and i think they just went out of sequence  because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said
  and the second boy said i bring you myrrh and the third boy said frank sent this 
 what these things have in common is that kids will take a
  have a go
 am i right  they 're not frightened of being wrong 
 i don 't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative 
 what we do know is if you 're not prepared to be wrong  you 'll never come up with anything original
 if you 're not prepared to be wrong  and by the time they get to be adults most kids have lost that capacity
  they have become frightened of being wrong  and we run our companies like this we stigmatize mistakes
 're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make 
 and the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities 
 picasso once said this he said that all children are born artists  the problem is to remain an artist as we grow up  
 i believe this passionately
 we don 't grow into creativity we grow out of it  or rather we get educated out of it  so why is this
  i lived in stratford on avon until about five years ago in fact we moved from stratford to los angeles 
 so you can imagine what a seamless transition that was laughter
 actually we lived in a place called snitterfield just outside stratford which is where shakespeare 's father was born 
 are you struck by a new thought i was you don 't think of shakespeare having a father do
 don 't think of shakespeare being a child do you shakespeare being seven i never thought of it  i mean he was seven at some point he was in somebody 's english class
  being sent to bed by his
  we moved from stratford to los angeles  and i just want to say a word about the transition my son didn 't want to come i 've got two kids he 's twenty one now my daughter 's sixteen  he didn 't want to come
 to los angeles he loved it but he had a girlfriend
 in england this was the love of his
  had their fourth anniversary  
 because it 's a long time when you 're sixteen  he was really upset on the plane he said i 'll never find another girl like sarah 
 and we were rather pleased about that frankly laughter
 because she was the main reason we were leaving the country
  but something strikes you when you move to america and travel around the world every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects 
 every one doesn 't matter where you go you 'd think it would be otherwise but it isn 't at the top are mathematics and languages then the humanities and at the bottom are the arts everywhere on earth  
 and in pretty much every system too there 's a hierarchy within the arts  art and
  music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance 
 there isn 't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics why 
 why not  
 i think this is rather important  i think math is very important but so is dance children dance all the time if they 're allowed to we all do we all have bodies don 't we 
 did i miss a meeting
  happens is as children grow up we start to educate them progressively from the waist up and then we focus on their heads  and slightly to one side  
 if you were to visit education as an alien and say what 's it for public education 
 i think you 'd have to conclude  if you look at the output  who really succeeds by this who does everything that they should 
 who gets all the brownie points who are the winners
 i think you 'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public
  education throughout the world is to produce university professors isn
 't it they 're the people who come out the top and i used to be one  so there 
 and i like university professors but you know  we shouldn 't hold them up as the high water mark of all human achievement they 're just
  another form of life  but they 're rather curious and i say this out of affection for them there 's something curious about professors in my experience not all of them but typically  they live in their heads  
 they live up there and slightly to one side  
 they 're disembodied you know in a kind of literal way they look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads
  getting their head to meetings 
 if you want real evidence of out of body experiences 
 get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics  and pop into the discotheque on the final night 
 and
 there you will
  it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability  and there 's a reason
 around the world there were no public systems of education really before the 19th century  they all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism 
 so the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas number one
 that the the most useful subjects for work are at the top  
 so you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid things you liked on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that 
 is that right  don 't do music you 're not going to be a musician don 't do art you won 't be an artist
  benign advice now profoundly mistaken the whole world is engulfed in a revolution and the second is academic ability which has really
  to dominate our view of intelligence because the universities designed the system in their image  
 if you think of it the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance  
 and the consequence is that many highly talented brilliant creative people think they 're not  
 because the thing they were good at at school wasn 't valued  or was actually stigmatized 
 and i think we can 't afford to go on that way in the next thirty years according to unesco
  more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history  
 more people and it 's the combination of all the things we 've talked about technology and its transformation effect on work and demography and the huge explosion in population  
 suddenly degrees aren 't worth anything isn
 't that true  
 when i was a student  if you had a degree you had a job if you didn 't have a job it 's because you didn 't want one
 didn 't want one frankly 
 but now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games  
 because you need an ma where the previous job required a ba and now you need a phd for the other it 's a process of academic inflation and it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet  
 we need to radically rethink our view of intelligence  we know three things about intelligence one it 's diverse we
  think about the world in all the ways that we experience it we think visually  we think in sound we think kinesthetically
  we think in abstract terms we think in movement  secondly intelligence is dynamic  
 if you look at the interactions of a human brain as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations intelligence is wonderfully interactive the brain isn 't divided
  into compartments in fact creativity which i define as the process of having original ideas that have value
 more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things
 by the way  there 's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum it 's thicker in women 
 following off from helen yesterday this is probably why women are better at
  know it from my personal life if my wife is cooking a meal at home which is not often  thankfully  no
 she 's good at some things  but if she 's cooking  she 's dealing with people on the phone she 's talking to the kids she 's painting the ceiling she 's
 doing open heart surgery over here  if i 'm cooking  the door is shut the kids are out the phone 's on the hook if she comes in i get
  annoyed i say terry please i 'm trying to fry an egg in here 
 give me a break 
 laughter actually do you know that old philosophical thing if a tree falls in a in a forest and nobody hears it did it happen 
  if a man speaks his mind in a forest and no woman hears him is he still wrong 
 and the third thing about intelligence is it 's distinct
  i 'm doing a new book at the moment called epiphany which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent i 'm fascinated by how people got to be there
  really prompted by a conversation i had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of gillian lynne have you heard of her 
 some have she 's a choreographer and everybody knows her work she did cats 
 and phantom of the opera she 's wonderful i used to be on the board of the royal ballet as you can see anyway gillian and
 i had lunch one day and i said how did you get to be a
  it was interesting when she was at school she was really hopeless  
 and the school in the ' 30s wrote to her parents and said we think gillian has a learning disorder she couldn 't concentrate she was fidgeting i think now they 'd say she had
  and she was there with with her mother and she was led and sat on this chair at the end and she sat on her hands for twenty minutes while this man talked to her mother about the problems gillian was having at school
  because she was disturbing people her homework was always late and so on little kid of eight in the
  the doctor went and sat next to gillian and said i 've listened to all these things your mother 's told me  i need to speak to her privately
  wait here we 'll be back we won 't be very long and they went and left her but as they went out of the room he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk  
 and when they got out he said to her mother just stand and watch her 
 and
 the minute they left the room she was on her feet moving to the music  and they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said
  lynne gillian isn 't sick  she 's a dancer
  take her to a dance school i said what happened she said she did 
 i can 't tell you how wonderful it was we walked in this room and it was full of people like me 
 people who couldn 't sit still people who had to move to think who had to move to
  they did modern they did contemporary she was eventually auditioned for the royal ballet school  she became a soloist she had a wonderful career at the royal ballet  she eventually graduated from the royal ballet school 
  the gillian lynne dance company met andrew lloyd webber  she 's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history  she 's given pleasure to millions  and she 's a multi millionaire 
 somebody else might have put her on medication and
  what i think it comes to is this al gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered
 by rachel carson  i believe our only hope for the future
 is to adopt a new conception of human ecology one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity
  our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip mine the earth for a particular commodity 
 and for the future  it won 't serve us we have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we 're educating our children 
 there was a wonderful quote by jonas salk who said
 if all the insects were to disappear from the earth  within fifty years all life on earth would end
 if all human beings disappeared from the earth  within fifty years all forms of life would flourish 
 and he 's right  
 what ted celebrates is the gift of the human imagination  we have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely
 and that we avert some of the scenarios
  that we 've talked about and the only way we 'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are
 and seeing our children for the hope that they are and our task is to educate their whole being so they can face this future by the way we may not see this future  
 but they will 
 and our job is to help them make something of it  thank you very much
