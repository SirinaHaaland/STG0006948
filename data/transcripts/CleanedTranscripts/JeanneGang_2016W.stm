  i 'm a relationship builder when you think of a relationship builder don 't you just automatically think architect 
 probably not that 's because most people think architects design buildings
  but what we really design are relationships  
 because cities are about people they 're places where people come together for all kinds of exchange  and besides skylines are highly specific urban habitats with their own insects plants and animals  and even their own weather  
 but today urban habitats are out of balance  climate change together with political and economic troubles are
  having an impact they 're adding up and stressing out cities and us the people who live in them 
 for me the field of ecology has provided important insight because ecologists don 't just look at individual species on their own they look at the relationships between living things and their environment  
 they look at how all the diverse parts of the ecosystem are interconnected  and it 's actually this balance this web of life that sustains life 
 my team and i
  have been applying insights from ecology to architecture
 to see how physical space can help build stronger relationships  
 the projects i 'm going to show you today use the idea of building relationships as the key driver for design 
 here 's an example of what i mean recently  we were asked to design a center for social justice
  they asked us for a building that could break down traditional barriers between different groups and in doing so create possibilities for meaningful conversations around social justice 
 the students wanted a place for cultural exchange  they thought a place for preparing food together could do that 
 and they wanted to be welcoming to the outside community they thought a fireplace could draw people in and help start conversations 
  everybody wanted the work of social justice to be visible to the outside world 
 there really wasn 't a precedent for this kind of space  so we looked around the globe and found examples of community meeting houses
 community meeting houses are places
 where there 's very specific relationships between people like this one in mali where the elders gather  
 the low roof keeps everybody seated and at equal eye
  level it 's very egalitarian i mean  you can 't stand up and take over the meeting you 'd actually bump your head 
 in meeting houses there 's always a central space where you can sit around a circle and see each other  so we designed a space just like that right in the middle of the arcus center and we anchored it with a fireplace and a kitchen it
  's pretty hard to get a kitchen and a fireplace in a building like this with the building codes but it was so important to the concept we got it done  
 and now the central space works for big social gatherings
 and a place to meet one on one for the very first time  it 's almost like this three way intersection that encourages bumping into people and starting a conversation 
 now you can always pass the kitchen and see something going on you can sit by the fireplace and share stories  you can study together
  in big groups or in small ones because the architecture sets up these opportunities 
 even the construction is about building relationships it 's made of cordwood masonry which is using logs the way you would use bricks  it 's super low tech and easy to do and anyone can do it and that 's the entire point  
 the act of making is a social activity  
 and it 's good for the planet
 the trees absorbed carbon when they were growing up and they gave off oxygen  
 and now that carbon is trapped inside the walls and it 's not being released into the atmosphere so making the walls is equivalent to taking cars right off the road  
 we chose the building method because it connects people to each other and to the environment  
 but is it working is it creating
  relationships and nurturing them how can we know 
 well more and more people are coming here for one and as a result of the fireside chats and a full calendar of programming 
 people are applying for the arcus fellowships in fact
 applications have increased tenfold for the arcus fellowship since the building opened  it 's working 
  's bringing people together  
 so i 've shown how architecture can connect people on this kind of horizontal campus scale 
 but we wondered if social relationships could be scaled up or rather  upward in tall buildings 
 tall buildings don 't necessarily lend themselves to being social buildings they can seem isolating and inward  
 you might only see people in those awkward elevator rides
  but in several major cities  i 've been designing tall buildings
 that are based on creating relationships between people this is aqua  it 's a residential high rise in chicago
 aimed at young urban professionals and empty nesters many of them new to the city 
 with over seven hundred apartments we wanted to see if we could use architecture to help people get to know their neighbors even when their homes are organized in the vertical dimension
  so we invented a way to use balconies as the new social connectors  
 the shapes of the floor slabs vary slightly and they transition as you go up the tower the result of this is that
 you can actually see people from your balcony the balconies are misregistered 
 you can lean over your balcony and say hey just like you would across the backyard
 to make the balconies more comfortable for
  a longer period of time during the year  we studied the wind with digital simulations  
 so the effect of the balcony shapes breaks up the wind and confuses the wind and makes the balconies more comfortable and less windy
  now just by being able to go outside on your balcony or on the third floor roof terrace  you can be connected to the outdoors
  even when you 're way above the ground plane  so the building acts to create community within the building and the city at the same time it 's working  
 and people are starting to meet each other on the building surface and we 've heard 
 laughter they 've even starting getting together as couples
  but besides romantic relationships the building has a positive social effect on the community 
 as evidenced by people starting groups together and starting big
  projects together like this organic community garden on the building 's roof terrace  
 so i 've shown how tall buildings can be social connectors  but what about public architecture how can we create better social cohesion in public buildings and civic spaces  and why is it important 
 public architecture is
  just not as successful if it comes from the top down 
 about fifteen years ago in chicago they started to replace old police stations  
 and they built this identical model all over the city 
 and even though they had good intentions of treating all neighborhoods equally  
 the communities didn 't feel invested in the process or feel a sense of ownership of these buildings 
 it was equality in the sense that everybody gets the same police station but it wasn 't equity in the sense
  responding to each community 's individual needs  and equity is the key issue here  you know in my field
  there 's a debate about whether architecture can even do anything to improve social relationships  but i believe
 that we need architecture and every tool in our tool kit
 to improve
  policy reforms have been recommended in order to rebuild trust  but my team and i wondered if
 design and a more inclusive design process could help add something positive to this policy conversation  we asked ourselves simply can design help rebuild trust  
 so we reached out to community members and police officers in north lawndale it 's a neighborhood in chicago where the police station is perceived as a scary fortress surrounded by a parking lot
  lot 
 in north lawndale people are afraid of police and of going anywhere near the police station even to report a crime  
 so we organized this brainstorming session with both groups participating and we came up with this whole new idea for the police station  
 it 's called polis station polis is a greek word that means a place with a sense of community  it 's based on the idea
 that if you can increase opportunities for positive social interactions between police and community members 
 you can rebuild that relationship and activate the neighborhood at the same time  
 instead of the police station as a scary fortress you get highly active spaces on the public side of the station
  that spark conversation like a barbershop a coffee shop
 or sports courts as well  both cops and kids said they love sports 
 these insights came directly from the community members and the police officers themselves and as designers our role was just to
 connect the dots and suggest the first step  so with the help of the city and the parks  we were able to raise funds and design and
  right on the police station parking lot  it 's a start  but is it rebuilding trust the
 people in north lawndale say the kids are using the courts every day and they even organize tournaments like this one shown here  and once in a while an officer joins in  
 but now they even have basketballs inside the station that kids can borrow and recently they 've asked us to expand the courts and build a park on the site 
  report something astonishing  
 before there was fear of going anywhere the station  
 and now they say there 's a sense that the court is safer than other courts nearby and they prefer their kids to play here  
 so maybe in the future on the public side of the station  you might be able to drop in for a haircut at the barbershop
 or reserve the community room for a birthday party or renew your driver 's license or get
  money out of an atm it can be a place for neighbors to meet each other and to get to know the officers and vice versa 
 this is not a utopian fantasy  it 's about how do you design to rebuild trust  trusting relationships  
 you know  every city has parks  libraries
  other public buildings that have the potential to be reimagined as social connectors  
 but reimagining the buildings for the future is going to require engaging the people who live there engaging the public can be intimidating
 and i 've felt that too but maybe that 's because in architecture school we don 't really learn how to engage the public in the act of design 
 we 're taught to defend our design against criticism  but i think that can change
 so if we can focus the design mind on creating
 positive reinforcing relationships in architecture and through architecture i believe
 we can do much more than create individual buildings  we can reduce the stress and the polarization in our urban habitats 
 we can create relationships  we can help steady this planet we all share 
 see architects really are relationship builders
