  twenty years ago  when i was a barrister and human rights lawyer in full time legal practice in london 
 and the highest court in the land still convened some would say by
  an accident of history in this building here  
 i met a young man who had just quit his job in the british foreign office 
 when i asked him why did you leave he told me this story  
 he had gone to his boss one morning and said let 's do something about human rights abuses in china 
 and his boss had replied we can 't do anything about human rights abuses in china because we have trade relations with china
  friend went away with his tail between his legs and six months later he returned again to his boss 
 and he said this time let 's do something about human rights in burma as it was then called 
 his boss once again paused and said oh 
 but we can 't do anything about human rights in burma because we don 't have any trade relations with burma
  this was the moment he knew he had to leave it wasn 't just the hypocrisy that got to him  
 it was the unwillingness of his government to engage in conflict with other governments in tense discussions 
 all the while  innocent people were being harmed  
 we are constantly told
 that conflict is bad
 that compromise is good
 that conflict is bad but consensus is good that conflict is bad
 and collaboration
 is good
  but in my view that 's far too simple a vision of the world we cannot know whether conflict is bad unless we know who
  who is fighting why they are fighting
 and how they are fighting and compromises can be thoroughly rotten
 if they harm people who are not at the table 
 people who are vulnerable  disempowered people whom we have an obligation to protect 
 now you might be somewhat skeptical of a lawyer arguing
 about the benefits of conflict and creating problems for compromise but i did also qualify as a
  and these days i spend my time giving talks about ethics for free so as my bank manager likes to remind me i 'm downwardly mobile  
 but if you accept my argument it should change not just the way we lead our personal lives which i wish to put to one side for the moment  
 but it will change the way we think about major problems of public health
 and the environment
  let me explain  
 every middle schooler in the united states my 12 year old daughter included  learns that there are three branches of government  
 the legislative  the executive and the judicial branch  
 james madison wrote if there is any principle more sacred in our constitution  
 and indeed
  in any free constitution than any other it is that which separates
 the legislative  the executive and the judicial powers now the framers were not just concerned
 about the concentration and exercise of power they also understood the
  determine the constitutionality of laws
 if they participate in making those laws  
 nor can they hold the other branches of government accountable if they collaborate with them or enter into close relationships with them 
 the constitution is as one famous
  and we the people are served when those branches do indeed struggle with each other 
 now  we recognize the importance of struggle not just in the public sector between our branches of government  
 we also know it too in the private
  in relationships among corporations  
 let 's imagine that two american airlines get together and agree that they will not drop the price of their economy class airfares below two hundred and fifty dollars a ticket 
 that is collaboration some would say collusion not competition  and we the people are harmed
 because we pay more for our tickets
 imagine similarly two airlines were to
  say look airline a we 'll take the route from la to chicago and airline b says we 'll take the route from chicago to dc and we won 't compete 
 once again that 's collaboration or collusion instead of competition  and we the people are harmed  
 so we understand the importance of struggle
 to relationships between branches of government the
 public sector  we also understand the importance of conflict when it comes to relationships
 among corporations  the private sector  but where we have forgotten it is in the relationships
  the public and the private and governments all over the world are collaborating with industry to solve problems of public health and the environment  
 often collaborating with the very corporations that are creating or exacerbating the problems they are trying to solve  
 we are told
 that these relationships are a
  but what if someone is losing out  
 let me give you some examples 
 a united nations agency decided to address a serious problem poor sanitation in schools in rural india 
 they did so not just in collaboration with national and local governments but also with a television company
 and with
 a major multinational soda company
 in exchange for less than one million dollars that corporation received the benefits of a  months long promotional campaign including a 12 hour telethon all using the company 's logo and color scheme 
 this was an arrangement
 which was totally understandable
 from the corporation 's point of view  it enhances the reputation of the company and it creates brand loyalty for its products  
 but in my view  
 this is profoundly problematic for the intergovernmental agency an agency that has a mission to promote sustainable living 
 by increasing consumption of sugar sweetened beverages made from scarce local water supplies and drunk out of plastic bottles in a country that is already grappling with obesity this is
  neither sustainable from a public health nor an environmental point of view  and in order to solve one public health problem  
 the agency is sowing the seeds of another 
 this is just one example of dozens i discovered
 in researching a book on the relationships between government and industry  i could also have
  you about the initiatives in parks in london and throughout britain involving the same company promoting exercise or indeed
 of the british government creating voluntary pledges in partnership with industry instead of regulating industry these collaborations or partnerships have become the paradigm in public health 
 and once again they make
  sense from the point of view of industry it allows them to frame public health problems and their solutions in ways that are least threatening to most consonant with their commercial interests  so obesity becomes a problem of
 individual
 of personal behavior personal responsibility and lack of physical activity it is not a problem
  when framed this way of a multinational food system involving major corporations  
 and again  i don 't blame industry industry naturally engages in strategies of influence to promote its commercial interests  
 but governments have a responsibility to develop
  governments are making
 when they collaborate in this way with industry is that they conflate the common good
 with common ground  
 when you collaborate with industry  you necessarily put off the table things that might promote the common good to which industry will not agree industry will not agree to increased
  regulation unless
 it believes this will stave off even more regulation or perhaps knock some competitors out of the market  
 nor can companies agree to do certain things for example raise the prices of their unhealthy products because that would violate competition law 
 as we 've established 
 so our governments should not confound the common good and
  common ground especially when common ground means reaching agreement with industry  
 i want to give you another example moving from high profile collaboration to something that is below ground
 both literally and figuratively  the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas  
 imagine that you purchase a plot of land not knowing the
  mineral rights have been sold this is before the fracking boom 
 you build your dream home on that plot  
 and shortly afterwards you discover that a gas company is building a well pad on your land 
 that was the plight
 of the hallowich family  within a very short period of time they began to complain of headaches
 of sore throats of itchy eyes in addition to the interference of the noise vibration and the bright lights from the flaring of natural gas 
 they were very vocal in their criticisms  
 and then they fell silent  
 and thanks to the pittsburgh  post gazette where this image appeared and one other newspaper we discovered why they fell silent  the newspapers went to the court and said what happened to the
  and it turned out the hallowiches had made a secret settlement with the gas operators  and it was a take it or leave it settlement the gas company said you can have
 a six figure sum to move elsewhere and start your lives again but in return you must promise not to speak of your experience with our company not to speak of your experience 
  with fracking not to speak about the health consequences
 that might have been revealed by a medical examination  now i do not blame the hallowiches for accepting a 
 settlement
 and starting their lives elsewhere and one can understand why the company would wish to silence a squeaky wheel  what i want to point the finger at is the legal and regulatory
  a system in which there are networks of agreements just like this one which serve to silence people and seal off data points
 from public health experts and epidemiologists a system in which regulators will even refrain from issuing a violation notice in the event of pollution if the landowner and the gas company agree to settle 
 this is a system which isn 't just bad from a public health point of view  it exposes hazards to local families who remain
  remain in the dark  
 now i have given you two examples not because they are isolated examples they are examples of a systemic problem  
 i could share some counterexamples the case for example of the public official
 who sues the pharmaceutical company for concealing the fact that its antidepressant increases suicidal
  thoughts
 in adolescents i can tell you about the regulator who went after the food company for exaggerating the purported health benefits of its yogurt 
 and i can tell you about the legislator
 who despite heavy lobbying directed at both sides of the aisle pushes
 for environmental protections these are isolated examples
  but they are beacons of light in the darkness  and they can show us
 the way  
 i began by suggesting that sometimes we need to engage in conflict 
 governments should tussle with struggle with at times engage in direct conflict with corporations
  this is not because governments are inherently good and corporations are inherently evil  each is capable of good
 or ill  
 but corporations understandably act to promote their commercial interests  and they do so either sometimes
 undermining or promoting the common good  but it is the responsibility
 of governments to protect and promote the common good and we should insist
 that they fight to do so this is because governments are the guardians
 of public health governments are the guardians of the environment  and it is governments
 that are guardians of these essential parts of our common good  thank you
