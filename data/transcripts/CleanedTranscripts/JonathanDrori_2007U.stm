  try and
 explain why it is that perhaps we don 't understand as much as we think we do 
 i 'd like to begin with four questions  this is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year that 's an in joke by the way
  who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard and they 're questions that i 've asked of science television producers of audiences of
 science educators so
 that 's science teachers
 and also of seven year olds and i find that the seven year olds do marginally better than the other audiences which is somewhat surprising  
 so the first question and you might want to write this down  either on a bit of paper
 a virtual piece of paper in your head and for viewers at home you can try this as well 
 a little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot right  i think we agree on that where does the tree get the stuff that makes up
 this chair right where does all this stuff come from and your next question
 is can you light a little
  with a battery a bulb
 and one piece of wire 
 and would you be able to kind of draw a you don 't have to draw the diagram but would you be able to draw the diagram if you had to do it or would you just say that 's actually not possible 
 the third question is why is it hotter in summer than in winter  i think we can probably agree
 that it is hotter in summer than in winter  but why
 and finally would you be able to and you can sort of scribble it if you like
 scribble a plan diagram of the solar system showing the shape of the planets ' orbits would you be able to do that  and if you can just scribble a pattern
  teachers as teachers often think but actually from common sense from experience of the world around them from
 all the things that go on between them and their peers  and their their carers and their parents and all of that  experience and one of the
 great experts in this field of course was bless him  cardinal
  be very careful what you get into people 's heads because it 's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards  right 
 laughter i 'm
 not quite sure how he died actually was he beheaded in the end or hung 
 now  those questions which of course you 've got right and you haven 't been conferring and so on and i you know normally i would pick people out and humiliate  but maybe not in this
 instance a little seed weighs a lot and 
  percent of this stuff came out of the air  
 now i guarantee that about eighty five percent of you or maybe it 's fewer at ted 
 will have said it comes out of the ground  
 and some people probably two of you will come up and argue with me afterwards and say that actually it comes out of the ground now if that was true we 'd have trucks going round the country filling people 's gardens in with soil it 'd be a fantastic 
  business  but actually we don 't do that the mass of this comes out of the air  now i passed all my biology exams in
  in in britain  i passed them really well but i still came out of school thinking that that stuff came out of the ground 
 second one can you light a little torch bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire yes you can and i 'll show you in a second how to do that 
 now  i have some rather bad news which is that i had a piece of video that i was about to show you which unfortunately the sound doesn 't work in this room 
  i 'm going to describe to you in true monty python fashion what happens in the video 
 and in the video a group of researchers go to mit on graduation day we chose mit because obviously that 's a very long way away from here and you wouldn 't mind too 
  much but it sort of works the same way in britain and in the west coast of the usa  
  and they couldn 't answer them and so there 's a whole lot of people saying i 'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air  that 's very surprising to me and those are science graduates  and we intercut it with we are the premier science university in the world because of british like hubris 
 laughter and when we gave graduate engineers
 that question they said it couldn 't be done and when we gave them a battery and a piece of wire and a bulb and said
  can you do it they couldn 't do it right and that 's no different from imperial college in london by the way it 's not some sort of anti american thing going on  
 as if 
 now  
 the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money for teaching people we might as well get it right and there are also some societal reasons why we might want people to understand
 what it is that 's happening in photosynthesis for
 one half of the
 carbon equation is how much we emit 
 and the other half of the carbon equation as i 'm very conscious as a trustee of kew is how much things soak up and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere
 that 's what plants actually do for a living 
 and for any finnish people in the audience this is a finnish pun  we are both literally and metaphorically skating on thin ice
 if we don 't understand that kind of thing now here 's how you do the battery and the bulb  it 's so easy
 of course you all knew that but if you haven 't played with a battery and a bulb  if you 've only seen a circuit diagram you might not be able to do that  
 and that 's one of the problems 
 so why is it hotter in summer than in winter we learn as children that you get closer to something that 's hot  and it burns you it
 's a very powerful bit of learning and it happens pretty early on 
  by extension we think to ourselves why it 's hotter in summer than in winter must be because we 're closer to the sun i promise you that most of you will have got that oh
 you 're all shaking your heads but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly other ones are kind of going like this all right it
 's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the sun are spread out more 
 right  because of the tilt of the earth and if you think the tilt is tilting us closer no it isn 't the sun is
  million miles away and we 're tilting like this right it makes no odds in fact in the northern hemisphere 
 we 're further from the sun in summer as it happens but it makes no odds the difference 
 ok now  the scribble of the diagram of the solar system if you believe as most of you probably do that it 's hotter in summer than in winter because we 're closer to the sun you must have drawn an ellipse 
 right that would explain it right  except in your you 're nodding now in your ellipse have you thought well what happens during the night
  australia and here  right  they 've got
 summer and we 've got winter and what does the does the earth kind of rush towards the sun at night  and then rush back again i mean it 's a
 very strange thing going on  and we hold these two models in our head of what 's right and what isn 't right
  and we do that as human beings in all sorts of fields  
  here 's copernicus ' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan that 's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper right and
 this is nasa 's view they 're stunningly similar  i hope you notice the coincidence here 
 what would you do if you knew that people had this misconception right in their heads of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children 
 what sort of diagram would you show them
  the solar system to show that it 's not really like that you 'd show them something like this wouldn 't you it 's a plan looking down from above but no look what i found in the textbooks  
 that 's what you show people right  these are from textbooks from websites educational websites and almost anything you pick up is like that 
 and the reason it 's like that is because it 's dead boring to have a load of concentric circles whereas that 's much more exciting to look at something at that angle isn 't it 
 right  and by doing it at that angle if you 've got that misconception in your head then that
  thing will be ellipses  so you 've it
 's crap isn 't it really as we say 
 so these mental models we look for evidence that reinforces our models we do this of course with matters of race and politics and everything else and we do it in science as well so we look just look and scientists do it constantly
 we look for evidence that reinforces our models  and some folks are just all too able and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models
  being i 'm in the united states i 'll have a dig at the europeans these are examples of what i would say is bad practice in science teaching centers these pictures are from la villette in france and the welcome
 wing of the science museum in london  and if you look at the kind of the way these things are constructed there 's a lot of mediation by glass and it 's very blue and
 kind of professional in that way that
  allen comes up from under the sheets in that scene in annie hall and said god that 's so professional and
 that you don 't there 's no passion in it and it 's not hands on right and you know pun intended  whereas good interpretation i 'll use an example from nearby
 is san francisco exploratorium where all the things that that the demonstrations and so on are made out of everyday objects
  that children can understand it 's very hands on and they can engage with and experiment with 
 and i know that if the graduates at mit and in the imperial college in london had had the battery and the wire and the bit of stuff and you know 
 been able to do it they would have learned
 how how it actually works rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can 't do it 
 so good interpretation is more about things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world
  and things that where there isn 't an extra barrier of a piece of glass
 or machined titanium and it all looks fantastic ok 
 and the exploratorium does that really really well and it 's amateur  but amateur in the best sense in other words the root of the word being of love and passion 
 so children are not empty vessels  ok  so as monty python would have it this is a bit lord privy seal to say so but
  children are not empty vessels they come with their own ideas and their own theories and unless you work with those
  then you won 't be able to shift them right and i probably haven 't shifted your ideas of how the world and universe operates either  
 but this applies equally to matters of trying to sell new technology for example we are in britain we 're trying to do a digital switchover of the whole population into digital technology [ for television ] 
 and it 's one of the difficult things is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works
  's quite difficult to shift those
  so we 're not empty vessels the mental models that we have as children persist into adulthood 
 poor teaching actually does more harm than good in this country and in britain  magnetism is understood better by children before they 've been to school than afterwards  
 ok  same for gravity two concepts so it 's which is quite humbling as a you know if you 're a teacher and you look before and after 
  's quite worrying they do worse in tests afterwards  after the teaching 
 and we collude we design tests or at least in britain so that people pass them right and governments do very well they pat themselves on the back ok 
 we collude and actually
 if you
 if someone had designed a test for me when i was doing my biology exams to really understand to see whether i 'd understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue  
 and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air
  i i might have done better at science so the most important thing is to get people to articulate their
