  on building seats i think concluded that ultimately the solution is people shouldn 't sit down i could have told them that
  yesterday the automotive guys gave us some new insights
 they pointed out that i believe it was between thirty and fifty years from
 today that they will be steering cars by wire without all that mechanical stuff
 that 's reassuring
  they then pointed out there 'd be sort of the other controls by wire to get rid of all that mechanical stuff
 that 's pretty good but why not get rid of the wires
 then you don 't need anything to control the car except thinking about it
  i would love to talk about the technology and sometime in
 what 's past the fifteen minutes i 'll be happy to talk to all the techno geeks around here about what 's in here
 but if i had one thing to say about this before we get to first
 it would be that from the time we started building this
 the big idea wasn 't the technology it really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the ibot for the
  community the big idea here
 is i think a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem
 in transportation and maybe to put that in perspective
 there 's so much data on this i 'll be happy to give it to you in different forms you never know what strikes the fancy of who
 but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world and
  henry ford just about one hundred years ago started cranking out model ts what i don 't think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied
 for instance in that time ninety one percent of america lived either on farms or in small towns
 so the car
 the horseless
  carriage that replaced the horse and carriage was a big deal it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage it
 was half as long
 and it was an environmental improvement because for instance in one thousand nine hundred and three they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown
 manhattan because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses
 and a million of them urinating and doing other things and the typhoid and other problems created were
  almost unimaginable so the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy
 it also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm or their farm to a town or from a town to a city
 it all made sense with ninety one percent of the people living there
 by the nineteen fiftys we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world
  the highway system and it is certainly
 a wonder and by the way as i take shots at old technologies
 i want to assure everybody and
 particularly the automotive industry who 's been very supportive of us that i don 't think this in any way
 competes with airplanes or cars
 but think about where the world is today
 fifty percent of the global population now lives in cities that 's three two billion people
 we 've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today
 five hundred years ago sailing ships started getting reliable enough we found a new continent one
 hundred and fifty years ago locomotives got efficient enough steam power that we turned the continent into a country
 over the last hundred years we started building cars and then over the fifty years we 've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way and
 we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that
 but during that entire process more and more people have been born and more and more people are moving to cities china alone is going to move
 four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half
 and so nobody i think
 would argue that airplanes in the last fifty years have turned
 the continent and the country now into a neighborhood and if you just look at how technology has been applied we 've solved all the long range
 high speed high volume large weight problems of moving things around
  nobody would want to give them up
 and i certainly wouldn 't want to give up my airplane or my helicopter or my humvee or my porsche i love them all i don 't keep any of them in my living room
 the fact is
 the last mile is the problem and half the world now lives in dense cities and people spend depending on who they are between ninety and ninety five percent of their energy
 getting around on foot i think there 's
 i don 't know what data
  would impress you but how about forty three percent of the refined
 fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the united states
 three million people die every year in cities
 due to bad air and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced
 by transportation devices particularly sitting
  in cities and again i say that not to attack any industry i think i really do i love my airplane
 and cars on highways moving sixty miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient both
 from an engineering engineering point of view an energy consumption point of view and a utility point of view and we all love our cars and i do
 the problem is you get into the city and you want to go four blocks
  it 's neither fun nor efficient nor productive it 's not sustainable
 if
 in china in the year one thousand nine hundred and ninety ninety eight four hundred and seventeen million people used bicycles one seven million people used cars
 if five percent of that population became quote middle class and wanted to
 go the way we 've gone in the last hundred years at the same time
 fifty percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of manhattan every six weeks
 it isn 't sustainable environmentally
 it isn 't sustainable economically there just ain 't enough oil
 and it 's not sustainable politically i mean what are we fighting over right now we can make it complicated but what 's the world fighting over right now
 so it seemed to me that
  somebody had to work on that last mile and it was dumb luck we were working on ibots
 but once we made this we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis you don 't need the water
 or snowmobiles you don 't need the snow or skiing it 's it 's just fun and people love to move around doing fun things
 and every one of those industries by the way just golf carts alone is a multi billion dollar industry but
 rather than go license this off which is what we normally do it seemed to me
 that if we put all our effort not into the technology but into an understanding of a world that 's
 solved all its other problems but has somehow come to accept
 that cities which right back from ancient greece on were meant to walk around cities that were architected and built for people
 now have a footprint that while we 've solved
  every other transportation problem and it 's like moore 's law i mean look at the time it took to cross a continent
 in a conestoga wagon then on a railroad then an airplane every other form of transportation 's been improved
 in five thousand years
 we 've gone backwards in getting around cities they 've gotten bigger they 're spread out the most expensive real estate on this planet in
 in every city wilshire boulevard or fifth avenue or tokyo
 or paris the most expensive real estate is their downtowns
 sixty five percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars the twenty largest cities in the world
 so you wonder what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities what if
 you could make them fun attractive clean environmentally friendly
 what if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this as that last link
 to mass transit
 to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want and then have our cities energized again
  we thought it would be really neat to do that and one of the problems we really were worried about is
 how do we get legal on the sidewalk because technically i 've got motors i 've got wheels i 'm a motor vehicle
 i don 't look like a motor vehicle i have the same footprint as a pedestrian i have the same unique capability
 to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space i took this down to ground zero and knocked my
  way through crowds for an hour i 'm a pedestrian but the law typically lags technology by a generation or two and
 if we get told we don 't belong on the sidewalk we have two choices
 we 're a recreational vehicle that doesn 't really matter and i don 't spend my time doing that kind of stuff
 or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a greyhound bus or a vehicle
 we 've been so concerned about that we went to the postmaster general of the united states as the first person we ever showed on the outside and said
 put your people on it everybody trusts their postman
 and they belong on the sidewalks and they 'll use it seriously seriously
 he agreed we went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat carrying seventy pounds of stuff
 they love it and i can 't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket
 so we 've been working really really hard but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop
 as an attitude about what 's important and how to apply the technology
 we went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to
 let us design
  and build these things and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted
 so i 'm happy really i am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want and yes it 's really fun and yes you should all go out and try it
 but if i could ask you to do one thing it 's not to think about it as a piece of technology but just imagine
  that although we all understand somehow that it 's reasonable
 that we use our four thousand pound machine which can go sixty miles an hour that can bring you everywhere you want to go and somehow
 it 's also what we used for the last mile and it 's broken and it doesn 't work
 one of the more exciting things that occurred to us about
 why it might get accepted happened out here in california a few weeks ago after we launched it we were here
  with
 a news crew on venice beach zipping up and back and he 's marveling at the technology and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by
 and skateboarders are zipping by
 and a little old lady i mean if you looked in the dictionary a little old lady
 came by me and now that i 'm on this i 'm the height of a normal adult now and and she just stops and the camera is there and
  and she looks up at me and
 says can i try that and what was i you know how are you going to say anything and so i said sure so i get off
 and she gets on and with a little bit of the usual ah then she turns around and she goes about
 twenty feet and she turns back around and she 's all smiles and
  she comes back to me and she stops and she says
 finally they made something for us and the camera is looking down at her i 'm thinking wow that was great
 please lady don 't say another word
 and and the camera is down at her and this guy has to put the microphone in her face said what do you mean by that
  i figured it 's all over now and she looks up and she says well
 she 's still watching these guys go she says i can 't ride a bike no she says i can 't use
 a skateboard and i 've never used roller blades she knew them by name
 she says and it 's been fifty years since i rode a bicycle then she looks up she 's looking up and and she says
 and i 'm eighty one years old and i don 't drive a
  anymore i still have to get to the store and i can 't carry a lot of things and
 it suddenly occurred to me that among my many fears were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it
 it was that fundamentally you believe there 's
 pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left the sidewalks in these cities
 when you look at the
 thirty six inches of legal requirement for sidewalk then the eight foot for the parked car then the three lanes and then the other eight feet it 's
 that little piece is all that 's there
 but she looks up and says this and it occurs to me well kids aren 't going to mind these things and they don 't vote and
 business people and then young adults aren 't going to mind these things they 're pretty cool so i guess subliminally i was
  worried that it 's the older population that 's going to worry
 so having seen this
 and having worried about it for eight years the first thing i do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys call aarp
 get an appointment right away we 've got to show them this thing
 and they took it to washington they showed them and
 they 're going to be involved now watching how these things get absorbed
 in a number of cities like atlanta where we 're
 doing trials to see if it really can in fact help re energize their downtown
 the bottom line is whether you believe the united
  nations or any of the other think tanks in the next twenty years all human population growth on this planet will be in cities
 in asia alone it will be over a billion people
 they learned to start with cell phones they didn 't have to take the one hundred year trip we took
 they start at the top of the technology food chain
 we 've got to start building cities and human environments where a one hundred and fifty pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense rich green space
  environment without being in a four thousand pound machine to do it
 cars were not meant for parallel parking they 're wonderful machines to go between cities but just think about it we 've solved all the
 long range high speed problems
 the greeks went from the theater of dionysus to the parthenon in their sandals you do it in your sneakers not much has changed
 if this thing goes only three times as fast as walking three times a thirty minute walk becomes ten minutes your choice when living in a city
 if it 's now ten minutes
 because at thirty minutes you want an alternative whether it 's a bus a train we 've got to build an infrastructure a light rail or you 're going to keep parking those cars
 but if you could put a pin in most cities and imagine how far you could if you
  the time walk in one half hour it 's the city
 if you could make it fun and make it eight or ten minutes you can 't find your car un park your car move your car re park your car and go somewhere
 you can 't get to a cab or a subway
 we could change the way people allocate their resources
 the way this planet uses its energy
 make it more fun and we 're hoping to some extent history will say we were right
 that 's segway this is a stirling cycle engine
 this had been confused by a lot of things we 're doing
 this little beast right now is producing a few hundred watts of electricity yes it could be attached to this and yes on a
 kilogram of propane you could drive from new york to boston if you so choose
 perhaps more
  interesting about this little engine is it 'll burn any fuel because some of you might be skeptical about the
 capability of this to have an impact where most of the world you can 't simply plug into your one hundred and twenty volt outlet
 we 've been working on this actually as an alternative energy source starting way back with johnson johnson to run an ibot because the best
 batteries you could get
 ten watt hours per kilogram in lead
  twenty watt hours per kilogram nickel cadmium forty watt hours per kilogram in nickel metal hydride sixty watt hours per kilogram in lithium eight thousand seven hundred and fifty watt hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline which is why nobody drives electric cars
 but in any event if you can burn it
 with the same
  efficiency because it 's external combustion as your kitchen stove if you can burn any fuel it turns out to be pretty neat
 it makes just enough electricity to for instance do this which at night is enough electricity in the rest of the world as
 mister holly doctor holly pointed out can run computers and a light bulb but more interestingly the thermodynamics of this say
 you 're never going to get more than twenty percent efficiency it doesn 't matter much it says if you get two hundred watts of electricity you 'll get seven or eight hundred watts of heat
 if you wanted to boil water and re condense it at a rate of ten gallons an hour
 it takes about twenty five a little over twenty five three kilowatt twenty five thousand watts of continuous power
 to do it that 's so much energy you couldn 't afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way
 certainly in the rest of the world your choice is to devastate the place turning everything that will burn into heat or drink the water
  that 's available
 the number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water depending on whose numbers you believe it 's between sixty and eighty five thousand people per day
 we don 't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world we need water and women shouldn 't have to spend four hours a day looking for it or watching their kids die
 we figured out how to put a vapor compression distiller on this thing with a counter flow heat exchanger to take the
 waste heat then using a little bit of the electricity control that process and for four hundred and fifty watts which is a little more than half of its waste heat
 it will make ten gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it so if we put this box on here in a few years could we have a
  in a sustainable package that weighs sixty pounds i don 't know
