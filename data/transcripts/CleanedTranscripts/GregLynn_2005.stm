  i would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that 's tracked by architecture what 's interesting about architects is 
 we always have tried to justify beauty by looking to nature and
  arguably  beautiful architecture has always been looking at a model of nature  so  for roughly three hundred years the hot debate in architecture
 was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture because the nose was one fifth of your head 
 or because your head
  of your body 
 and the reason that that was the model of beauty and of nature was because the decimal point had not been invented yet it wasn 't the  16th century
 and
 everybody had to dimension a building in terms of fractions  so a room would be dimensioned as one fourth of a facade the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as ten
 get down to the small elements by fractional subdivision finer and finer and finer in the   15th century the decimal point was invented architects 
  stopped using fractions and they had a new model of nature  so  what 's going on
 and which is using digital tools  and that has a lot of implications to the way we think about beauty and form and it has a lot of implications
  in the way we think about nature  
 the best example of this would probably be the gothic and the gothic was invented after the invention of calculus although the gothic architects weren 't really using 
  calculus to define their forms  but what was important is the gothic moment in architecture was the first time that force and motion was thought of in terms of form  
  cross you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting get articulated as lines so you 're really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form 
  much later robert maillart 's bridges which optimize structural form with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola  
  the end of the  19th century beginning of the 20th century and how that hanging chain model translates into archways
 and vaulting 
 so in all of these examples structure is the determining force frei otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams
 and foam bubble models to generate his mannheim concert hall
 interestingly in the last ten years norman foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model to generate the roof of the national gallery with the structural engineer chris williams 
 in all these examples there 's one ideal form  because these are thought in terms of structure  and as an architect i 've always found these kinds of systems very limiting because
  i 'm not interested in ideal forms and i 'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment so what i thought i would
 bring up is another component that needs to be thought of whenever you think about nature  and that 's basically the invention of
 generic form in genetic
  my hero is actually not darwin it 's a guy named william bateson father of greg bateson who was here for a long time
 in monterey  and he was what you 'd call a teratologist he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations to find rules 
  and laws rather than looking at the norms so instead of trying to find the ideal type
 he has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb  when i first saw this image  
 ten years ago i actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time  beautiful because it has symmetry  
 so  what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations  instead of
 having a thumb  you would either get another opposable thumb  or you would get four fingers so the mutations reverted
  to symmetry  
 and bateson invented the concept of symmetry breaking 
 which is that wherever you lose information in a system  
 you revert back to symmetry so symmetry wasn 't the sign of order and organization which is what i was always understanding and as is an architect
 symmetry was the absence of information  so whenever you lost information you 'd move to symmetry
  you added information to a system you would break symmetry so this whole idea of natural form
 shifted at that moment from looking for ideal shapes to looking for a combination of information and
 and generic form  
 you know  literally after seeing that image and finding out what bateson was working with we started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and
  branching to start to think about architectural form  
 to just talk for a minute about the digital mediums that we 're using now and how they integrate calculus  the fact that 
 means that we don 't have to think about dimension in terms of ideal units or
  in architecture we deal with big assemblies of components so there might be
 up to say fifty thousand pieces of material in this room you 're sitting in right now
 that all need to get organized now typically you 'd think that they would all be the same like the chairs you 're sitting in would all be the same dimension you know
 i haven 't verified this but it 's the norm that every chair would be a slightly different dimension 
 because you 'd want to space them all out for everybody 's sight lines
  the elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting they 're all losing their modular quality  and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions that 's because we 're all using calculus tools for manufacturing
 and for design 
 calculus is also a mathematics of curves so even a straight line  defined with calculus is a curve it 's just a curve without inflection 
  a new vocabulary of form is now pervading all design fields whether it 's automobiles architecture products  etc it 's really being affected by 
  this digital medium of curvature the intricacies of scale that come out of that you know in the example of the nose to the face there 's a fractional 
  with calculus the whole idea of subdivision is more complex because the whole and the parts are one continuous series it 's
 too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus so i brought some images to just describe how that works this
 is a korean church that we did in queens  and in this example you can see that the components of this
  but they 're repetitive without being modular each one of the elements in this structure
 is a unique distance and dimension and all of the connections are unique angles now the only way we could design that 
 or possibly construct it is by using a 
 definition of the form it also is much more dynamic so that you can see that the same
  opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it so the same space that appears to be a kind 
  of closed volume  when seen from the other side becomes a kind of open vista  
 changes also in architecture 
 that we 're starting to look now not for some ideal form  like a latin cross for a church  but actually all the traits of a church  so  
 light that comes from behind from an invisible source
  directionality that focuses you towards an altar it turns out it 's not
 rocket science to design a sacred space you just need to incorporate a certain
  number of traits in a very kind of genetic way  
 so  these are the different perspectives of that interior which has a very complex set of orientations all in a simple form 
 in terms of construction and manufacturing this is a
 housing block that was built in the ' 70s in
  here we 've broken the five hundred apartments up into small neighborhoods  and differentiated those neighborhoods  
 i won 't go into too much description of any of these projects but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building
 are all held up by one hundred and
 structural trusses
  because we 're using escalators to move people all of these trusses are picking up diagonal
 loads  so every one of them is a little bit 
  you move down the length of the building  so  working with
 bentley and microstation we 've written a custom piece of software that networks all of the components together into these
  so that if we change any element along the length of the building not only does that change distribute through each one of the trusses  
 but each one of the trusses then distributes that information down the length of the entire facade of the building  so it 's a single calculation
 for every single component of the building
 that we 're adding onto so it 's tens of millions of calculations just to design one connection between
  a piece of structural steel and another piece of structural steel  but what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized
 relationship of all these components one to another 
 this idea has kind of brought me into doing some product design  and it 's because
 design firms that have connections to architects like i 'm working with vitra
 which is a furniture company and alessi which is a houseware company 
 they saw this actually solving a problem this ability to differentiate components but keep them synthetic  so  
 not to pick on bmw or to celebrate them but
 take bmw as an example they have to in two thousand and
  have a distinct identity for all their models of cars so the three hundred series or whatever their newest car is the one hundred series that 's coming out 
 has to look like the seven hundred series at the other end of their product line so they need a distinct coherent identity which is bmw 
 at the same time there 's a person paying thirty thousand dollars for a 300 series car and a person paying seventy thousand dollars for a seven hundred series  and that person paying more than double
 doesn 't want their car to look too much like the  bottom of the market car so they have to also discriminate between these products  so  
 as manufacturing starts to allow more
 design options 
 this problem gets exacerbated of the whole and the parts now as an architect part to whole relationships is all i think about but in terms of product design it 's becoming more and more of
  an issue
 for companies  so  the first kind of test product we did was with alessi which was for a coffee and tea set it 's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set we 
  knew that at the beginning so i actually went to some people i knew down south in san diego and we used
  just cut a
 graphite mold  put it in an oven heat it to one thousand degrees
  gently inflate titanium that 's soft and then explode it at the last minute into this form  
 but what 's great about it is the forms are only a few hundred dollars  the titanium 's several thousand dollars but the forms are very cheap  
 so  we designed a system here
 of eight curves that could be swapped
  similar to that housing project i showed you 
 and we could recombine those together so that we always had ergonomic shapes that always had the same volume and could always be produced in the same way that 
  way  each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars  and get incredible variation in the components
  this is one of those examples of the sets 
 so for me what was important is that this coffee set which is just a coffee pot a teapot and those are the pots sitting on a tray
 that they would have a coherence so they would be greg lynn alessi coffee pots but that everyone who bought one would have a one of a kind object that was unique in some way 
 to go back to architecture what 's organic about architecture as a field unlike product design
  is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm like we have to design things which are coherent as a single object 
 but also break down into small rooms and have an identity of both the big scale and the small scale 
 architects tend to work
 with signature
  so that an architect needs a signature and that signature has to work across the scale of houses up to say skyscrapers  and that problem of signatures is a thing we 're very good at maintaining and working with 
 and intricacy which is the relationship of say  the shape of a building its structure its windows its color its pattern 
 these are real architectural problems  so  
 my kind of hero
 for this in the natural world are these tropical frogs i got
  in them because they 're the most extreme example of a surface where the texture and the
 let 's call it the decoration i know the frog doesn 't think of it as decoration but that 's how it works
 are all intricately connected to one another so a change in the form indicates a change in the color pattern  
  the pattern and the form aren 't the same thing but they really work together and are fused in some way  so  when doing
 a center for the national parks in costa rica  we tried to use that idea of a gradient color and a change in texture as the structure moves across the surface of the building  
 we also used a continuity of change from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum  so it 's all one
 continuous change in the massing but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms 
 in a housing project in valencia spain we 're doing the
 different towers of housing fused together in shared curves so you get a single mass  like a kind of monolith  but it breaks down
 into individual elements  
  can see that that change in massing also gives all forty eight of the apartments a unique shape and size  but always within a kind of controlled
 limit an envelope of change 
 i work with a group of other architects we have a company called united architects we were one of the finalists for the world trade center site design 
 and i think this just shows how
  how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large scale construction we wanted to make a kind of gothic cathedral around the footprints of the world trade center site 
 and to do that we tried to connect up
 the five towers into a single system  and we looked
  there were numerous examples of other architects trying to do the same thing 
 we really approached it at the level of the typology of the building  where we could build these five separate towers but they would all join at the  60th floor and make a kind of single monolithic mass  
 with united architects also we made a proposal for the european central bank headquarters that used the same system  
 but this time in a much more monolithic mass like a sphere
 but again you can see this kind of organic fusion of multiple building elements to make a thing which is whole but breaks down into smaller parts but in an incredibly organic way
