  is how war starts 
 one day you 're living your ordinary life  
 you 're planning to go to a party  you 're taking your children to school  you 're making a dentist appointment 
 the next thing the telephones go out
  the tvs go out there 's armed men on the street 
 there 's roadblocks your life as you know it goes into suspended animation it
 stops  
 i 'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine a bosnian friend about what happened to her 
 because i think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like 
 she was walking to work one day in
  april one thousand nine hundred and ninety two in a miniskirt and high heels she worked in a bank 
 she was a young mother  she was someone who liked to party  great person  
 and suddenly she sees a tank
 ambling down the main road of sarajevo knocking everything out of its path
  she thinks she 's dreaming  but she 's not 
 and she runs as any of us would have done and takes cover and she hides behind a trash bin 
 in her high heels and her miniskirt 
 and as she 's hiding there she 's feeling ridiculous but she 's seeing this tank go by with soldiers and people all over the place and chaos and
 she
  i feel like alice in wonderland going down the rabbit hole down down down into chaos 
 and my life will never be the same again 
 a few weeks later my friend was in a crowd of people
 pushing with her infant son in her arms
 to give him to a stranger on a bus which was one of the last buses leaving sarajevo to take children out so they could be
 and she remembers struggling with her mother to the front crowds and crowds of people take my child take my child 
 and passing her son
 to someone through a window  and she didn 't see him for years the siege went on for three and a half
  and it was a siege without water  without power without electricity without heat without food  in the middle of europe 
 in the middle of the 20th century  
 i had the honor
 of being one of those reporters that lived through that siege  
 and i say i have the honor and the privilege of being there because it 's taught me everything not just about being a reporter  but about being a human being
  i learned about compassion  i learned about ordinary people who could be heroes  
 i learned about sharing  i learned about camaraderie most of all i learned about love 
 even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos  
 i learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors  share food raise their children drag
  someone who 's being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life  
 helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take them to hospitals  
 i learned so much about myself martha gellhorn who 's one of my heroes once said you can only love one war
  i went on to cover many many many wars after that so many that i lost count  but there was nothing like sarajevo  
 last april i went back to a very strange
 what i called a deranged high school reunion 
 what it was was the 20th anniversary of the siege the beginning of the siege of sarajevo  and
 i don 't like the word
  sounds like a party and this was not a party it was a very somber gathering of
 the reporters that worked there during the war  humanitarian aid workers and of course the brave and courageous people of sarajevo themselves  
 and the thing that struck me the most that broke my heart was walking down the main street of sarajevo where my friend aida saw the tank coming twenty years ago
  and in that road
 were more than twelve thousand red chairs empty 
 and every single one of them symbolized a person who had died during the siege 
 just in sarajevo not in all of bosnia 
 and it stretched from one end of the city
 to a large part of it and the saddest for me were the tiny
  little chairs
 for the children i now cover syria  and i started reporting it
 because i believed that it needs to be done i believe a story there has to be told 
 i see again a template of the war in bosnia 
 and when i first arrived in damascus i saw this strange moment where people
 didn 't seem to believe that war was going to descend  and it was exactly the same in bosnia and nearly every other country i 've seen where war comes people don 't want to believe it 's coming 
 so they don 't leave they don 't leave before they can they don 't get their money out they stay because you want to stay in your home and then
  is a place that haunts me a lot in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four i briefly left sarajevo to go report the genocide in rwanda
  between april
 and august 
 one million people were slaughtered now if those twelve thousand chairs
  freaked me out
 with the sheer number i want you just for a second to think of a million people and to give you some example i remember
 standing and looking down a road as far as i could see at least a mile  
 and there were bodies piled twice my height
 of the dead  and that was just a small percentage of the dead  and there were mothers holding their children who had been caught in
  last death throes so we learn a lot from war  and i mention rwanda
 because it is one place like south africa where nearly twenty years on there is healing
 fifty six percent of the parliamentarians are women 
  there 's also within the national constitution now you 're actually not allowed to say hutu or tutsi you 're not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity which is of course what started the slaughter in the first place 
 and an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story or i find it beautiful there was a group of children 
 mixed hutus and tutsis and a group of women who were adopting them
  and they lined up and one was just given to the next 
 there was no kind of compensation for you 're a tutsi you 're a hutu  you might have killed my mother you might have killed my father 
 they were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation  and i find this remarkable 
 so when people ask me how i continue to cover war and why i continue to do
  it this is why when i go back to syria next week in fact what i see
 is incredibly heroic people some of them fighting for democracy for things we take for granted every single day 
 and that 's pretty much why i do it 
 in two thousand and four i had a little baby boy
  call him my miracle child because
 after seeing so much death and destruction and chaos and darkness in my life  this
 ray of hope was born  and i called him luca  which means the bringer of light because he does bring light to
  but i 'm talking about him because when he was four months old 
 my foreign editor forced me to go back to baghdad where i had been reporting all throughout the saddam regime and during the fall of baghdad and afterwards  
 and i remember getting on the plane in tears  crying to be separated from my son 
 and while i was there a quite famous iraqi politician who was a friend of mine said to me
 why aren 't you home with luca and i said well i have to see it was two thousand and four which was the beginning of the
 incredibly bloody time in iraq i have to see  i have to see what is happening here i have to report it and he said 
 go home because if you miss his first tooth
  if you miss his first step you 'll never forgive yourself but there will always be another war 
 and there sadly will always be wars  
 and i am deluding myself if i think as a journalist as a reporter as a writer what i do
 can stop them i can 't  i 'm not kofi annan he can 't stop a war he tried to negotiate syria and couldn 't do it  i 'm not a
  conflict resolution person  
 i 'm not even a humanitarian aid doctor and i can 't tell you the times of how helpless i 've felt to have people dying in front of me and i couldn 't save them 
 all i am is a witness 
 my role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless 
 a colleague of mine described it as to shine a light in the darkest corners of the world
 and that 's what i try to do i
 'm not always successful 
 and sometimes it 's incredibly frustrating because you feel like you 're writing into a void or you feel like no one cares who
 cares about syria who cares about bosnia who cares about the congo the ivory coast liberia sierra leone 
  all of these strings of places that
 i will remember for the rest of my life  
 but my mtier is to bear witness and that is the crux the heart of the matter for us reporters who do this 
 and all i can really do is hope not to policymakers or politicians because as much as i 'd like to have faith that they
 read my words
  and do something i don 't delude myself but what i do hope
 is that if you remember anything i said or any of my stories tomorrow morning over breakfast if you can remember the story of sarajevo 
 or the story of rwanda 
 then i 've done my job  thank you very much
