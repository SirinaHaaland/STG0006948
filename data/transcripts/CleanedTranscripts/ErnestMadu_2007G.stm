  it is interesting that in the united states the most significant health care budget goes to cardiovascular disease care whether it 's private or public
 there 's no comparison at all in africa where it is a major killer it is totally
 ignored  and that situation cannot be right we must do something about it a health status of a nation
 parallels development of that nation 
 seventeen million people die every year from heart disease
 thirty two million heart attacks and strokes occur most of this is in developing countries and the majority is in africa
 eighty five percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries not in the west and yet ninety percent of the resources are in the west who is at risk 
 people like you it 's not just the africans that should be concerned about that all friends of africa  that will have reason to be in africa at some point in time should be very concerned
 about this deplorable situation has anyone here wondered what will happen if you go back to your room at night and you start getting chest pains shortness of breath  
 sweating  you 're having a heart attack 
 what are you going to do 
 will you fly back to the u s germany  europe no you will die fifty percent will die within
  this is what 's going on 
 in a look at the map of the u s the graph here ten million people here ten million here  by the time you get to fifty it
 's almost no one left in nigeria life expectancy is 
  not because some people don 't survive childhood illnesses they do but they do not survive after
  the time that they reach about forty five years old and fifty years old and those are the times they 're most productive those are the times that they should be contributing to africa 's development
  but they 're not there the best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents  
 if you cannot secure the parents  you cannot guarantee the security of the african child
  what are the risk factors it 's very well known i 'm not going to spend a lot of time on those these are just for information hypertension diabetes obesity lack of exercise the usual suspects 
 right here in tanzania  thirty percent of individuals have hypertension 
 we 'll save two hundred and fifty thousand lives a year  that 's quite significant  easy to treat look at the situation in mauritius in eight short years we 're here talking 
  about hiv  malaria  which is all good  we cannot make the mistakes we 've made with malaria and hiv in eight short years
  diseases will become the leading causes of death in africa  
 that is something to keep in mind we can 't deal with it with situations like this this is a typical african hospital 
 we can 't depend on the elites they go to
 usa  germany  u k for treatment  unbelievable  you can 't depend on foreign aid alone here is the situation
  united states has had a lot of trouble to deal with their own internal issues  so they spend their money trying to fix those problems  you can 't rightly it 's not their responsibility 
 it is my responsibility  i have to take care of my own problems if they help  that 's good  but that is not my expectation 
  've always done them  if they have not worked  we have to look for alternative solutions i 'm here to talk to you about solutions 
 this has been what has been a difficult sign to some of us  
 several years ago we started thinking about it  everyone knows the problem no one knows what the solutions are 
 we decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is everyone
  is ready to throw in money in terms of free money aid to developing countries talk about sustainable investment no one is interested 
 you can 't raise money  i have done businesses in healthcare in the united states i live in nashville tennessee health care capital of america [ it 's ] very easy to raise money for health care ventures  but start telling them  you know we 're going to try to do it in nigeria everyone runs away
  that is totally wrong those of you in the audience here if you want to help africa  invest money in sustainable development  
 let me lead you through a day in the life of the heart institute so you get a glimpse of what we do and
  health care comparable to the best anywhere in the world can be done in a developing country environment  we have twenty five positions right now all of them
 trained  board certified in the usa canada or
  we have every modality that can be done in vanderbilt cleveland clinic everywhere in the  u s and we do it for about ten percent of the cost that
 you will need to do those things in the united states 
 additionally we have a policy that no one is ever turned away because of
  whether you have one dollar two dollars it doesn 't matter  
 and i will tell you how we 're able to do it  we make sure that we select our equipment properly  we go for modular units units that
  functions have modular components  easy to repair and because of that we do not take things
  not durable and cannot last we emphasize training  and we make sure that this process is regenerative very soon we will all be dead and gone but the problems will stay unless we have people taking over from where we stopped  
 we made sure that we produced some things ourselves  we do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals  we get the generators from the companies  we manufacture them
  that keeps the costs down  so for a radiopharmaceutical in the  u s that you 'll get a unit dose for two hundred and fifty dollars when we 're finished manufacturing it in house we come at a price of about two dollars 
 we recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and
  all these problems we 're talking about if we bring development they will all disappear 
 technology is a great equalizer how do we make it work it 
 it extends opportunity to the rural centers  and we can use expertise in a very smart way 
 this is the way our centers are set up we currently have three locations
  planning a fourth one and we have now decided to go into africa  we will be doing
 the west african heart institute in port harcourt  nigeria that project will be starting within the next few months  we hope to open in 
 and we will do other centers 
 this model can be adapted to every disease process all the units all the centers are linked through a switched hub to
 a central server and all the images are
  to review stations  and we designed this telemedicine solution it 's proprietary to us  and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone who is interested in doing it  you can still be profitable 
 we make sure that
 the telemedicine platform gives access to expert medical
 specialists anywhere in
  click of the button  i 'll lead you through to see how this happens this is at the heart institute the doctors from anywhere can log in i can call you in switzerland
  and say listen go into our system look at mrs jones  look at the study tell me what you think they 'll give me that information  and we 'll make the care of the patient
  have to experience the anxiety of not knowing because of limited expertise 
 we also use [ an ] electronic medical record system  i 'm happy to say that the things we have implemented
 eighty percent of  u s practices do not have them and yet the technology is there but you know they have that
  if you can 't get it in nashville  you can travel to birmingham two hours away and you 'll get it  if you can 't get it in cleveland you can go to cincinnati  we don 't have that luxury 
  so we have to make it happen when we do it  we will put the cost of care down and we 'll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable and everyone will get the care they deserve  
  we emphasize that but you know  you have to tell people what can be done it 's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive  and they 
  go home and can 't do it  they need to be alive they need to feed  we recommend exercise as the most effective  simple  easy thing to do we have had walks every year every march april  we form
  into groups and make them go into challenges  which group loses the most weight  we give them prizes  which groups record more walking distance by pedometer 
  we give them prizes  we do this constantly  we encourage them to bring children  that way we start exposing the children from very early on on what these issues are because once they learn it  they will stay with it
  in doing this we have created at least one hundred skilled jobs in jamaica alone and these are physicians with expertise and special training  we have taken care of over 
  one thousand indigent patients that could have died  including four free pacemakers in patients with complete heart block for those that understand cardiology complete heart block means certain death 
  we are pleased with that indirectly  we have saved the government of jamaica five million dollars from people that would have gone to miami or atlanta for care and
 we 've hopefully saved a lot of lives 
 by the end of this year  we would have contributed over one million dollars in indigent care in the first four
  's been three hundred and forty thousand dollars averaging eighty five thousand dollars a month the government will not do that because they have competing needs they need to put resources elsewhere 
 but we can still do it people say how can you do that this is how we can do that at least four thousand rich jamaicans that were heading to miami for treatment have
 that they did not go to miami because of the heart institute of the caribbean and
  if they went to miami they will spend significantly more eight to ten times more and they feel happy spending it at home getting the same quality of care 
 and for that money for every one patient that has the money to pay  it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the
  for this to work  this progress must be sustainable  so we emphasize training training is critical  we have gone further  we have formed a relationship 
 with the university of technology jamaica where i now have an appointment  and we are starting a biomedical engineering program  so that we will train people locally who can repair
 not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues we 're also starting ancillary health care technology training programs training people in
 echocardiography cardiac ultrasound those kinds of things now with that kind of training  it gives people motivation because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging
  senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care at the university hospital of the west indies  
 i came to the heart institute in two thousand and six  as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program 
  three months at the heart institute there 's been no doubt around my colleagues
 about the utility of the training i received here and i think there 's been an
 increased interest now in particularly in echocardiography
 and its use in our setting sharon lazarus i am an echocardiographer at the heart institute of the caribbean  since the past two years
 i received training at this institution i think this aspect of
  training in cardiology that the heart institute of the caribbean has introduced in jamaica is
 very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases ernest madu the lesson in this
 is that it can be done and it can be sustained
  you can make it possible for everyone who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care  
 when have have you been appointed to play god  
 it is not my decision my job is to make sure that every person no matter what
 fate has assigned to you will have the opportunity to get the best
 quality health care in life next stop is west african heart institute
  be doing in port harcourt nigeria  as i said before  we will do other centers
 across west africa  we will extend the same system into other areas like dialysis treatment  and anyone who is interested in doing it in any 
  health care situation  we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we 've
  we do this
