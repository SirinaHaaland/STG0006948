  i thought i would start with a very brief history of cities  settlements typically began
 with people clustered around a well and the size of that settlement was roughly the distance you could walk with a pot of water on your head in fact  if you fly over
 germany for example and you look down and you see these hundreds of little villages they 're all about a mile apart  you needed easy access to the fields 
 and for hundreds even thousands of years  the home was really the center of life  life was very small for most people  
 it was a center of entertainment
  of energy production of work a center of health care that 's where babies were born and people died 
 then with industrialization everything started to become centralized you had dirty factories that were moved to the outskirts of cities 
 production was centralized in assembly plants  you had centralized energy production learning took place in schools health care took place
 in hospitals
 and then you had networks that developed you had water sewer networks
 that allowed for this kind of unchecked expansion  you had
 separated functions increasingly you had rail networks that connected residential industrial commercial areas you had auto networks in fact the
  was really give everybody a car build roads to everything and give people a place to park when they get there it was not a very functional model and we still
 we still live in that world and this is what we end up with  
 so you have the sprawl of la the sprawl of mexico city  
 you have these unbelievable new cities in china  which you might call tower sprawl they 're all building cities on the model that
  which is really obsolete i would argue and there are hundreds and hundreds of new cities that are being planned all over the world 
 in china alone  three hundred million people some say four hundred million people will move to the city over the next fifteen years that means building the
 equivalent of the entire built infrastructure of the us in fifteen years imagine that 
 and we should all care about this whether you live in cities
 cities or not cities will account for ninety percent of the population growth eighty percent of the global
  percent of energy use but at the same time it 's
 where people want to be increasingly  
 more than half the people now in the world live in cities  
 and that will just continue to escalate cities are places of celebration personal expression you have the flash mobs of pillow fights that
 i 've been to a couple they 're quite fun
 cities are where most most of the wealth is created and particularly in the developing world it 's where women find opportunities that 's a lot of the reason why cities are growing very quickly 
 now there 's some trends that will impact cities first of all work is becoming distributed and mobile the office building is basically obsolete for doing private work 
  once again because of distributed computation communication is becoming a center of life so it 's a center of
 production and learning and shopping and health care and all of
 these things that we used to think of as taking place outside of the home  
 and increasingly everything that people buy every consumer product in one way or another can be personalized
 and that 's a very important trend to think about so this is my image of the city of the future
 laughter in that it 's a place for people  you know  maybe not the way people dress but
 you know the question now is how can we have all the good things that we
 identify with cities without all the bad things 
 this is bangalore it took me a couple of hours to get a few miles in bangalore last year so with cities you also have congestion and pollution and disease and all these negative things how can we have the good stuff
  without the bad so we we went back and started looking at the great cities that evolved before the cars  paris was a series of these little villages
 that came together and you still see that structure today the twenty arrondissements of paris are these little neighborhoods 
 most of what people need in life can be within a five or 10 minute walk 
 and if you look at the data when you have that kind of a structure you get a very even distribution of the
  shops and the physicians and the pharmacies and the cafes
 in paris and then you look at cities that evolved after the automobile and it 's not that kind of a pattern there 's very little that 's within a five minute walk
 of most areas of places like pittsburgh not to pick on pittsburgh but most american cities really have have evolved
  let 's look at new cities and we 're involved in a couple of new city projects in china  
 so we said let 's start with that neighborhood cell we think of it as a compact urban cell so provide most of what most people want
 within that 20 minute walk this can also be a resilient electrical microgrid community heating  power  
 communication networks etc can be concentrated there  stewart brand
  right in the center  probably  and he might be right and then we we can form in effect a mesh network it 's something of an internet typology
 pattern  so you can have a series of these neighborhoods  you can dial up the density about twenty thousand people per cell if it 's cambridge go up to fifty thousand if it 's manhattan density you connect everything with mass transit
 and you provide most of what most people
 need within that neighborhood you can begin to develop a whole
  typology of streetscapes and the the
 vehicles that can go on them i won 't go through all of them i 'll just show one  this is boulder it 's a great example of kind of a mobility parkway a superhighway for joggers and 
 bicyclists where you can go from one end of the city to the other without crossing the street  
  i 'll get into in a minute this is even a more interesting solution in seoul korea they took the elevated highway they got rid of it they reclaimed the street  
 the river down below below the street  and you can go from one end of seoul to the other without crossing a pathway for cars  
 the high line in manhattan
 is very similar  you have these
 rapidly emerging bike lanes all over the world i lived in manhattan for fifteen years i went back
 a couple of weekends ago took this photograph of these fabulous new bike lanes
 that they have installed 
 they 're still not to where copenhagen is 
 where something like forty two percent of the trips within the city are by bicycle it 's mostly just because they have fantastic infrastructure there  
 we actually did exactly the wrong thing in boston 
 the big dig
  so we got rid of the highway but we we created a traffic island  and
 it 's certainly not a mobility pathway for anything other than cars
  mobility on demand is something we 've been thinking about so we think we need an ecosystem of these shared use vehicles connected to mass transit 
 these are some of the vehicles that we 've been working on
  but shared use is really key if you share a vehicle you can have at least four people use one vehicle as opposed to one 
 we have hubway here in boston the vlib ' system
 in paris 
 we 've been developing at the media lab this little city car that is optimized for shared use in cities 
 we got rid of all the useless things like engines and
  we moved everything to the wheels  so you have the drive motor the steering motor the breaking all in the wheel  
 that left the chassis unencumbered so you can do things like fold so you can fold this little vehicle up
 to occupy a tiny little footprint this was a video that was on european television last week showing the spanish
 minister of industry driving this little vehicle and when it 's
  can spin you don 't need reverse you don 't need
 parallel parking you just spin and go directly in so
 we 've been working with a company to commercialize this my phd student ryan chin presented these early ideas
 two years ago at a tedx conference
  so what 's interesting is then if you begin to add new things to it like autonomy you get out of the car  you park at your destination you
 pat it on the butt it goes and it parks itself it charges itself and you can get something like seven times as many vehicles
 in a given area as conventional cars and we think this is the future actually we could do this today  it 's not really
 a problem we can combine shared use and folding and autonomy and we get something like twenty eight times the land utilization
 with that kind of strategy
  one of our graduate students then says well  how does a driverless car communicate
 with pedestrians  you have nobody to make eye contact with you don 't know if it 's going to run you over so he 's developing strategies so the vehicle can communicate with pedestrians so 
 so the headlights are eyeballs the pupils can dilate we have directional audio we can throw sound
 directly at people what i love about this project is he solved a problem that doesn 't exist yet so
 we also think that
 we can democratize access to bike lanes you know bike lanes are mostly used by young guys in stretchy pants so 
 we think we can develop a vehicle that operates on bike lanes accessible to elderly and disabled 
 women in skirts  businesspeople 
 and address the issues of energy congestion mobility aging and obesity simultaneously that 's our
  challenge  this is an early design for this little three wheel it 's an electronic bike  you have to pedal to operate it in a bike lane 
 but if you 're an older person that 's a switch if you 're
 a healthy person you might have to work really hard to go fast you can dial in forty calories going into work and five hundred going home when you can take a shower 
 we hope to have that built
 this fall
  is another area where we can really improve  
 mayor menino in boston says lack of affordable housing for young people is one of the biggest problems the city faces  
 developers say ok we 'll build little teeny apartments people say we don 't really
 want to live in a little teeny conventional apartment  so we 're saying  let 's build
 a standardized chassis much like our car  let 's bring advanced
  technology into the apartment
 infill give people the tools within this
  open loft chassis to go through a process of defining what their needs and values and activities are 
 and then a matching algorithm will match a unique assembly of integrated infill components furniture and cabinetry that
 are personalized
 to that individual and they give them the tools to go through the process and to refine it and it 's something like working with an architect where the dialogue starts when you give
 an alternative to a person to react to now the most interesting
 implementation of that for us is when you can begin to have robotic walls so your your space can convert from exercise to a
  workplace if you run a virtual company  you have guests over  you have two guest rooms that are developed  you
 have a conventional one bedroom arrangement when you need it maybe that 's most of the time you have a dinner party the table folds out to fit sixteen people in
 otherwise a conventional one bedroom or maybe you want a dance studio i mean architects have been thinking about these ideas for a long time what
  to do now develop things that can scale
 to those three hundred million chinese people that would like to live in the city and very comfortably  
 we think we can make a very small apartment that functions as if it 's twice as big
 by utilizing these strategies i don 't believe in smart homes
  that 's sort of a bogus concept  i think you have to build dumb homes and put smart stuff in it and
 so we 've been working on a chassis
 of the wall itself  you know standardized platform with the motors
 and the battery when it operates little solenoids that will lock it in place and get low voltage power  
 we think this can all be standardized and then people can personalize the stuff that goes into that wall and like the car we can integrate all
  of sensing to be aware of human activity so if there 's a baby or a puppy in the way  you won 't have a problem so
 the developers say well this is great ok so if we have a conventional building we have a fixed envelope maybe we can put in fourteen units 
 if they function as if they 're twice as big we can get twenty eight units in 
 that means twice as much parking though parking 's really expensive it 's about
  seventy thousand dollars per space to build a conventional parking spot inside a building  so if you can have
 folding and autonomy  you can do that in one seventh of the space that goes down to ten thousand dollars per car just for the cost of the parking  you add shared use and
 you can even go further 
 we can also integrate all kinds of advanced technology through this process there 's a path to market
 for innovative companies to bring technology into the home in this case a project we 're doing with siemens  
 we have sensors on all the furniture all the infill that understands where people are and what they 're doing blue light is very efficient so we have these tunable 
 lighting fixtures it recognizes where the person is what they 're doing  fills out the light when necessary to full spectrum
  white light and
 saves maybe thirty forty percent in energy consumption we think over even conventional state of the art
 lighting systems  this just shows you the data that comes from the sensors that are embedded in the furniture we don 't really believe in cameras to do things
 in homes we think these little wireless sensors
 are more effective
 we think we can also personalize sunlight that 's sort of the ultimate personalization in some ways so we we 've looked at articulating mirrors of the facade that can throw shafts of sunlight
 anywhere into the space therefore allowing you to shade most of the glass on a hot day like today  
 in this case she picks up her phone she can map food preparation at the kitchen island to a particular location of
  sunlight an algorithm will keep it in that location as long as she 's engaged in that activity  this can be combined with  led lighting as well  
 we think workplaces should be shared i mean this is really the workplace of the future i think this is starbucks you know  maybe a third
 and you see everybody has their back to the wall and they have food
  they 're in their own little personal bubble 
 we need shared spaces for interaction and collaboration we 're not doing a very good job with that 
 at the cambridge innovation center you can have shared desks  
 i 've spent a lot of time in finland at the design factory of aalto university where the they have a shared shop and shared fab lab 
 shared quiet spaces
 electronics spaces recreation
  we think ultimately all of this stuff can come together 
 a new model for mobility a new model for housing a new model for how we live and work a path to market for advanced technologies  but in the end the 
  main thing we need to focus on are people cities are all about people they 're places for people 
  same time dramatically reducing co2 and energy it 's a global imperative we have to get this right  thank you
