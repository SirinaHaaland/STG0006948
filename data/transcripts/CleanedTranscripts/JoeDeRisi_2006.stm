  how can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us and aid medicine 
 how can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology
 into a
  i want to turn everything we know right now about detecting viruses and the spectrum of viruses that are out there into let 's say a small chip  when we started thinking about this project 
 how we would make a single diagnostic assay to screen for all pathogens simultaneously
  're also
 evolving very fast this is a picornavirus picornaviruses these are things that include the common cold and polio things like this you 're looking at the outside shell of the virus 
  and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evolving very very fast and the blue parts are not evolving very fast when people think about making pan viral detection reagents usually
  problem that 's an issue because how can we detect things if they 're always changing but evolution is a balance
  where you have fast change  you also have
 things that almost never change  
 and so we looked into this a little more carefully  and i 'm going to show you data now this is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop i took a bunch of these small picornaviruses like the common cold like polio and so on 
 and i just broke them down into small
  and so took this first example which is called coxsackievirus  and just break it into small windows  and i 'm coloring these small windows blue if another virus shares an identical sequence in its genome to that virus  
 these sequences right up here which don 't even code for protein by the way are almost absolutely identical across all of these so i could use this sequence as 
  a marker to detect a wide spectrum of viruses  without having to make something individual now over
  here there 's great diversity  that 's where things are evolving fast down here you can see slower evolution less diversity  now by the time we get out here to let 's say  acute bee paralysis virus probably a bad one to have if you 're a bee 
 this virus shares almost no similarity to coxsackievirus  but i can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved among these viruses on the
  screen are in identical regions right up here  and so we can encapsulate these regions of
  through evolution how these viruses evolved
 by just choosing dna elements or rna elements in these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents  
 ok so that 's what we did but how are we going to do that well for a long time since i was in graduate school i 've been messing around making dna chips that is  printing dna
 on glass and that 's what you see here these little salt spots are just dna tacked onto glass  and so i can put thousands of these on our glass chip and use them as a detection reagent  we took our
  chip over to hewlett packard and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots and this is what you see you can actually see the strands of dna lying flat on the glass here so what we 're doing is just printing dna on glass little flat things and these are going to be markers for
  pathogens  
 ok  i make little robots in lab to make these chips  and i 'm really big on disseminating technology if you 've got enough money to buy just a camry you can build one 
  of these too  and so we put a deep how to guide on the web  totally free with basically order off the shelf parts you can build a dna array machine in your garage here 's the section on the all important emergency stop switch
 every important machine 's got to have a big red button  but really it 's pretty robust you can actually be making dna chips in your
 in your garage and decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly it 's a lot of fun 
 laughter and so what we did  and this is  a really cool project we just started by making a respiratory virus chip
  situation where you go into the clinic and you don 't get diagnosed well we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses on one chip and we threw in herpes virus for good measure i mean why not the
 first thing you do as a scientist is you make sure stuff works  and so what we did is we take tissue culture cells
 and infect them with various viruses and we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid the genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells mostly viral stuff and stick it on the array to see where
  it sticks now if the dna sequences match they 'll stick together and so we can look at spots and if spots light up we know there 's a certain virus in there that 's what one of these chips really looks like and these red spots are in 
  fact signals coming from the virus  and each spot represents a different family of virus or species of virus  
  what we did is we took tissue culture cells and infected them with adenovirus and you can see this little yellow barcode next to adenovirus and likewise we infected them with 
  's a paramyxovirus and you see a little barcode here and then we did respiratory syncytial virus  that 's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere it 's like boogeremia basically 
  you can see that this barcode is the same family but it 's distinct from parainfluenza 3 which gives you a very bad cold and so we 're getting unique signatures a fingerprint for each virus 
  polio and rhino they 're in the same family very close to each other rhino 's the common cold and you all know what polio is  and you can see that these signatures are distinct and  kaposi 's sarcoma associated herpes virus gives a nice signature down here  and so it is not any one
 stripe or something that tells me i have a virus of a particular type here  it 's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing 
 all right i can see a rhinovirus and here 's the blow up of the rhinovirus 's little barcode but what about different rhinoviruses how do i know which rhinovirus i have there 're one hundred and two known variants of the common 
  cold and there 're only one hundred and two because people got bored collecting them there are just new ones every year  and so  here are four different rhinoviruses and you can see even with your eye without any fancy
  algorithms that you can distinguish each one of these barcodes from each other now this is kind of a cheap shot because i know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is and i in fact designed the chip 
 expressly to be able to tell them apart but what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer we don 't know what the sequence is just pull them out of the field 
  we never knew anything about no one 's ever sequenced them and you can also see that you get unique and distinguishable patterns you can imagine building up some library whether real or virtual of fingerprints of essentially every virus  but that 's  
 again  shooting fish in a barrel you know right you have tissue culture cells there are a ton of viruses what about real people you can 't control real people as you probably know you have no idea what someone 's going to cough into a cup 
  and it 's probably really complex right 
 it could have lots of bacteria it could have more than one virus and it certainly has host genetic material so
 how do we deal with this and how do we do the positive control here  well  it 's pretty simple  that 's me getting a nasal lavage  and the idea is  
 let 's experimentally inoculate people with virus this is all irb approved by the way  
 they got paid  and basically we experimentally inoculate people with the common cold virus or even better
  let 's just take people right out of the emergency room undefined 
 respiratory tract infections you have no idea what walks in through the door so let 's start off with the positive control first where we know the person was healthy  they got a shot of virus up the nose  let 's see what happens day zero  nothing happening 
 they 're healthy they 're clean it 's amazing actually we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses even when you 're walking around healthy it 's pretty clean if you 're healthy
  day two we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern and it 's very similar to what we get in the lab doing our tissue culture experiment  so that 's great  but again  cheap shot right we put a ton of virus up this guy 's nose  so 
 so how about the people who walk in off the street here are two individuals represented by their anonymous id codes  they both have rhinoviruses we
  never seen this pattern in lab we sequenced part of their viruses they 're new rhinoviruses no one 's actually even seen remember 
  sequences we 're using on this array allow us to detect even novel or uncharacterized viruses 
 because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution here 's another guy you can play the diagnosis game yourself here these different blocks represent the different viruses in this paramyxovirus family
  down the blocks and see where the signal is well doesn 't have canine distemper that 's probably good 
 laughter but by the time you get to block nine you see that respiratory syncytial virus maybe they have kids and then you can see also the family member that 's related rsvb 
  is showing up here so that 's great here 's another individual  sampled on two separate days repeat visits to the clinic 
  can see that there 's a little stripe over here for sendai virus  that 's mouse parainfluenza 
 the genetic relationships are very close there  
 that 's a lot of fun  so we built out the chip we made a chip that has every known virus ever discovered on it  why not every plant virus every insect virus every marine virus  everything that we could get out of genbank that is the national repository of sequences 
 now we 're using this chip and what are we using it for well  first of all
  you have a big chip like this you need a little bit more informatics so we designed the system to do automatic diagnosis and the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns because we 're never going to get samples of every virus it would 
  be virtually impossible but we can get virtual patterns and compare them to our observed result which is a very complex mixture and come up with some sort of score of how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something 
 a cell culture that 's chronically infected with papilloma you get a little computer readout here  and our algorithm says it 's probably papilloma type eighteen  and that is in fact what these particular cell cultures are chronically infected with so let 's do something a little bit harder  
 we put the beeper in the clinic when somebody shows up and the hospital doesn 't know what to do because they can 't diagnose it they call us  that 's the idea and we 're setting this up in the bay area and so this case report happened three weeks
  ago  we have a 28 year old healthy woman no travel history [ unclear ] doesn 't smoke doesn 't drink
 10 day history of fevers night sweats bloody sputum she 's coughing up blood muscle pain she went to the clinic and they gave her
 antibiotics
 and then sent her home she came back after ten days of fever right still has the fever  and she 's hypoxic she doesn 't have much oxygen in her lungs they did a
  scan a normal lung is all sort of dark and black here all this white stuff it 's not good this sort of tree and bud formation indicates there 's inflammation  there 's likely to be infection  ok  
 so the patient was treated then with a 
  cephalosporin antibiotic and doxycycline  and on day three it didn 't help she
 progressed to acute failure  they had to intubate her so they put a tube down her throat and they began to mechanically ventilate her she could no longer breathe for herself 
 what to do next don 't know switch antibiotics so they switched to another antibiotic tamiflu it 's not clear why they thought she had the flu  but they switched to tamiflu  and 
  on day six they basically threw in the towel you do an open lung biopsy when you 've got no other options there 's an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this procedure  and so basically and what do they learn from it
  looking at her open lung biopsy  and i 'm no pathologist but you can 't tell much from this all you can tell is there 's a lot of swelling  bronchiolitis it was unrevealing that 's the pathologist 's report  
 and so what did they test her for they have their own tests of course  and so they tested her for over seventy different assays for every sort of bacteria and fungus and viral assay you can buy off the shelf sars metapneumovirus
 everything came back negative  over one hundred thousand dollars worth of tests i
 mean they went to the max for this woman  and basically on hospital day eight  that 's when they called us they gave us endotracheal aspirate you know a little fluid from the throat from this tube that they got down there
 and they gave us this we put it on the chip  what do we see well  we saw
  no one cares about it in fact  
 it 's not even really sequenced that much there 's just a little bit of it sequenced there 's almost no epidemiology or studies on it 
 no one would even consider it  because no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure  and why is that just lore  there 's no data no data to support whether it causes severe 
 or mild disease  clearly we have a case of a healthy person that 's going down  
  report i 'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes that 's unpublished it 's going to come out tomorrow and it 's an interesting case of how you might use this chip to find something new and open a new door prostate cancer i
 don 't need to give you many statistics about prostate cancer  most of you already know it  third leading cause of cancer deaths in the u s 
 lots of risk factors but there is a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer
  for maybe about ten percent of prostate cancer  
 there are folks that are predisposed to it and the first gene that was mapped in association studies for this
 early onset prostate cancer was this gene called rnasel what is that it 's an antiviral defense enzyme 
 so we 're sitting around and thinking why would men who have the mutation
 a defect in an antiviral defense system get prostate cancer
  make sense unless maybe there 's a virus so we put tumors and now we have over one hundred tumors
 on our array  and we know who 's got defects in rnasel and who doesn 't and i 'm showing you the signal from the chip here  
 and i 'm showing you for the block of retroviral oligos and what i 'm telling you here from the
  that men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme and have a tumor 
 often have forty percent of the time a signature which reveals a new retrovirus  
 ok that 's pretty wild  what is it so we clone the whole virus
 first of all i 'll tell you that a little automated prediction told us it was very similar to a mouse virus  
 but that doesn 't tell us too much so we actually clone the whole thing and the viral genome i 'm showing you right here  it 's a classic gamma retrovirus but it
  totally new no one 's ever seen it before its closest relative is in fact from mice  and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus because it 's infecting a species other than mice  
 and this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it 's related to other viruses viruses we 've done it for many patients now  and we can say that they 're all
  independent infections they all have the same virus  but they 're different enough that there 's reason to believe that they 've been independently acquired is it really in the tissue and i 'll end up with this yes  
  we take slices of these biopsies of tumor tissue and use material to actually locate the virus  and we find cells here with viral particles in them these guys really do have this virus
