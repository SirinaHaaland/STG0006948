  i have to say that i 'm very glad to be here i understand we have
 over eighty countries here so that 's a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries in each country i 'm sure you have this thing called the parent teacher
  not the ones for your kids but the one you had as a child where your parents come to school and your teacher talks to your parents and it 's a little bit awkward  
 well i remember in third grade i had this moment where my father who never takes off from work he 's a classical blue collar
 a working class immigrant person going to school to see his son how he 's doing and the teacher said
  you know john
 is good at math and art and he kind of nodded  you know  
 the next day i saw him talking to a customer at our tofu store  and he said you know  john 's good at math 
 and that always stuck with me all my life  why didn 't dad say art why wasn 't it okay  
 why it became a question my entire life and
 that 's all right because being good at math meant he bought me a computer and some of
  remember this computer this was my first computer who had an apple ii apple ii users very cool as you remember the apple ii did nothing at all you 'd
 plug it in you 'd type in it and green text would come out it would say you 're wrong most of the time that was the computer we knew  that computer is a computer that
 i learned about going to mit my father 's dream
  i learned about the computer at all levels 
 and after i went to art school to get away from computers and i began to think about the computer as more of a spiritual space of thinking  
 and
 i was influenced by performance art so this is
 twenty years ago i made a computer out of people it was called the human powered computer experiment i have a power
  i built this in kyoto the old capital of japan  
 it 's a room broken in two halves i 've turned the computer on and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk
 built out of cardboard  and it 's put into the computer  
 and the floppy disk drive person wears it she finds the first sector on the disk and
 takes data off the disk and passes it off to of course the bus so the bus diligently
 carries the data
 into the computer to the memory to the cpu the vram etc and it 's an actual working computer that 's a bus really 
 and it looks kind of fast that 's a mouse driver where it 's xy 
 it looks like it 's happening kind of quickly but it 's actually a very slow computer and when i realized how slow
  this computer was compared to how fast a computer is it made me wonder about computers and technology in general 
 and so i 'm going to talk today about four things really the first three things are about how i 've been curious about technology design and art and how they intersect how they overlap  
 and also a topic that i 've taken on since four years ago i became the president of rhode island school of design
  talk about how i 've looked to combine these four areas into a kind of a synthesis a kind of experiment  so
 starting from technology 
 technology is a wonderful thing when that apple ii came out  it really could do nothing it could show text and
 after we waited a bit  we had these things called images  remember when images were first possible
  and then the browser appeared the browser was great  but the browser was very primitive very narrow bandwidth text first then images  we waited
  you see this little pattern here we 're kind of stuck in a loop perhaps and this sense of possibility from computing is something i 've been questioning for the last
 ten or so years and
  have looked to design as we understand most things and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine 
 and i have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson
 designers talk about the relationship between form and content content and form now what does that mean  well  content is the word
  it 's a kind of a bad feeling word  fear  
 fear is set in light helvetica  so it 's not too stressful  and if you set it in ultra light helvetica  it 's like oh fear who cares right 
 you take the same ultra light helvetica and make it big and like whoa that hurts fear  so you can see how you change the scale you change the
  content is the same but you feel differently  
 you change the typeface to like this typeface and it 's kind of funny it 's like pirate typeface  like captain jack sparrow typeface arr fear like aww that 's not fearful that 's actually funny  
 or fear like this kind of a nightclub typeface like we gotta go to fear
  titanic and you feel sorry for the letters like i feel the fear  you feel for them  
 or you change the typeface to something like this it 's very classy it 's like that that expensive restaurant fear  i can never get in there it
 's just amazing fear  
 but that 's form content if you just change one letter in that content you get a much better word  much better content
 free free is a great word you can serve it almost any way 
 free bold feels like mandela free it 's like yes  i can be free  
 free even light feels kind of like ah i can breathe in free it feels great or even free spread out  it 's like ah i can breathe in free  so easily  
 and i can add in a blue gradient and a dove  and i have like  don draper
  free so
 you see that form content design it works that way it 's a powerful thing it 's like magic almost like the magicians we 've seen at
 ted it 's magic design does that  
 and i 've been curious about how design and technology intersect and i 'm going to show you some old work i never really show anymore to give you a sense of what i used to
  so i made a lot of work in the ' 90s this was a square that responds to sound people ask me why i made that it 's not clear  laughter
 but i thought it 'd be neat for the square
 to respond to me and my kids were small then and
  computer respond to sound and it was really at the time i was wondering why doesn 't the computer respond to sound  so i made this as a kind of an experiment at the time  and then
 i spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this and i stopped doing it because my students at mit got so much
  hang up my mouse but in ' ninety six i made my last piece  it was in black and white monochrome fully monochrome all in integer mathematics it 's called tap type write it 's
 paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter that my mother used to
 type on all the time as a legal secretary  it has ten variations
  i love the french film the red balloon great movie right i love that movie
  show this last one this is about balance you know it 's kind of stressful typing out so if you type on this keyboard you can like balance it out 
 if you hit g life 's okay  so i always say hit g and it 's going to be
  was twenty years ago  and
 i
 was always on the periphery of art  by being president of risd i 've gone deep into art and art is a wonderful thing  fine art pure art you know 
 when people say i don 't get art  i don 't get it at all that means art is working  you know it 's like art is supposed to be enigmatic
 that 's great 
 art does that because art is about asking questions questions that may not be answerable at
 risd we have this amazing facility called the edna lawrence nature lab  it has eighty thousand samples of animal 
 bone  mineral plants  you know in rhode island if an animal gets hit on the road they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it 
 and why do we have this facility
  because at risd you have to look at the actual animal the object to understand its volume to perceive it at risd you 're not allowed to draw from an image 
 and many people ask me john couldn 't you just digitize all this make it all digital wouldn 't it be better  
 and i often say well  there 's something good to how things used to be done there 's something very different about it something we should figure out what is good about how we did it
  even in this new era  
 and i have a good friend he 's a new media artist named tota hasegawa he 's based in london no actually it 's in tokyo but when he was based in london he had a game with his wife 
 he would go to antique shops  and the game was as such when we look at an antique we want we 'll ask the shopkeeper
  and he saw over and over the antique 's value was all about it being old  
 and as a new media artist he reflected and said  you know i 've spent my whole career making new media art 
  's new media and he realized it isn 't about old or new  
 it 's about something in between it isn 't about old the dirt new the cloud  it 's about what is good 
 a combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at you see it in all interesting art today in all interesting businesses today  how we combine those two together to make good is very interesting 
 so art makes questions
  questions 
 and leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions  we aren 't functioning so easily anymore  we aren 't a simple authoritarian regime anymore
  as an example of authoritarianism i was in russia one time traveling in st petersburg at a national monument  and i saw this sign that says do not walk on the grass
  i speak english and you 're trying to single me out that 's not fair  
 but i found a sign for  russian speaking people  
 and it was the best sign ever to say no it was like no swimming no hiking no anything my favorite ones are no plants
  today  but as we know it 's been disrupted it is now a network instead of a perfect tree  it 's a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy  and that 's kind of awkward  
 and so today  leaders are faced with how to lead differently i believe  this is work i did with my colleague becky bermont
 on creative leadership what can we learn from artists and designers for how to lead  because in many senses a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes
 someone who 's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes a traditional leader is always wanting to be right  whereas a
 creative leader hopes to be right  and this frame is important today in this complex ambiguous space and artists and designers have a lot to teach us i believe  
  i had a show in london recently where my friends invited me to come to london for four days to sit in a sandbox and i said great  
 and so i sat in a sandbox for four days straight six hours every day six minute appointments with anyone in london
  and that was really bad  but
 i would listen to people hear their issues draw in the sand try to figure things out and it was kind of hard to figure out what i was doing
  president i do a lot of meetings you know 
 and by the end of the experience i realized why i was doing this 
 it 's because leaders what we do is we connect improbable connections and hope something will happen  
 and in that room i found so many connections between people across all of london  
 and so
  connecting people is the great question today  whether you 're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy  it 's a wonderful design challenge and one thing i 've been doing is
 doing some
 research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective let me show you something i haven 't shown anywhere actually 
 so what this is is a kind of a sketch an application sketch i wrote in python  
  this is called powershop  and the way it works is
 imagine an organization you know the ceo isn 't ever at the top the ceo 's at the center of the organization  
 there may be different subdivisions in the organization and you might want to look into different areas for instance  
 green are areas doing well  red are areas doing poorly  you know how do you as the leader scan connect make things happen  
 so for instance you might open up a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there and know that you know someone in eco
 and
 these people here are in eco the people you might engage with as ceo people
 going across the hierarchy  
 and part of the challenge of the ceo is to find connections across areas and so you might look in r & d and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest  
  it 's a person important to engage so you might want to for instance get a heads up display on how you 're interacting with them  
 how many coffees do you have how often are you
 calling them  emailing them  what is the tenor of their email how is it working out  
 leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy  
 you can also imagine
 using technology like from luminoso the guys from cambridge who were looking at deep text analysis what is
  of your communications
