  if i could have the first slide please 
 contrary to calculations made by some engineers
  bees can fly dolphins can swim and geckos can even climb
 up the smoothest surfaces now what i want to do in the short time i have is to try to allow each of you to
 experience the thrill of
 revealing
 nature 's
  i get to do this all the time and it 's just incredible i want to try to share just a little bit of that with you
 in this presentation  the challenge of looking at nature 's designs and i 'll tell you the way that we perceive it and the way we 've used it 
 the challenge of course is to answer this question what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere  
 and if we could figure that out how can we implement
 those designs  
 well  many biologists will tell engineers and others  
 organisms have millions of years to get it right they 're spectacular they can do everything wonderfully well  so the answer is bio mimicry just copy nature directly 
 we know from working on animals
 that the truth is that 's exactly what you don 't want to do
  because evolution works on the just good enough principle not on a perfecting principle  
 and the constraints in building any organism when you look at it are really severe 
 natural technologies have incredible constraints think about it if you were an engineer and i told you
 that you had to build an automobile  but it had to start off to be this big then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way
  or think about the fact that if you build an automobile i 'll tell you that you also inside it have to put a factory
 that allows you to make another automobile
  and you can absolutely never  absolutely never  because of history and the inherited plan start with a clean slate so
 organisms have this important
  evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer and this is really important when you begin to look at animals instead we believe
 you need to be inspired by biology 
 you need to discover the general principles of nature and then use these analogies when they 're advantageous  
 this is a real challenge to do this because animals when you start to really
  look inside them how they work
 appear hopelessly complex there 's no detailed history of the design plans you can 't go look it up anywhere  
 they have way too many motions for their joints 
 too many muscles even the simplest animal we think of something like an insect  and they have more neurons and connections than you can imagine
 how can you make sense of this  well  we believed and we hypothesized
 that
 one way animals could work simply is if the control of their movements
 tended to be built into their bodies themselves
  what we discovered was that 
 and eight legged animals all produce the same forces on the ground when they move  they all work like this kangaroo
 they bounce  
 and they can be modeled by a spring mass system that we call the the spring mass system because we 're biomechanists it 's actually a pogo stick  
 they all produce the pattern of a pogo stick how is that true  well a human one of your legs
 works like two legs of a trotting dog  or works like three legs together as one of a trotting insect  or four legs as one of a trotting crab
  then they alternate in their propulsion  but the patterns are all the same  almost every organism we 've looked at this way
 be an article coming out that says that really big things
 like t rex probably couldn 't do this but you 'll see that next week now what 's interesting is the animals then we said bounce along the vertical plane this way and in our collaborations with pixar in a bug 's life
  the bipedal nature of the characters of the ants and we told them of course they move in another plane as well  and they asked us this question they say why model just in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane when you 're telling us these animals are moving in the horizontal plane 
 this is a good question  nobody in biology ever modeled it this way we took their advice
 and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well we took their three legs
  collapsed them down as one we got some of the best mathematicians in the world from princeton to work on this problem 
 and we were able to create a model where animals are not only bouncing up and down but they 're also bouncing side to side
 at the same time and many organisms fit this kind of pattern now why is this important to have this model because it 's very interesting when you take this model
 and you perturb it you give it a push as it bumps into
 with no brain or no reflexes just by the structure alone  it 's a beautiful model  
 let 's look at the mathematics 
 that 's enough 
 laughter the animals when you look
  using basically springy legs that is the legs can do computations on their own the control algorithms in a sense are embedded in the form of the animal itself  
 why haven 't we been more inspired by nature and these kinds of discoveries  
 well  i would argue that human technologies are really different from natural technologies
  at least they have been so  so far think about the typical kind of robot that you see 
 human technologies have tended to be large 
 flat with right angles stiff  made of metal  they have rolling devices and axles there are very few motors very few sensors  
 whereas nature tends to be small 
 and curved and it bends and twists and has legs instead and appendages  and has many muscles and many many sensors
  different design however what 's changing what 's really exciting and i 'll show you some of that next is
 that as human technology takes on more of the characteristics of nature then nature really can become a much more useful teacher and
 here 's one example that 's really exciting this is a collaboration we have with stanford  and they developed this new technique called shape
  it 's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape that they like 
 and put in the material properties they can embed sensors and actuators right in the form itself  
 for example here 's a leg the clear part is stiff  
 the white part is compliant and you don 't need any axles there or anything  it just bends by itself beautifully so you can put those properties
  it inspired them to show off this design by producing a little robot they named sprawl 
 our work has also inspired another robot a biologically inspired bouncing robot from the university of michigan and mcgill
 named rhex for robot hexapod and this one 's autonomous  
 let 's go to the video and let me show you some of these animals moving and then some of the simple robots that have been inspired by our discoveries
  here 's what some of you did this morning although you did it outside not on a treadmill  here 's what we do 
 this is a death 's head cockroach  this is an american cockroach you think you don 't have in your kitchen
  said all these animals are sort of working like pogo sticks they 're bouncing along as they move  and you can see that in this ghost crab from the beaches of panama and north carolina 
 it goes up to four meters per second when it runs  
 it actually leaps into the air and has aerial phases when it does it like a horse  and you 'll see it 's bouncing here 
 discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human like richard  or a cockroach  or a crab  
 or a kangaroo the relative leg stiffness of that spring is the same for everything we 've seen so far  
 now what good are springy legs then what can they do well we wanted to see if they allowed the animals to have greater stability and maneuverability so we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height of the animals that we 're looking at 
 we were certain they couldn 't do this and here 's what they did 
 the animal ran over it and it didn 't even slow down 
 it didn 't decrease its preferred speed at all we couldn 't believe that it could do this  it said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple springy legs  you could 
  make it as maneuverable as any that 's ever been built  
 here 's the first example of that this is the stanford shape deposition manufactured robot named sprawl  it has six legs there are the tuned
 springy legs  it moves in a gait
 that an insect uses and here it is going on the treadmill
 now what 's important about this robot  compared to other robots is that it can 't see anything  it can 't feel anything
 it doesn 't have
  it can maneuver over these obstacles without any difficulty whatsoever  it 's this technique of building
 the properties into the form this is a graduate student  this is what he 's doing to his thesis project
 very robust if a graduate student does that to his thesis project this is from mcgill and university of michigan this is the rhex 
  it only has six moving parts  six motors but it has springy tuned
 legs  it moves in the gait of the insect it has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front and the hind leg on the other side sort of an
  go on different surfaces here 's sand although we haven 't perfected the feet yet but i 'll talk about that later  here 's rhex
  this robot can 't see anything  it can 't feel anything  it has no brain  it 's just working with a tuned mechanical
  going down a pathway i presented this to the jet propulsion lab at nasa  and they said that they had no ability to go down craters to look for ice and life ultimately on mars
 and he said especially with legged robots because they 're way too complicated  nothing can do that and i talk next i showed them this video
 with the simple design of rhex here and just to convince them we should go to mars in two thousand and eleven i tinted the video orange just to give them the sense
  another reason why animals have extraordinary performance and can go anywhere is because they have an effective interaction with the environment 
 the animal i 'm going to show you that we studied to look at this is the gecko we have one here
 and notice its position  it 's holding on now i 'm going to challenge you i 'm going show you a video
  one of the animals is going to be running on the level  and the other one 's going to be running up a wall  which one 's which they
 're going at a meter a second  
 how many think the one on the left is running up the wall applause
 okay  the point is it 's really hard to tell
  we looked at students do this and they couldn 't tell they can run up a wall at a meter a second fifteen steps per second  and they look like they 're running on the level  how do they do this  
 it 's just phenomenal
 the one on the right was going up the hill  how do they do this they have bizarre toes  they have toes
 that uncurl like party favors when you blow them out
  and then peel off the surface like tape like if we had a piece of tape now we 'd peel it this way they do this with their toes  it 's bizarre
  this peeling inspired irobot that we work with to build
 here 's a legged version and a tractor version or a bulldozer version
  let 's see some of the geckos move with some video and then i 'll show you a little bit of a clip of the of the robots  here 's the gecko running up a vertical surface there it goes
  in real time there it goes again
  obviously we have to slow this down a little bit 
 you can 't use regular cameras you have to take one thousand pictures per second to see this 
 and here 's some video at one thousand frames per second now i want you to look at the animal 's back do
 you see how much it 's bending like that we can 't figure that out that 's an unsolved mystery we don 't know how it works if you have a son or a daughter that
  to come to berkeley  come to my lab and we 'll figure this out  okay send them to berkeley because that 's the next thing i want to do  here 's the gecko mill 
 it 's a see through treadmill with a see through treadmill belt  so we can watch the animal 's feet and videotape them through the treadmill belt 
 to see how they move  here 's the animal that we have
  running on a vertical surface  pick a foot and try to watch a toe and see if you can see what the animal 's doing 
 see it uncurl and then peel these toes  it can do this in fourteen milliseconds
  adhesive to do it  peeling in the animal  peeling in the 
  climb autonomously can go on the flat surface  transition to a wall and then go onto a ceiling there 's the bulldozer version  
 now  it doesn 't use pressure sensitive glue the animal does not use that 
  're limited to at the moment what does the animal do the animal has weird toes  and if you look at the toes they have these little leaves there  
 and if you blow them up and zoom in you 'll see that 's there 's little striations in these leaves  
 and if you zoom in two hundred and seventy times you 'll see it looks like a rug  
 and if you blow that up and zoom in nine hundred times you see there are hairs there tiny hairs
 and if you look carefully those tiny hairs have striations  
 and if you zoom in on those thirty thousand times  you 'll see each hair has split ends
  and if you blow those up  they have these little structures on the end 
 the smallest branch of the hairs looks like spatulae and an animal like that has one billion
 of these
  to get very close to the surface  in fact there 's the diameter of your hair a gecko has two million of these and each hair has one hundred to one thousand split ends
  think of the contact of that that 's possible 
 we were fortunate to work with another group at stanford that built us a special manned sensor that we were able to measure the force of an individual hair
  here 's an individual hair with a little split
  we measured the forces they were enormous  they were so large that a patch of hairs about this size the gecko 's foot could support the weight of a small child about forty pounds easily  
 now  how do they do it 
 we 've recently discovered this do they do it by friction no force is too low do they do it by electrostatics no
  you can change the charge they still hold on do they do it by interlocking that 's kind of a like a velcro like thing no  you can put them on molecular smooth surfaces they don 't do it  how about suction
 they stick on in a vacuum  
 how about wet adhesion or capillary adhesion they don 't have any glue  and they even stick under water just fine if you put their foot under water they grab on how do they do it then 
 believe it or not they grab on by intermolecular
  by van der waals forces you know you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry where you had these two atoms they 're close together and the electrons are moving around that tiny force is sufficient to allow them to do that because it 's added up so many times with these small structures
 what we 're doing
 is we 're taking that inspiration of the hairs 
 and with another colleague at berkeley we 're manufacturing them and just recently we 've made a breakthrough where we now believe
  going to be able to create the first synthetic
 dry adhesive 
 many companies are interested in this 
 we also presented to nike even
  excited about this that we realized that that small size scale and where everything gets sticky and gravity doesn 't matter anymore
 we needed to look at ants and their feet because one of my other colleagues at berkeley
 has built a six millimeter silicone robot with legs  but it gets stuck it doesn 't move very well  
 but the ants do and we 'll figure out why so that ultimately we 'll make this move
  and imagine you 're going to be able to have swarms of
 these six millimeter robots
 available to run around
 where 's this going i think you can see it already clearly
 the internet is already having eyes and ears you have web cams and so forth
  but it 's going to also have legs and hands you 're going to be able to do programmable work through these kinds of robots so that you can
  we saw david kelly is at the beginning of that with his
 fish  
 so in conclusion i think the message is clear if you need a message  if nature 's not enough 
 if you care about search and rescue or mine clearance or medicine or the various things we 're working on 
 we must preserve
 nature 's designs otherwise these secrets will be lost forever thank you
