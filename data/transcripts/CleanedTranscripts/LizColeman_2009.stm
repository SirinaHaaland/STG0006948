  college presidents are not the first people who come to mind
 when the subject is the uses of the creative imagination so i thought i 'd start by telling you how i got here  the story begins in the late '
  i was invited to meet with leading educators from the newly free eastern europe and russia 
 they were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities  since education under the soviet union was essentially propaganda
 serving the purposes of a state ideology  they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations
 if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women  given this rare
  opportunity to start fresh they chose liberal arts as the most compelling model because of its historic commitment to furthering its students ' broadest intellectual and deepest ethical potential 
 having made that decision they came to the united states  home of liberal arts education to talk with some of us most closely identified
  with that kind of education they spoke with a passion an urgency an intellectual conviction
 that for me was a voice i had not heard in decades a dream long forgotten 
 for in truth  we had moved light years
 from the passions that animated them  
 but for me
  unlike them in my world  the slate was not clean  and what was written
 on it was not encouraging in truth  liberal arts education
 no longer exists at least genuine liberal arts education in this country we have professionalized liberal arts to the point
 where they no longer provide
 the breadth of application and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement
 that is their signature  over the past century the expert has dethroned the educated generalist
 to become the sole model of intellectual accomplishment expertise
 has for sure had its moments  but the price of its
  dominance is enormous 
 subject matters are broken up into smaller and smaller pieces with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure  
 we have even managed to make the study of literature arcane 
 you may think you know what is going on in that jane austen novel that is until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism
 the progression of today 's college student is to jettison every interest except one 
 and within that one to continually narrow the focus learning more and more about less and less 
 this despite the evidence all around us of the interconnectedness of things  
 lest you think i exaggerate
 here are the beginnings of the a b cs of anthropology 
 as one moves up the ladder values other than technical competence are viewed with increasing suspicion  
 questions such as what kind of a world are we making what kind of a world should we be making  what kind of a world can we be making
  treated with more and more skepticism  and move off the table in so doing 
 the guardians of secular democracy in effect
 yield the connection between education and values to fundamentalists who you can be sure 
 have no compunctions about using education to further their values the absolutes
 of a theocracy  meanwhile  the values and voices of democracy are silent  
 either we have lost touch with those values or no better believe they need not or cannot be taught 
 this aversion to social values may seem at odds with the explosion of community service programs  but despite the attention paid to
  these efforts they remain emphatically extracurricular in effect
  is treated as outside the realm of what purports to be serious thinking and adult purposes simply put 
 when the impulse is to change the world 
  the academy is more likely to engender a learned helplessness
 than to create a sense of empowerment this brew
 oversimplification of civic engagement 
 idealization of the expert fragmentation of knowledge 
 emphasis on technical mastery neutrality as a condition of academic integrity is toxic
 when it comes to pursuing the vital
  connections between education and the public good between intellectual integrity
 and human freedom which were at the heart of the challenge
 posed to and by
 my european colleagues when the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge
 were more than enough i can assure you to give one pause 
 what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable  
 whether it was threats to the environment 
 inequities in the distribution of wealth  lack of a sane policy or a sustainable policy with respect to the continuing uses of energy  we were in
  desperate straits and that was only the beginning
  the corrupting of our political life had become a living nightmare  nothing was exempt
 separation of powers  civil liberties  
 the rule of law  the relationship of church and state accompanied by a squandering of the nation 's material wealth
 that defied credulity
  a harrowing predilection for the uses of force had become commonplace with an equal distaste for the alternative forms of influence 
 at the same time 
 all of our firepower was impotent
 when it came to halting or even stemming the slaughter in rwanda
 once a model for the world 
 has become most noteworthy for its failures  
 mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy eludes vast numbers of our students  
 despite having a research establishment that is the envy of the world 
 more than half of the american public don 't believe in evolution and don 't press your luck about how much those
  who do believe in it actually understand it 
 incredibly  this nation 
 with all its material intellectual and spiritual resources seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas  
 equally startling from my point of view is the fact that no one
  was drawing any connections between what is happening to the body politic  and what is happening in our leading educational institutions  
 we may be at the top of the list when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth we are not even on the list
 when it comes to our responsibility for the health of this democracy we are playing with fire
 you can be sure jefferson knew what he was talking about when he said 
 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was 
 and never will be 
 on a more personal note  this betrayal of our principles our decency our hope made it
  impossible for me to avoid the question what will i say years from now when people ask ' where were you ' 
 as president of a leading liberal arts college famous for its innovative history there were no excuses  
 so the conversation began at bennington knowing that if we were to regain the integrity of liberal education it would take
  radical rethinking of basic assumptions  beginning with our priorities  
 enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective 
 the accomplishment of civic virtue is tied to the uses of intellect and imagination at their most challenging 
 our ways of approaching agency and authority turn inside out
 to reflect
 the reality that no one has the answers to the challenges facing citizens in this century and everyone
 has the responsibility
 for trying and participating in finding them 
 bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences in personal and professional objectives  
 but the balances
  redressed our shared purposes assume an equal if not greater importance 
 when the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward  
 the idea is to make the 
  challenges themselves
 from health and education to the uses of force the organizers of the curriculum they would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines
  but structures designed to connect  rather than divide
 mutually dependent circles  rather than isolating triangles 
 and the point is not to treat these topics as topics of study  but as frameworks of action 
 the challenge to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant
  and sustainable difference  
 contrary to widely held assumptions  an emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking 
 the importance of coming to grips with values like justice 
 equity  truth becomes increasingly evident as students discover that interest alone
 cannot tell them what they
  to know when the issue is rethinking education our approach to health or strategies for achieving an economics of equity  
 the value of the past also comes alive 
 it provides a lot of company you are not the first to try to figure this out just as you are unlikely to be the last 
 even more valuable history
  provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual as well as the intended consequences of ideas 
 in the language of my students deep thought matters
 when you 're contemplating what to do about things that matter a new liberal
  curriculum has begun to emerge  rhetoric  the art of organizing the world of words to maximum effect  design  
 the art of organizing the world of things  
 mediation and improvisation also assume a special place in this new pantheon  
 quantitative reasoning attains its proper position at the heart of what it takes to manage change
 where measurement is crucial as is a capacity to discriminate
 systematically between what is at the core and what is at the periphery  
 and when making connections is of the essence  the power of technology emerges with special intensity but so does the importance of content
  the more powerful our reach  the more important the question about what 
 when improvisation resourcefulness imagination are key  artists at long last  take their place at the table  when strategies of action are in the process of being designed 
 in this dramatically expanded ideal of a liberal arts education
 where the continuum of thought and action is its life 's blood
  knowledge honed outside the academy becomes essential 
 social activists business leaders  lawyers politicians professionals will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good 
  in turn continuously move outside the classroom to engage the world directly 
 and of course this new wine needs new bottles
 if we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism
 of this idea the most important discovery we made in our focus on public action
 was to appreciate that the hard choices are not between good and evil  but between
  competing goods  this discovery is transforming 
 it undercuts 
  self righteousness radically alters the tone and character of controversy and enriches dramatically the possibilities for finding common ground 
 ideology  zealotry  unsubstantiated opinions simply won 't do 
 this is a political education
  to be sure  
 but it is a politics of principle not of partisanship 
 so the challenge for bennington is to do it on the cover of bennington 's two thousand and eight holiday card
 is the architect 's sketch of a building opening in two thousand and ten that is to be a center for the advancement of public action 
 the center will embody and sustain this new
  educational commitment think of it as a kind of secular church 
 the words on the card describe what will happen inside  
 we intend to turn the intellectual and imaginative power  passion and boldness of our students  faculty and staff
 to developing strategies for acting on the critical challenges of our time
 are doing our job  
 while these past weeks have been a time of national exhilaration in this country it would be tragic if you thought this meant your job was done  
 the glacial silence we have experienced in the face of the shredding of the constitution the unraveling of our public
  the deterioration of our infrastructure is not limited to the universities  we the people
 have become inured to our own irrelevance when it comes to doing anything significant about anything that matters concerning governance  beyond waiting another four years 
 we persist also
 in being sidelined by the idea of the expert as the only one capable of coming up with answers
  despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary the problem is there is no such thing
 as a viable democracy made up of experts
 and should continue to learn everything there is to know about something or other  we actually do it all the time  
 and there will be and should be those who spend a lifetime pursuing a very highly defined area of inquiry  but this 
  will not yield the flexibilities of mind
  the multiplicity of perspectives  the capacities for collaboration and innovation this country needs that is where you come in 
 what is certain
 is that the individual talent exhibited in such abundance here  
 needs to turn its attention to that collaborative  messy  frustrating  contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy
  president obama and his team simply cannot do it alone 
 if the question of where to start seems overwhelming you are at the beginning not the end of this adventure 
 being overwhelmed is the first step
 if you are serious about trying to get at things that really matter  on a scale that makes a difference  so what do you do when you feel overwhelmed
 well you have two things you have a mind  and you have other people start with those and change the world
