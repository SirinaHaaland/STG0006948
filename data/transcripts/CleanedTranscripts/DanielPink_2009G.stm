  need to make a confession at the outset here a little over twenty years ago  i did something that i regret something that i 'm not
 particularly proud of something that in many ways i wish no one would ever know  but here i feel kind of
  obliged to reveal 
 in a moment of youthful indiscretion i went to law school 
 in america  law is a professional degree after your university degree you go on
  when i got to law school  i didn 't do very well 
 to put it mildly i didn 't do very well i in fact graduated in the part of my law school class that made the top ninety %
 possible thank
 i never practiced law a day in my life i pretty
  against my better judgment  against the advice of my own wife  
 i want to try to dust off some of those legal skills what 's left of those legal skills  i don 't want to tell you a story  
 i want to make a case  
 i want to make a 
 dare i say lawyerly case for rethinking how we run our
  businesses  
 so  ladies and gentlemen of the jury  
 take a look at this  this is called the candle problem  some of you might know it it 's created in one thousand nine hundred and forty five by a psychologist named karl duncker
 karl duncker he created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science and here 's how it works
  suppose i 'm the experimenter i bring you into a room i give you a candle some thumbtacks and some matches  and i say to you your job is to 
  attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn 't drip onto the table now what would you do many people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall doesn
  i saw somebody kind of make the motion over here some people have a great idea where they light the match
  the side of the candle try to adhere it to the wall it 's an awesome idea doesn 't work  
 and eventually after five or ten minutes most people figure out the solution which you can see here  
 the key is to overcome what 's called functional fixedness you look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks  but it can also have this other function as a platform for the candle the
 candle problem
 i want to tell you about an experiment using the candle problem done by a scientist named sam glucksberg who is now at princeton university us this shows the power 
 of incentives he gathered his participants and said i 'm going to time you how quickly you can solve this problem to one group he said i 'm going to time you to establish norms  averages for how long it typically takes someone to
  this sort of problem to the second group he offered rewards he said if you 're in the top 
  of the fastest times 
 you get five dollars  
 if you 're the fastest of everyone we 're testing here today  
 you get twenty dollars 
 now this is several years ago  adjusted for inflation  it 's a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work it 's a nice motivator question 
 how much
  faster did this group solve the problem  answer it took them on average three and a half minutes
 longer  
 three point five min longer  this makes no sense right  i mean  i 'm an american  i believe in free markets  that 's not how it 's supposed to work  right 
 laughter if you want people to perform better you reward them right bonuses
  commissions their own reality show incentivize them  
 that 's how business works  but that 's not happening here  
 you 've got an incentive designed to sharpen thinking and and accelerate creativity  and it does just the opposite  
 it dulls thinking and blocks creativity  what 's interesting about this experiment is that it 's not an aberration this has been replicated over and
  over and over again for nearly forty years these contingent motivators if you do this then you get that work in some circumstances 
 but for a lot of tasks they actually either don 't work or often they do harm  
  i spent the last couple of years looking at the science of human motivation particularly the dynamics of extrinsic motivators and intrinsic motivators and i 'm telling you it 's not even close  
 if you look at the science there is a mismatch between what science knows
 and what business does what 's alarming here is that our business operating system think of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses how we motivate people how we apply our
 human resources
 it 's built entirely around these extrinsic motivators around carrots and sticks  that 's actually fine for many kinds of 20th century tasks  
 but for 21st century tasks that mechanistic
  he presented the problem in a slightly different way like this up here
  attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn 't drip onto the table same deal you we 're timing for norms you we 're incentivizing 
 what happened this time 
 this time  the incentivized group kicked the other group 's butt
  tacks are out of the box it 's pretty easy isn 't it laughter
 if then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks where there is a simple set of rules and a clear destination to go to 
 rewards by their very nature narrow our focus
  concentrate the mind that 's why they work in so many cases so for tasks like this 
 a narrow focus where you just see the goal right there zoom straight ahead to it  they work really well  but for the real candle problem 
 you don 't want to be looking like this 
 the solution is on the periphery you want to be looking around that reward actually narrows our focus and restricts our possibility  let me tell you why this is so
  workers are doing less of this kind of work  and more of this kind of work  that routine
  work certain kinds of accounting financial analysis computer programming has become fairly easy to outsource fairly easy to automate 
 software can do it faster
  faster low cost providers can do it cheaper  so what really matters are the
 more right brained creative  conceptual kinds of abilities think about your own work  think about your own work  
 are the problems that you face or even the problems we 've been talking about here
  they have a clear set of rules and a single solution no the rules are mystifying  the solution if it exists at all is surprising and not obvious  everybody in this room
 is dealing with their own version of the candle problem and for candle problems of any kind 
 in any field those if then
  around which we 've built so many of our businesses don 't work it makes me crazy
  and here 's the thing  this is not a feeling  
 okay i 'm a lawyer i don 't believe in feelings  this is not a philosophy  i 'm an american i don 't believe in philosophy
  as we say in my hometown of washington d c a true fact 
 let me give you an example let me marshal the evidence here i 'm not telling a story 
 i 'm making a case ladies and gentlemen of the jury  some evidence dan ariely one of the great economists of our time  he and three colleagues did a study
 they gave these mit students a bunch of games games that involved creativity  and motor skills  and concentration and the offered them for performance  three levels of rewards  
 small reward medium reward  
 large reward 
 if you do really well you get the large reward on down what
  as long as the task involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected the higher the pay  the better the performance okay 
 but once the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill a larger reward led to poorer performance  
 then they said let 's see if there 's any cultural bias here  
  is modest in north american standards is more meaningful there  same deal a bunch of games three levels of rewards what happens 
 people offered the medium level of rewards
 did no better than people offered the small rewards  but this time people offered the highest rewards  
 they did the worst of all 
 in eight of the nine
  tasks we examined across three experiments higher incentives led to worse performance is this some kind of 
  socialist conspiracy going on here
  no these are economists from mit from carnegie mellon from the university of chicago do you know who sponsored
  the federal reserve bank of the united states  
 that 's the american experience let 's go across the pond to the london school of economics  lse london school of economics  alma mater of eleven nobel laureates in economics  
 training ground for great economic thinkers like george soros  and friedrich hayek and mick jagger
  we find that financial incentives can result in a negative
 impact on overall performance there is a mismatch between what science knows
 and what business does and what worries me as we stand here in the rubble of the economic collapse is that too many organizations
 are making their decisions  their policies about talent and people based on assumptions that are outdated  
 unexamined and rooted more in folklore than in science 
 and if we really want to get out of this economic mess if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the 21st century
  the solution is not to do more of the wrong things 
 to entice people with a sweeter carrot or threaten them with a sharper stick 
 we need a whole new approach 
 the good news is that the scientists who 've been studying motivation have given us this new approach  it 's built much more around intrinsic motivation around the desire to do things because they matter because we like it they 're interesting
  or part of something important  and to my mind that new operating system for our businesses revolves around three elements autonomy  mastery
 and purpose  autonomy  the urge to direct our own lives  mastery the desire to get better and better at something that matters purpose  the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves 
 these are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses  i want to talk today only about
  autonomy
  20th century we came up with this idea of management management did not emanate from nature management is not a tree  it 's a television set  somebody invented it
 it doesn 't mean it 's going to work forever management is great traditional notions of management are great
  you don 't see a lot of it but you see the first stirrings of something really interesting going on what it means is paying people adequately and fairly absolutely getting the issue of money off the table  
  and then giving people lots of autonomy some examples how many of you have heard of the company atlassian
 it looks like
  less than half atlassian
 is an australian software company  
 and they do something incredibly cool a few times a year they tell their engineers go for the next twenty four hours and work on anything you want 
 as long as it 's not part of your regular job work on anything you want engineers use this time to come up with a cool
 patch for code come up with an elegant hack  then they
  present all of the stuff that they 've developed to their
 teammates to the rest of the company in this wild and woolly all hands meeting at the end of the day being australians everybody has a beer
 they call them fedex days  why  because you have to deliver something overnight  
 it 's pretty not bad it 's a huge trademark violation but it 's pretty clever
  that one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software fixes that might never have existed  
 it 's worked so well that atlassian has taken it to the next level with twenty % time done  famously at google where engineers can spend twenty % of their time working on anything they want 
 they have autonomy over their time their task their team their technique radical amounts of autonomy  and at google as many of you know
 about half of the new products in a typical year are birthed during that twenty % time 
 things like gmail  orkut  google news  let me give you an even more radical example of it 
 something called the results only work environment 
 created by two american consultants  in place at a dozen companies around north america
  in a rowe people don 't have schedules  
 they show up when they want they don 't have to be in the office at a certain time or any time  
 they just have to get their work done how they do it  when they do it  where they do it  is totally up to them  
 meetings in these kinds of environments
 are optional what happens  almost across the board 
  worker satisfaction goes up turnover goes down  autonomy mastery and purpose the building blocks of a new way of doing things some of you might look at this and say 
 hmm that sounds nice but it 's utopian and i say nope 
 i have proof  the mid 1990s microsoft started an encyclopedia
  all the right incentives they paid professionals to write and edit thousands of articles well compensated managers oversaw the whole thing to make sure it came in on budget and on time a
 few years later another encyclopedia got started different model  right 
 do it for fun no one gets paid a cent or a euro or a yen 
 do it because you like to do it
  gone to an economist anywhere hey i 've got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia if they went head to head who would win 
 ten years ago you could not have found a single sober economist anywhere on planet earth
 who would have predicted the wikipedia model  this is the titanic battle between these two approaches
  this is the thrilla in manila  intrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators autonomy mastery and purpose versus carrot and sticks  and who wins 
 intrinsic motivation autonomy mastery and purpose  in a knockout let me wrap up 
 there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does here is what science knows 
 one those 20th century rewards those motivators we think are a natural part of business do work
  but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances two those if then rewards
 often destroy creativity  three the secret to high performance isn 't rewards and punishments  but that unseen intrinsic drive the drive to do things
 for their own sake the drive to do things cause they matter and 
 here 's the best part we already know this the science confirms what we know in our hearts so  if we
  repair this mismatch between science and business  if we bring our motivation  notions of motivation into the 21st century  if we get past this lazy  dangerous ideology of carrots and sticks  
 we can strengthen our businesses  
 we can solve a lot of those candle problems and maybe
 maybe maybe
 we can change the world  i rest my case
