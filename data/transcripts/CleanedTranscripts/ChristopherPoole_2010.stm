  group of kids and they like to say funny words like barrel roll it 's a video game move from star fox
  found this website called futaba channel and it was a japanese forum and imageboard that
  outside of japan and so what i did is i took it  i translated it into english  and i stuck it up for my friends to use now six and a half years later
 over seven million people are using it contributing over seven hundred thousand posts per day 
 and we 've gone from one board to  forty eight boards this
 is what it looks like so what 's unique about the site is that it 's anonymous and it has no memory there 's no
  archive there are no barriers  there 's no registration these things that we 're used to with with forums don 't exist on 4chan and that 's led to this
 discussion that 's completely raw completely unfiltered
 what the site 's known for because it has this environment is it 's fostered the creation of a lot of internet phenomena
  the largest memes that have come out of this site
 some of you might be familiar with are these lolcats
 just silly pictures of cats with text and this resonates with millions of people apparently because there are tens of thousands of these and there is a whole blogging empire now dedicated to to pictures like these  
 and
 rick astley 's kind of rebirth these past two years  rickroll was this bait and switch  really simple classic bait and switch
  says they 're linking to something interesting and you get an ' 80s pop song that 's all it was and it got big enough to the point where there was a float last year at the macy 's thanksgiving day parade  
  and rick astley pops out and rickrolls millions of people on television 
 there are thousands of memes that come out of the site there are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream the ones i 've just shown you
  every day every month people are producing thousands of these so
 does a site like this have rules 
 we do they 're the codified rules that that i 've come up with which are more or less ignored by the community  and so they 've come up with their own set of rules 
 the rules of the internet and so there are three that i want to show you
  rule one is you don 't talk about b two is you do not talk about b
 and this one 's kind of interesting if it exists there is porn of it  no exceptions and i
 will spare you that slide i assure you it is very true 
 b is the first board we started with and it is in many ways the beating heart of the website it is where a third of all the traffic is going and
  for  more than anything not just the memes they 've created but the exploits and chris just touched on one of those a second ago and that was
 the time one hundred poll 
 so somebody at time at the magazine thought it would be fun to nominate me for this this thing they did last year  
 and so they placed me on it and the internet got wind of it my community
 decided they wanted me to
  win it  i didn 't instruct them to do it they just decided that that 's what they wanted and so you know three hundred and ninety percent approval rating ain 't so bad 
 so they they broke that poll and i ended up on top i ended up at this really fancy party
  but that 's not what 's interesting about this it 's that they weren 't putting me at the top of this list they were actually it got so
  sophisticated to the point where they gamed
 all of the top twenty one places to spell marblecake also the game 
 the amount of time and effort that went into that is absolutely incredible and marble cake is significant because it is the channel that this group called
  is this group of people
 that protested 
 very famously  
 scientology  the story is scientology had this embarrassing video of tom cruise it went up online they got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the internet  and so these people 
 over seven thousand people less than one month later organized in a hundred cities around the globe and
  the church of scientology and they have continued to do so now two full years
 after the fact  they are still protesting
 so we 've got this activist group that 's this grassroots group that 's come out of the site 
 and last i 'm going to show you the example the story of dusty the cat dusty is is the name that we 've given to this cat this
 young man
 posted a video of him abusing his cat on youtube and you know 
 this didn 't sit well with with people and so there was this outpouring of support
 for people to to do something about this so what they did is they i mean they put csi to
  the internet detectives came out they
 matched they found his myspace they took the youtube video and they mashed everything in the video within twenty four hours  they had his name
  and within forty eight hours  
 he was arrested 
 and so what i think is really intriguing about a community like 4chan is just that it 's this open place as i said it 's raw
  it 's unfiltered  and sites like it are kind of going the way of the dinosaur right now  they 're endangered because we 're moving towards
 social networking we 're moving towards persistent identity  we 're moving towards
  you know a lack of privacy really we 're sacrificing a lot of that and i think in doing so moving towards those
  got a couple questions for you but if i ask them is the ted website going to go down cp you 're lucky that this is this is not being streamed to them live right now
  you made the case there but anonymity basically allows people to say anything all the rules gone you 've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography and i 'm just curious whether you you
 sometimes lie awake in the night worrying that you 've opened
  for as much good that kind of comes out of this this environment  there is plenty of bad there are plenty of downsides  but i think that the greater good
 is being served here by just allowing people there are very few places now where you can go and not have identity to be be completely anonymous and say and say whatever you 'd like
  and saying whatever you like i think is powerful doing whatever you like is now crossing a line  but
 i think it 's important to have these places when i get emails people say thank you for giving me this place this outlet where i can come after work and
 be myself ca but words saying things you know can be
 constructive it can be really damaging and if you cut the link between what is said and any attribution back to you  i mean surely there are huge risks with that
  there are certainly but ca
 tell me about what i mean i think you asked
 the board what you might say at ted right cp yeah i posted a thread on sunday  and within twenty four hours it had
 over twelve thousand responses and the thing is i didn 't 
  that presentation because i can 't read to you anything that they said
 ninety nine percent of it is just would have been you know  bleeped out  but there there were some good things that came out of that too 
 love and peace were mentioned ca love and peace were mentioned kind of with quote marks around them right cp cats and dogs were mentioned too ca 
 and that that content is
  off the board now right it 's gone or is it still up there cp i stuck that thread so it lasted a few days it went up to about sixteen thousand posts and now  now it has been taken off ca okay well now 
 i 'm not sure i would have necessarily
 recommended everyone at ted to go and check it out anyway
 chris you yourself i mean you 're a figure of some intrigue you 've got this surprising
  money  yet
  what 's the commercial picture here cp the commercial picture is that there really isn 't much of one i guess
 the site has adult content on it i mean obviously it 's got some very offensive obscene content on it just in terms of language alone and when you 've got that you 've pretty much sacrificed any hope of of
  i 'm back
 in school right now ca but what conversations did you or do you have with your mother about 4chan cp 
 at first very kind of pained  awkward conversations the content is not dinner table
  in the least
 but my parents i think part of why they they kind of
 are able to appreciate it is because they don 't understand it ca and
 they were probably pleased to see you on top of the time poll
  i just went back to school and i
 am considering majoring in urban studies and then going on to urban planning kind of taking whatever i 've learned from online communities and trying to adapt that to
 a physical community
