  is a lot of ones and zeros  it 's what we call binary information  this
 is how computers talk  it 's how they store information it 's how computers think  it 's how computers do
  it is that computers do 
 i 'm a cybersecurity researcher which means my job is to sit down with this information and try to make sense of it to try to understand what all the ones and zeroes mean  
 unfortunately for me we 're not just talking about the ones and zeros i have on the screen here  we 're not just talking about a few pages of ones and zeros  
 we 're talking about billions and billions of ones and zeros  more than anyone could possibly comprehend  
 now as exciting as that sounds when i first started doing cyber
  when i first started doing cyber i wasn 't sure that sifting through ones and zeros was what i wanted to do with the rest of my life 
 because in my mind cyber was keeping viruses off of my grandma 's computer  
 it was keeping people 's myspace pages from being hacked and maybe maybe on my most glorious day  it was keeping someone 's credit card information from being stolen 
 those are important things  but that 's not how i wanted to spend my life
  but after thirty minutes of work as a defense contractor i soon found out that my idea of cyber was a little bit off 
 in fact in terms of national security  keeping viruses off of my grandma 's computer was surprisingly low on their priority list and
 the reason for that is cyber is so much bigger than any one of those things
  cyber is an integral part of all of our lives  because computers are an integral part of all of our lives even if you don 't own a computer 
 computers control everything in your car from your gps to your airbags  they control your phone they 're the reason you can call nine hundred and eleven and get someone on the other line  
 they control our nation 's entire infrastructure they 're the reason you have electricity  heat  clean water food computers control our military equipment everything from missile silos to satellites to nuclear defense networks
 all of these things are made possible
 because of computers and therefore because of cyber and when something goes wrong cyber can make all of these things impossible  
 but that 's where i step in a big part of my job is defending all of these things  keeping them working  but once in a while part of my job is to break one of these things
  just about defense  it 's also about offense  we 're entering an age where we talk about cyberweapons 
 in fact  so great is the potential for cyber offense that cyber is considered a new domain of warfare  
 warfare  it 's not necessarily a bad thing 
 on the one hand  it means we have whole new front on which we need to defend ourselves 
 but on the other hand  it means we have a whole new way to attack a whole new way to stop evil people from doing evil things
  let 's consider an example of this that 's completely theoretical suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building and he wants to do this again and again
 in the future  so he doesn 't want to be in that building when it explodes  he 's going to use a cell phone as a remote detonator  
 now  it used to be the only way we had to stop this terrorist
 was with a hail of bullets and a car chase  but that 's not necessarily true anymore  we 're entering an
  age where we can stop him with the press of a button from one thousand miles away  
 because whether he knew it or not as soon as he decided to use his cell phone he stepped into the realm of cyber 
 a well crafted cyber attack could break into his phone 
 disable the overvoltage protections on his battery drastically overload the circuit  cause the battery to overheat and explode  
 no more phone  no more detonator  maybe no more terrorist all with the press of a
  button from a thousand miles away  so how does this work it all comes back to those ones and zeros  binary information
 makes your phone work and used correctly  it can make your phone explode  
 so when you start to look at cyber from this perspective  spending your life sifting through binary
 information starts to seem kind
  but here 's the catch  this is hard really really hard and here 's why 
 think about everything you have on your cell phone 
 you 've got the pictures you 've taken you 've got the music you listen to 
 you 've got your contacts list your email and probably five hundred apps you 've never used in your entire life  
 and behind all of this is the software the code that controls
  and somewhere buried inside of that code is a tiny piece that controls your battery and that 's what i 'm really after  
 but all of this  just a bunch of ones and zeros  
 and it 's all just mixed together in cyber we call this finding a needle in a stack of needles because everything pretty much looks alike  i 'm looking for one key piece  but it just blends in with everything else  
 so let 's step back from
  this theoretical situation of making a terrorist 's phone explode and look at something that actually happened to me 
 pretty much no matter what i do my job always starts with sitting down with a whole bunch of binary information  and i 'm always looking for one key piece to do something specific 
 in this case i was looking for a very advanced very high tech piece of code that i knew i could hack  but it was somewhere buried inside of a billion ones and zeroes  
 unfortunately for me i didn 't know quite what i was looking for i didn 't know quite what it would look like which makes finding it really
  really hard  
 when i have to do that what i have to do is basically look at various pieces of this binary information  
 try to decipher each piece and see if it might be what i 'm after so after a while i thought i had found the piece i was looking for 
 i thought maybe this was it it seemed to be about right but i couldn 't quite tell i couldn 't tell what those ones and zeros represented
  i spent some
 time trying to put this together  
 but wasn 't having a whole lot of luck and finally i decided i 'm going to get through this i 'm going to come in on a weekend  and i 'm not going to leave until i figure out what this represents so that 's what i did i came in on a saturday morning 
 and about ten hours in i sort of had all the pieces to the puzzle i just didn 't know how they fit together i didn 't know what these ones and zeros meant at the 15 hour mark
  i started to get a better picture of what was there  but i had a creeping suspicion
 that what i was looking at was not at all related to what i was looking for by twenty hours the pieces started to come together very slowly 
 and i was pretty sure i was going down the wrong path at this point  but i wasn 't going to give up after thirty hours in the lab  
 i figured out exactly what i
  and i was right it wasn 't what i was looking for i spent thirty hours piecing together the ones and zeros that formed a picture of a kitten 
 i wasted thirty hours of my life
 searching for this kitten that had nothing at all to do with what i was trying to accomplish  so
 i was frustrated i was exhausted after thirty hours in the lab i probably smelled horrible but
 instead of just going home and calling it quits i took a step back
  and asked myself what went wrong here 
 how could i make such a stupid mistake
  i 'm really pretty good at this i do this for a living  so what happened 
 well i thought when you 're looking at information at this level  it 's so easy to lose track of what you 're doing it 's easy to not see the forest through the trees it 's easy to go down the wrong rabbit hole
 and waste a tremendous amount of time doing the wrong thing  but i had this epiphany we were looking at the data
 completely incorrectly since day one 
 this is how computers think ones and zeros  it 's not how people think  
 but we 've been trying to adapt our minds to think more like computers so that we can understand this information  
 instead of trying to make our minds fit the problem we should have been making the problem fit our minds because our brains have a tremendous potential
 for analyzing huge amounts of information  just not like this  so what if we could unlock that potential just by translating this to the right kind of information  
 so with these ideas in mind  i sprinted out of my basement lab at work to my basement lab at home  which looked pretty much the same the main difference is at work 
 i 'm surrounded by cyber materials and cyber seemed to be the problem in this situation 
 at home  i 'm surrounded by everything else i 've ever
  so i poured through every book i could find every idea i 'd ever encountered to see how could we translate a problem from one domain to something completely different 
 the biggest question was what do we want to translate it to what do our brains do perfectly naturally that we could exploit 
 my answer was vision 
 we have a tremendous capability to analyze visual information we can combine color gradients depth cues all sorts of these different signals into one coherent picture of the world around us 
 that 's incredible
  if we could find a way to translate these binary patterns to visual signals we could really unlock the power of our brains to process this stuff  
 so i started looking at the binary information and i asked myself what do i do when i first encounter something like this and the very first thing i want to do the very first question i want to answer is what is this  
 i don 't care what it does how it works all i want to know is what is this and
 the way i can figure that out is by looking at chunks
 sequential chunks of binary information  and i look at the relationships between those chunks 
 when i gather up enough of these sequences i begin to get an idea of exactly what this information must be  
 so let 's go back to that blow up the terrorist 's phone situation  
 this is what english text looks like at a binary level  this is what your contacts list would look like
 if i were examining it  it 's really hard to analyze this at this
  level but if we take those same binary chunks that i would be trying to find and instead translate that to a visual representation translate those relationships  
 this is what we get  this is what english text looks like from a visual abstraction perspective  
 all of a sudden  it shows us all the same information that was in the ones and zeros  but show us it in an entirely
 different way a way that we can immediately comprehend we can instantly see all of the patterns here  it takes me seconds to pick out patterns here  but hours  days to pick them 
  out in ones and zeros  it takes minutes for anybody to learn what these patterns represent here  but years of experience in cyber to learn what those same patterns represent in ones and zeros  
  upper case by upper case upper case by lower case lower case by upper case  this is caused by spaces this is caused by carriage returns we can go through every little detail of the binary information in seconds 
 as opposed to weeks  months at this level  this is what an image looks like from your cell phone  
 but this is what it looks like in a visual abstraction  
 this is what your music looks like  but here 's its visual abstraction most importantly for me  this is what the code on your
  cell phone looks like this is what i 'm after in the end  
 but this is its visual abstraction 
 if i can find this  i can 't make the phone explode i could spend weeks trying to find this in ones and zeros  but it takes me seconds to pick out a visual abstraction like this  
 one of those most remarkable parts about all of this is it gives us an entirely new way to understand new information stuff that we haven 't seen before
 so i know what english looks like at a binary level and i know what its visual abstraction looks like  but i 've never seen russian binary in my entire life 
 it would take me weeks just to figure out what i was looking at from raw ones and zeros  but because our brains can instantly pick up and recognize these subtle patterns inside of these visual abstractions  we can unconsciously apply those in new situations  
 so this is what russian looks like in a visual
  abstraction because i know what one language looks like  i can recognize other languages even when i 'm not familiar with them 
 this is what a photograph looks like  but this is what clip art looks like this is what the code on your phone looks like  but this is what the code on your computer looks like 
 our brains can pick up on these patterns in ways that we never could have from looking at raw ones
 ones and zeros  
 but we 've really only scratched the surface of what we can do with this approach we 've only begun to unlock the capabilities of our minds to process visual information  
 if we take those same concepts and translate them into three dimensions instead we find entirely new ways of making sense of information 
 in seconds we can pick out every pattern  here we can see the cross associated with code we can see cubes associated with text  we can even pick up the tiniest visual artifacts things that would take us weeks  months to find in ones and
  zeroes are immediately apparent in some sort of visual abstraction and
 as we continue to go through this and throw more and more information at it what we find is that we 're capable of processing billions of ones and zeros in a matter of seconds just by using
 our brain 's built in ability to analyze patterns  so this is really nice
  but all this tells me is
 what i 'm looking at  so at this point based on visual patterns i can find the code on the phone  but that 's not enough to blow up a battery  
 the next thing i need to find is the code that controls the battery  but we 're back to the needle in a stack of needles problem that code looks pretty much like all the other code on that system  
 so i might not be able to find the code that controls the battery but there 's a lot of things that are very similar to that you have code that controls your screen that controls your buttons that controls your microphones so even if i can 't find the code for the battery
  i bet i can find one of those things  so the next step in my binary analysis process is to look at pieces of information that are similar to each other  
 it 's really really hard to do at a binary level  
 but if we translate those similarities to a visual abstraction instead  
 i don 't even have to sift through the raw data all i have to do is wait for the image to light up to see when i 'm at similar pieces  i follow these strands of similarity like a trail
  of bread crumbs to find exactly what i 'm looking for  
 so at this point in the process i 've located the code responsible for controlling your battery  but that 's still not enough to blow up a phone 
 the last piece of the puzzle is understanding how that code controls your battery  
 for this i need to identify very subtle very detailed relationships within that binary information
 another very hard thing to do when looking at
  at ones and zeros  
 but if we translate that information into a physical representation  we can sit back and let our visual cortex do all the hard work  it can find all the detailed patterns all the important pieces 
 for us it can find out exactly how the pieces of that code work together to control that battery  
  whereas the same process would have taken months in the past  
 this is all well and good in a theoretical blow up a terrorist 's phone situation i wanted to find out if this would really work
 in the work i do every day  so i was playing around with these same concepts
 with some of the data i 've
 looked at in the past  
 and yet again i was trying to find a very detailed specific piece of code inside of a massive piece of binary information  
 so i looked at it
  at this level  thinking i was looking at the right thing only to see
 this doesn 't have the connectivity i would have expected for the code i was looking for 
 in fact i 'm not really sure what this is  but when i stepped back a level and looked at the similarities within the code i saw  
 this doesn 't have similarities like any code that exists out there i can 't even be looking at code 
  this is an image of some sort 
 and from here i can see it 's not just an image  this is a photograph  
 now that i know it 's a photograph i 've got dozens of other binary translation techniques to visualize and understand that information  
 so in a matter of seconds we can take this information  shove it through a dozen other visual translation techniques in order to find out exactly what we were looking
  it was that darn kitten again 
 all this is enabled because we were able to find a way to translate a very hard problem to something our brains do very naturally  
 so what does this mean 
 well for kittens it means no more hiding in ones and zeros  
 for me  it means no more wasted weekends 
 for cyber  it means we have a radical new way to tackle the most impossible problems  it means we have a new weapon
 in the evolving theater of cyber warfare  
 but for all of us it means that cyber engineers now have the ability to become first responders in emergency situations  
 when seconds count  we 've unlocked the means to stop the bad guys  thank you
