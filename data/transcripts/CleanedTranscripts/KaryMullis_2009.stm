  a stage in philadelphia i think it was with a bag similar to this and i was pulling a molecule out of this bag and i was saying you don 't know this
  your body knows it extremely well  and i was thinking that your body hated it  at the time because we are very immune to this this is called 
  alpha gal epitope and the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them is the reason that you can 't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily  
 actually our body doesn 't hate these our body loves these it eats them  i mean the cells in our
  immune system are always hungry  and if an antibody is stuck to one of these things
 on the cell it means that 's food 
 now i was thinking about that and i said you know we 've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don 't make and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff 
 but
 i said  we can 't get rid of it because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can 't get rid of that
  you use that what if i could stick this molecule slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me that had just invaded my lungs 
 i mean i could immediately
 tap into an immune response that was already there where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it
 it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on it was kind of like the same thing that happens when you like when you 're getting
 traffic ticket in l a 
 and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car and then charges you for possession of marijuana it 's like this very fast very efficient way to get people off the street 
 so you can take a bacteria that really doesn 't make these things at all and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street  
 and for certain bacteria we don 't have really efficient ways to do that anymore our antibiotics are running out and i mean the
  world apparently is running out too so probably it doesn 't matter fifty years from now
 streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant because we won 't be here but if we are 
 we 're going to need something to do with the bacteria so i started working with this thing  with a bunch of collaborators  and trying to attach this
  to things that were
 themselves attached to certain specific target zones bacteria that we don 't like
 and i feel now like george bush it 's like
 mission accomplished so i might be doing something dumb just like he was doing at the time  but basically what i was talking about there we 've now gotten to work  
 and
 it 's
 killing bacteria it 's eating them this thing can be stuck like that little green triangle up there
  of symbolizing this right now you can stick this to something called a dna aptamer 
 and that dna aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it so you can find a little feature
 on a bacterium that you don 't like like staphylococcus i don 't like it in particular because it killed a professor friend of mine last year it doesn 't respond to
  so i don 't like it and i 'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it that will know how to find staph when it 's in your body  and will alert your immune system to go after it 
 here 's what happened  see that line on the very top with the little dots 
 that 's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in texas at brooks air base with anthrax and they had also been treated
 with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular
  direct your immune system to it you 'll notice they all lived the ones on the top line that 's a one hundred percent survival rate  and they actually lived another fourteen days or twenty eight when we finally killed them and took them apart and figured out what
 went wrong why did they not die and they didn 't die because they didn 't have anthrax anymore
