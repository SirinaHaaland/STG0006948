  a big explosion as you climb through three thousand ft  imagine a plane full of smoke  imagine an engine going clack
  i was sitting in 1d i was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants  
 so i looked at them right away
  and they said no problem we probably hit some birds the pilot had already turned the plane around and we weren 't that far you could see manhattan 
 two minutes later three things happened at the same time 
 the pilot lines up the plane with the hudson river
  's usually not the route 
 he turns off the engines  now imagine being in a plane with no sound  
 and then he says three words the most unemotional three words i 've ever heard  he says brace for impact 
 i didn 't have to talk to the flight attendant
  i could see in her eyes it was terror life was over  now i want to share with you three things i learned about myself
 that day i learned that it all changes in an instant 
 we have this bucket list we have these things we want to do in life  and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach out to that i didn 't 
 all the fences i wanted to mend 
 all the experiences i wanted to have and i never did
  as i thought about that
 later on i came up with a saying which is i collect bad wines 
 because if the wine is ready and the person is there i 'm opening it 
 i no longer want to postpone anything in life  and that urgency that purpose has really changed my life 
 the second thing i learned that day and this is as we
 clear the george washington bridge which was by not a lot
 i thought about wow  i really feel one real regret  i 've lived a good life 
 in my own humanity and mistakes i 've tried to get better at everything i tried but in my humanity i also allow my ego to get in 
 and i regretted the time i wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter and
 i thought about my relationship with my wife
 with my friends with people 
 and after as i reflected on that i decided to eliminate negative energy from my life it 's
 not perfect but it 's a lot better  i 've not had a fight with my wife in two years it feels great  i no longer try to be right  
 i choose to be happy 
 the third thing i learned and this is as your mental clock starts going
  can see the water coming i 'm saying please blow up i don 't want this thing to break in twenty pieces like you 've seen in those documentaries  
 and as we 're coming down  
 i had a sense of wow  dying is not scary it 's almost like we 've been preparing for it our whole lives 
 but it was very sad
  want to go  i love my life  
 and that sadness really framed in one thought which is i only wish for one thing 
 i only wish i could see my kids grow up 
 about a month later i was at a performance by my daughter
  and it made all the sense in the world to me  i realized
 at that point by connecting those two dots that the only thing that matters in my life
 is being a great dad above all above all the only goal i have in life is to be a good dad 
 i was given the gift of a miracle of not dying that day  i was given another gift which was to be able to see into the
  future and come back and live
 differently  i challenge you guys that are flying today  imagine the same thing happens on your plane and please don 't
 but imagine and how would you change  what would you get done that you 're waiting to get done because you think you 'll be here forever 
 how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them and more than anything
  being the best parent you can thank you
