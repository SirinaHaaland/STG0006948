  never before has the phrase i am british elicited so much pity
  i come from an island where many of us like to believe there 's been a lot of continuity over the last thousand years  
 we tend to have historically imposed change on others but done much less of it ourselves 
 so it came as an immense shock to me when i woke up on the morning of june twenty four to discover that my country had voted to leave the european union my prime minister had resigned
  and scotland was considering a referendum that could bring to an end the very existence of the united kingdom  
 so that was an immense shock for me  and it was an immense shock for many people
  but it was also something that over the following several days  created a complete political meltdown in my country 
 there were calls for a second referendum almost as if  following a sports match  we could ask the opposition for a replay
 everybody was blaming everybody else people blamed the prime minister for calling the referendum in the first place they blamed the leader of the opposition for not fighting it hard enough  the young accused the old  the educated blamed the less well educated 
 that complete meltdown
 was made even worse by the most tragic element of
  levels of xenophobia and racist abuse in the streets of britain at a level that i have never seen before in my lifetime 
 people are now talking about whether my country is becoming a little england  
 or as one of my colleagues put it whether we 're about to become a 1950s nostalgia theme park floating in the atlantic ocean 
  but my question is really should we have the degree of shock that we 've experienced since 
 was it something that took place overnight  or are there deeper structural factors that have led us to where we are today  
 so i want to take a step back and ask two very basic questions first  what does brexit represent not just for my country  but for all
  what can we do about it how should we all respond  so first  what does brexit represent  
 hindsight is a wonderful thing
 brexit teaches us many things about our society and about societies around the world  
 it highlights in ways that we seem embarrassingly unaware of how divided our societies are the vote split along lines of age
  education  class and geography  young people didn 't turn out to vote in great numbers but those that did wanted to remain older people
 really wanted to leave the european union  geographically it was london and scotland that most strongly committed to being part of the european union  
 while in other parts of the country there was very
  those divisions are things we really need to recognize and take seriously  
 but more profoundly  the vote teaches us something about the nature of politics today  contemporary politics is no longer just about right and left  
 it 's no longer just about tax and spend  it 's about globalization  the fault line of contemporary politics is between those that
  if we look at why those who wanted to leave we call them leavers as opposed to remainers we see two factors in the opinion polls that really mattered  
 the first was immigration and the second sovereignty  and these represent a desire for people to take back control of their own lives and the feeling that they are
  unrepresented by politicians  
 but those ideas are ones that signify fear and alienation 
 they represent a retreat back towards nationalism and borders
 in ways that many of us would reject  what i want to suggest is the picture is more complicated than that that liberal
  and i firmly include myself in that picture need to write ourselves back into the picture in order to understand how we 've got to where we are today  
 when we look at the voting patterns across the united kingdom  we can visibly see the divisions  
 the blue areas show remain and the red areas leave when i looked at this what personally struck me
 was the very little time in my life i 've actually spent in many of the red
  areas  
 i suddenly realized that looking at the top fifty areas in the uk that have the strongest leave vote i 've spent a combined total of four days of my life in those areas 
 in some of those places  i didn 't even know the names of the voting districts  
 it was a real shock to me  and it suggested that people like me who think of ourselves
  as inclusive  open and tolerant perhaps don 't know our own countries and societies nearly as well as we like to believe 
 and the challenge that comes from that is we need to find a new way to narrate globalization to those people
  to recognize that for those people who have not necessarily been to university who haven 't necessarily grown up with the internet  that don 't get opportunities to travel they may be unpersuaded 
 by the narrative that we find persuasive in our often liberal bubbles 
 it means that we need to reach out more broadly and understand in the leave
  vote a minority
 have peddled the politics of fear and hatred 
 creating lies and mistrust around for instance the idea that the vote on europe could reduce the number of refugees and  asylum seekers coming to europe  when the vote on leaving had nothing to do with immigration from outside the european
  for a significant majority of the leave voters the concern was disillusionment with the political establishment  this was a protest vote for many 
 a sense that nobody represented them that they couldn 't find a political party that spoke for them  and so they rejected that political establishment 
 this replicates around europe and much of the liberal
  we see it with the rise in popularity of donald trump in the united states with the growing nationalism of viktor  orbn in hungary 
 with the increase in popularity of marine le pen in france  the specter of brexit is in all of our societies  
 so the question i think we need to ask is my second question which is how should we collectively respond 
 for all of us who care about creating liberal
 open tolerant societies we urgently need a new vision 
 a vision of a more tolerant inclusive globalization  one that brings people with us rather than leaving them behind  
 that vision of globalization is one that has to start by a recognition of the positive benefits of globalization
  the consensus amongst economists is that free trade  the movement of capital  the movement of people across borders benefit everyone on aggregate  
 the consensus amongst international relations scholars is that globalization brings interdependence  which brings cooperation and peace  
 but globalization also has redistributive effects it creates winners and
  to take the example of migration we know that immigration is a net positive for the economy as a whole under almost all circumstances  
 but we also have to be very aware that there are redistributive consequences  that importantly low skilled immigration
 can lead to a reduction in wages for the most impoverished in our societies and also put pressure
  on house prices  that doesn 't detract from the fact that it 's positive  but it means more people have to share in those benefits and recognize them 
 in two thousand and two the former secretary general of the united nations kofi annan  gave a speech at yale university  
 and that speech was on the topic of inclusive globalization that was the speech in which he coined that term  
  the glass house of globalization has to be open to all if it is to remain secure  bigotry
 and ignorance are the ugly face of exclusionary
 and antagonistic globalization that idea of inclusive globalization was briefly revived in two thousand and eight
 in a conference on progressive governance involving many
  of the leaders of european countries  
 but amid austerity and the financial crisis of two thousand and eight the concept disappeared almost without a trace globalization has been taken to support 
 a neoliberal agenda  it 's perceived to be part of an elite agenda rather than something that benefits all 
  so the question is how can we achieve that goal how can we balance on the one hand
 addressing fear and alienation
 while on the other hand refusing vehemently to give in to xenophobia and nationalism that is the question for all of us 
 and i think as a social
  that social science offers some places to start 
 our transformation has to be about both ideas and about material change  and i want to give you four ideas as a starting point  
 the first relates to the idea of civic education  
 what stands out from brexit is the gap between public perception and empirical reality  
 it 's been suggested that we 've moved
  where evidence and truth no longer matter  and lies have equal status to the clarity of evidence so how can we 
 how can we rebuild respect for truth and evidence into our liberal democracies  it has to begin with education  but it has to start with the recognition that there are huge gaps 
 in two thousand
  the pollster ipsos mori published a survey on attitudes to immigration  
 and it showed that as numbers of immigrants increase so public concern with immigration also increases  although it obviously didn 't unpack causality because 
  this could equally be to do not so much with numbers but the political and media narrative around it 
 about the nature of immigration 
 for example in these attitudes in the united kingdom  the public believed that levels of asylum were a greater proportion of immigration than they were 
 but they also believed the levels of educational migration were far lower as a proportion of overall migration than they actually are so we have to address this misinformation the gap between perception and reality
 on key aspects of globalization 
 and that can 't just be something that 's left to our schools  although that 's important to begin at an early age  it has to be about lifelong civic participation and public engagement that we all encourage as societies  
 the second thing that i think is an opportunity is the idea to encourage
  one of the things that stands out for me very strikingly  looking at immigration attitudes in the united kingdom  
 is that ironically  the regions of my country that are the most tolerant of immigrants have the highest numbers of immigrants  so for instance  london and the southeast have the highest numbers of
  and they are also by far the most tolerant areas  it 's those areas of the country that have the lowest levels of immigration that actually are the most exclusionary and intolerant towards migrants  
 so we need to encourage exchange programs we need to ensure that older generations who maybe can 't travel get access to the internet  we need to encourage even on a local and national 
  level more movement more participation more interaction with people who we don 't know and whose views we might not necessarily
  agree with 
 the third thing that i think is crucial though  and this is really fundamental 
 is we have to ensure that everybody shares in the benefits of globalization  
 this illustration from the financial times post brexit is really striking  
 it shows tragically that those people who voted to leave the european union were those who actually benefited the most materially from trade with the european union
 but the problem is that those people in those areas didn 't perceive themselves to be beneficiaries they didn 't believe that they were actually getting access to material 
  benefits of increased trade and increased mobility around the world
  is that in order to encourage the integration of refugees  we can 't just benefit the refugee populations we also have to address the concerns of the host communities in local areas 
 but in looking at that one of the policy prescriptions is that we have to provide disproportionately better education facilities  health
  access to social services in those regions of high immigration to address the concerns of those local populations  
 but while we encourage that around the developing world  we don 't take those lessons home and incorporate them in our own societies  
 furthermore if we 're going to really take seriously the need to ensure people share in the economic benefits our businesses and corporations need a model of globalization that recognizes that they too have to take people with them
  the fourth and final idea i want to put forward is an idea that we need more responsible politics 
 there 's very little social science evidence that compares attitudes on globalization  
 but from the surveys that do exist  
 what we can see is there 's huge variation across different countries and time periods in those countries for attitudes and
  like migration and mobility on the one hand and free trade on the other but one hypothesis that i think emerges from a cursory look at that data
 is the idea that polarized societies are far less tolerant of globalization it 's the societies like sweden in the past like canada
  where there is a centrist politics where right and left work together that we encourage supportive attitudes towards globalization 
 and what we see around the world today is a tragic polarization a failure to have dialogue between the extremes in politics and a gap in terms of that liberal center ground that can encourage communication and a shared understanding 
 we might not achieve that today  but at the very least we have to call upon our politicians and our media to drop a language of fear and be far more
  tolerant of one another 
 these ideas are very tentative  
 and that 's in part because this needs to be an inclusive and shared project 
 i am still
  am still european i am still a global citizen 
 for those of us who believe that our identities are not mutually exclusive we have to all work together
 to ensure that globalization takes everyone with us and doesn 't leave people behind  only then will we truly reconcile
