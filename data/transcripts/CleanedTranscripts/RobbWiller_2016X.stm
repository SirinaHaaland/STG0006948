  so you probably have the sense as most people do that polarization is getting worse in our country 
 that the divide between the left and the right is as bad as it 's been in
  really any of our lifetimes but you might also reasonably wonder if research backs up your intuition and
 in a nutshell the answer is sadly yes 
 in study after study  we find that liberals and conservatives have grown further apart 
 they increasingly wall themselves off in these ideological silos 
  more and more choosing to live in different parts of the country 
 and i think that most alarming of all of it is seeing this rising animosity on both sides 
 liberals and conservatives democrats and republicans more and more they just don 't like one another
  you see it in many different ways  they don 't want to befriend one another they don 't want to date one another if they do
 they find out they find each other less attractive  
 and they more and more don 't want their children to marry someone who supports the other party a particularly shocking statistic 
 you know in my lab the students that i work with we 're talking about some sort of social pattern
 i 'm a movie buff  and so i 'm often like what kind of movie are we in here with this pattern
  so what kind of movie are we in with political polarization well it could be a disaster movie it
 certainly seems like a disaster could be a war movie  also fits  
 but what i keep thinking is that we 're in a zombie apocalypse movie 
  you know the kind there 's people wandering around in packs not thinking for themselves  seized by this mob mentality trying to spread their disease
 and destroy society  
 and you probably think as i do that you 're the good guy in the zombie apocalypse movie   and all this hate and polarization it 's being propagated by the other people because we 're brad pitt right
  trying to hold on to what we hold dear you know not foot soldiers in the army of the undead not that never that 
 but here 's the thing  what movie do you suppose they think they 're
 in right  
 well they absolutely think that they 're the good guys in the zombie apocalypse movie right  
 and you 'd better believe that they think that they 're brad pitt and that we we are the zombies
  and who 's to say that they 're wrong 
 i think that the truth is that we 're all a part of this and the good side of that is that we can be a part of the solution  
 so what are we going to do  
 what can we do to chip away at polarization in everyday life what could we do to connect with and communicate with our political counterparts
  well these were exactly the questions that i and my colleague matt feinberg became fascinated with a few years ago and we started doing research on this topic  
 and one of the first things that we discovered that i think is really helpful for understanding polarization
 is to understand that the political divide in our country is undergirded by a deeper moral divide so one of the most robust findings in the history
 of political psychology is this pattern identified by jon haidt and jesse graham psychologists that liberals and conservatives tend to endorse different values to different degrees  
 so for example  we find that liberals tend to endorse values like equality and fairness
 and care and protection from harm more than conservatives do and
 tend to endorse values like loyalty patriotism respect for authority and moral purity more than liberals do  
 and
 matt and i were thinking that maybe this moral divide might be helpful for understanding
 how it is that liberals and conservatives talk to one another and why they so often seem to talk past one another when they do
  conducted a study where we recruited liberals
 to a study where they were supposed to write a persuasive essay that would be compelling to a conservative in support of same sex marriage 
 and what we found was that liberals tended to make arguments in terms of the liberal moral values of equality and fairness so they said things
  they being gay americans deserve the same equal rights as other americans 
 overall we found that sixty nine percent of liberals invoked one of the more liberal moral values in constructing their essay 
 and only nine percent invoked one of the more conservative moral values  even though they were supposed to be trying to persuade conservatives
  when we studied conservatives and had them make persuasive arguments in support of making english the official language of the us a classically conservative political position  we found that they weren 't much 
  better at this fifty nine percent of them made arguments in terms of one of the more conservative moral values  and just eight percent invoked a liberal moral value even though they were supposed to be targeting liberals for persuasion  
  you can see right away why we 're in trouble here right 
 people 's moral values  they 're their most deeply held beliefs people are willing to fight and die for their values  
 why are they going to give that up just to agree with you on something that they don 't particularly want to agree with you on anyway 
 if that persuasive appeal that you 're making to your republican uncle means that he doesn 't just have to change his view he 's got to change his underlying values too that
 's not going to go very far  
 so what would work better
  well  we believe it 's a technique that we call moral reframing  and we 've studied it in a series of experiments 
 in one of these experiments  we recruited liberals and conservatives to a study where they read one of three essays before having their environmental attitudes surveyed 
 and the first of these essays was a
  liberal values of care and protection from harm it said things like in many important ways we are causing real harm to the places we live in and 
 it is essential that we take steps now to prevent further destruction from being done to our earth 
 another group of participants were assigned to read a really different essay that was designed to tap into the conservative value of moral purity  
 it was a pro environmental essay as well
  said things like keeping our forests  drinking water and skies pure is of vital importance 
 we should regard the pollution of the places we live in to be disgusting 
 and reducing pollution can help us preserve what is pure and beautiful about the places we live and
 then we had a third group that were assigned to read just a
  was just a comparison group so we could get a baseline  and what we found when we surveyed people about their environmental attitudes afterwards we found that liberals it didn 't matter what essay they read they tended to 
 have highly pro environmental attitudes regardless liberals are on board for environmental protection 
  we even found that conservatives who read the moral purity essay were significantly more likely to say that they believed in global warming and were concerned about global warming  even though this essay didn 't even mention global warming 
 that 's just a related environmental issue  
 but that 's how robust this moral reframing effect was 
 and we 've studied this on a whole slew of different political issues so
 if you want to move conservatives
 on issues like same sex marriage or national health insurance it helps to tie these liberal political issues to conservative values like patriotism and moral purity  
 and we studied it the other way too if you want to move liberals to the right on conservative policy issues like
 military spending and making english the official
  to be more persuasive if you tie those conservative policy issues to liberal moral values like equality and fairness 
 all these studies have the same clear message  if you want to persuade someone on some policy  it 's helpful to connect that policy to their underlying moral values  
 and when you say it like that it seems really obvious right like why did
  even though it is it 's something we really struggle to do you know it turns out that when we go to persuade somebody on a political issue we talk like we 're speaking into a mirror  
 we don 't persuade so much as we rehearse our own reasons for why we believe some sort of political position
  we kept saying when we were designing these reframed moral arguments
  empathy and respect  empathy and respect if you can tap into that you can connect
 and you might be able to persuade somebody in this country  so
 thinking again about
 what movie we 're in maybe i got carried away before maybe it 's not a zombie apocalypse movie  
 maybe instead it 's a buddy cop movie 
 just roll with it
 you know the kind  there 's a white cop and a black cop or maybe a messy cop and an organized cop whatever it is  they don 't get along because of this difference 
 but in the end when they have to come together and they cooperate the solidarity that they feel  it 's greater because of that gulf that they had to
  and remember that in these movies  it 's usually worst in the second act when our leads are further apart than ever before  
 and so maybe that 's where we are in this country  late in the second act of a buddy cop movie 
 laughter torn apart but about to come back together  
 it sounds good but if we want it to happen i think the responsibility is going to start with us so
 this is my call to you let 's put this country back together  let 's do it despite the politicians
 and the media and facebook and twitter and congressional redistricting and all of it all the things that divide us 
 let 's do it because it 's right  
 and let 's do it
 because this hate and contempt
 that flows through all of us every day
 makes us ugly and it corrupts us  and it threatens the very fabric of our society  
 we owe it to one another
 and our country to reach out and try to connect 
 we can 't afford to hate them any longer  and we can 't afford to let them hate us either
 empathy and respect  empathy and respect  
 if you think about it it 's the very least that we owe our fellow citizens  thank you
