  a teacher and this is my world  and along the way i 've started noticing i 'm on my
  third generation of kids that they 're getting bigger they 're getting sicker 
 in addition to these complexities i just learned that seventy percent of the kids that i see who are labeled learning disabled would not have been had they had proper prenatal nutrition
 the realities of my community are simple they look like this  
 kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this and as jobs continue to leave my community and energy continues to come in be exported in it 's no wonder that really some people refer to the south bronx as a desert  
 but i 'm the oldest
  sixth grader you 'll ever meet so i get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm that i 'm hoping to share with you all today
  and with that note  i come to you with this belief that kids should not have to leave their communities to live learn and earn in a better one so i 'm here to tell you a story about me and 
  this wall that i met outside which i 'm now bringing inside  and it starts with three people 
 my passionate borough president and a guy named george irwin from green living technologies who helped me with my class and helped me get involved with this patented technology
  but it all starts with seeds in classrooms  in my place which looks like this 
 and i 'm here today
 hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp and that 's really what this is all about and it starts with incredible kids like this who come early and stay late
  all of my kids are either iep or ell learners most come with a lot of handicaps most are homeless and many are in foster care almost all of my kids live below poverty  
 but with those seeds from day one we are growing in my classroom and this is what it looks like in my classroom and you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds  and then you notice that those seeds become farms across the bronx that look like this  
 but again  
 i am not a farmer
 i 'm a teacher and i don 't like weeding and i don 't like back breaking labor  so i wanted to figure out how i could get this kind of success into something small like this and bring it into my classroom so that 
  handicapped kids could do it kids who didn 't want to be outside could do it and everyone could have access  so i called george irwin  and what do you know  he came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall  
  and lo and behold we gave birth to the first edible wall in new york city so if you 're hungry get up and eat you can do it right now my kids play cow all the time okay
 but we were just getting started the kids loved the technology so we called up george and we said we gotta learn more now mayor bloomberg thank you very much we no longer need work permits  which comes with slices and bonded contractors we 're available for you we decided to go to boston  
 and my kids from the poorest congressional district in
  america became
 the first to install a green wall designed by a computer with real live learning tools twenty one stories up if you 're going to go visit it it 's on top of the john hancock building  
 but closer to home we started installing these walls in schools that look like this with lighting like that
  heirloom students making heirloom sauce with plastic forks  and we get it into the cafeteria and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers  and that is the youngest nationally certified workforce in america 
  with our bronx borough president and what 'd we do then well  i met nice people like you and they invited us to the hamptons
  so i call this from south bronx to southampton 
 and we started putting in roofs that look like this  and we came in from destitute neighborhoods to start building landscape like this  wow people noticed  and so we got invited back this past 
  summer and we actually moved into the hamptons payed three thousand five hundred dollars a week for a house  and we learned how to surf  and when you can do stuff like this
 these are my kids putting in this technology and when you can build a roof that looks like that on a house that looks like that
  looks like this this is the new green graffiti  
 so  you may wonder what does a wall like this really do for kids besides changing landscapes and mindsets 
  it does it gets me to meet incredible contractors like this  jim ellenberger from ellenberger services  and this is where it becomes true triple bottom line  because jim
  realized that these kids my future farmers really had the skills he needed to build affordable housing for new yorkers  right in their own neighborhood  and this is what my kids are doing making living wage  now 
  if you 're like me you live in a building there are seven guys out of work looking to manage a million dollars i don 't have it but if you need a toilet fixed or you know some shelving  i gotta wait six months for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me that 's the beauty of this economy
  licensed and bonded in trade and that 's my first student to open up the first in his family to have a bank account 
 this immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an  atm 
 and this is the true triple bottom line because we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destitute and turn them into something like this with interiors like this  wow people noticed  and notice they did so cnn called and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer 's market  
 and then when rockefeller center said nbc could you put this thing up on the walls we were delighted  but this i show you when kids from the poorest congressional district in america
 wall  design it plant it and install it in the heart of new york city that 's a true s se puede moment really scholastic if you ask me
 but this is not a getty image that 's a picture i took of my bronx borough president addressing my kids in his house not the jailhouse making them feel a part of it that 's our state senator gustavo rivera and bob bieder coming to my classroom to make my kids feel important
 when the bronx borough president shows up and the state senator comes to our class believe you me the bronx can change attitudes now we are poised ready willing and able to export our talent and diversity in ways we 've never even imagined  
 and when the local senator gets on the scale in public and says he 's got to lose weight  
 so do i and i tell you what i 'm doing it and
 so are the kids
  then celebrities started  produce pete can 't believe what we grow  lorna sass came and donated books okay  we 're feeding seniors  and when we realized that we were growing for food justice 
  in the south bronx so did the international community and my kids in the south bronx were repped in the first international green roof conference and that 's just great except what about locally  
  the most disenfranchised and marginalized were able to roll out one hundred gardens to new york city public schools that 's triple bottom line  okay  a year ago today i was invited 
  to the new york academy of medicine  i thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy new york made sense especially when the resources were free so thank you all and i love them they introduced me to the new york city strategic alliance for health again free
  don 't waste them  and what do you know  six months later  my school and my kids were awarded the first ever high school award of excellence
 for creating a healthy school environment  the greenest class in new york city  but more importantly is my kids learned to get 
 they learned to give  and we took the money that we made from our farmer 's market and started buying gifts for the homeless and for needy around the world so we started giving back  and that 's when i realized that the greening of america starts
 first with the pockets then with the heart and
  then with the mind so we were onto something  and we 're still onto something and thank god trinity wall street noticed because they gave us the birth of green bronx machine we 're three thousand strong right now  
  and what does it really do it teaches kids to re vision their communities so when they grow up in places like this they can imagine it like this and my kids  trained and certified ma you get the tax abatement thank you mayor bloomberg can take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that and that
  me people is another true s se puede moment now 
 how does it start it starts in schools no more little knicks and little nets  
 group by broccoli  group by your favorite vegetable something you can aspire to okay and these are my future farmers of america growing up in brook park on 141st street the most migrant 
  community in america when tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this  it 's no wonder we get fruit like that and i love it and so
  teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down  and that 's a true s se puede moment  and again  brook park
 feeds hundreds of people without a food stamp or a fingerprint the poorest congressional district in america the most migratory community in america
  the south bronx of america  and we 're doing it 
 how does it start well look at jose 's attention to detail  thank god omar knows that carrots come from the ground and not aisle nine at the supermarket or through a  bullet proof window or through a piece of styrofoam  
 and when henry knows that green is good  so do i and when you expand their palates you expand their vocabulary  and most importantly when you put big kids together with little kids you get the big fat white guy out of the middle
  this kind of accountability amongst peers which is incredible god i 'm going to run out of time so i 've gotta keep it moving but
 this is my weekly paycheck for kids that 's our green graffiti this is what we 're doing  and behold the glory and bounty that is bronx county  nothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other  i gotta tell you i 'm a protective
 parent but those kids are the kids who are now putting pumpkin patches on top of trains we 're also designing coin
  ponds for the rich and affluent we 're also becoming children of the corn creating farms in the middle of fordham road for awareness and window bottles out of garbage  now i don 't expect every kid to be a farmer but i expect you to read about it 
  write about it blog about it offer outstanding customer service  i expect them to be engaged and man are they so that 's my incredible classroom that 's the food where does it go zero miles to plate right down into the cafeteria or more importantly to local shelters where most of our kids are getting one to two meals
  a day  and we 're stepping it up no air jordans were ever ruined on my farm and in his day a million dollar gardens and incredible installations let me tell you something people 
 this is a beautiful moment
  black field brown field toxic waste field battlefield we 're proving in the bronx that you can grow anywhere on cement  and we take orders for flowers i 'm putting the bake sale to shame  we take orders now
  the spring  and these were all grown from seeds  we 're learning everything  and again when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse as this to do something as special as this we 're really creating a moment  now  you may ask about these kids  
 forty percent attendance to ninety three percent attendance all start overage
 and under credit they are
  my first cohort is all in college  earning a living wage the rest are scheduled to graduate this june happy kids happy families  happy colleagues  amazed people the glory 
  and bounty that is bronx county  let 's talk about mint where is my mint  i grow seven kinds of mint in my class mojitos anybody i 'll be at telepan later  but 
 my green [ unclear ] twenty five thousand pounds of vegetables i 'm growing organic citizens engaged kids  so help us go from this to this self sustaining
  entities  eighteen months return on investment plus we 're paying people living wage and health benefits while feeding people for pennies on the dollar 
  so here in new york i urge you my fellow americans to help us make america great again  it 's simple share your passion it 's real easy go see these two videos please one got us invited to the white house one 's a recent incarnation  
 and most importantly get the biggest bully out of schools this has got to go tomorrow people you
 that keep
 kids out of stores that look like this  make them a healthy
  pick it off the wall in your own classroom delicioso  model good behavior get them to a green cart big kids love strawberries and bananas teach them entrepreneurship thank god for 
 grownyc let them cook great lunch today let them do culinary things but most importantly  just love them  nothing works like unconditional love so my good friend kermit said it 's not easy being green 
  flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment where ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor  
 okay  my dear friend majora carter once told me we have everything to gain and nothing to lose so here and at a time when we 've gone from the audacity to hope to hope for some audacity i urge you to do something  
 i urge you to do something right now we 're all tadpoles but i urge you to become a big frog and take that big green leap i don 't care if you 're on the left on the right up the middle
 join me use i 've got a lot of energy help me use it
  we can do something here  and along the way please take time to smell the flowers especially if you and your students grew them 
 i 'm steve ritz this is green bronx machine  i 've got to say thank you to my wife and family for my kids thank you for coming every day and for my colleagues believing and supporting me  we are growing our way into a new economy  thank you god bless you and enjoy the day i 'm steve ritz
