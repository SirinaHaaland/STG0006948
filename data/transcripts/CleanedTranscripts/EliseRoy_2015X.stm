  never forget the sound
 of laughing with my friends i 'll never forget the sound of my mother 's voice right before i fell asleep
  the comforting sound of water
 trickling down a stream  
 imagine my fear  pure fear 
 when at the age of ten  i was told i was going to lose my hearing  
 and over the next five years it progressed until i was classified as profoundly deaf  
 but i believe
  believe that losing my hearing
 was one of the greatest gifts i 've ever received 
 you see  i get to experience the world in a unique way  and i believe that these unique experiences
 that people with disabilities have is what 's going to help us make and design a better world
 for everyone both
  people with and without disabilities 
  i used to be a disability rights lawyer  and i spent a lot of my time focused on enforcing the law  ensuring that accommodations were made 
 and then
 i had to quickly learn international policy  because i was asked to work on the un convention that protects people with disabilities
  as the leader of the ngo there 
 i spent most of my energy trying to convince people about the capabilities of people with disabilities  
 but somewhere
 along the way  and after many career transitions that my parents weren 't so happy about 
 i stumbled upon a solution
  that i believe
 may be an even more powerful tool to solve
 some of the world 's greatest problems  disability or not
  and that tool is called design thinking 
 design thinking is a process for innovation and problem solving  there are five steps
 the first is defining the problem
 and understanding its constraints the second
 is observing people in real life situations and empathizing with them  
 third  throwing out hundreds of ideas the more the better the wilder the better
  you can find  to mimic your solution to test it and to refine it 
 and finally  implementation  ensuring that the solution you came up with is sustainable  
 warren berger says that design thinking teaches us to
  to refine to experiment and probably most importantly  ask those stupid questions 
 design thinkers believe that everyone is creative  
 they believe in bringing people from multiple disciplines together  because they want to share multiple perspectives and bring them together and ultimately merge them to form something new
 design thinking is such a successful and versatile tool that it has been applied in almost every industry  
 i saw the potential
 that it had for the issues i faced so i decided to go back to school
 and get my master 's in social design this looks at how to use design to create
  positive change in the world 
 while i was there i fell in love with woodworking  
 but what i quickly realized was that i was missing out on something as
 you 're working with a tool right before it 's about to kick back at you which means the piece or the tool jumps back at you it makes a sound  
 and i couldn 't hear this
  sound so i decided  why not try and solve it 
 my solution was a pair of safety glasses that were engineered to visually alert the user
 to pitch changes in the tool before the human ear could pick it up  why hadn 't
 tool designers thought of this before
 two reasons  
 one i was a beginner  i wasn 't weighed down by expertise or conventional wisdom 
 the second is i was deaf 
 my unique experience of the world
 helped inform my solution
  as i went on i kept running into more and more solutions that were originally made for people with disabilities  
 and that ended up being picked up embraced and loved by the mainstream disability or not 
 this is an oxo potato peeler it was originally designed for people with arthritis  but it was so comfortable everybody loved it
  text messaging that was originally designed for people who are deaf  and as you know everybody loves that too 
 i started thinking what if we changed our mindset 
 what if we started designing for disability first not the norm as
  when we design for disability first we often stumble upon solutions that are not only inclusive  
 but also are often better than when we design for the norm  
 and this excites me  because this means
 that the energy it takes to accommodate someone with a disability can be leveraged
  a force for creativity and innovation this moves us
 from the mindset of trying to change the hearts and the deficiency mindset of tolerance 
 to becoming an alchemist the type of magician that this world so desperately
  i also believe that people with disabilities have great potential to be designers within this design thinking process 
 without knowing it from a very early age i 've been a design thinker fine tuning my skills 
 design thinkers
 are by nature 
  listening to a conversation and only understanding fifty percent of what is said 
 you can 't ask them to repeat every single word  
 they would just get frustrated with you  
 so without even realizing it my solution was to take the muffled sound i heard 
  and turn it into a rhythm and place it with the lips i read years later someone commented that my writing
 had a rhythm to it well this is because i experience conversations as rhythms  
 i also became
 really really good at failing quite literally my first semester in spanish
  got a  d 
 but what i learned was that when i picked myself up and changed a few things around eventually  
 i succeeded
 design thinking encourages people to fail and fail often because
  you will succeed  
 very few great innovations in this world have come from someone succeeding on the first try  
 i also experienced this lesson in sports  i 'll never forget my coach saying to my mom 
 if she just didn 't have her hearing loss she would be on the national team
  what my coach  and what i didn 't even know at the time 
 was that my hearing loss actually helped me excel at sports  
 you see  when you lose your hearing not only do you adapt your behavior  
 but you also adapt your physical senses  
 one example of this is
 that my visual attention span increased imagine
 a soccer player coming down the left flank  imagine being goalkeeper like i was 
 and the ball is coming down the left flank a person with normal hearing would have the visual perspective
 of this i had the benefit of a spectrum this wide so i picked up the
 players over here that were moving about and coming down the field  and i picked them up quicker  
 so that if the ball was passed i could reposition myself and be ready for that shot 
 so as you can see  i 've been a design thinker for nearly all my life 
 my observation skills have been honed so that i pick up on things that others would never pick up on
  my constant need to adapt has made me a great ideator and problem solver  
 and i 've often had to do this within limitations and constraints 
 this is something that designers also have to deal with frequently 
 my work most recently took me to haiti 
 design thinkers often seek out extreme situations because that often informs some of their best
 designs  and haiti
 it was like a perfect storm  i lived and worked with three hundred deaf individuals
 that were relocated after the two thousand and ten earthquake  
 but five and a half years later  there still was no electricity
  there still was no safe drinking water there were still no job opportunities 
 there was still rampant crime and it went unpunished  international aid organizations came one by one  but they came with
  solutions they didn 't come ready to observe and to adapt based on the community
  one organization gave them goats and chickens  
 but they didn 't realize that there was so much hunger in that community 
 that when the deaf went to sleep at night and couldn 't hear 
 people broke into their yards and their homes and stole these chickens and goats and eventually they were all gone
  if that organization had taken the time to observe
 deaf people to observe the community they would have realized their problem and perhaps
 they would have come up with a solution  something like a solar light  lighting up a secure pen to put them in
  at night to ensure their safety you don 't
 have to be a design thinker to insert the ideas i 've shared with you today 
 you are creative  
 you are a designer everyone is 
 let people like me help you
  with disabilities help you look sideways  and in the process solve some of the greatest problems
