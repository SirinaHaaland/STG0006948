  a scrambled egg  but as you look at it i hope you 'll begin to feel just
  slightly uneasy 
 because you may notice that what 's actually happening is that the egg is unscrambling itself 
 and you 'll now see the yolk and the white have separated  and now they 're going to be poured back into the egg  and we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works
  a scrambled egg is mush tasty mush but it 's mush an egg is a beautiful sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things such as chickens  
 and we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity  
 in fact this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics the second law of thermodynamics or the law of
  what that says basically
 is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure
 to lack of order lack of structure in fact to mush  and that 's why that video feels a bit strange  and yet  
 look around us 
 what we see around us is staggering complexity  eric beinhocker estimates that in new york city alone there are some ten billion
  skus or distinct commodities being traded 
 that 's hundreds of times as many species as there are on earth  
 and they 're being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals who are linked by trade travel and the internet into a global system of stupendous complexity  
  a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity i 've described the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center  
 well the answer seems to be the universe can create complexity  but with great difficulty 
 in pockets there appear what my colleague  fred spier calls
  goldilocks conditions not too hot not too cold just right for the creation of complexity 
 and slightly more complex things appear  and where you have slightly more complex things you can get slightly more complex things and in this way complexity builds stage by stage 
 each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost
  out of nowhere in the universe  we refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments  
 and at each threshold the going gets tougher  the complex things get more fragile 
 more vulnerable the goldilocks conditions get more stringent  and it 's more difficult to create
  as extremely complex creatures  desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility 
 and that 's the story that we tell in big history  but to do it you have do something that may at first sight seem completely impossible you have to survey the whole history of the universe  
  do it 
 let 's begin by winding the timeline back thirteen point seven billion years to the beginning of time 
 around us
  emptiest thing you can
 and cube it a gazillion times and that 's where we are and then suddenly 
 bang a universe appears an entire universe  and we 've crossed our first threshold the universe is tiny  it 's smaller than an atom  it 's incredibly hot  it contains everything 
  that 's in today 's universe so you can imagine it 's busting  and it 's expanding at incredible
  speed
 and at first it 's just a blur  but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur  
 within the first second energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity 
 and energy does something else quite magical it congeals to form matter
 quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons and all of that
  in the first second 
 now we move forward three hundred and eighty thousand years 
 that 's twice as long as humans have been on this planet  and now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium 
 now i want to pause for a moment three hundred and eighty thousand years after the origins of the universe
 because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage 
 we know above all that it was extremely simple it consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms and they have no structure they 're really a sort of cosmic mush 
 but that 's not completely true  
 recent studies by satellites such as the wmap satellite have shown that in fact there are just tiny differences in that background what you see here  
 the blue areas
 are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas these are tiny differences but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity and this is how it works  
 gravity is more powerful where there 's more stuff  so where you get slightly denser areas 
  gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms so we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds and each cloud is compacted  gravity gets more powerful 
  as density increases  the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud and then at the center the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of ten million degrees protons start to fuse there 's a huge release of
  we have our first stars 
 from about two hundred million years after the big bang  stars begin to appear all through the universe  billions of them  
 and the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex 
 stars will create the goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds  
 when very large stars die  they create temperatures so high
 that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations to form all the elements of the periodic table  if like me you 're wearing a gold ring it was forged in a supernova explosion  
 so now the universe is chemically more complex  and in a chemically more complex universe it 's possible to make more things
  and what starts happening is that around young suns young stars 
 all these elements combine they swirl around the energy of the star stirs them around  they form particles they form snowflakes they form little dust motes they form 
  rocks they form asteroids and eventually they form planets and moons  and that is how our solar system was formed four and a half billion
  rocky planets like our earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials  so we 've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity  
 now 
 the going gets tougher  
 the next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile  significantly more vulnerable  but they 're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity
 i 'm talking of course about living organisms 
 living organisms are created by chemistry we are huge packages of chemicals 
 so chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force that operates over smaller scales than gravity which explains why you and i are smaller than stars or planets 
 now what are the ideal conditions for chemistry 
 what are the goldilocks conditions well
 you need energy  
 but not too much in the center of a star there 's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again  but not too little 
 in intergalactic space there 's so little energy that atoms can 't combine  
 what you want is just the right amount and planets it turns out are just right because they 're close to stars
  but not too close 
 you also need a great diversity of chemical elements  and you need liquids such as water why 
 well in gases atoms move past each other so fast that they can 't hitch up 
 in solids atoms are stuck together they can 't move in liquids  they can cruise and cuddle
 and link up to form molecules now where do you find such goldilocks conditions
 well planets are great and our early earth was almost perfect 
 it was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water  and deep beneath those oceans at cracks in the earth 's crust 
 you 've got heat seeping up from inside the earth  and you 've got a great diversity of elements so at those deep oceanic vents  
 fantastic chemistry began to happen
  atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations  
 but of course  life is more than just exotic chemistry 
 how do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable well 
 it 's here that life introduces an entirely new trick 
 you don 't stabilize the individual  you stabilize the template
  thing that carries information  and you allow the template to copy itself and dna of course is the beautiful molecule that contains that information you
 'll be familiar with the double helix of dna each rung contains information  so dna contains information about how to make living organisms 
  and dna also copies itself so it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean so the information spreads notice that information has become part of our story  
 the real beauty of dna though is in its imperfections as it copies itself  once in every billion rungs there tends to be an error  and what that means
 is that dna is in effect learning  it 's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work
  dna 's learning and it 's building greater diversity and greater complexity and we can see this happening over the last four billion years 
 for most of that time of life on earth living organisms have been relatively simple single cells  but they had great diversity and inside great complexity  
 then from about six hundred to eight hundred million years ago multi celled organisms appear  you get fungi you get fish
  you get plants  you get amphibia  you get reptiles  and then of course you get the dinosaurs  
 and occasionally  there are disasters
  million years ago  an asteroid landed on earth near the yucatan peninsula  creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear
  and the dinosaurs were wiped out 
 terrible news for the dinosaurs  
 but great news for our mammalian ancestors who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs  and we human beings 
 are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began sixty five million years ago with the landing of an asteroid 
 humans appeared about two hundred thousand years ago  and i believe we count
 as a threshold in this great story  let me explain why 
 we 've seen that dna learns in a sense  it accumulates information  but it is so slow 
 dna accumulates information through random errors some of which just happen to work  
 but dna had actually generated a faster way of learning it had produced organisms with brains  and those organisms can learn
  learn in real time they accumulate information they learn the sad thing is when they die  the information dies with them 
 now what makes humans different
 is human language  
 we are blessed with a language a system of communication so powerful and so precise that we can share what we 've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory
  that means it can outlast the individuals who learned that information  and it can accumulate from generation to generation  and that 's why as a species we 're so creative and so powerful and that 's why we have a history 
 we seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift 
 i call this ability collective learning  it 's what makes us different
 we can see it at work in the earliest stages of human history  
 we evolved as a species in the savanna lands of africa  
 but then you see humans migrating into new environments into desert lands into jungles into the ice age tundra of siberia tough tough environment into the americas into australasia 
 each migration involved learning learning new ways of exploiting the environment new ways
  of dealing with their surroundings then ten thousand years ago  
 exploiting a sudden change in global climate with the end of the last ice age humans learned to farm  
 farming was an energy bonanza and exploiting that energy human populations multiplied human societies got larger  denser more interconnected
  and then from about five hundred years ago  
 humans began to link up globally through shipping through trains through telegraph through the internet until now we seem to form a single 
 global brain of almost seven billion individuals  and that brain is learning at warp speed  
  collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us  
 so
 here we are 
 back at the convention center  we 've been on a journey a return journey of thirteen point seven billion years  i hope you agree this is a
  and it 's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role  but it also contains warnings 
 collective learning is a very very powerful force  and it 's not clear that we humans are in charge of it 
 i remember very vividly as a child growing up in england living through the cuban missile crisis for a
  the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction  and the same weapons are still here  and they are still armed  
 if we avoid that trap 
 others are waiting for us we 're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last ten thousand years  
 so what big history can do is
  show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us but it can also show us
 our power with collective learning and now finally
 this is what i want 
 i want my grandson daniel and his friends and his generation throughout the world to know the
  story of big history and to know it so well
 that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us 
 and that 's why a group of us are building a free  online syllabus in big history for high school students throughout the world  
 we believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them as daniel
  and his generation face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet  
 i thank you for your attention
