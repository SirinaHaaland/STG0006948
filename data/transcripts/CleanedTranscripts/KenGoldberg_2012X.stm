  i know this is going to sound strange  but i think robots can inspire us
 to be better humans see i grew up in bethlehem pennsylvania  the home of bethlehem steel my father was an engineer
  i was growing up he would teach me how things worked we would build projects together  like model rockets and slot cars 
 here 's the  go kart that we built together  
 that 's me behind the wheel  with my sister and my best friend at the time  
 and one day  he came home when i was about ten years old  and at the dinner table he
  announced that for our next project we were going to build a robot 
 a robot  now i was thrilled about this  because at school there was a bully named kevin  
 and he was picking on me because i was the only jewish kid in class  
 so i couldn 't wait to get
  they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals
  and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lifting  
 but my dad didn 't get the kind of robot he wanted either he and i worked on it for several years  but it was 
 and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn 't there yet  
  so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand and a few years later he was diagnosed with cancer 
 you see what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting  
 it was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals  
 he didn 't recognize that at the time  and he contracted leukemia  and he died at the age of
  i was devastated by this and i never forgot the robot that he and i tried to build 
 when i was at college  i decided to study engineering like him 
 and i went to carnegie mellon  and i earned my phd in robotics i 've been studying robots ever since  
 so what i 'd like to tell you about are four robot projects and how they
  how they 've inspired me to be a better human
  by one thousand nine hundred and ninety three i was a young professor at 
 and i was just building up my own robotics lab  and this was the year the world wide web came out 
 and i remember my students were the ones who told me about it  and we would
 we were just amazed we started playing with this
  and that afternoon  we realized that we could use this new universal interface to allow anyone in the world
 to operate the robot in our lab  
 so  rather than have it fight or do industrial work  
 we decided to build a planter put the robot into the center of it  and we called it the telegarden
  put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the of the robot  and we wrote some special scripts and software so that anyone in the world could come in and by clicking on the screen they could move the robot around and visit the garden  
 but we also set up some other software that lets you participate
 and help us water the garden  remotely and if you watered it a few times
 we 'd give you your own seed to plant now 
 this was an engineering project  
 and we published some papers on the system design of it  but we also thought of it as an art installation 
 it was invited after the first year by the ars electronica museum in austria
  have it installed in their lobby  
 and i 'm happy to say it remained online there twenty four hours a day  for almost nine years that robot was operated
 by more people than any other robot in history now one day  i got a call out of the blue
 from a student  who asked a very simple but profound question
 is the robot real 
 now everyone else had assumed it was and we knew it was because we were working with it  but i knew what he meant  
 because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden and then basically index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot
  and the more i thought about it i couldn 't think of a good answer for how he could tell the difference 
 this was right about the time that i was offered a position here at berkeley  
 and when i got here  i looked up hubert dreyfus who 's a  world renowned professor of philosophy  
 and i talked with him about this and he said this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy 
 it goes back to the skeptics and up through descartes
 it 's the issue of epistemology  the study of how do we know that something is true 
 so he and i started working together  and we coined a new term telepistemology 
 the study of knowledge at a distance we invited leading artists engineers
 and philosophers to write essays about this and the results are collected in this book from mit
  press  
 so thanks to this student  who questioned what everyone else had assumed to be true  
 this project taught me an important lesson about life  
 which is to always
 question assumptions 
 now the second project i 'll tell you about grew out of the telegarden  as it was operating my students and i were very interested in how people were
  other and what they were doing with the garden  so we started thinking what if the robot could leave the garden
 and go out into some other interesting environment  like for example what if it could go to a dinner party
 at the white house so  because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface
  we decided that rather than have a robot replace the human
 to go to the party  we 'd have a human replace the robot we called it the tele actor 
 we got a human  someone who 's very outgoing and gregarious
 and
 she was outfitted with a helmet
 with various equipment cameras and microphones and then a backpack with wireless internet connection  and the idea was that she could go
  into a remote and interesting environment  and then over the internet people could experience what she was experiencing  so they could
 see what she was seeing  but then more importantly they could participate by interacting with each other
 and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go and then conveying those to the
 so we got a chance to take the tele actor to the webby awards
 in san francisco  and that year sam donaldson was the host 
 just before the curtain went up i had about thirty seconds to explain to mr donaldson what we were going to do  
  is going to be joining you onstage this is a new experimental project  and people are watching her on their screens 
 there 's cameras involved and
 there 's microphones and she 's got an earbud in her ear  and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next and he said wait a second that 's what i do
 she walked right up to him  and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips 
 laughter we were totally surprised we had no idea that would happen  
 and he was great he just gave her a big hug in return and it worked out great but that night as we were packing up  i asked 
 how did the tele directors decide that they would give a kiss to sam donaldson
  and she said they hadn 't she
 said  
 when she was just about to walk onstage the tele directors still were trying to agree on what to do and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural 
 laughter so the success of the tele actor that night
 was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor she knew when to trust her instincts
  and so that project taught me another lesson about life  which is that when in doubt  improvise 
 now the third project grew out of my experience when my father was in the hospital  
 he was undergoing a treatment chemotherapy treatments and there 's a related treatment called
  called brachytherapy  where tiny  radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors  
 and the way it 's done  as you can see here is that surgeons
 insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds and all these needles are inserted in
  it 's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs and as a result
 the needles
 damage these organs cause damage  which leads to trauma and side effects  
 so my students and i wondered what if we could modify
 the system  so that the needles could come in
  so we simulated this we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this and we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs and yet still achieve the coverage of the of the tumors with the radiation  
 so now we 're working with doctors at ucsf and engineers at johns hopkins and we 're building a robot
  that has a number of it 's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles  
 and as you can see here they can avoid delicate organs
 and still reach the targets they 're aiming for 
 so by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel  this project also taught me an important lesson  
 when in doubt  when your path is blocked
 and the last project also has to do with medical robotics  and this is
 something that 's grown out of a system called the da vinci surgical robot  
 and this is a commercially available device it 's being used in over two thousand hospitals around the world
  the idea is it allows
  many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious like suturing 
 and currently all of these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon  
 so the surgeon becomes fatigued over time  and we 've been wondering what if we could program the robot
 to perform some of these subtasks and thereby free the surgeon
  to focus on the more complicated parts of the of the surgery and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster now 
 it 's hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this  
 but it turns out my colleague pieter abbeel  who 's here at berkeley  has developed a new set of techniques
 for teaching robots from example  so he 's gotten
  robots to fly helicopters do incredibly interesting beautiful acrobatics by watching human experts fly them  
 so we got one of these robots we started working with pieter and his students and we asked a surgeon
 to perform a task
 with the robot so what we 're doing is asking the surgeon to perform the task and we record the motions of the robot
 so here 's an example i 'll use tracing out a figure eight as an example  
 so here 's what it looks like when the robot this is what the robot 's path looks like those three examples  now  those are much better than what a novice like me could do  
 but they 're still jerky and imprecise  so we record all these
  go through a sequence of steps  
 first  we use a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition  and this allows us to temporally align all of the examples  
 and then we apply kalman filtering a technique from
 control theory that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them
  human demonstrations they 're all noisy and imperfect and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot we then execute that on the robot  
 we observe what happens 
 then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning 
 then what we do
 is we increase the velocity a little bit  we observe the results adjust the controls again
  again  
 and observe what happens and we go through this several rounds  and here 's the result that 's the inferred task trajectory and here 's the robot moving at the
 speed of the human here 's four times the speed of the human here 's seven times  
 and here 's the robot operating at ten times
 the speed of the human so we 're able to get a robot to perform a delicate
  task like a surgical subtask at ten times the speed of a human  so this project
 also because of its involved practicing and learning doing something over and over again this project also has a lesson  
 which is  if you want to do something well 
  so these are four of the lessons that i 've learned from robots over the years
 and the field of robotics has gotten much better over time  
 nowadays high school students can build robots like the industrial robot my dad and i tried to build  
 but it 's very
  now  and now 
 i have a daughter named odessa 
 she 's eight years old  and she likes robots too maybe it runs in the family 
 laughter i wish she could meet my dad
 and now i get to teach her how things work and we get to build projects together  and i wonder what kind of lessons she 'll learn from them
 robots are the most human
 of our machines they can 't solve all of the world 's problems  but i think they have something
 important to teach us i invite all of you
 to think about the innovations that you 're interested in the machines that you wish for and think about what
  might be telling you because i have a hunch that many of our technological innovations the devices we dream about 
 can inspire us to be better humans
