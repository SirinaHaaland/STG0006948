  ten years ago exactly  i was in afghanistan  
 i was covering the war in afghanistan  and i witnessed as a reporter for al jazeera 
 the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged
 out of a war like that then
  two years later  i covered another war the war in iraq  i was placed
 at the center of that war because i was covering the war from the northern part of iraq  
 and the war ended with a regime change like the one in afghanistan  
 and that regime that we got rid of
 was actually a dictatorship
  regime that for decades
 created a
 great sense of paralysis within the nation within the people themselves  
 however the change that came through foreign intervention created even worse circumstances for the people and deepened the sense of paralysis and inferiority in that part of the world  
 for decades
  decades we have lived under authoritarian regimes in the arab world in the middle east 
 these regimes created something within us
 during this period i 'm forty three years old right now for the last forty years  i have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents
  regimes that we have seen around us and for a moment i was wondering 
 are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground a change that does not come through foreign intervention 
 through the misery of occupation 
  and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes 
 the iraqis  
 yes they got rid of saddam hussein  but when they saw their land occupied by foreign forces they felt very sad 
 they felt that their dignity had suffered  and this is why they revolted this is why they did not accept
  and actually other regimes they told their citizens would you like to see the situation of iraq  
 would you like to see civil war sectarian killing  would you like to see destruction would you like to see foreign troops on your land 
 and the people thought for themselves maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in instead of having the second scenario 
 that was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen for ten years
 unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting
 images of destruction  
 images of killing of sectarian conflicts  images of violence  emerging from a magnificent piece of land a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture
 for thousands of years now i am here to tell you
  that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived 
 a new generation
 connected inspired by universal values and a global understanding has
 created a new reality for us
 we have found a new way to express our feelings and to express our dreams  
 these young people
 who have restored
  our nations in that part of the world  who have given us new meaning for freedom
 and empowered us to go down to the streets nothing happened
 nothing just step out of your house raise your voice and say we would like to see the end of the regime this is what happened in tunisia 
 over a few days  the tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars in the security agencies 
  because of the voices of the public people who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices they tried to kill  the intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people  they
 found something called facebook  they found something called twitter  they were surprised by all of these
  they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them bring them back home this is what they were telling this is their propaganda bring these kids home because they are misled 
 but yes  
 these youth
 who have been inspired by universal values who are idealistic enough to imagine a magnificent future and
  same time realistic enough to balance this kind of imagination and the process leading to it
 not using violence not trying to create chaos
 these young people  
 they did not go home  parents actually went to the streets and they supported them and this is how the revolution was born in tunisia  
 we in al jazeera
 were banned from tunisia for for years  and the government did not allow any al jazeera reporter to be there  
 but we found that these people in the street all of them are our reporters  
 feeding our newsroom with pictures with videos and with news  and suddenly that newsroom in doha became a center
 that received all this kind of input
 from ordinary people people who are connected and people who have ambition and who have liberated themselves from the feeling of inferiority  
 and then we took that decision  we are unrolling the news  
 we are going to be the voice for these voiceless people we are going to spread the message  yes  some of these young people are connected to the internet  but the connectivity in the arab world is very little
  because of many problems that we are suffering from but al jazeera took the voice from these people and we amplified [ it ] 
 we put it in every sitting room in the arab world and internationally globally through our english english channel  
 and then
 people started to feel that there 's
  decided to leave  
 and then egypt started 
 and hosni mubarak decided to leave  and now libya as you see it and then you have yemen  and you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that 
 feeling of how do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant 
  internet
 and connectivity has created [ a ] new mindset  but this mindset
 has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from and while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change 
 before we thought and governments told us and even
  sometimes it was true that change was imposed on us 
 and people rejected that because they thought that it is alien to their culture
 always we believed
 that change will spring from within that change should be
 a reconciliation
  cultural diversity with our faith in our tradition and in our history  but at the same time open to universal values  connected with 
  the world  tolerant to the outside  and this is the moment that is happening right now in the arab world  this is the right moment and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create
 the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the
  region how did the elite deal with that
 the so called political elite in front of facebook they brought the camels
 in tahrir square  in front of al jazeera  they started creating tribalism  and then when they
  they started speaking about conspiracies that emerged from tel aviv
 and washington in order to divide the arab world  they started telling the west be aware of al qaeda al qaeda
 is taking over our territories these are islamists trying to create new imaras
  be aware of these people who [ are ] coming to you
 in order
  right now cannot be deceived  because this corrupt elite
 in that region has lost even the power of deception  
 they could not and they cannot imagine how they could really deal with this reality
 they have lost  they have been detached
  their people from the masses  and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other 
 al jazeera is not
 a tool of revolution we do not create revolutions  
 however when something of that magnitude happens  we are at the center of the coverage 
 we were banned from egypt 
 and our correspondents  some of them were arrested
 but
 most of our
 camera people and our journalists  they went underground in egypt voluntarily
 to report what happened in tahrir square  for eighteen days our cameras were
 broadcasting live the voices of the people in tahrir square
  i remember one night
 when someone phoned me on my cellphone ordinary person who i don 't know from tahrir square  he told me we appeal to you not to switch off the cameras if you switch off the cameras tonight there will be a genocide 
 you are protecting us by showing what is happening at
 tahrir square i felt the responsibility
 to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to
  make your best not to switch off the cameras at night 
 because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story and they feel protected as well 
 so we have a chance
 to create a new future in that part of the world  
 we have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world 
 let us not
  the mistake of iran of [ the ] mosaddeq revolution  let us free ourselves especially in the west from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest 
 or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security
  but terrorism and violence and destruction  let us accept the choice of the people  let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule to rule their future 
 the future should be ruled by people themselves  even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us 
  moment in time is the best opportunity for the world for the west and the east 
 to see stability and to see security and to see friendship and to see tolerance emerging from the arab world  rather than the images of violence and 
  terrorism let us support these people  let us stand for them
  and let us give up our narrow selfishness in order to embrace change and in order to celebrate with the people of that region a great future and hope and tolerance 
 the future has arrived  
 and the future is now i thank you very much
  thank you for coming here how would you characterize the historical significance of what 's happened  is this
  be the biggest story that we have ever covered we have covered many wars we have covered a lot of tragedies a lot of problems a lot of conflict zones a lot of hot spots in the region because we were centered at the middle of it  but this is a story 
 it is a great story it is beautiful it is not something that you only cover because you have to cover
  you are witnessing
 change in history you are witnessing the birth of a new era  and this is what the story 's all about ca there are a lot of people in the west who are still
 skeptical or think this may just be
 an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos 
 you really believe that if there are democratic elections in egypt now that a government could emerge that espouses some of the values you 've spoken about so inspiringly
 actually after the collapse of the hosni mubarak regime  
 the youth who have organized themselves in certain groups and councils they are guarding the transformation
 and they are trying to put it on a track in order to satisfy
 the values of of democracy  but at the same time also to make it reasonable and to make it rational not to
 to go out of order in my opinion these people are much more wiser than not only the political elite  even the intellectual elite even opposition leaders including political parties 
 at this moment in time  the youth in the arab world are much more wiser and capable of creating the change than the
  we are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way what should people here here at ted here in the west 
 do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what 's happening here wk i think we have discovered a very
  issue in the arab world that people care people care about this great transformation mohamed nanabhay who 's sitting with us the head of 
 he told me that
 a two thousand five hundred percent increase of of accessing our website from various parts of the world fifty percent of it is coming from america  because we discovered that people care  and people would like to know
  receiving the stream through our internet  unfortunately in the united states we are not covering but washington d c at this moment in time for
 al jazeera english but i can tell you this is the moment to celebrate through connecting ourselves with those people in the street and expressing 
 our support to them and expressing this kind of feeling universal feeling of supporting the weak and the oppressed to create a much better future for all of us
 well wadah a group of
 members of the ted community  tedxcairo are meeting as we speak 
 they 've had some speakers there i believe they 've heard your talk  thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us thank you so much
