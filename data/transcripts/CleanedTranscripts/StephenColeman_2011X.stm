  what i want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the western world
 australia  united states the uk and so on face in some of the deployments that they 're dealing with
 in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things we 've sent australian military
  personnel to in recent years we 've got obvious things like iraq and afghanistan but you 've also got things like east timor and the solomon islands and so on  
 and a lot of these deployments that we 're sending military personnel to these days aren 't
 traditional wars  in fact a lot of the jobs  we 're asking military personnel to do in those
 situations are ones that in their own countries australia the us and so on would actually be done by police officers
 so there 's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they 're doing things they haven 't really been trained for and they 're doing things
 that
 those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for  now there 's a bunch of reasons why we send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs  
 if australia had to send
  people tomorrow to west papua for example  we don 't have one thousand police officers hanging around that could go tomorrow and we do have one thousand soldiers that could go  
 so when we have to send someone we send the military they 're there they 're available and heck they 're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support  
 so they are able to do it in that sense  but they aren 't trained the same way
  police officers are and they 're certainly not equipped the way police officers are so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these issues 
 one particular thing that 's come up that i am especially interested in is the question of whether when we 're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the
  nonlethal weapons that police have 
 since they 're doing some of the same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and there 's a range of places you 'd think those things would be really useful for example when you 've got military checkpoints 
 if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel are unsure if this person 's hostile or not  say this person approaching here and they say is this a suicide bomber or not  is something hidden under their clothes what 's
  person is hostile or not if the person doesn 't follow directions they may end up shooting them 
 and then find out afterwards either  yes we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn 't understand what was going on  
 so if they had nonlethal weapons then they would say we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn 't hostile at least we haven 't killed them 
 another situation this photo is from one of the missions in the balkans in the late
 where maybe they know someone is hostile  they 've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that 's clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever  
 but if they respond there 's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt it 'd
 be collateral damage that the military often doesn 't want to talk about so again they 'd say  with access to nonlethal weapons
  if we 've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else at least we 're not going to kill them 
 another suggestion has been since we 're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they 're actually going to send robots out in the field that are autonomous they 'll make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without a human in the loop 
 so the suggestion is if we 're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea
  nonlethal weapons so if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven 't actually killed them  
 now there 's a whole range of different sorts of nonlethal weapons some of which are available now some of which they 're developing  you 've got traditional things like pepper spray  oc spray up at the top there or tasers over here  the one on the top right here is
  actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them 
 you 've got nonlethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones 
 and this one in the middle here  the large truck is called the active denial system something the us military is working on at the moment 
 it 's essentially a big microwave transmitter 
 it 's sort of your classic idea of a heat ray
  it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things anybody who is hit with this feels a sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way 
 it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin  
 so you feel this massive heat and you go i want to get out of the way and
 they think this will be really useful in places where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile
  need to keep people away from a particular place we can do that with these sorts of things
  so there 's a whole range of different nonlethal weapons we could give military personnel  and there 's a whole range of situations where they 're looking at them and saying these things would be really useful 
 but as i said the military and the police are very
  have to look very hard at this to recognize that they might be very different
  in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they 're trained to use force is especially different 
 the police and knowing because i 've actually helped to train police police particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained
 to  de escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force
 only as an absolute last resort 
 military personnel are being trained for war  so they 're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force
  the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine 
 you can start shooting at people 
 so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different
 and i think it 's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of nonlethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police 
 and since we 've already had so many problems with police use of nonlethal weapons in various ways i thought it would be a good idea to look at some of those things and relate it to the military context
 i was very surprised when i started to do this to see
  people who advocated the use of nonlethal weapons by the military
 hadn 't actually done that 
 they generally seemed to think why would we care what 's happened with the police we
 're looking at something different and didn 't seem to recognize  they were looking at pretty much the same stuff 
 so i started to investigate some of those issues and have a look at the way police use nonlethal weapons when they 're introduced and some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things
 when they actually do introduce them and
 of course  being australian i started looking at stuff in australia knowing from my own experience of various times when nonlethal weapons have been introduced in australia 
 one of the things i particularly looked at was the use of oc spray oleoresin capsicum spray pepper spray
 by
 australian police and seeing what had happened when that had been introduced and those sorts of issues  and one study that i found a particularly interesting
  one was in queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly
  and i went and had a look at some of the figures here  now  when they introduced oc spray in queensland they were really explicit the police minister 's and a heap of public statements were made 
  about it they were saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting
  this is something they can use instead of a firearm in situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone 
 so i looked at all of the police shooting figures and you can 't actually find them very easily for individual australian states i could only find these this is from an australian institute of criminology 
  report you can see in the fine print at the top police shooting deaths means not just people shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the
  presence of police 
 but these are the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where queensland said yes this is where we 're going to give all police officers across the entire state access 
  to oc spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years 
  victoria yes correct  that spike was all victoria 
 so it wasn 't that queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on 
 so six shootings across the whole country  fairly consistently over the years before the next two years were the years they studied two thousand and one two thousand and two anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they 've introduced this the number of times police in queensland used oc spray in that period
 hundreds one  three a thousand is getting better 
 explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting i 'm going to go out on a limb here
  and say that if queensland police didn 't have oc spray they wouldn 't have shot two thousand two hundred and twenty six people in those two years
 laughter in fact if you have a look at the studies they were looking at 
 the material they were collecting and and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about fifteen percent of cases where oc spray was used
  it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were
  no complaints about it not within the context of this study anyway
 it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent  who were potentially violent  and also quite frequently used
 to deal with people who were simply passively noncompliant
  this person is not doing anything violent but they just won 't do what we want them to they 're not obeying the directions we 're giving them so
  that 'll speed them up everything will work out better that
 way this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it 's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems  
 now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of nonlethal weapons and people 
  might be some problems there 's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is
  weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of force is that you have to be discriminate you have to be careful about who you 're shooting at 
 so one of the problems suggested with nonlethal weapons is that they might be used indiscriminately that you would use them against a whole range of people because you don 't have to worry so much anymore  and in fact  one particular instance where i think that actually happens
  moscow in two thousand and two which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students at adfa are old enough to remember  
 so  chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they were holding something like seven hundred people hostage they 'd released a bunch of people but they still had about seven hundred people hostage  
 and the russian military police
  came in and stormed the theater the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anesthetic gas  and it turned out that lots of the hostages died
 as a result of inhaling the gas
  it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas  
 and it 's no surprise that people died because you don 't know how much gas each person is
  to inhale what position they 'll fall in when they become unconscious and so on there were in fact only a couple of people who got shot
 in this episode  so when they had a look at it afterward there were only a couple of people who 'd apparently been shot by the hostage takers or by the
 police forces trying to deal with the situation  virtually everybody that got killed got killed
 from inhaling the gas  the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it 's certainly a few more than that because other people
  over the next few days  
 so this was one problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately a
 second problem people sometimes talk about with military use of nonlethal weapons and it 's actually why in the chemical weapons convention it 's very clear that you can 't use riot control agents as weapons of warfare
  that it 's seen that sometimes nonlethal weapons might be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a lethal force multiplier
 that you use nonlethal weapons first so your lethal weapons will actually be more effective 
 the people you 'll be shooting at won 't be able to get out of the way they won 't be aware of what 's happening  and you can kill them better  and that 's exactly what happened here  
 the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody
  were simply shot in the head  
 so this nonlethal weapon was being used in this case as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation
 another problem i want to quickly mention is that
 there 's a whole heap of problems with the way people are actually taught to use nonlethal weapons and get trained about them and then
  tested and so on because they 're tested in nice  safe environments and are taught to use them in nice safe environments like this where
 you can see exactly what 's going on the person spraying the oc spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don 't get contaminated and so on  
 but they 're never used like that they 're used out in the real world 
 like in texas like this [ police taser great grandmother during traffic stop ]
 i confess this particular case
  one that piqued my interest in this it happened while i was working as a research fellow at the us naval academy
 news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with a police officer she wasn 't violent  
 in fact  he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall 
 and eventually she said to him well i 'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car i 'm going to tase you and she says oh go ahead
  and it 's all captured by the video camera running in the
 in the front of the police car 
 so she 's seventy two 
 and it 's seen that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with her 
 and there are other examples of the same sorts of things where you think is this really an appropriate way to use nonlethal weapons 
 police chief fires taser into fourteen year old girl 's head she was running away what else was i suppose to do
  or florida 
 police taser 6 year old boy at elementary school and they clearly learned a lot from it because in the same district police review policy after children shocked 2nd child shocked by taser stun gun within weeks same police district  
 another child within weeks of tasering the six year old boy  just
  i checked the reports on this one i looked at it i was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed
 i kid you not that 's exactly what it said she took up a more threatening position in her bed 
 but i 'd remind you i 'm talking about military uses of nonlethal weapons so why is this relevant
  because police are actually more restrained in the use of force than the military are they 're trained to be more restrained in the use of force than
  they 're trained to think more to try and de escalate so if you have these problems with police officers with nonlethal weapons  
 what on earth would make you think it 's going to be better with military personnel  
 the last thing that i would like to say  
 when i 'm talking to the police about what a perfect nonlethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably say the same thing they say it 's got to be something that 's nasty enough that people don 't want to be hit with this weapon  
 so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it
 but it 's also going to be something that doesn 't leave any lasting effects 
 in other words your perfect nonlethal weapon is something that 's perfect for abuse 
 what would these guys have done if they 'd had access to tasers or to a manned portable version of the active denial system
 a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about
  so i think
 yes  there may be ways that nonlethal weapons will be great in these situations but there 's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well  thanks very much
