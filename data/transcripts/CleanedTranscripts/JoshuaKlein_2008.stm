  any of you get really freaked out by that you might want to leave now so this is a vending machine for crows over the past few days many of you have been asking
  how did you come to this how did you get started doing this it started as with many great ideas or many ideas you can 't get rid of anyway at a cocktail party 
 about ten years ago i was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine we were sitting there and he was complaining about the crows that were all over his yard and making a big mess  
 and he was telling me we ought to eradicate these things kill them because they 're making a mess 
 i said that was stupid maybe we should just train them to do something useful and he said that was impossible  
 and i 'm sure i 'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying
 when someone tells you it 's impossible  so i spent the next ten years reading about crows in my spare time 
 and after ten years of this my wife said you 've got to do this thing you 've been talking about and build the vending machine so i did  
 but part of the reason i found this interesting is 
 i started noticing that we 're very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion and
  one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living 
 they 're surviving and i 'm talking specifically about synanthropic species  
 which have adapted specifically for human ecologies species like rats and cockroaches and and crows  
 and as i started looking at them i was finding that they had hyper adapted they 'd become extremely adept at living with us  and in return we just tried to kill them all the time 
 laughter and in doing so we were
  breeding them for parasitism we were giving them all sorts of
 reasons to adapt new ways so for example rats are incredibly responsive breeders and cockroaches as anyone who 's tried to get rid of them knows have become really immune to the poisons that we 're using  
 so i thought 
 let 's build something that 's mutually beneficial something that we can both benefit from and find some way to make a new relationship with these species so i built the vending machine
  but the story of the vending machine is is a little more interesting if you know more about crows  
 it turns out crows aren 't just surviving with human beings they 're actually thriving they 're found everywhere on the planet except for the arctic and the southern tip of south america  and in all that area 
  they 're only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings  so we may not think about them but they 're always around
  and not surprisingly  given the human population growth more than half of the human population is living in cities now and
 out of those nine tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities we 're seeing a population boom with crows  so
 bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers  so that that 's no great surprise  
 but what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way
  this is betty she 's a new caledonian crow and these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood here she 's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube  but the researchers had a problem they messed up and left just a stick of wire in there 
 and
 she hadn 't had the opportunity to do this before you see it wasn 't working very well 
 so she adapted now this is completely unprompted she had never seen this done before no one taught her to
  bend this into a hook or had shown her how it could happen but she did it all on her own  so keep in mind she 's never seen this done
 it turns out we 've been finding more and more that crows are really really intelligent their brains are in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are 
 there 's all kinds of anecdotes for the different kinds of intelligence they have for example in sweden crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice and when the fishermen move off the crows fly down reel up the lines and eat the fish or the the bait it 's pretty annoying for the fishermen
 an entirely different tack at university of washington a
 few years ago they were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus some students went out netted some crows  
 brought them in weighed and measured them and let them back out again and they were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week whenever these particular students walked around campus these crows would caw at them and and run around and make make their life kind of miserable
  less entertained when this went on for the next week  
 and the next month  and after summer break  
 until they finally graduated and left campus and glad to get away i 'm sure came back sometime later and found the crows still remembered them 
 so the moral being don 't piss off crows  so
 now students at the university of washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask
  fairly interesting 
 so we know these crows are really smart but the more i dug into this the more i found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation video crows have become highly skilled at
 making a living in these new urban environments in this japanese city  they have
 devised a way of eating a food that normally they can 't manage
  's significant about this isn 't that crows are using cars to crack nuts in fact that 's old hat for crows this happened about ten years ago in
 a place called sendai city at a driving school in the suburbs of tokyo
  since that time all the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior now every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk waiting to collect its lunch  
 so they 're learning from each other and research bears this out parents seem to be teaching their young  
 they learn from their peers they learn from their enemies if i have a little extra time i 'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity
  they 've developed cultural adaptation  and as we heard yesterday that 's the pandora 's box that 's getting human beings in trouble and we 're starting to see it with them
 they 're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges and new resources in their environment  which is really useful if you live in a city  
 so we know that there 's lots of crows  we found out they 're really smart and they can teach each other when all this became clear i realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine
  so that 's what we did this is a vending machine for crows and it uses skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages it 's pretty simple 
 basically what happens is that we put this out in a field or someplace where there 's lots of crows we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine crows eventually come by eat the peanuts and get used 
  to the machine being there  eventually they eat all the peanuts then they see peanuts here on the feeder tray and hop up and help themselves
 then they leave the machine spits up more coins and peanuts and life is dandy if you 're a crow you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut  so when they get really used to that we move on
 to the crows coming back now they 're used to the sound of the machine they keep coming back and digging out peanuts from the pile of coins that 's there  when they get really happy about this we stymie them
  move to the third stage where we only give them a coin now like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing this really pisses them off  so
 they do what they do in nature when they 're looking for something sweep things out of the way with their beak they do that here and that knocks the coins down the slot  when that happens they get a peanut
  this goes on for some time the crows learn that all they have to do is show up wait for the coin to come out put it in the slot then get their peanut  when they 're good and comfortable with that we move to the final stage where they show up and nothing happens
  is where we see the difference between crows and other animals squirrels for example would show up look for the peanut  
 go away come back look for the peanut  go away they do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored and then they go off and play in traffic
  crows on the other hand show up and they try and figure it out they know this machine has been messing with them through three different stages of behavior
  so they they poke at it and peck at it and eventually some crow gets a bright idea hey 
 there 's lots of coins lying around from the first stage hops down picks it up drops it in the slot  
 and we 're off to the races that crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts until his friends figure out how to do it and then there we go 
 so what 's significant about this to me isn 't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts mind you there 's two hundred and sixteen
  million dollars ' worth of change lost every year  but i 'm not sure i can depend on that roi from crows 
 laughter instead i think we should look a little bit larger 
 i think crows can be trained to do other things for example why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events  or find expensive components from discarded electronics 
 or maybe do search and rescue
  the main point of all this for me is we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species we can find ways to interact with these other species that doesn 't involve exterminating them  but involves finding an equilibrium with them that 's a useful balance 
 thanks very much
