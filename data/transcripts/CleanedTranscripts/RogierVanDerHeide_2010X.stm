  statement on the screen that says light creates ambiance light makes
 the feel of a space and light is also the expression of structure
  that was not by me that was of course by le corbusier  the famous
 architect and here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings the chapel
 notre dame du haut de ronchamp where he creates this light that he could only make because there 's also dark  and
 i think that is the quintessence of this
  there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well being without proper darkness  
 so this is how we normally would light our offices we have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much lux
 and of great uniformity  this is how we
 create uniform lighting from one wall to the other in a regular grid of lamps and
 that is quite different from what i just showed you from le corbusier 
 if we would apply these codes and standards to the pantheon in rome it would never have looked like this  because
 this beautiful light feature that goes around there all by itself can only appear because there is also darkness in that same
  the same is more or less what santiago calatrava said when he said 
 light i make it in my buildings for comfort and he didn 't mean the comfort of a five course dinner
 as opposed to a one course meal  
 but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people he meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience
  and he created these gorgeous
 buildings where you can see the sky and where you can experience the sun that give us a better life in the built environment
  just because of the relevance of light
 in its brightness and also in its shadows  and
 what it all boils down to is of course the sun  and this image of the sun may
 suggest that the sun is something evil and aggressive but we should not forget that all energy on this planet actually comes
  from the sun  and light is only
 a manifestation of that energy 
 the sun is for dynamics for color changes the sun is for beauty in our environment like in this building
 the high museum in atlanta  which has been created by renzo piano from italy together with arup lighting a brilliant team of lighting designers
  created a very subtle modulation of light across the space  responding to what the sun does outside just because of all these beautiful openings in the roof  so in an indirect way you can see
 the sun  and what they did is they created an integral building element to improve
 the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum they created this
  shade that you can see here which
 actually covers the sun  but opens up to the good light from the sky 
 and here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models with
 quantitative as well as qualitative methods to come to
 a final
 solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture 
 they allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way as you can see here there 's some direct light on the floor but they could easily figure out where that comes from  
 and they
 allow people in that building to really enjoy the sun  the good part of the sun  and enjoying the sun can be
 in many different ways of course  it can be just like this  or maybe like this which is rather peculiar but this is
 the viewing of a sun eclipse
 in the united states  and it 's just a bit bright up there  so these people have found a very intriguing solution
  this is i think a very illustrative image of what i try to say that the beautiful dynamics of sun 
 bringing these into the building 
 creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives
 this is all about darkness as much as it is about lightness of course because otherwise you don 't see these dynamics as opposed to the first office that i showed you
 in the beginning of the talk this is
 a well known office which is the weidt group they are
 in green energy consulting or something like that and they really practice what they preach because this office doesn 't have any electric lighting at all it has only on one side
  big big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range 
 so it can be very dim over there and you do your work and it can be very bright over there and you do your work  but actually the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable to all these 
  different light conditions that together create an environment that is never boring and that is never dull and therefore
  helps us to enhance our lives  i really owe a short introduction of this man to you this is richard kelly
 who was born one hundred years ago which is the reason i bring him up now because it 's kind of an anniversary year in the 
  richard kelly was the first person to really describe a
  different ideas about light in architecture that all together make up this
 beautiful experience so to begin with focal glow he meant something like this where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around  
  or something like this  which is the lighting design he did for general motors for the car showroom and you enter that space and you feel like wow  this is
 so impressive just because of this focal point this huge light source in the middle 
 to me it is something from theater and i will get back to that a little bit later it 's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus  
 it could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and
  lights up a patch of the land highlighting it
 compared to the dim environment  or it can be in today 's retail in the shopping environment
 lighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around  
 ambient luminescence is something very different 
 richard kelly saw it as something infinite something without any focus something where all details
  i see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax
 and to contemplate  it could also be something like this the national museum of science in london where
 this blue is embracing all the exhibitions and galleries in one large gesture  and then finally kelly 's play of brilliants added
  to that
 really some play  i think of the skyline of hong kong  or perhaps the chandelier in the opera house  or in the theater here  
 which is the decoration  the icing on the cake something playful something that is just an addition to the architectural environment i would say 
 these three distinct elements together make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better  
 and we can only create these out of darkness and i will explain that further  and i guess that is something that richard kelly here on
  left was explaining to ludwig mies van der rohe  and behind them you see that seagram building that later turned into an icon
 of modern lighting design those times there were some
 early attempts also for light therapy already you can see here a photo from the united states library of medicine where people are put in the sun
  to get better it 's a little bit of a different story this health aspect of light than what i 'm telling you today  in today 's
 modern medicine  there is a real understanding of light in an almost biochemical way  and
 there is the idea that when we look at things it is the yellow light that helps us the most that we are the most sensitive for but
 our circadian rhythms which are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep and be alert
  relaxed and so forth and so on they are much more triggered by blue light 
 and by modulating the amount of blue in our environment  we can help people to relax  or to be alert to fall asleep  or to stay awake  
 and that is how 
 maybe in the near future light can help hospitals to
 make people better sooner  recover them quicker
  maybe in the airplane we can overcome jet lag like that perhaps
 in school we can help children to learn better because they concentrate more on their work  
 and you can imagine a lot more applications  but i would like to talk further about
 the combination of light and
 darkness as a quality in our life so light is of course
 social interaction also to create relationships with all the features around us 
 it is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other  
 and it is all about this planet  but when you look at this planet at night  it looks like this  and i think this is the most shocking image in my talk today  because all this light here goes up to the sky  it never reaches the
  ground where it was meant for it never is to the benefit of people it only spoils the darkness  so
 at a global scale  it looks like this  and i mean that is quite amazing what you see here how much light
 goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground because if we look at the earth the way it
  something like this very inspiring image where darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation
 and to help us to relate to everything 
 the world is changing though and urbanization is a big driver of everything i took this photo two weeks ago in guangzhou and i realized that ten years ago there was nothing like this
 of these buildings 
 it was just a much smaller city and the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous  and we have to
  understand
 these main questions how do people move through these new urban spaces how do they share their culture how do we tackle things like mobility 
 and how can light help there because the new technologies they seem to be in a really interesting position to contribute to the solutions
 of urbanization and
  provide us with better environments 
 it 's not that long ago that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps and of course we had the metal halide lamps and fluorescent lamps and things like that 
 now we have led but here you see the latest one and you see how incredibly small it is and this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity 
 because
 this tiny tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it and we can actually leave it out where it 's not needed at all
  and where we can preserve darkness  so that is a really interesting proposition i think  and a new way of lighting
 the architectural environment with our well being in mind  
 the problem is though that i wanted to explain to you how this really works but i can have four of these on my finger  so you would not be able to really see them  so i asked
  our laboratory to do something about it and they said well we can do something they created for me the biggest led in the world especially for tedx in amsterdam  so here it is 
  it 's the same thing as you can see over there just two hundred times bigger  and i will very quickly show you how it works  so just
  this is not very pleasant and comfortable and for that reason we cover the led with
 a phosphor cap and the phosphor is excited by the blue
 and makes the light white and warm and pleasant and then when you add the lens to that you can bundle the light and send it wherever you need it
 without any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else  so you can preserve the darkness
 and make the light
 i just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works thank you 
 we can go further  so we have to rethink the way we light our cities we have to think
 again about light as a default solution why are all these motorways
  can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness 
 can we be much more gentle with light  like here this is a very low light level actually 
 can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create so they really want to connect with it like here  
 or can we create simply sculptures that are very inspiring to be in and to be around and can we preserve the darkness because to find a place like this today on earth is really
 very very challenging
  and to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult 
 even in the oceans we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well being 
 and it 's known that migrating birds for example get very disoriented because of these offshore platforms  and we discovered that when we make those lights green 
 the birds they actually go the right way they are not disturbed
  turns out once again that spectral sensitivity
 is very important here in all of these examples  i think we should start making the light
 out of darkness and use the darkness as a canvas
 like the visual artists do like edward hopper in this painting  i think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting
  when i see it i start to think who are those people where have they come from where are they going what just happened what will be happening in the next five minutes  
 and it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light  
 edward hopper was a real master
 in creating the narration by working with light and dark  and we can learn from that and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments
  we can do that in commercial spaces like this  and you can still also go outside and
 enjoy the greatest show in the universe  which is of course the universe itself  so
 i give you this wonderful informative image
 of the sky  ranging from the inner city  where you may see one or two stars and
  all the way to the rural environments where you can enjoy
 this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars 
 in architecture it works just the same by appreciating the darkness
 when you design the light you create much more interesting environments that truly enhance our lives  
 this is the most well known example tadao ando 's church of the light
  but i also think of
 peter zumthor 's spa in vals 
 where light and dark in very gentle combinations alter each other to define the space  or richard maccormac 's southwark tube station in london 
 where you can really see the sky even though you are under the ground  
 and finally  i want to point out that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater  and i think it 's fantastic that we are today
 experiencing tedx in a theater for the first time
  because i think we really owe to the theater a
 big thanks  it wouldn 't be such an inspiring scenography without this theater  and i think the theater is a place
 where we truly enhance life with light  thank you very much
