  to give me an idea of how many of you here may find what i 'm about to tell you of practical value  let me ask you please to raise your hands  who here is either over sixty five years old
 or hopes to live past age
  parents or grandparents who did live or have lived past sixty five raise your hands please 
 okay you are the people to whom my talk will be of practical value 
 the rest of you won 't find my talk personally relevant but i think that you will still find the subject fascinating i 'm going to talk about growing older in
  this subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book which compares traditional small tribal societies
 with our large modern societies 
 with respect to many topics such as bringing up children  growing older health  dealing with danger  settling disputes  religion and speaking more than one language
  those tribal societies which constituted all human societies for most of human history 
 are far more diverse than are our modern  recent big societies  
 all big societies that have governments and where most people are strangers to each other are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies  
 tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments in how to run a human society  they constitute experiments from which we ourselves
  may be able to learn 
 tribal societies shouldn 't be scorned as primitive and miserable  but also they shouldn 't be romanticized as happy and peaceful 
 when we learn of tribal practices some of them will horrify us but there are other tribal practices which when we hear about them  we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves
  most old people in the u s end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years  and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly  
 whereas in traditional societies  older people instead live out their lives among their children their other relatives and their lifelong friends  
 nevertheless the treatment of the elderly varies
  enormously among traditional societies  from much worse to much better than in our modern societies 
 at the worst extreme many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways 
 by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they
  or by abandoning them when the group moves or by encouraging older people to commit suicide  or by killing older people 
 in which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents 
 it happens mainly under two conditions one is in nomadic hunter gather societies that often shift camp
 and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who can 't walk
  people already have to carry their young children and all their physical possessions  
 the other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctuating environments  such as the arctic or deserts  where there are periodic 
  food shortages  and occasionally there just isn 't enough food to keep everyone alive  
 and for children 
 to us americans it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father 
  but what could those traditional societies do differently  
  their old people had to do it to their own parents  and the old people know what now is going to happen to them 
 at the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly the happy extreme 
 are the new guinea farming societies where i 've been doing my fieldwork for the past fifty years  and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world 
 in those societies older people are cared for they are fed  they remain valuable and they continue to live in the
  same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children  relatives and lifelong friends  
 there are two main sets of reasons for this variation among societies in their treatment of old people
  the variation depends especially on the usefulness of old people and on the society 's values  
  as regards usefulness 
 older people continue to perform useful services 
 one use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food 
 another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren  thereby freeing up their own adult 
  children  the parents of those grandchildren to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren  
  of older people is in making tools weapons baskets pots and textiles in fact they 're usually the people who are best at it 
 older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies  and the people most knowledgeable about politics  medicine  religion songs and dances 
  older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern literate societies 
 where our sources of information are books and the internet 
 in contrast in traditional societies without writing  older people are the repositories of information 
 it 's their knowledge that spells the difference between survival and death for their whole society
 in a time of crisis caused
  by rare events
 for which only the oldest people alive have had experience 
 those then are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies  
 their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the society 's treatment of the elderly  
 the other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the society 's cultural values
 for example there 's particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in east asia  
 associated with confucius ' doctrine of filial piety which means obedience respect and support for elderly parents
  cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the
  older americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications  
 they 're at a big disadvantage in hospitals our hospitals have an explicit policy called age based allocation of healthcare resources 
 that sinister expression means that if hospital resources are limited
  for example if only one donor heart becomes available for transplant or if a surgeon has time to operate on only a certain number of patients
 american hospitals have an explicit policy of giving preference to younger patients over older patients
 on the grounds that younger patients are considered
 more valuable to society because they have more years of life ahead of them  even though the younger patients have fewer years of valuable life experience behind them
  there are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the u s 
 one is our protestant work ethic which places high value on work  so older people who are no longer working aren 't respected 
 another reason is our american emphasis on the virtues of  self reliance and independence  
 so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer
 self reliant and independent
  still a third reason is our american cult of youth  
 which shows up even in our advertisements ads for coca cola and beer always depict smiling young people even though old as well as young people buy and drink coca cola and beer 
 just think what 's the last time you saw a coke or beer ad depicting smiling people
  never instead the only american ads featuring white haired old people are ads for retirement homes and pension planning 
 well what has changed in the status of the elderly today
 compared to their status in traditional societies  there have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse 
 big changes for the better include the fact that today we enjoy much longer
  lives much better health in our old age  and much better recreational opportunities  
 another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people  
 changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past
  that means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people and that each old person has less individual value  
 another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly is the breaking of social ties with age because older people their children and their friends  all move 
  and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives we americans move on the average every
  five years  hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth  
 yet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly is formal retirement from the workforce  
 carrying with it a loss of work friendships and a loss of the
  associated with work perhaps the biggest change for the worse
 is that our elderly are objectively less useful than in traditional societies  
 widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge  when we want some information we look it up in a book or we google it
 instead of finding some old person to ask the slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there
  as a child
 is still useful when that person is old but
 the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful sixty years later  
 and conversely we older people are not fluent in the technologies
 essential for surviving in modern society for
  i was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers
 because i had memorized the multiplication tables and i know how to use logarithms and i 'm quick at manipulating a slide rule 
 today though those skills are utterly useless because any idiot
 can now multiply eight digit numbers accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator  conversely i at age
  for everyday life my family 's first tv set in 
 had only three knobs that i quickly mastered an on off switch 
 a volume knob and a channel selector knob today just to watch a program on the tv set in my own house 
 i have to operate a 
 tv remote that utterly defeats me i have to telephone my
  25 year old sons
 and ask them to talk me through it while i try to push those wretched forty one buttons 
 what can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the u s and to make better use of their value 
 that 's a huge problem in my remaining four minutes today i can offer just a few
  one value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high quality childcare to their grandchildren  if they choose to do it as more young women enter the workforce
 and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full time caretakers of their children  
 compared to the usual alternatives of paid babysitters and day care centers
  child care 
 they 've already gained experience from raising their own children  they usually love their grandchildren  and are eager to spend time with them  
 unlike other caregivers  grandparents don 't quit their job
 because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby a second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss
  of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology 
 at the same time older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions
 that have now become rare because of rapid change but that could come back for example only americans now in
  or older today can remember
 the experience of living through a great depression 
 the experience of living through a world war  and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs 
 most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things but millions of older americans
  those terrible situations could come back  even if they don 't come back we have to be able to plan for them
 on the basis of the experience of what they were like older people have that experience younger people don 't  
 the remaining value of older people that i 'll mention involves recognizing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do there are other things that they can do better than younger people 
 a challenge for society is to make use of those
  things that older people are better at doing 
 some abilities of course decrease with age those include abilities at tasks requiring physical strength and stamina  
 ambition and the power of novel reasoning in a circumscribed situation  
 such as figuring out the structure of dna  best left to scientists under the age of thirty
  attributes that increase with age include experience  
 understanding of people and human relationships  
 ability to help other people without your own ego getting in the way  
 and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases  such as economics and comparative history  best left to scholars over the age of sixty  
 hence older people are much better than younger people at
  supervising administering advising  strategizing teaching  synthesizing and devising  long term plans 
 i 've seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their 
 who are still active as investment managers  farmers lawyers
  and doctors 
 in short many traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern big societies
  paradoxically nowadays when we have more elderly people than ever before living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before
  the lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern american society
  we can surely do better by learning from the lives of the elderly in traditional societies  but what 's true of the lives of the elderly in traditional societies
 is true of many other features of traditional societies as well of course i 'm not advocating that we all give up agriculture and metal tools and return to
  obvious respects in which our lives today are far happier than those in small traditional societies  
 to mention just a few examples our lives are longer  materially much richer  and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies  
 but there are also things to be admired about people in traditional societies  and perhaps to be learned from them
  usually socially much richer than our lives  although materially poorer their children
 are more self confident more independent  and more socially skilled than are our children  
 they think more realistically about dangers than we do  they almost never die of diabetes heart
  and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today  
 features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them 
 those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies  i hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies
 as i found it to live in those societies
