  so this is my niece her name is yahli she is nine months old 
 her mum is a doctor  and her dad is a lawyer by the time  yahli goes to college the jobs her parents do are going to
  look dramatically different 
 in two thousand and thirteen researchers at oxford university did a study on the future of work  
 they concluded that almost one in every two jobs have a high risk of being automated by machines
 machine learning is the technology that 's responsible for most of this disruption 
 it 's the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence it allows machines to learn from data and mimic some of the things that humans can do
 my company kaggle operates on the cutting edge of machine learning
 we bring together hundreds of thousands of experts to solve important problems for industry and academia 
 this gives us a unique perspective on what machines can do what they can 't do and what jobs they might automate or threaten
 machine learning started making its way into industry in the early ' 90s it started with relatively simple tasks  
 it started with things like assessing credit risk from loan applications
 by reading handwritten characters from zip codes 
 over the past few years we have made dramatic breakthroughs  
 machine learning is now capable of far far more complex tasks 
 in two thousand and twelve kaggle challenged its community to build an algorithm that could grade high school essays the winning algorithms were able to match the grades given by human teachers  
 last year we issued an even more
  difficult challenge can you take images of the eye and diagnose an eye disease called diabetic retinopathy  
 again the winning algorithms were able to match the diagnoses given by human ophthalmologists 
 now given the right data machines are going to outperform humans at tasks like this a teacher might read ten thousand essays over a
  an ophthalmologist might see fifty thousand eyes a machine can read millions of essays or see millions of eyes within minutes 
 we have no chance of competing against machines on frequent high volume tasks  
 but
 there are things we can do that machines can 't do  where machines have made very little progress is in tackling novel situations  they can 't handle
  things they haven 't seen many times before 
 the fundamental limitations of machine learning is that it needs to learn from large volumes of past data  now humans don 't 
 we have the ability to connect seemingly disparate threads to solve problems we 've never seen before  
 percy spencer was a physicist working on radar during world war ii when he noticed the magnetron was melting his chocolate bar
  he was able to connect his understanding of electromagnetic radiation with his knowledge of cooking in order to invent any guesses the microwave oven  
 now this is a particularly remarkable example of creativity but this sort of  cross pollination happens for each of us in small ways thousands of times per day 
 machines cannot compete with us when it comes to tackling novel situations and this puts a fundamental limit on the human tasks that machines will automate 
 so what does this mean for the future of work
  future state of any single job lies in the answer to a single question 
 to what extent is that job reducible to frequent high volume tasks and to what extent does it involve tackling novel situations 
 on frequent high volume tasks  machines are getting smarter and smarter  today they grade essays they diagnose certain diseases
  over coming years they 're going to conduct our audits 
 and they 're going to read boilerplate from legal contracts accountants and lawyers are still needed they 're going to be needed for complex tax structuring for pathbreaking litigation  but machines will shrink their ranks and make these jobs harder to come by 
 now  as mentioned machines are not making progress on novel situations  
 the copy behind a marketing campaign needs to grab consumers ' attention it has to stand out from the crowd business
  means finding gaps in the market things that nobody else is doing 
 it will be humans that are creating the copy behind our marketing campaigns  and it will be humans that are developing our business strategy 
 so yahli whatever you decide to do  let every day bring you a new challenge  if it does then you will stay ahead of the machines 
 thank you
