  my first day as a principal  but hardly my first day
 in the school district of philadelphia  i graduated from philadelphia public schools
  and i went on to teach special education for twenty years in a 
  school in north philadelphia  where crime is rampant
 and deep poverty is among the highest in the nation  
 shortly after i walked into my new school a huge fight
 broke out among the girls
 after things were quickly under control  i immediately called a meeting
 in the school 's auditorium to introduce myself as the school 's new principal
  the tone for my new students i started listing as forcefully as i could
 my expectations for their behavior
 and my expectations for what they would learn in school  when all of a sudden a girl way in the back of the auditorium
  do you keep calling this a school  this
 is not a school in one outburst  ashley had expressed
 what i felt and never quite was able to articulate
 about my own experience when i attended a low performing school in the same neighborhood many many many years earlier 
 that school
 was definitely not a school  fast forwarding
 a decade later to two thousand and twelve
  i was to be strawberry mansion 's fourth principal in four years it was labeled
 and persistently dangerous due to its low test scores
 and high number of weapons  drugs  assaults
  shortly as i approached the door of my new school and attempted to enter  and found the door locked with chains 
 i could hear ashley 's voice in my ears going miss  
 miss  
 this is not a school 
 the halls were dim and dark from poor lighting there were tons of piles of broken old furniture and
  desks in the classrooms and there were thousands of unused materials and resources this
 was not a school as the year progressed i noticed
 that the classrooms were nearly empty the students were just
  scared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen 
 scared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food 
 they were scared from all the fighting and all the bullying this
 was not a school 
 and then there were the teachers who were incredibly afraid for their own safety
  they had low expectations for the students
 and themselves  and they were totally unaware of their role in the destruction of the school 's culture this
 was the most troubling of all 
 you see ashley was right  and not just about her school for far too many schools for
  kids who live in poverty their schools are really not schools at all 
 but this can change let me tell you how it 's being done at strawberry mansion high school  
 anybody who 's ever worked with me will tell you
 i am known for my slogans
  i am going to use three
 that have been paramount in our quest for change 
 my first slogan is if you 're going to lead lead i
 always believed that what happens in a school and what does not happen in a school is up to the principal  
 i am the principal  and having that title
 required me to lead
  i was not going to stay in my office  
 i was not going to delegate my work  
 and i was not going to be afraid to address anything that was not good for children  whether that made me liked
 or not i am a leader  so i know i cannot do anything alone 
  leadership team who believed in the possibility of all the children and together  
 we tackled the small things like resetting every single locker combination by hand
 so that every student could have a secure locker 
 we decorated every bulletin board in that building with bright  colorful and positive messages  
 we took the chains off the front doors of the school we got the lightbulbs
  replaced  and we cleaned every classroom to its core 
 recycling every every textbook that was not needed  and discarded thousands of old materials and furniture  we used two dumpsters
 per day and of course of course  we tackled
  entire school budget
 so that we can reallocate funds to have more teachers and support staff  
 we rebuilt the entire school day schedule from scratch to add a variety of start and end times  
 remediation  
 honors courses 
  and counseling all during the school day all during the school day  
 we created a deployment plan
 that specified where every single support person and police officer would be every minute of the day  and we monitored
 at every second
  was a behavior system designed to promote positive behavior at all times the results 
 strawberry mansion was removed from the persistently dangerous list our first year
 after being
 after being on the persistently dangerous list for five consecutive years  
 leaders
 make the impossible possible that brings me to my second slogan  so what  now what
  we looked at the data  and we met with the staff there were many excuses for why strawberry mansion was low performing and persistently dangerous 
 they said  that only sixty eight percent of the kids come to school on a regular basis one hundred percent of them live in poverty 
 one percent of the parents participate many of the children come from incarceration and single parent homes
 percent of the students have special needs and the state data revealed
 that six percent of the students were proficient in algebra and ten were proficient in literature
 after they got through telling us all the stories of
  how awful the conditions and the children were i looked at them  
 and i said so what  now what what are we gonna do about 
 eliminating excuses
  every turn became my primary responsibility 
 we addressed every one of those excuses through a mandatory professional development  
 paving the way for intense focus on teaching and learning 
 after many observations what we determined
 was that teachers knew what to teach
 but they did not know how to teach so many children with so many vast abilities
  developed a lesson delivery model for instruction
 that focused on small group instruction 
 making it possible for all the students to get their individual needs met in the classroom 
 the results  
 after one year  state data revealed
 that our scores have grown by one hundred and seventy one percent in algebra
  and one hundred and seven percent in literature 
 we have a very long way to go 
 a very long way to go 
 but we now approach every obstacle with a so what now what attitude 
 and that brings me to my third and final slogan
 if nobody told you
 they loved you today  you remember i do  and i always will my students have problems 
 social emotional
 and economic problems you could never imagine  some of them are parents themselves  and some are completely alone
 if someone asked me my real secret
 for how i truly keep strawberry mansion moving forward i would have to say that i love my students
 and i believe in their possibilities unconditionally
  when i look at them  i can only see what they can become  
 and that is because
  because
 i am one of them  
 i grew up poor in north philadelphia too 
 i know what it feels like to go to a school that 's not a school  
 i know what it feels like to wonder if there 's ever going to be any way out of poverty 
  i got the ability to dream despite the poverty that surrounded me so if
 i 'm going to push my students toward their dream and their purpose in life  
 i 've got to get to know who they are 
 so i have to spend time with them
  so i manage the lunchroom every day and while i 'm there i talk to them
 about deeply personal things  
 and when it 's their birthday  i sing happy birthday even though i cannot sing at all 
 i often ask them why do you want me to sing when i cannot sing at all
 and they respond by saying because we like feeling special 
 we hold monthly town hall meetings
 to listen to their concerns to find out what is on their minds they ask us
  why can 't we just do what we want to do 
 they ask  and i answer each question honestly  
 and this exchange in listening
 helps to clear up any misconceptions every moment
  in my rules and consequences
 is their earned respect 
 i insist on it  and because of this we can accomplish things together 
  they are clear about my expectations for them  
 and i repeat those expectations every day over the p a system i remind them 
 i remind them of those core values
 of focus tradition  
 excellence  integrity and perseverance  and i remind them every day
 how education can truly
  change their lives  and i end every announcement the same if nobody told you
 they loved you today  you remember i do  and i always will ashley 's words
 of miss  miss  this is not a school is forever etched in my mind
 if we are truly going to make real progress in addressing poverty
 then we have to make sure
 that every school that serves children in poverty is a real school a school
  them with knowledge
 and mental training to navigate the world around them 
 i do not know all the answers  but what i do know
 is for those of us
 who are privileged and have the responsibility of leading a school that serves children in poverty  we must truly lead
  and when we are faced with unbelievable challenges  we must stop and ask ourselves so what  
 now what what are we going to do about it 
 and as we lead  we must never forget
 that every single one of our students is just a child often scared by
 the world tells them they should be  
 and no matter what the rest of the world tells them they should be
  we should always provide them with hope 
 our undivided attention 
 unwavering belief in their potential  
  and we must tell them often 
 if nobody told them they loved them today  remember we do  and we always will  thank you
