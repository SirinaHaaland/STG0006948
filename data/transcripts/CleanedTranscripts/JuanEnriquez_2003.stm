  i 'm supposed to scare you because it 's
 about fear right  and you should be really afraid  but not for the reasons why you think you should be you should be really afraid that
 if we stick up the first slide on this thing
 there we go that you 're missing out because if you
  spend this week thinking about iraq and thinking about bush
 and thinking about the stock market you 're going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we 've ever been on and
 this is what this adventure 's really about 
 this is crystallized dna  every life form on this planet every insect every bacteria every plant every animal 
  is coded in that stuff  and if you want to take a single crystal of dna  it looks like that and
 we 're just beginning to understand this stuff  and this is the single most exciting adventure
 that we have ever been on it 's the single greatest mapping project we 've ever been on if you think that the mapping of america 's made a difference or landing on the moon or this other
  it 's the map of ourselves and the map of every plant and every insect and every bacteria
 that really makes a difference  and it 's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution 
 laughter it turns out that
 what this stuff is and richard dawkins has written about this is this is really a river out of eden so the three point two billion base pairs inside each of your cells
 is really a history of where you 've been for the past billion years  and we could start dating things
  changing medicine and archeology  it turns out that if you take the human species about seven hundred years ago  
 white europeans diverged from black africans in a very significant way  
 white europeans were subject to the plague  and when they were subject to the plague most people didn 't survive but those who survived
  and that mutation was passed on to their kids because they 're the ones that survived so there was a great deal of population pressure  in africa because you didn 't have these cities  
 you didn 't have that ccr5 population pressure mutation we can date it to seven hundred years ago
 that is one of the reasons why aids is raging across africa as fast as it is and not as fast across europe  
 and we 're beginning to find these little things
 for malaria for sickle cell for
  cancers  and in the measure that we map ourselves this is the single greatest adventure that we 'll ever be on  and this friday  i want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine  
 and i want you to toast these two people 
 because this friday fifty years ago  
 watson and crick found the structure of dna  
 and that is almost as important a date as the
  of february when we first mapped ourselves but anyway we 'll get to that  i thought we 'd talk about the new zoo  
 so all you guys have heard about dna all the stuff that dna does but
 some of the stuff we 're discovering is kind of nifty because
 this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet 
 if you think you 're successful or cockroaches are successful it turns out that there 's ten trillion trillion pleurococcus sitting out there  
  project is so important because we 're just beginning to learn where we came from and what we are  
 and we 're finding amoebas like this this is the amoeba dubia and
 the amoeba dubia doesn 't look like much  except that each of you has about three point two billion letters which is what makes you you as far as gene code inside
  your cells 
 and this little amoeba which you know sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions 
 turns out to have six hundred and twenty billion base pairs
 of gene code inside 
 so this little thingamajig has a genome that 's two hundred times the size of yours  
 and if you 're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms  it may not turn out to be chips
  it may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba and again we 're learning from life
 and how life works this funky little thing people didn 't used to think
 that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors because it was dangerous
 and of course nothing lived there  and then finally somebody picked up a microscope and looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores 
  and sitting next to that water in the cores was this little deinococcus radiodurans doing a backstroke  
 having its chromosomes blown apart every day  six seven times restitching them  living in about two hundred times the radiation that would kill you 
 and by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse and how important and how interesting this journey into life is 
 and how many different life forms there are and how there can be different life forms living in very different places  
 maybe even outside of this planet  because if you can live in radiation that looks like this
  that brings up a whole series of interesting questions this little thingamajig we didn 't know this thingamajig existed 
 we should have known that this existed because this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye 
 so this thing is zero point seven five millimeters it lives in a deep trench off the coast of namibia  and what you 're looking at with this namibiensis
 is the biggest bacteria we 've ever seen so it 's about the size of a little
  period on a sentence  again  we didn 't know this thing was there
 three years ago we 're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo  
 this is a really odd one this is ferroplasma the reason why ferroplasma is interesting is because it
 eats iron lives inside the equivalent of battery acid
 so when you think of odd life forms when you think of what it takes to live  
 it turns out this is a very efficient life form and they call it an archaea archaea means the ancient ones 
 and the reason why they 're ancient is because this thing came up when this planet was covered by things like sulfuric acid in batteries
  and it was eating iron
 when the earth was part of a melted core so it 's not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins that you should be aware of
 and interested in on this little journey your fear should be that you are not that you 're paying attention to stuff which is temporal i mean  george bush
 he 's going to be gone alright 
 life isn 't whether the humans survive or don 't survive these things are going to be living on this
  planet or other planets  and it 's just beginning to understand this code of dna that 's really the most exciting intellectual
 adventure that we 've ever been on  
 and you can do strange things with this stuff  this is a baby gaur  conservation group gets together  tries to figure out
 how to breed an animal that 's almost extinct they can 't do it naturally so what they do with this thing is they take
 a spoon take some cells out of an adult gaur 's mouth code  
 take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow 's egg  reprogram
 cow 's egg different gene code  when you do that the cow gives birth to a gaur 
  sumatran tigers 
 and the australians bless their hearts are playing with these things now the last of these things died in september one thousand nine hundred and thirty six these are tasmanian tigers
 the last known one died at the hobart zoo  
 but it turns out that as we learn more about gene code and how to reprogram species  we may be able to close the gene gaps
 in deteriorate dna  and when we learn how to
  close the gene gaps then we can put a full string of dna together  and if we do that and insert this into a fertilized wolf 's egg  
 we may give birth to an animal that hasn 't walked the earth since one thousand nine hundred and thirty six 
 and then you can start going back further and you can start thinking about dodos  and you can think about other
  and in other places like maryland  they 're trying to figure out what the primordial ancestor is 
 because each of us contains our entire gene code of where we 've been for the past billion years  because we 've evolved from that stuff  
 you can take that tree of life and collapse it back and in the measure that you learn to reprogram maybe we 'll give birth
 to something that is very close to the first primordial ooze  and it 's all coming out of things that look like this
  are companies that didn 't exist five years ago  huge gene sequencing facilities the
 size of football fields  some are public some are private it takes about five billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time  takes about three million dollars the second time  
 we will have a 1 000 dollar genome within the next five to eight years  
 that means each of you will contain
 on a cd your entire gene code  and it will be really boring it will read
  the really neat thing about this stuff
 is that 's life and laurie 's going to talk about this one a little bit because if you happen to find this one inside your body you 're in big trouble because that 's the source code for ebola 
 that 's one of the deadliest diseases known to humans but plants work the same way and insects work the same way and this apple works the same way this apple is the same thing as this floppy disk 
 because this thing codes ones and zeros  and this thing codes a
  it sits up there absorbing energy on a tree and one fine day it has enough energy to say  execute and it goes [ thump ] right 
 and when it does that  pushes a exe what it does is it executes the first line of code which reads just like that 
  and that means make a root next line of code make a stem next line of code  tacgggg make a flower that 's white that blooms in the spring that smells like this
  in the measure that you have the code and the measure that you read it and by the way the first plant was read two years ago the
 first human was read two years ago the first insect was read two years ago the
 first thing that we ever read was in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five a little bacteria called haemophilus influenzae  
 in the measure that you have the source code as all of you know you can change the source code  and
 can reprogram life forms so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine 
 or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials which is why dupont is now growing a form of polyester that feels like silk in corn 
 this changes all rules  this is life  but we 're reprogramming it 
 this is what you look like 
 this is one of your chromosomes  and what you can do now is you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here
  and what those genes code for and what animals they code against  and then you can tie it to the literature  
 and in the measure that you can do that you can go home today 
 and get on the internet and access the world 's biggest public library which is a library of life 
 and you can do some pretty strange things because in the same way as you can reprogram this apple if you go to cliff tabin 's lab at the harvard medical school  he 's reprogramming chicken
  embryos to grow more wings 
 why would cliff be doing that he doesn 't have a restaurant the
 reason why he 's reprogramming that animal to have more wings is because when you used to play with lizards as a little child  
 and you picked up the lizard sometimes the tail fell off 
 but it regrew
  not so in human beings  you cut off an arm  you cut off a leg it doesn 't regrow  but because each of your cells contains your entire gene code  
 each cell can be reprogrammed if we don 't stop stem cell research
 and if we don 't stop genomic research to express different body functions  
 and in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings and what the program is for those cells to
  to stop undifferentiated cells which you know as cancer  
 and one of the things we 're going to learn how to do is how to reprogram cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone stomach  
 skin  pancreas  and you are likely to be wandering around and your children on regrown body parts
 in a reasonable period of
  in some places in the world where they don 't stop the research 
 how 's this stuff work  
 if each of you differs from the person next to you by one in a thousand but only three percent codes which means it 's only one in a thousand times three percent very small differences in expression and punctuation can make a significant difference take a simple declarative sentence
  men read that sentence and they look at that sentence and they read this okay 
 now women look at that sentence and they say uh uh wrong  this is the way it should be seen
  that 's what your genes are doing that 's why you differ from this person over here
 by one in a thousand  right  but you know he 's reasonably good looking but i won 't go there 
 you can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation you can look at
 this right  and they look at the world a little differently they look at the same world and they say
 that 's how the same gene code that 's why you have thirty thousand genes  mice have thirty thousand genes husbands have thirty thousand genes 
 mice and men are the same wives know that  but anyway  
 you can make very small changes in gene code and get really
  even with the same string of letters  
 that 's what your genes are doing every day  that 's why sometimes a person 's genes don 't have to change a lot to get cancer  
 these little chippies these things are the size of a credit card  they will test any one of you for sixty thousand
  that brings up questions of privacy and insurability and all kinds of stuff but it also allows us to start going after diseases because if you run
 a person who has leukemia through something like this it turns out that three diseases with completely similar clinical syndromes
 are completely different diseases because in all leukemia that set of genes over there over expresses in mll it 's the middle set of genes  and in
  it 's the bottom set of genes  and if one of those particular things is expressing in your body  then you take gleevec and you 're cured  
 if it is not expressing in your body if you don 't have one of those types a particular one of those types
 don 't take gleevec it won 't do anything for you 
 same thing with receptin if you 've got breast cancer 
 don 't have an her 2 receptor don 't take receptin  changes the nature of medicine  changes the predictions of medicine changes the way medicine works
  the greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college was this thing  
 and it turns out that this is not so important any more the u s library of congress  
 in terms of its printed volume of data contains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company every month
 on a compound basis  let me say that again a single genomics company generates more data in a month on a compound basis  than is in the printed
  collections of the library of congress  this is what 's been powering the u s economy  it 's moore 's law  so all of you know
 that the price of computers
 halves every eighteen months and the power doubles right  except that when you lay that side by side
 with the speed with which gene data 's being deposited in genbank moore 's law
 is right here  it 's the blue line
 this is on a log scale and that 's what superexponential growth means  this is going to push computers
 to have to grow faster than they 've been growing because so far there haven 't been applications that have been required
 that need to go faster than moore 's law this stuff does 
 and here 's an interesting map this is a map which was finished at the harvard business school one of the really interesting questions is if all this
  data 's free who 's using it this is the greatest public library in the world well it turns out that there 's about twenty seven trillion bits
 moving inside from the united states to the united states about four point six
 trillion is going over to those european countries about five point five 's going to japan there 's almost no communication between japan  
 and nobody else is literate in this stuff  
 it 's free  no one 's reading
 it they 're focusing on the war they 're focusing on bush they 're not interested in life  so this is what a new map of the world looks like 
 that is the genomically literate world 
 and that is a problem  in fact it 's not a genomically literate world you can break this out by states  
 and you can watch states rise and fall depending on their ability to speak a language of life and you can watch new york
 fall off a cliff and you can watch new
  jersey fall off a cliff and you can watch the rise
 of the new empires of intelligence  
 and you can break it out by counties  because it 's specific counties and if you want to get more specific it 's actually specific zip codes 
 so you want to know where life is happening  well in southern california it 's happening in ninety two thousand one hundred
  and that 's it and that 's the triangle between salk scripps ucsd and it 's called torrey pines road 
 that means you don 't need to be a big nation to be successful it means you don 't need a lot of people to be successful  
 and it means you can move most of the wealth of a country in about three or four carefully picked 747s 
 same thing in massachusetts looks more spread out but oh by the way the ones that are the same color are contiguous
  what 's the net effect of this in an agricultural society the difference between the richest and the poorest the most productive and the least productive was five to one 
 why because in agriculture if you had ten kids and you grow up a little bit earlier
 and you work a little bit harder you could produce about five times more wealth on average than your neighbor in a knowledge
  that number is now four hundred and twenty seven to one 
 it really matters if you 're literate not just in reading and writing in english and french and german  but in microsoft and linux and apple 
 and very soon it 's going to matter if you 're literate in life code 
 so if there is something you should fear it 's that you 're not keeping your eye on the ball 
 because it really matters who speaks life 
 that 's why nations rise and fall  
 and it turns out that if you went back to the
  productive nation on earth was australia  
 per person and new zealand was way up there  and then the u s came in about one thousand nine hundred and fifty and then switzerland about one thousand nine hundred and seventy three and then the u s got back on top
 beat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks
  and today of course you all know that the most productive nation on earth is luxembourg 
 producing about one third more wealth per person per year than america 
 tiny landlocked state
  no oil  no diamonds  no natural resources just smart people moving bits 
 different rules  
 here 's differential productivity rates 
 here 's how many people it takes to produce a single u s patent 
 so about three thousand americans six thousand koreans  fourteen thousand brits seven hundred and ninety thousand argentines you want to know why argentina 's crashing  
 it 's got nothing to do with inflation
  nothing to do with privatization you can take 
 ivy league economist stick him in charge of argentina  he still crashes the country because he doesn 't understand how the rules have changed oh 
 yeah and it takes about five point six million indians well watch what happens to india india and china used to be forty percent of the global economy
 just at the industrial revolution and they are now about four point eight percent
  two billion people one third of the global population producing five percent of the wealth
 because they didn 't get this change because they kept treating their people like serfs instead of like
 shareholders of a common project 
 they didn 't keep the people who were educated they didn 't foment the businesses they didn 't do the ipos  
 silicon valley did  and that 's why they say that silicon valley has been powered by
  not integrated circuits indians and chinese
