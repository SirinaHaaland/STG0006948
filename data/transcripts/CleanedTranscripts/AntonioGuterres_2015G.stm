  let 's start with a figure  during two thousand and fifteen  almost one million refugees and migrants arrived in europe from many different countries of course from syria and iraq 
  afghanistan and bangladesh and eritrea and elsewhere and there have been reactions of two different kinds welcoming parties and
 border fences  but i want to look at it a little bit from the short term and the  long term perspective and the first question is
 very simple  
 why has the movement of refugees spiked so fast in the last six months ag well 
 i think basically what triggered this huge increase was the syrian refugee group there has been an increased
  movement into europe from africa from asia  but slowly growing and all of a sudden we had this massive increase in the first months of this year  
 why i think there are three reasons two long term ones and the trigger the long term ones 
 in relation to syrians is that hope
 is
 less
  look at their own country and they don 't see much hope to go back home  because there is no political solution so there is no
 light at the end of the tunnel  second the living conditions of the syrians in the neighboring countries have been deteriorating  we just had
 research with the world bank 
 and eighty seven percent of the syrians in jordan and ninety three percent of the syrians in lebanon live below the national poverty lines
 only half of the children go to school  which means that people are living very badly not only are they refugees out of home not only have they suffered what they have suffered but they are living in 
 very very dramatic conditions  and then the trigger was when all of a sudden international aid decreased
  thirty percent food support to the syrian refugees  they 're not allowed to work 
 so they are totally dependent on international support  and they felt the world is abandoning us and that in my opinion was the trigger all of a sudden  there was a rush  and people started 
  to move in large numbers and to be absolutely honest  if i had been in the same situation
  wasn 't supposed to be sudden the war in syria has been happening for five years millions of refugees are in camps and villages and towns around syria 
 you have yourself warned about the situation and about the consequences of a breakdown of libya for example  
 and yet europe looked totally unprepared ag 
 well  unprepared because divided and when you are divided you don 't want to recognize the reality  you prefer to postpone decisions
 because you do not have the capacity to
  them  and the proof is that even when the spike occurred europe remained divided and was unable to put in place a mechanism
 to manage the situation
 you talk about one million people it looks enormous  but the population of the european union is five hundred and fifty million people which means we are talking about one per
  refugee per three lebanese  and lebanon  
 struggling of course  but it 's managing  so  the question is is this something that could have been managed if
 not mentioning the most important thing which would have been addressing the root causes  but forgetting about root causes for now looking at the phenomenon as it is
  able to come together in solidarity
 to create
 an adequate reception capacity of entry points but for that the countries at entry points need to be massively supported  and then screening the people 
  with security checks and all the other mechanisms distributing those that are coming into all european countries  according to the possibilities of each country  
 too little too late bg it 's already breaking down ag my country is supposed to receive four thousand four thousand in portugal means nothing so
 this is perfectly manageable if it is managed  but in the present circumstances the pressure is at the point of entry  and then as people move in this chaotic way through the balkans then they come to germany sweden  
  and austria they are the three countries that are in the end receiving the refugees the rest of europe is looking without doing much bg let me
 try to bring up three questions playing a bit devil 's advocate  i 'll try to ask them  make them blunt but
 i think the questions are very present in the minds of many people in europe right now the first of course is about
 numbers you say five hundred and fifty million versus one million is not much but
 realistically how many people can europe take
 because
 refugees have the right to be protected  
 and there is such a thing as international law  so there is no way you can say i take ten thousand and that 's finished 
 i remind you of one thing  in turkey at the beginning of the crisis i remember one minister saying turkey will be able to receive up to one
  thousand or something of the sort if you count all refugees 
 so i don 't think it 's fair to say how many we can take what it is fair to say is how we can we organize ourselves to assume our international responsibilities 
  and europe has not been able to do so because basically europe is divided because there is no solidarity in the european project  and
 's not only about refugees there are many other areas and let 's be honest this is the moment in which we need more europe instead of less europe  
 but as the public less and less believes in european institutions it is also each time more difficult to convince the public that we need more europe to solve these problems bg we seem to be at the point where
 the numbers turn into political shifts particularly domestically we saw it again this weekend in france but we have seen it over and over in many countries in poland and in denmark and in switzerland and elsewhere
 the the mood changes radically because of of the numbers although they are not very significant in absolute
 numbers  the prime minister of ag but if i may on these  i mean  what does a european see at home in a
  every single day a few months ago  opening the news every single day a crowd coming uncontrolled moving from border to border and the images on television were of hundreds or thousands of people moving
 and the idea is that nobody is taking care of it this is happening without any kind of management and so their idea
  they are coming to my village so there was this completely false idea that europe was being invaded and our way of life is going to change  and everything will
 and and the problem is that if this had been properly managed if people had been properly received  welcomed
  sheltered at point of entry screened at point of entry  and the moved by plane to different european countries this would not have scared people
  we have a lot of people scared just because europe was not able to do the job properly bg but there are villages in germany with
 three hundred inhabitants and one thousand refugees  so what 's your position how do you imagine these people reacting ag if there would be a proper management of the situation and the proper distribution of people all over europe 
 you would always have the percentage that i mentioned one per
  it is because things are not properly managed that in the end we have situations that are totally  impossible to
 live with and of course if you have a village
 in lebanon there are many villages that have more syrians than lebanese lebanon has been living with that i 'm not asking for the same to happen in europe for all european villages to have more refugees than
  inhabitants  what i am asking is for europe to do the job properly  and to be able to organize itself to receive people as other countries in the world
 were forced to do in the past bg so if you look at the global situation not only at europe bg yes bg 
 if you look at the global situation so not only
 at europe i know you can make a long list of countries that are not
 really stepping up but i 'm more interested in the other part is there somebody who 's doing
 well eighty six percent of the refugees in the world are in the developing world and if you look at countries like ethiopia
 ethiopia has received more than six hundred thousand refugees all the borders in ethiopia are open
  and they have as a policy
  they call the people to people policy that every refugee should be received  and they have south sudanese  they have sudanese they have somalis
 all the neighbors  they have eritreans and in general  african countries are extremely welcoming of refugees coming 
 and i would say that in the middle east
 and in in asia we have seen a tendency for borders to be open  now we see some
 problems with the syrian situation as the syrian situation evolved into also a major security crisis
  but the truth is that for a large period all borders in the middle east were open 
 the truth is that for afghans the borders of pakistan and iran were open for at the time six million afghans that came  so i would say that even today the trend in the developing world 
  has been for borders to be open  the trend in the developed world is
  opinion  a mixture of discussions between
 refugee protections on one side and security questions in my opinion misinterpreted on the other side bg we 'll come back to that too but you mentioned the cutting of funding and the vouchers
 from the world food programme that reflects the general underfunding of the organizations working on these these issues
  now that the world seems to have woken up are you getting more funding and more support or it 's still the same ag we are getting more support i would say that we are coming close to the levels of last year
  we were much worse
 during the summer  but that is clearly insufficient to address the needs of the people and address the needs of the countries that are supporting the people and here we have
  the priorities of development cooperation that is required for instance lebanon and jordan are middle income countries because they are middle income countries they cannot receive
 soft loans or grants from the world bank  now today this doesn 't make any sense  because they are providing a global public good they have millions of refugees there and to be honest  they 
  are pillars of stability in the region with all the difficulties they face and the first line of defense of our collective security
  so it doesn 't make sense that these countries are not a first priority in development cooperation policies  and they are not 
 and not only do the refugees live in very dramatic circumstances inside those countries  but the local communities themselves are suffering because salaries went down because
 there are more unemployed because prices
  if you look at today 's situation of the indicators in these countries it is clear that
  their poor
 groups of the population are living worse and worse because of the crisis they are facing bg who should be providing this support country by country international organizations the european union who should be coming up with this support
  to join all efforts it 's clear that
 bilateral cooperation is essential  it 's clear that multilateral cooperation is essential it 's clear that international financial institutions should have flexibility in order to be able to invest 
 more massively in support to these countries  we need to combine all the instruments and to understand that today in protracted situations at a certain moment that it doesn 't make sense anymore to make a distinction between humanitarian aid
  you are talking about children in school you are talking about health  you are talking about infrastructure that is overcrowded you are talking about things that require a long term perspective a 
  development perspective and not only an emergency humanitarian aid perspective bg i would like your comment on something that was in newspapers this morning
  for the republican nomination for us president donald trump  
 yesterday he said this no listen to this it 's interesting i quote 
 i am calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the us  until our country 's representatives can figure out what 's going on 
 how do you react to that ag well it 's not only donald trump
 several people around the world with political responsibility saying for instance that muslims refugees should not 
 received and the reason why they say this is because they think that by doing or saying this they are protecting the security of their countries  
 now i 've been in government  i am very keen on the need for governments to protect the security
 of their countries and their people  but
  if you say 
 like that in the us or in any european country we are going to close our doors to muslim refugees 
 what you are saying is the best possible help for the propaganda of terrorist organizations 
 because what you are saying what you are saying will
 be heard by all the muslims in your own country and it will pave the way for the
  and the mechanisms that through technology
  and all those other groups are today penetrating in our societies  and it 's just telling them you are right we are against you so
 obviously  
 this is creating in societies that are all multiethnic multi religious multicultural this is creating a situation in which really
  is much easier for the propaganda of these terrorist organizations to be effective 
 in recruiting people for terror acts within the countries where these kinds of sentences are expressed bg have the recent attacks in paris and the reactions to them made your job more difficult
  reaction in relation to these kinds of terrorist attacks is close all borders not understanding
 that the terrorist problem in europe is largely homegrown  
 we have thousands and thousands of european fighters in syria and in iraq  so this is not something that you solve by just not allowing syrians
 to come in and i must say  i am convinced
  it was on purpose because
 part of the strategies of daesh is against refugees because they see refugees as people that should be with the caliphate and are fleeing to the crusaders
  and i think that is part of daesh 's strategy to make europe react 
 closing its doors to muslim refugees and
 having an hostility towards muslims inside europe exactly to facilitate
 daesh 's work 
 and my deep belief is that it was not the refugee movement that triggered terrorism i think as i said essentially terrorism in europe is today a homegrown movement
 in relation to the global situation that we are facing and what we need is exactly to prove these groups wrong by welcoming
  integrating effectively those that are coming from that part of the world  and another thing that i believe is that to a large extent  what we are today paying for in europe
 is the failures of integration models that didn 't work in the ' 60s in the ' 70s in the ' 80s in relation to big migration flows that took place at that time and generated what is today in many of the people for instance of the second generation of communities
  situation of feeling marginalized  having no jobs  having improper education living in some of the neighborhoods that are not
 adequately provided by public infrastructure and this kind of
 uneasiness  sometimes even anger that exists in this second generation is largely due to the failure of integration policies
  the failure of what should have been a much stronger investment in creating the conditions for people to live together and respect each other for me it is clear
 but i also recognize that for that to work properly  you need a huge investment in the social cohesion of your own societies and europe to a large extent  failed in that investment 
 in the past few decades bg question you are stepping down from your job at
 the end of the year  after ten years if you look back at two thousand and five when you entered that office for the first time what do you see
 ag well look  in two thousand and five we were helping one million people go back home
 in safety and dignity  because conflicts had ended last year  we helped one hundred and twenty four thousand 
 in two thousand and five we had about
  million people displaced by conflict in the world today we have more than sixty million 
 at that time we had had  recently  some conflicts that were solved  
 now we see a multiplication of new conflicts and the old conflicts never died  afghanistan somalia democratic republic of congo  
 it is clear that the world today is much more dangerous than it was 
 it is clear that the capacity of the international community to prevent conflicts and to timely solve them is
  is  unfortunately much worse than what it was ten years ago there are no clear power relations in the world 
 no global governance mechanisms that work  which means that
 we live in a situation where impunity and unpredictability tend to prevail  and that means that more and more people suffer  namely those
  a tradition in american politics that when a president leaves the oval office for the last time
 he leaves a handwritten note on the desk for his successor that walks in a couple of hours later  if you had to write such a note to your successor filippo grandi what would you write ag well
 i don 't think i would write any message you
 know one of the terrible things when one leaves an office is to try to become the backseat driver
  new one what to do so that i will not do  if i had to say something to him
