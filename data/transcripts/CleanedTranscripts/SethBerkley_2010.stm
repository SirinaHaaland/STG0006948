  you worry about what is going to kill you 
 heart disease cancer a car accident most of us worry about things we can 't control like
  the tragic earthquake that just occurred in haiti  but what really threatens humanity 
 a few years ago professor vaclav smil tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history  
 he called these massively fatal 
 meaning that they could kill up to one hundred million people in the next fifty
  he looked at the odds of another world war of a massive volcanic eruption even of an asteroid hitting the earth  
 but he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to one hundred percent  
 and that is a severe flu pandemic  
 now  you might think of flu as just a really bad cold  but it can be a death
  thousand people in the united states die of seasonal flu in the developing world the data is much sketchier but the death toll is almost certainly higher you
 the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic 
  and eighteen a new virus appeared that killed some fifty to one hundred million people it spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms 
 are we safer today  well  we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared  but this threat could reappear at any time 
 the good news is that we 're at a moment in
  time when science technology globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility  
 the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one fifth of all deaths and countless misery on earth 
 we can do this we 're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines  and if we get these to more
  we can certainly save more lives  
 but with new or better vaccines for malaria  tb hiv pneumonia diarrhea flu  we could end suffering that has been on the earth since the beginning of time  
 so i 'm here to trumpet vaccines for you but first i have to explain why they 're important
 because vaccines the power of them is really like a whisper when they work they can make history but after a while you can barely
  hear them  
 now  some of us are old enough to have a small circular scar on our arms from an inoculation we received as children  
 but when was the last time you worried about smallpox a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us or polio how many of you remember the iron lung  
 we don 't see scenes like this anymore because of
  vaccines now
  it 's interesting because there are 30 odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now but we 're still threatened by things like hiv and flu  
 why is that well 
 here 's the dirty little secret  until recently we haven 't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked 
  we knew they worked through old fashioned trial and error  you took a pathogen you modified it you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened 
 this worked well for most pathogens somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu  but not at all for hiv for which humans have no natural immunity  
 so let 's explore how vaccines work they basically
  of weapons for your immune system
 which you can deploy when needed 
 now when you get a viral infection  what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength  and that might be too late  
 what happens is you have forces in your body pre trained to recognize and defeat specific foes
  so that 's really how vaccines work now let 's take a look at a video that we 're debuting at ted for the first time on how an effective hiv vaccine might work 
 a vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader after hiv penetrates the body 's
  it infects immune cells to replicate  
 the invader draws the attention of the immune system 's front line troops  
 dendritic cells or macrophages  capture the virus and display pieces of it 
 memory cells generated by the hiv vaccine are activated when they learn hiv is present from the  front line troops 
 these memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed
  b cells turn into plasma cells  
 which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch onto hiv to prevent it from infecting cells 
 while squadrons of killer t cells seek out and destroy cells that are already hiv infected 
 the virus is defeated  without a vaccine these responses would have taken more than a week by that time
  the battle against hiv would already have been lost seth berkley 
 really cool video isn 't it 
 the antibodies you just saw in this video  in action are the ones that make most vaccines work so the real
 question then is how do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and hiv  the principal challenge for both of these viruses is that they 're always changing  
 so let 's take a look at the flu virus in this rendering of the flu virus these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you 
 and also what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize
  the virus when these mutate they change their shape  and the antibodies don 't know what they 're looking at anymore 
 so that 's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu  it 's also why in the spring we have to make a best guess 
  at which three strains are going to prevail the next year put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall
  even worse the most common influenza influenza a also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans and they can recombine 
 in those particular animals  in addition wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of
  isolated cases with an apparent mortality rate of seventy percent  now
 luckily that particular virus although very scary at the time did not transmit from person to person very easily this year 's
 threat was actually a human  avian swine mixture that arose in mexico it was easily transmitted but
  luckily was pretty mild  
 and so in a sense our luck is holding out but you know another wild bird could fly over at anytime 
 now let 's take a look at hiv as variable as flu is hiv makes flu look like the rock of gibraltar  the virus that causes aids is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted 
 it mutates furiously
  furiously it has decoys to evade the immune system it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome  
 here 's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to hiv a much wilder target 
 in the video a moment ago you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells now
  that in a recently infected person 
 there are millions of these ships each one is just slightly different  finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder 
 now in the  twenty seven years since hiv was identified as the cause of aids  
 we 've developed more drugs to treat hiv than all other viruses put together these drugs aren 't cures but they
  represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of hiv at least for those who can access them 
 the vaccine effort though is really quite different  large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business 
  many thought that it was just impossible to make an aids vaccine but today evidence tells us otherwise 
 in september  we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in thailand for the first time  we saw an aids 
  vaccine work in humans albeit quite modestly and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago  
 but in the past few months researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of an hiv infected individual 
 now what does this mean  we saw earlier that hiv is highly variable 
 that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus if you take these and you put them in
  best of our monkey models they provide full protection from infection  
 in addition these researchers found a new site on hiv where the antibodies can grab onto 
 and what 's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates it 's like as many times as the virus changes
  its clothes it 's still wearing the same socks and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks  
 so what we 've got is a situation the thai results tell us we can make an aids vaccine and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that 
 this strategy working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate has never been done before
  and its implications extend way beyond that of just hiv  
 so think of it this way 
 we 've got these new antibodies we 've identified and we know that they latch onto many many variations of the virus  we know that they have to latch onto a specific part  so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part  present that through a vaccine
  what we hope is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies and that would create a universal hiv vaccine  
 now it sounds easier than it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site and as you can imagine these  three dimensional structures 
  are much harder to work on and if you guys have ideas to help us solve this we 'd love to hear about it 
  the research that has occurred from hiv now has really helped with innovation with other diseases so for instance a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing 
  antibodies to influenza as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus they 're currently making a cocktail an antibody cocktail that can be used to treat severe overwhelming cases of flu
  what they can do is use these tools of retro vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine now 
  is just one technique within the ambit of so called rational vaccine design let me give you another example  
 we talked about before the h and n spikes on the surface of the flu virus  
 notice these other smaller protuberances these are largely hidden from the immune system now it turns out that these spots
 also don 't change much when the virus mutates
  you can cripple these with specific antibodies you could cripple all versions of the flu  
 so far animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease  although you might get a mild case  so if this works in humans what we 're talking about is
  a universal flu vaccine one that doesn 't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death we really could think of flu
  bad cold 
 of course the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it so to do that we have to combine smart vaccine design 
 with smart production methods and of course smart delivery methods
 the u s government promised one hundred and fifty million doses of vaccine by october 15th for the flu peak 
 vaccines were promised to developing countries hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing  so what happened  
 well we first figured out how to make flu vaccines how to
  it was a slow cumbersome process that depended on
 chicken eggs 
 millions of living chicken eggs  viruses only grow in living things and so it turned out that for flu chicken eggs worked really well 
 for most strains you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg  
 luckily for us we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances so today  we get our
  flu vaccines from chicken eggs hundreds of millions of chicken eggs
 almost nothing has changed  the system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow this year 's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early
  here 's an alarming thought what if that wild bird flies by again  you could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines so 
 dan [ barber ] if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm i know where to get them  
  and we can up that to about one point two billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu  but this assumes that our factories are humming
 because in two thousand and four the u s supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant  and the process still takes more than half a year 
 so are we better prepared than we were
 with the new technologies emerging now i hope we can say definitively yes 
 imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we 're currently spending now in the united states 
 with a range of new technologies we could here 's an example 
 a company i 'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the h spike of flu that sparks the immune system
 if you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium  which creates a vigorous immune response they 've created a very powerful flu fighter 
 this vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria  e coli now as you know bacteria reproduce quickly it 's like making yogurt
 and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories in a few weeks with no
  eggs for a fraction of the cost of current methods 
 so here 's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies and aside from the radically 
  increased production and huge cost savings for example the e coli method i just talked about
 mostly left out of the current response  sees the potential of these alternate technologies and they 're leapfrogging the west
  india mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use 
 because these technologies are so efficient and relatively
  billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them now think of where this leads us 
 new infectious diseases appear or reappear
 every few years  some day perhaps soon we 'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us 
 will we be quick enough to react before millions die  luckily this year 's flu was relatively
  in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated  so if we have the political and financial foresight
 to sustain our investments we will master these and new tools of vaccinology  and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives 
 no longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year no longer does aids need to kill two million a year
  longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases or indeed anybody  
 instead of having vaclav smil 's massively fatal discontinuity of life we can ensure the continuity of life  
 what the world needs now are these new vaccines  and
  you must dream about this what is the kind of time scale on
 let 's start with hiv for a game changing vaccine that 's actually out there and usable sb 
 the game change can come at any time because the problem we have now is we 've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans we just need a better one and with these types of antibodies we know humans can make them so if we can figure out how to do that then we have the
  and what 's interesting is there already is some evidence that we 're beginning to crack that problem so the challenge is full speed ahead ca in your gut do you think it 's probably going to be at least another five years sb you know everybody says it 's ten years 
  but it 's been ten years every ten years so i hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends ca and that 's the same with universal flu vaccine the same kind of thing sb i think flu is different i think what happened with flu is we 've got a
 i just showed some of this a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now  
 they look good  the problem has been that what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that 's what we were comfortable with 
 you also can use adjuvants which are chemicals you mix that 's what europe is doing so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available but going back to what michael specter said the anti vaccine crowd didn 't really want that to happen ca and malaria 's even
  there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in phase three trials now it probably isn 't the perfect vaccine but it 's moving along ca seth most of us do work 
  where every month we produce something we get that kind of gratification  you 've been slaving away at this for more than a decade
