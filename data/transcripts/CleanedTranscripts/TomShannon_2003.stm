  a sculpture i made which is
 a way of kind of freeing a form into an object that has different degrees of freedom
  this is a bronze ball an aluminum
 arm here and then this wooden disk and the wooden disk was really
 thought about as something that you 'd want to hold on to and
 that would glide easily through your hands 
 the aluminum is because it 's very light the bronze is nice hard  durable material that could roll on the ground
 inside of the bronze ball there 's a lead weight that
 on an axle that 's
 on two bearings that pass in between  across it like this that counterbalance
 this this weight so it it allows it to
 to roll and the sphere has that balance property that it always
 it always sort of stays still and looks
  the same from every direction but
 if you put something on top of it it disbalances it and so it would tip over but in this case because
 the interior is free swinging in relation to the sphere  it can stand up on one point  and then there was a
 second level to
  which is that it
 i wanted it to convey
 some proportions that i was interested in which is the diameter of the moon and the diameter of the earth
 in proportion in proportion to each other
 i was exploring really early on wanting to make things float in the air and i thought up a
 lot of ideas  this is sculpture that i made that
 it 's magnetically levitated
 thing is is that it 's slightly dangerous normally it 's sort of cordoned off when it 's in a museum
 but it 's uh let 's see if i can manipulate it a little bit without um
 so this is just floating  floating on a permanent magnetic field  which stabilizes it
 in all directions except there is a slight tether here
 keeps it from
 going over the top of its field it 's sort of surfing
 on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave  and that 's what supports the object and keeps it stable  
 i think we could roll the tape admin  i have a sort of a collection of videos
  that i took of different installations which i could narrate this is a sculpture of the sun
 and the earth in proportion  representing that eight and a half minutes that it takes light and gravity to connect the two
 so here is the earth it 's a little less than a millimeter
 that was turned of solid bronze 
 and here is a similar sculpture that 's the sun at that end  and then in a series of fifty five balls it reduces proportionately
  ball and the spaces between them reduce proportionately  until they get down to this little earth  this is in a
 sculpture park in in taejon  
 this one is about the
 the moon and then the distance to the earth in proportion
  also this is a little stone ball  floating as you can see the little tether that it 's also magnetically levitated  
 and then this is
 the first part of this is one hundred and nine spheres  since the sun is one hundred and nine times the diameter of the earth  and so this is the size of the
  and then each of these little spheres
 is the size of the earth in proportion to the sun 
 it 's made up of sixteen concentric shells each one has ninety two spheres this is in the courtyard of a twelfth century alchemist  i was thinking that the sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist 
 so this
  on the
 subject a slice from the equator of the earth  and then the moon in the center  
 and it 's floating and this is in france
  it 's balancing on a shaft and a ball  right at the center of gravity or just slightly above the center of gravity which
 means that the
 the lower half of the object is
 just a little bit more weighty so you can see it rotating here  it weighs about a ton or over a ton it 's made of stainless steel quite thick  but it 's being balanced like that in
  it 's susceptible to motion by the air currents
  this is another species of work that i do these are these arrays these spheres are all suspended but they have magnets horizontally in them
 that make them all like compasses so all the red sides for example face one direction south and the blue side the compliment 
 faces the other way so as you turn around you 're seeing different colors
  this is based on the
  structure of a diamond it was a diamond cell structure was the point of departure and then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows
 between the atoms and so i placed one more element of each one of them these were white spheres  then i had video projectors
 that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres so they would catch
 parts of the images and
 make sort of  three dimensional color volumes as you walk through it through the object  
 this is something i did of
 a tactile communication system it was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture and then putting it into a communication
 an idea of moving a sculpture a ball  that would be directed around the room by a computer  
 this is a clock i designed it has buckminster fuller 's dymaxion map edited here it turns once per day
 in synchrony with the earth  
 and then  this is like projects that
  it 's a floating island with water  fresh water that can fly from place to place this would be grown i suppose with nanotechnology in the future
 sometime in the course of doing
 doing my work
 i sort of have a broad range of interests 
  and some of it is just the idea of creating media
 media as a sculpture
 something that would keep the sculpture fresh and
 ever changing by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of 
 and
 i had a lot of
 always interested in the concept of a crystal ball and the idea
  that you could see things inside of a crystal ball and predict the future
 or a television set where it 's sort of like a magic box where anything can appear  i
 had thought about a long time ago  in the late ' 60s when i was just starting out i was
 under the influence of thinking about buckminster fuller 's grand project for an electric globe across from the united nations and
 and other things that were
  happening the space program at that time and whole earth catalog things like that i was thinking about
 mass produced spherical television sets that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites  so
 if we could roll the next film here  this has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations but this the the current version of it is
 is a flying airship that is about thirty five meters in diameter about one hundred and ten feet
 in diameter  the whole surface of it is covered with sixty million diodes red blue and green that allow you to have
 a high resolution picture visible in daylight  i came with a plan i brought it to paul maccready
 's company aerovironment
 to do a feasibility study and they analyzed it and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it so we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen
 this is the control room inside of
 the ship the idea of this air genie is it 's something that can just transform and become anything it 's like a traveling show
 it has speakers on it and it has cameras
 over the surface
  of it  so it can see its environment and then it can mimic its environment and disappear  here the legs are retracting  the cabin
 is open or closed as you like it weighs about twenty tons  it has on board generators it can generate about a million kilowatts
  in order to be
 bright enough to be visible in daylight  the idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show it really would be dedicated to
 to the arts and to interacting 
 there would be on board a crew of artists musicians that would allow the thing to become actually kind of a conscious object that would respond to the moment and to interact as an entity that
  it 's completely silent and nonpolluting it has electric motors with a novel propulsion system  it could be interacted with large crowds in
 different ways primarily i would be interested in how it would interact with say  going to a college campus and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences  
 the world the situation of the globe  the default image on
 the object would probably be
 image  but then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues or migrations all of the things that we 're concerned with today
  could interact with that
