  i grew up in this neighborhood when i was fifteen years old i went from being what i think was a strapping young athlete 
 over four months  slowly wasting away until i was basically a famine victim
 with an unquenchable thirst
  i had basically digested away my body  and
 this all came to a head when i was on a backpacking trip my first one ever actually on old rag mountain in west virginia and
 was putting my face into puddles of water and drinking like a dog that night
 i was taken into the emergency room and diagnosed as a type one diabetic in
 and i recovered thanks to the miracles of modern medicine  insulin and other things and
 gained all my weight back and more  and
 something festered inside me after this happened 
 what i thought about was what caused the diabetes you see diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your body fights itself and at the time people thought
  that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen
 had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen and then kill the cells that make insulin and this is what i thought for a long period of time and that 's in fact what
  medicine and people have focused on quite a bit the microbes that do bad things and that 's where i need my
 so i went yesterday i apologize i skipped a few of the talks and i went over to the national academy of sciences building
  and they
 sell toys  giant microbes and
 here we go  so you you have caught  flesh eating disease if you
  i gotta get back out my baseball ability here 
 so
  unfortunately or not surprisingly  most of the microbes they sell at the national academy building are pathogens 
 everybody focuses on the things that kill us and that 's what i was focusing on 
 and
 it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes and those microbes actually
 do us good much of the time rather than killing us  
 and so we 've known about this for some period of time people have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us i know you 're not paying attention to me but 
 the microbes that cover us  and
 if you look at them in the microscope you can see that we actually have ten times as many cells of microbes on us as we have
 human cells there 's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain 
 we are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms  
 and unfortunately if you want to learn about the microorganisms just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient and so we just heard about the dna sequencing it turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes and to understand them is to look at their dna
  and that 's what i 've been doing for twenty years using dna sequencing  collecting samples from various places including the human body  
 reading the dna sequence and then using that dna sequencing to tell us about the microbes that are in a particular place  and what 's amazing when you use this technology for example looking at humans we 're not just covered in a sea of
  there are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us  
 we have millions of genes of microbes in our human microbiome covering us  and so this microbial diversity differs between 
  people  and what people have been thinking about in the last ten maybe fifteen years is maybe these microbes this microbial cloud in and on us  
 and illness differences between us  and that comes back to the diabetes story i was telling you it turns out that people now think that one of the triggers for type one diabetes is not fighting 
  a pathogen  but is in fact trying to miscommunicating with the microbes that live in and on you 
  killing the cells that make insulin in my body  
 and so what i want to tell you about for a few minutes is what people have learned using dna sequencing techniques in particular to study the microbial cloud 
 that lives in and on us  and i want to tell you a story about a personal project my first personal experience with studying the microbes on the human body actually came
  corner from here at georgetown i gave a talk and a family friend who happened to be the dean of georgetown medical school was at the talk and came up to me afterwards saying 
 they were doing a study of ileal transplants in people and they wanted to look at the microbes
 after the transplants  and so i started a collaboration with this person michael zasloff and thomas fishbein to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea
 after they were transplanted into a recipient  
 and i can tell you all the details about the microbial study that we did there but the reason i want to tell you this story is something really striking that they did at the beginning of this project  they take the donor ileum  
 which is filled with microbes from a donor and they have a recipient who might have a problem with their microbial community say crohn 's disease 
 and they sterilized the donor ileum
 cleaned out all the microbes and then put it in the recipient  they did this because this was common practice in medicine even though it was
 obvious
 that this was not a good idea  and fortunately in the course of this project the transplant surgeons and the other people decided  forget common
  we have to switch so they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial community in the ileum 
 they leave the microbes with the donor and theoretically that might help the people who are receiving this
 ileal transplant  and so people this is a study that i did now in the last few years there 's been a great expansion in using dna technology to study the microbes
  and on people there 's something called the human microbiome project that 's going on in the united states and metahit going on in europe and a lot of other projects and when people have done
 a variety of studies they have learned things
 such as when a baby is born during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the microbes from your mother there are risk factors associated with cesarean sections some of those risk factors may be due to 
  when you carve a baby out of its mother rather than being delivered through the birth canal  
 and a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system  
 helps in fighting off pathogens helps in our metabolism  and determining our metabolic rate probably determines our odor  and may even shape our behavior
 in a variety of ways and so these studies have documented or suggested out of a variety
  of important functions for the microbial community this cloud the 
 that live in and on us  and one
 area that i think is very interesting  which many of you may have now that we 've thrown microbes into the crowd is
 something that i would call germophobia so people are really into
  we have antibiotics in our kitchen counters people are washing every part of them all of the time we pump antibiotics into our food into
 our communities we take antibiotics
 excessively  and killing pathogens is a good thing if you 're sick  but we should understand that when we pump chemicals and antibiotics into our world that 
  we 're also killing the cloud of microbes that live in and on us  and excessive use of antibiotics in particular in children has been shown to be associated
  with  again risk factors for obesity for autoimmune diseases for a variety of problems that are probably due to disruption of
 the microbial community  so the microbial community can go wrong whether we want it to or not or we can kill it with antibiotics  but what can we do to
  i 'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics 
 probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore the microbial community that is in and on you and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases there 's a project going on at uc davis where people are using probiotics to try and treat 
 prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants premature infants have real problems with their microbial community 
  may be that probiotics can help prevent the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis in these premature infants
 but probiotics are sort of a very very simple solution most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat have one or two species in them  
 maybe five species in them and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species 
 so what can we do to restore our microbial community
 when we have thousands and thousands of species on us
 well one thing that animals seem to do is they eat eat poo coprophagia  and it turns out that
 many veterinarians old school veterinarians in particular have been doing something called poo tea 
 not booty  but poo tea to
  in horses and cows and things like that where you make
 tea from the poo from a healthy individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal although  unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole 
  in its side and you can put your hand into its rumen it 's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes
  top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system  so you may have heard
 in people they are now doing
 fecal transplants
  where rather than delivering a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth  they are delivering a community of probiotics a community of microbes from a healthy donor 
 through the other end
  and this has turned out to be very effective in fighting certain intransigent infectious diseases like
  difficile infections that can stay with people for years and years and years 
 transplants of the feces of the microbes from the feces from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure systemic c dif infections in some people 
 now what these
 transplants these fecal transplants or the poo tea suggest to me and
  many other people have come up with this same idea is that the microbial community in and on us  
 it 's an organ  
 we should view it as a functioning organ part of ourselves  we should treat it carefully and with respect  and we do not want to mess with it  say by 
  or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness
  without some real good justification and what the dna sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now is do detailed studies of say 
 one hundred patients who have crohn 's disease and one hundred people who don 't have crohn 's disease or one hundred people who took antibiotics when they were little and one hundred people who did not take antibiotics  
  the community of microbes and their genes and see if there are differences  and eventually we may be able to understand if they 're not just correlative differences but causative 
 studies in model systems like mouse and other animals are also helping do this but people are now using these technologies because they 've gotten very cheap 
  what i want to tell you about
 m d nothing can be wrong with my children we even went to the international society of endocrinology meeting as family in quebec  
 and i was getting up every five minutes to pee  
 and drinking everybody 's water at the table  and i think they all thought i was a druggie 
 but the reason i 'm telling you this is that the medical community my father as an example
  sometimes doesn 't see what 's right in front of their eyes the microbial cloud 
 it is right in front of us  we can 't see it most of the time  it 's invisible they 're microbes they 're tiny  
 but we can see them through their dna we can see them through the effects that they have on people  
 and what we need now is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context of everything in
  human medicine it doesn 't mean that it affects every part of us  but it might 
 what we need is a full field guide to the microbes that live in and on people so that we can understand
 what they 're doing to our lives  we are them  they are us  thank you
