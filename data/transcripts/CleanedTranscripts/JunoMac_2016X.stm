  i want to talk about sex for money  
 i 'm not like most of the people you 'll have heard speaking about prostitution before i 'm not a police officer or a social worker i 'm not an academic a journalist or a
  and as you 'll probably have picked up from maryam 's blurb  i 'm not a nun either 
 most of those people would tell you that selling sex is degrading 
 that no one would ever choose to do it that it 's dangerous women get abused and killed  in fact most of those people would say there should be a law against it 
 maybe that sounds reasonable to you 
 it sounded reasonable to me
 until the closing months of two thousand and nine when i was working
 every month my wages would just replenish my overdraft  i was exhausted and my life was going nowhere 
 like many others before me i decided sex for money was a better option 
 now don 't get me wrong i would have loved to have won the lottery instead  
 but it wasn 't going to happen anytime soon and my rent needed paying so i signed up for my first shift in a brothel 
 in the years that have passed
  i 've had a lot of time to think  
 i 've reconsidered the ideas i once had about prostitution  i 've given a lot of thought to consent and the nature of work under capitalism  
 i 've thought about gender inequality and the sexual and reproductive labor of women  
 i 've experienced exploitation and violence at work  i 've thought about what 's needed to protect other sex workers from these things  maybe you 've thought about them
 in this talk i 'll take you through the four main legal approaches applied to sex work throughout the world  
 and explain why they don 't work  why prohibiting the sex industry actually exacerbates every harm that sex workers are vulnerable to
 then i 'm going tell you about what we as sex workers actually want 
 the first approach is
  half the world including russia south africa and most of the us regulates sex work by criminalizing everyone involved  so that 's seller  buyer and third parties  
 lawmakers in these countries apparently hope that the fear of getting arrested will deter people from selling sex  
 but if you 're forced to choose between obeying the law and feeding yourself or your family you 're going to do the work anyway and take the risk 
 criminalization is a trap  it 's hard to get a conventional job
  you have a criminal record  potential employers won 't hire you  
 assuming you still need money you 'll stay in the more flexible informal economy the law forces you to keep selling sex  which is the exact opposite of its intended effect 
 being criminalized leaves you exposed to mistreatment by the state itself 
 in many places you may be coerced into paying a bribe or even into having sex with a police officer to avoid arrest
 police and prison guards in cambodia for example have been documented subjecting sex workers to what can only be described as torture  
 threats at gunpoint beatings  electric shocks rape and denial of food 
 another worrying thing  if you 're selling sex in places like kenya  south africa or new york 
 a police officer can arrest you if you 're caught carrying condoms 
 because condoms can legally be used
  as evidence that you 're selling sex  
 obviously this increases hiv risk  imagine knowing if you 're busted carrying condoms it 'll be used against you it
 's a pretty strong incentive to leave them at home right 
 sex workers working in these places are forced to make a tough choice between risking arrest or having risky sex  what would you choose
  would you pack condoms to go to work  how about if you 're worried the police officer would rape you when he got you in the van 
 the second approach to regulating sex work seen in these countries
 is partial criminalization where the buying and selling of sex are legal but surrounding activities like brothel keeping or soliciting on the street are banned 
 laws like these we have them in the uk and in france essentially say to us sex workers
  we don 't mind you selling sex  just make sure it 's done behind closed doors and all alone 
 and brothel keeping by the way is defined as just two or more sex workers working together  making that illegal means that many of us work alone  which obviously makes us vulnerable to violent offenders  
 but we 're also vulnerable if we choose to break the law by working together a
 couple of years ago a friend of mine was nervous after she was attacked at work so i said that she could see her clients from my place for a while during that time
 we had another guy turn nasty  i told the guy to leave or i 'd call the police 
 and he looked at the two of us and said you girls can 't call the cops you 're working together this place is illegal 
 he was right 
 he eventually left without getting physically violent but the knowledge that we were breaking the law empowered that man to threaten us he felt confident he 'd get away with it 
 the prohibition of street prostitution also
  causes more harm than it prevents  
 firstly to avoid getting arrested street workers take risks to avoid detection and that means working alone or in isolated locations like dark forests where they 're vulnerable to attack 
 if you 're caught selling sex outdoors  you pay a fine 
 how do you pay that fine without going back to the streets it was the need for money that saw you in the streets in the first place and so the fines stack up and you 're caught in a vicious cycle
  of selling sex to pay the fines you got for selling sex  
 let me tell you about mariana popa who worked in redbridge east london 
 the street workers on her patch would normally wait for clients in groups for safety in numbers and to warn each other about how to avoid dangerous guys  
 but during a police crackdown on sex workers and their clients she was forced to work alone to avoid being arrested 
 she was stabbed to death in the early hours
  of october  twenty nine two thousand and thirteen
 she had been working later than usual to try to pay off a fine she had received for soliciting 
 so if criminalizing sex workers hurts them why not just criminalize the people who buy sex  
 this is the aim of the third approach i want to talk about the swedish or nordic model of sex work law 
 the idea behind this law is that selling sex is intrinsically harmful and so you 're in fact helping
  sex workers by removing the option 
 despite growing support for what 's often described as the end demand approach there 's no evidence that it works there 's just as much prostitution in sweden as there was before 
 why might that be it
 's because people selling sex often don 't have other options for income  if you need that money the only effect that a drop in business is going have is to force you to lower your prices or offer more risky sexual services
  if you need to find more clients  you might seek the help of a manager  so you see rather than putting a stop to what 's often descried as pimping 
 a law like this actually gives oxygen to potentially abusive third parties 
 to keep safe in my work  i try not to take bookings from someone who calls me from a withheld number if
 it 's a home or a hotel visit  i try to get a full name and details  
 if i worked under the swedish model
  client would be too scared to give me that information i might have no other choice but to accept a booking from a man who is untraceable if he later turns out to be violent  
 if you need their money  you need to protect your clients from the police 
 if you work outdoors that means working alone or in isolated locations just as if you were criminalized yourself it might mean getting into cars quicker  
 less negotiating time means snap decisions
  is this guy dangerous or just nervous can you afford to take the risk can you afford not to 
 something i 'm often hearing is prostitution would be fine if we made it legal and regulated it 
 we call that approach legalization and it 's used by countries like the netherlands  germany and nevada in the us
  great model for human rights and in state controlled prostitution commercial sex can only happen in certain legally designated areas or venues and sex workers are made to comply with special restrictions like registration and forced health checks 
 regulation sounds great on paper  but politicians deliberately make regulation around the sex industry expensive and difficult to comply with 
 it creates a  two tiered system
  brothel owners can comply with the regulations but more marginalized people find those hoops impossible to jump through 
 and even if it 's possible in principle getting a license or proper venue takes time and costs money it 's not going to be an option for someone who 's desperate and needs money tonight they might be a refugee or fleeing domestic abuse  
  the most vulnerable people are forced to work illegally so they 're still exposed to all the dangers of criminalization i mentioned earlier so
 it 's looking like all attempts to control or prevent sex work from happening makes things more dangerous for people selling sex  
 fear of law enforcement makes them work alone in isolated locations and allows clients and even cops to get abusive in the knowledge they 'll get away with it
  fines and criminal records force people to keep selling sex  rather than enabling them to stop  
 crackdowns on buyers drive sellers to take dangerous risks and into the arms of potentially abusive managers these laws also reinforce stigma and hatred against sex workers 
 when france temporarily brought in the swedish model two years ago  ordinary citizens took it as a cue to start carrying out vigilante attacks against people working on the street 
 in sweden opinion surveys show that significantly more people want sex workers to be
  now than before the law was brought in 
 if prohibition is this harmful  you might ask why it so popular  
 firstly sex work is and always has been a survival strategy for all kinds of unpopular minority groups people of color migrants people with disabilities  lgbtq people particularly trans women 
 these are the groups most heavily profiled and punished through
  prohibitionist law i don 't think this is an accident 
 these laws have political support precisely because they target people that voters don 't want to see or know about 
 why else might people support prohibition  
 well  lots of people have understandable fears about trafficking 
 folks think that foreign women kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery can be saved by shutting a whole industry down
 so let 's talk about trafficking forced labor does occur
 in many industries  especially those where the workers are migrants or otherwise vulnerable and this needs to be addressed 
 but it 's best addressed with legislation targeting those specific abuses not an entire industry 
 when twenty three undocumented chinese migrants drowned while picking cockles in morecambe bay in two thousand and four there were no calls to
  outlaw the entire seafood industry to save trafficking victims  
 the solution is clearly to give workers more legal protections allowing them to resist abuse and report it to authorities without fear of arrest the way the term trafficking 
  is thrown around implies that all undocumented migration into prostitution is forced  
  of people smugglers many do this with the full knowledge that they 'll be selling sex when they reach their destination  
 and yes it can often be the case that these people smugglers demand exorbitant fees  coerce migrants into work they don 't want to do
 and abuse them when they 're vulnerable that 's true of prostitution  but it 's also true of agricultural work hospitality work and domestic work  
 ultimately nobody wants to be forced to do any
  of work  but that 's a risk many migrants are willing to take because of what they 're leaving behind if people were allowed to migrate legally they wouldn 't have to place their lives into the hands of people smugglers  
 the problems arise from the criminalization of migration just as they do from the criminalization of sex work itself 
 this is a lesson of history  if you try to prohibit something that people want or need to do whether that 's drinking alcohol or crossing
  borders
 or getting an abortion or selling sex  
 you create more problems than you solve prohibition barely makes a difference to the amount of people actually doing those things  
 but it makes a huge difference as to whether or not they 're safe when they do them  
 why else might people support prohibition 
 as a feminist i know that the sex industry is a site of deeply entrenched social inequality
 it 's a fact that most buyers of sex are men with money  and most sellers are women without you can agree with all that i do
 and still think prohibition is a terrible policy 
 in a better more equal world  maybe there would be far fewer people selling sex to survive  but you can 't simply legislate a better world
  if someone needs to sell sex because they 're poor or because they 're homeless or because they 're undocumented and they can 't find legal work  
 taking away that option doesn 't make them any less poor
 or house them
 or change their immigration status people worry that selling sex is degrading ask yourself is it more degrading than going hungry
 or seeing your children go hungry there 's no call to ban rich people from hiring nannies or getting manicures even though most of the people doing
  that labor are poor migrant women it 's the fact of poor migrant women selling sex specifically that has some feminists uncomfortable 
 and i can understand why the sex industry provokes strong feelings people have all kinds of complicated feelings when it comes to sex  
 but we can 't make policy on the basis of mere feelings especially not over the heads of the people actually effected by those
  policies if we get fixated on the abolition of sex work  we end up worrying more about a particular manifestation of gender inequality  rather than about the underlying causes 
 people get really hung up on the question well would you want your daughter doing it 
 that 's the wrong question  instead  imagine she is doing it how safe is she at work tonight  why isn 't she safer
 so
 we 've looked at full criminalization partial criminalization the swedish or nordic model and legalization and how they all cause harm 
 something i never hear asked
 is what do sex workers want 
 after all we 're the ones most affected by these laws new zealand decriminalized sex work in two thousand and three it 's crucial
  to remember that decriminalization and legalization are not the same thing decriminalization means the removal of laws that punitively target the sex industry instead treating sex work much like any other kind of work 
 in new zealand people can work together for safety  and employers of sex workers are accountable to the state a sex worker can refuse to see a client at any
  of street workers report that they feel the law protects their rights new zealand hasn 't actually seen an increase in the amount of people doing sex work  
 but decriminalizing it has made it a lot safer  
 but the lesson from new zealand isn 't just that its particular legislation is good  but that crucially  it was written in collaboration with sex workers namely the new zealand prostitutes ' collective 
 when it came to making sex work safer they were ready to hear it straight from sex workers themselves
 here in the uk 
  worker led groups like the sex worker open university and the english collective of prostitutes  and we form part of a global movement demanding decriminalization and 
 the universal symbol of our movement is the red umbrella we 're supported in our demands by global bodies like unaids the world health organization and amnesty international  
 but we need more allies
  if you care about gender equality or poverty or migration or public health then sex worker rights matter to you 
 make space for us in your movements that means not only listening to sex workers when we speak
 but amplifying our voices resist those who silence us those who say that a prostitute is
  either too victimized too damaged to know what 's best for herself 
 or else too privileged and too removed from real hardship not representative of the millions of voiceless victims 
 this distinction between victim and empowered
 is imaginary it exists purely to discredit sex workers and make it easy to ignore us 
 no doubt many of you work for a living  well sex work is work too just like you some of us like our jobs
  some of us hate them  ultimately most of us have mixed feelings  but how we feel about our work
 isn 't the point  and how others feel about our work certainly isn 't 
 what 's important is that we have the right to work safely and on our own terms sex workers are real people we 've had complicated experiences
  complicated responses to those experiences but our demands
 are not complicated you can ask expensive escorts in new york city brothel workers in cambodia street workers in south africa and every girl on the roster at my old job in soho and they will all tell you the same thing  
 you can speak to millions of sex workers
  we want full decriminalization and labor rights as workers i 'm just one sex worker on the stage today but i 'm bringing a message from all over the world
