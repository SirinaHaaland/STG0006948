  my dear fellow citizen  
 i write to you today to you who have lost in this era
 at this moment
 in our common life when the world is full of breaking and spite and fear  
 i address this letter
 simply to you  even though we both know there are many of you behind this
  and many of me behind this i 
 i write to you because at present 
 this quaking world we share
 scares me  
 i gather it scares you too some of what we fear  i suspect we fear
  in common but much of what we fear seems to be each other 
 you fear the world i want to live in and i fear your
 visions in turn do you know that feeling
 you get when you know it 's going to storm before it storms
 do you also feel that now fellow citizen 
 that malaise and worry that some who know feel reminds them of the
 perhaps
  because our fears of each other are not in sync in this round i sense that your
 fears of me of the world that i have insisted is right for us both
 has gathered over a generation 
 it took time for your fears to trigger my fears not least
 because at first i never thought i needed to fear you
 i heard you
 but did not listen all these years when you said that this amazing new world
 wasn 't amazing for you for many of you  across the industrialized world
  that the open liquid world i relished of people and goods and technologies flowing freely 
 going where they pleased  globally 
 was not for you  an emancipation  
 i have walked through your towns and while looking failed
  i did notice
 in stephenville  texas that the town square was dominated by one lawyer 's office after another 
 because of all the people rotating in and out of the prison  
 i did notice the barren shops in wagner south dakota 
 and the vfw
 gathering hall
 that stood in mockery
 of a community 's dream to endure  i did notice
 at the lancaster  pennsylvania wal mart that far too many people
 in their 20s and 30s looked a decade or two from death with patchy
  in their eyes  i did notice
 that the young people i encountered in paris in florence in barcelona had degrees
 but no place to take them 
 living on internships well into their 30s their lives prevented from launching
  because of an economy that creates wealth
 just not jobs  i did notice the news about those parts of london becoming
 ghost quarters where the global 
 turn fishy money into empty apartments
 and price lifelong residents of a city young couples starting out out of their
  own home  and i heard that the fabric of your life
 was tearing 
 you used to be able to count on work  and now you couldn 't 
 you used to be able to nourish your children 
 and guarantee that they would climb
 a little bit further in life than you had
  and now you couldn 't you used to be made to feel dignity in your work  and now
 you didn 't it
 used to be normal for people like you to own a home  and now it wasn 't 
 i cannot say
 i didn 't know these things but i was
  distracted creating a future in which we could live on mars  
 even as you struggled down here on earth i was distracted
 innovating immortality  
 even as many of you began to live shorter lives than your parents had
 i heard all of these things but i didn 't listen  i looked
 but didn 't see i read didn 't understand  i paid attention
 only when you began to vote and shout  
 and when your voting and shouting when the substance of it began to threaten
 me  
 i listened only when you moved toward shattering continental unions
 and electing vulgar demagogues only then did your pain become of interest
 to me 
 i know that feeling hurt is often prologue to dealing hurt
 i wonder now
 if you would be less eager to deal it
 if i had stood with you when you merely felt it  i ask myself
 why i didn 't stand with you then one reason is that i became entranced by the gurus of change
  became a worshiper of the religion of the new for novelty 's sake and of globalization and open borders and kaleidoscopic
 diversity  
 once change became my
 totalizing faith  i could be blind  i could fail to see change 's consequences
  could overlook the importance of roots traditions rituals stability and belonging 
 and the more fundamentalist i became
 in my worship of change
 and openness 
 the more i drove you towards the other polarity to cling to freeze to close
  to belong  
 i now see as i didn 't before
 that not having the right skin or right organ
 is not the only varietal of disadvantage 
 there is a subtler  quieter disadvantage in having
 those privileged traits and yet feeling history to be moving away from
 that while the past was hospitable to people like you the future will be more hospitable to others 
 that the world is growing less familiar less yours
 day by day 
 i will not concede for a moment
 that old privileges should not dwindle they cannot dwindle fast enough
 it is for you to learn to live in a new century in which there are no bonuses for showing up with the right skin and right organs 
 if and when your anger turns to hate please know that there is no space for that in our shared home
  but i will admit
  i have discounted the burden of coping with the loss of status  i have forgotten
 that what is socially necessary can also be personally gruelling 
 a similar thing happened
 with the economy
 that you and i share just as i cannot and don 't wish to turn back to the clock on equality and
  diversity  and yet must understand
 the sense of loss they can inspire  so too i refuse and could not if i wished
 turn back the clock on an ever more closely knit  interdependent world and on inventions that won 't stop being
  and yet i must understand your experience
 of these things 
 you have for years been telling me that your experience of these things is not as good as my theories forecast 
 yet before you could finish a complaining sentence
 about the difficulty of living with erratic hours
  vanishing opportunities about the pain of dropping your children off at 24 hour day care to make your 3am shift  
 i shot back at you
 before you could finish your sentence my dogma about how what you are actually experiencing was flexibility
 and freedom  
 language is one of the only things that we truly share
  and i sometimes used this joint inheritance to obfuscate and deflect
 and justify myself 
 to re brand what was good for me as something appearing good for us both when i threw around terms like the sharing
 economy
  i see now that what i was really doing at times was buying your pain
 on the cheap  sprucing it up
 and trying to sell it back to you as freedom  
 i have wanted to believe and wanted you to believe
 that the system that has been good to me that has made
  my life ever more seamless is also the best system for you  
 i have condescended to you with the idea that you are voting against your economic interests
 voting against your interests as if i know
 your
  i have a weakness
 for treating
 people 's economic interests as their only interest 
 ignoring things like belonging and pride and the desire to send a message to those who ignore you  
 so here
 we
  in a scary
 but not inexplicable moment of demagoguery  fracture xenophobia  resentment
 and fear  
 and i worry for us both if we continue down this road 
 me not listening you feeling unheard you shouting to get me to
  i worry when each of us is seduced by visions of the future that have no place for the other if this goes on if
 this goes on there may be blood 
 there are already hints of this blood in newspapers every day
  and no i do not think that i exaggerate there may be even talk of war in places that were certain
 they were done with it 
 there is always the hope
 of redemption but it will not be a cheap  shallow redemption that comes through blather about us all being in it together
  this will take more it will take accepting that we both made choices to be here 
 we create
 our others as parents as neighbors as citizens  we witness
 and sometimes ignore each other into being
 you were not born
 vengeful  i have some role
 in whatever thirst you now feel for revenge 
 and that thirst now tempts me to plot ever more elaborate escapes from our common life 
 from the schools and neighborhoods and airports and amusement parks that we used to share
  we face then a problem not of these large  impersonal forces  
 we face a problem of your and my
 relations  we chose ways of relating to each other
 that got us
  we can choose ways of relating that get us out  
 but there are things we might have to let go of fellow citizen  
 starting
 with our own
 cherished versions
 of reality  imagine if you let go of fantasies of a society purged
 of these or those people  imagine if i
  let go of my habit of saving the world
 behind your back 
 of deliberating on the future of your work 
 your food your schools in places where you couldn 't get past security  
 we can do this
 only if we first accept that we have neglected each other
 if there is hope
 to summon in this ominous hour it is this 
 we have for too long chased various shimmering dreams
 at the cost of attention to the foundational dream of each other
  the dream of tending to each other of unleashing each other 's wonders of moving through history together  
 we could dare to commit to the dream of each other
 as the thing that matters before every neon thing let us
  sincerely yours a fellow citizen
