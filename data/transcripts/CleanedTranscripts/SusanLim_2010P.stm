  so i was privileged to train in transplantation
 under two great surgical pioneers  thomas starzl who performed the world 's first successful liver transplant
  who performed the first liver transplant in the u k in the following year  i returned
 to singapore and in one thousand nine hundred and ninety performed asia 's first successful cadaveric
 liver transplant procedure  but against all odds  now when i look back the transplant was
  actually the easiest part 
 next raising the money to fund the procedure  but perhaps the most challenging part
 was to convince the regulators a matter which was debated in the parliament
 that a young female surgeon be allowed the opportunity to pioneer for her country  but twenty years on 
  asia 's longest surviving cadaveric liver transplant to date 
 applause and perhaps more important  
 i am the proud godmother to her fourteen year old son 
 but not all patients on the transplant wait list are
  the truth is there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around 
 as the demand for donor organs continues to rise in large part due to the aging population 
 the supply has remained relatively constant 
 in the united states alone one hundred thousand men women and children are on the waiting list for donor organs 
 and more than a dozen die each
  day because of a lack of donor organs  the transplant community
 has actively campaigned in organ donation and the gift of life has been extended
 from brain dead donors to living  related donors relatives who might donate an organ
  part of an organ like a split liver graft to a relative or loved one  
 but as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs the gift of life was then extended from living related donors to now living  unrelated donors  
 and this then has given rise
 to unprecedented
 and unexpected moral controversy how can one distinguish a donation that is voluntary
  and altruistic from one that is forced or coerced from for example a submissive spouse 
 a servant a slave an employee  where and how can we draw the line  
 in my part of the world too many people live below the poverty line  and in some areas
  areas  the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward
 has led to a flourishing trade in living  unrelated donors  
 shortly after i performed the first liver transplant i received my next assignment  and that was
 to go to the prisons to harvest organs from executed prisoners  i was also
  pregnant at the time  
 pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman 's life  but my joyful period
 was marred
 by solemn and morbid thoughts
 thoughts of walking through the 
  as this was the only route to take me to the makeshift operating room  and at each time  i would feel
 the chilling stares of condemned prisoners ' eyes follow me  
 and for two years  i struggled with the dilemma of waking up at four thirty am on a friday morning  driving to the
  getting down gloved and scrubbed  ready to receive
 the body of an executed prisoner  remove the organs and then transport these organs
 to the recipient hospital
 and then graft the gift of life
 to a recipient the same afternoon no doubt i was informed  the consent had been obtained
  my life the one fulfilling skill that i had was now invoking feelings of conflict
 conflict ranging from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn
 to celebratory joy at engrafting the gift of life at dusk in my team  the lives of one
  or two of my colleagues were tainted by this experience 
 some of us may have been sublimated  but really none of us remained the same 
 i was troubled
 that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial
 as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos
  and in my mind  i realized as a surgical pioneer
 that the purpose of my position of influence
 was surely to speak up for those who have no influence it made me wonder
 if there could be a better way a way to circumvent death and yet deliver the gift of life that might
  exponentially impact millions of patients worldwide 
 now just about that time  the practice of surgery evolved from big to small 
 from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures  tiny incisions  
 and in transplantation
  at the university of minnesota  i participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants  
 i witnessed the technical difficulty  and this inspired in my mind a shift
 from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells i thought to myself  why not take
 the individual cells
  out of the pancreas the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes and transplant these cells  technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting
 a whole organ  and at that time  stem cell research
 had gained momentum following the isolation of the world 's first human
 embryonic stem cells in the 
 the observation that stem cells as master cells  could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types heart cells liver cells  pancreatic islet cells captured
 the attention of the media and the imagination of the
  i too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology  
 and this inspired a shift in my mindset from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells  
 and i focused my research
 on stem cells as a possible source for cell transplants  
 today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells  embryonic stem cells have occupied center
  stage chiefly because of their pluripotency that is
 their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types  but
 the moral controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells the fact that these cells are
  old human embryos
 has encouraged research into other types of stem cells  
 now to the ridicule of my colleagues  i inspired my lab
 to focus on what i thought was the most 
  source of stem cells  adipose tissue or fat yes fat nowadays available in abundant supply
 you and i i think would be very happy
  to get rid of anyway fat derived stem cells are adult stem cells  and adult stem cells
 are found in you and me
 in our blood in our bone marrow  in our fat our skin and other organs 
 and as it turns out fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells  but adult stem cells are not
  embryonic stem cells  and here is the limitation adult stem cells are mature cells 
 and like mature human beings these cells
 are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell
  in two thousand and seven two remarkable individuals  shinya yamanaka of japan and jamie thomson of the united states made an astounding discovery  
 they discovered
 that adult cells  taken from you and me  could be reprogrammed
  and so guess what scientists around the world and in the labs
 are racing to convert aging adult cells
 aging adult cells from you and me they are racing to reprogram these
  in our lab we are focused on taking fat
 and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells
 cells that we may use to then form other more specialized cells  which one day may be used as
  if this research is successful it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice
 human embryos  
 indeed there is a lot of hype  but also hope that the promise of stem cells will one day provide cures for a whole range of conditions 
 heart disease stroke
  spinal cord injury muscular dystrophy retinal eye diseases
 are any  of these conditions
 relevant personally to you in may two thousand and six  something horrible happened to me 
 i was about to start a robotic operation  
 but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room i realized that my left visual field
 was fast collapsing into
  darkness
 earlier that week  i had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing yes i fell  
 and i started to see floaters and stars which i casually dismissed as too much  high altitude sun exposure 
 what happened to me might have been catastrophic if not for the fact
 that i was in reach of good surgical access  and i had my vision restored
 but not before a prolonged period of convalescence three months in a head down position this experience
 taught me to empathize more with my patients and especially those with retinal diseases 
 thirty seven million people worldwide
 are blind
  and one hundred and twenty seven million more suffer from impaired vision stem 
  retinal transplants  now in a research phase 
 may one day restore vision or part vision to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide  
 indeed we live in both challenging
 as well as exciting times as the world population ages
  scientists are racing to discover new ways
 to enhance the power of the body to heal itself through stem cells  it is a fact
 that when our organs or tissues are injured 
 our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation and these stem cells
 then float in the bloodstream and hone
  in to damaged organs to release growth factors
 to repair the damaged tissue 
 stem cells may be used as building blocks to repair damaged scaffolds within our body 
 or to provide new liver cells to repair damaged liver 
 as we speak there are one hundred and seventeen or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver
  diseases what lies ahead 
 heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide one point one million americans suffer heart attacks
 yearly four point eight million suffer cardiac failure stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors
  to repair damaged heart muscle
 or be differentiated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function 
 there are one hundred and seventy clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease  
 while still in a research phase 
 stem cells may one day herald
 a quantum leap in the field of cardiology stem cells provide hope for new beginnings small
  incremental steps cells rather than organs repair rather than replacement stem cell therapies
 may one day reduce the need
 for donor organs  
 powerful new technologies always present enigmas 
 as we speak the world 's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently
  underway following the usfda approval  and in the u k neural stem cells to treat stroke
 are being investigated in a phase one trial the research success that we celebrate today has been made possible
 by the curiosity and contribution and commitment of individual scientists and medical pioneers
  one has his story my story has been about my journey from organs to cells
 a journey through controversy inspired by hope
 hope that as we age you and i may one day celebrate longevity with an improved quality of life
