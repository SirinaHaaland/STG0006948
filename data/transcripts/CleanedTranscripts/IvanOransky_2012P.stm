  those of you who have seen the film moneyball or have read the book by michael lewis will be familiar with the story of billy beane  
 billy was supposed to be a tremendous ballplayer all the scouts told him so they told his parents that they predicted that he was going to be a star
  but what actually happened when he signed the contract and by the way  he didn 't want to sign that contract he wanted to go to college which is what my mother who actually does love me 
 said that i should do too and i did
 well he didn 't do very well  he struggled mightily 
 he got traded a couple of times he ended up in the minors for most of his career  and he actually ended up in management he ended up as a general manager of the oakland a 's
  for many of you in this room  ending up in management which is also what i 've done is seen as a success  i can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the bigs
 going into management ain 't no success story  it 's a failure 
 and what i want to talk to you about today and share with you is that our healthcare system our medical system is just as bad at predicting
 what happens to people in it
 patients others
 as those scouts were at predicting what would happen to billy beane  and yet every day thousands of people in this country
 are diagnosed with preconditions  we hear about pre hypertension we hear about
  pretty sure that i diagnosed myself with that in the green room  
 we also refer to subclinical conditions there 's subclinical atherosclerosis subclinical hardening of the arteries  
 obviously linked to heart attacks potentially 
 one of my favorites is called subclinical acne  
 if you look up subclinical acne  you may find a website which i did which says that this is the easiest type of acne to treat
 you
 don 't have the pustules or the redness and inflammation  maybe that 's because you don 't actually have acne  
 i have a name for all of these conditions it 's another precondition i call them preposterous
  but with a lot of these conditions that actually isn 't the case or at least it isn 't the case all the time  it 's as if there 's a rain delay every single time in many cases  
 we have  pre cancerous lesions 
 which often don 't turn into cancer  
 and yet if you take for example subclinical
  a bone thinning disease 
 the precondition  otherwise known as osteopenia  you would have to treat two hundred and seventy women for three years in order to prevent one broken bone 
 that 's an awful lot of women when you multiply by the number of women who were diagnosed with this osteopenia  
 and so is it any wonder given all of the costs and the side effects of the drugs that we 're using to treat these preconditions that every year we 're spending more than two trillion dollars on healthcare
 and yet one hundred thousand people a year and that 's a conservative estimate are dying not because of the conditions they have 
 but because of the treatments that we 're giving them and the complications of those treatments 
 we 've medicalized everything in this country 
 women in the audience i have some pretty bad news that you already know  and that 's that every aspect of your life has been medicalized  
 strike one is
  you hit puberty you now have something that happens to you once a month that has been medicalized it 's a condition  it has to be treated strike two
 is if you get pregnant
 that 's been medicalized as well  you have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy otherwise something might go wrong  strike three
 is
  we all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms
 for decades until all of a sudden we realized because a study came out a big one nih funded 
 it said actually a lot of that hormone replacement therapy may be doing more harm than good for many
 of those women just in case  i don 't want to leave the men out i
  after all
 i have really bad news for all of you in this room  and for everyone listening and watching elsewhere  you all have
 a universally fatal condition  so just take a moment it 's called pre death 
 every single one of you has it because you have the risk factor for it  which is being alive  
 but i have some good news for you because i 'm a journalist i like to end things in a happy way or
  that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk which we 'll see if that happens for everyone you will be a 
 i made up pre death if i used someone else 's pre death i apologize  i think i made it up i didn
  is what a particular cancer advocacy group would like everyone who just has a risk factor  
 but hasn 't actually had that cancer to call themselves you are a pre vivor 
 we 've had hbo here this morning i 'm wondering if mark burnett is anywhere in the audience i 'd like to suggest
 a
 reality tv show called pre vivor if you develop a disease  you 're off the island
  but the problem is we have a system
 that is completely basically promoted this we 've selected at every point in this system to do what we do  and to give everyone a precondition and then eventually a condition in some cases  
 start with the doctor patient relationship doctors  most of them 
  they are basically incentivized to do more procedures tests  prescribe medications patients come to them they want to do something we 're americans 
  we can 't just stand there we have to do something and so they want a drug  they want a treatment they want to be told this is what you have and this is how you treat it if the doctor doesn 't give you that 
  even worse if you are diagnosed with something eventually and the doctor didn 't order that test 
 you get sued  we have pharmaceutical companies that are constantly trying to expand
 the indications expand the number of people who are eligible for a given treatment because that obviously helps their bottom line we have advocacy groups like the one that 's come up with pre vivor 
 who want to make more and more people feel they are at are at risk or might have a condition  
 so that they can raise more funds and raise visibility
  et cetera  but this isn 't actually  despite what journalists typically do this isn 't actually about blaming particular players  we are all responsible  
 i 'm responsible  
 i actually root for the yankees i mean talk about rooting for the worst possible offender when it comes to doing everything you can do  thank you
  i didn 't have a course called how to think skeptically or how not to order tests  we have this system
 where that 's what you do  and it actually took being a journalist
 to understand all these incentives you know economists
  like to say there are no bad people there are just bad incentives  
 and that 's actually true  because what we 've created is a sort of field of dreams when it comes to medical technology  
 so when you put another mri in every corner you put a robot in every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery 
 well  we 've created a system where if you build it they will come  but
 you can actually perversely
  convince them
 that they have to come it
 was when i became a journalist that i really realized how i was part of this problem  and how we all are part of this problem  
 i was medicalizing every risk factor i was writing stories commissioning stories  
 every day that were trying to not necessarily make people worried although that was what often happened 
 but you know there are ways out i saw my own internist last week  and
 he said to me
  and he told me something that everyone in this audience could have told me for free  but i paid him for the privilege which is that i need to lose some weight  
 well  he 's right  i 've had honest to goodness high blood pressure for a dozen years now same
 age my father got it  and it 's a real disease it 's not pre hypertension it 's actual
  or anything like that he didn 't say  better start taking this statin you need to lower your cholesterol no he said go out and lose some weight come back and see me in a bit or just give me a call and let me know how you 're doing
