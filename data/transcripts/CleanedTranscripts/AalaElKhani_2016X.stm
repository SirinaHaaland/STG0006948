  over one point five billion people experience armed conflict 
 in response people are forced to flee their country leaving over fifteen million refugees 
 children without a doubt are the most innocent and vulnerable victims
  but not just from the obvious physical dangers  but from the often unspoken effects that wars have on their families  
 the experiences of war leave children at a real high risk for the development of emotional and behavioral problems 
 children as we can only imagine will feel worried threatened and at risk but there is good news  the quality of care that children receive in their
  families
 can have a more significant effect on their well being than from the actual experiences of war that they have been exposed to 
 so actually children can be protected
 by warm secure parenting
 during and after conflict 
 in two thousand and eleven
  i was a first year phd student in the university of manchester school of psychological sciences 
 like many of you here  i watched the crisis in syria unfold in front of me on the tv 
 my family is originally from syria and very early on i lost several family members in really horrifying ways 
 i 'd sit and i 'd gather with my family and watch the tv  we 've all seen those scenes bombs destroying
  and people screaming and running it was always the people screaming and running that really got me the most especially those terrified looking children  
 i was a mother to two young typically inquisitive children  
 they were five and six then at an age where they typically asked lots and lots of questions and expected real convincing answers 
  i began to wonder
 what it might be like to parent my children in a war zone and a refugee camp 
 would my children change 
 would my daughter 's bright happy eyes lose their shine would my son 's really relaxed and carefree nature
 become fearful and withdrawn  how would i cope  would i change 
 as psychologists and parent trainers we know that arming parents with skills
  in caring for their children can have a huge effect on their well being and
 we call this parent training
 the question i had was could parent training programs be useful for families while they were still in war zones or refugee camps 
 could we reach them with advice or training that would help them through
  i approached my phd supervisor  professor rachel calam with the idea of using my academic skills to make some change in the real world
 i wasn 't quite sure what exactly i wanted to do 
 she listened carefully and patiently  and then to my joy she said if that 's what you want to do  and it means so much to you then let 's do it 
 let 's find ways to see if parent programs can be useful for families in these contexts 
 so for the past five
  years myself and my colleagues  prof calam and dr kim cartwright have been working on ways to support families that have experienced war and displacement  
 now to know how to help families that have been through conflict support their children  the first step must obviously be to ask them what they 're struggling with  
 right i mean it seems obvious but it 's often those that are the most vulnerable that we 're trying to support
  that we actually don 't ask how many times have we just assumed we know exactly the right thing that 's going to help someone or something without actually asking them first 
 so i travelled to refugee camps in syria and in turkey  and i sat with families and i listened 
 i listened to their parenting challenges i listened to their parenting struggles and i listened to their call for help and sometimes that was
  just paused as all i could do was hold hands with them and just join them in silent crying and prayer
 they told me about their struggles  they told me about the rough  harsh refugee camp conditions
 that made it hard to focus on anything but practical chores like collecting clean water they told me how they watched their children withdraw 
  fear of loud noises fear of nightmares
 terrifying terrifying nightmares these families had been through what we had been watching on the tv  the mothers
 almost half of them were now widows of war or didn 't even know if their husbands were dead or alive
 described how they felt they were coping so badly  they watched their children change and they had no idea how to help them
 they didn 't know how to answer their children 's questions 
 what i found incredibly astonishing and so motivational was that these families were so motivated to support their children  despite all these challenges they faced they were trying to help their children  
 they were making attempts at seeking support from ngo
  from refugee camp teachers professional medics other parents 
 one mother i met had only been in a camp for four days  and had already made two attempts at seeking support for her eight year old daughter
 who was having terrifying nightmares  
 but sadly these attempts are almost always useless 
 refugee camp doctors when available are almost always too busy  or don 't have the knowledge or the time for basic parenting supports
  camp teachers and other parents are just like them
 part of a new refugee community who 's struggling with new needs 
 so then we began we began to think how could we help these families  
 the families were struggling with with things much bigger than they could cope with the syrian crisis made it clear how incredibly impossible it would be to reach families on an individual level
 how else could we help them how would we reach families at a population level and low costs
 in these terrifying terrifying times 
 after hours of speaking to ngo workers 
 one suggested a fantastic innovative idea of distributing parenting information leaflets via bread wrappers
 bread wrappers that were being delivered to
  families in a conflict zone in syria by humanitarian workers  so that 's what we did  
 the bread wrappers haven 't changed at all in their appearance  except for the addition of two pieces of paper  
 one was a parenting information leaflet that had basic advice and information that normalized to the parent
 what they might be experiencing
  child might be experiencing and information on how they could support themselves and their children  such as information like spending time talking to your child 
 showing them more affection 
 being more patient with your child talking to your children  the other piece of paper was a feedback questionnaire and of course there was a pen 
 so is this simply
 leaflet distribution  or is
  actually a possible means of delivering psychological first aid that provides warm secure loving parenting 
 we managed to distribute three thousand of these in just one week what
 was incredible was we had a sixty percent response rate  sixty percent of the three thousand families responded i don
 't know how many researchers we have here today  but that kind of response rate is fantastic 
  in manchester would be a huge achievement  let alone in a conflict zone in syria
 really highlighting how important these kinds of messages were to families
 i remember how excited and eager we were for the return of the questionnaires  
 the families had left hundreds of messages most incredibly positive and encouraging  but my favorite has got to be thank you for not forgetting about us and
  this really illustrates the potential means of the delivery of psychological first aid to families and the return of feedback too 
 just imagine replicating this using other means such as
 baby milk distribution or female hygiene kits  or even food baskets  
 but let 's bring this closer to home  because the refugee crisis is one that is having an effect on every single one of us 
 we 're bombarded with images daily of statistics
  and of photos  and that 's not surprising because by last month  over one million refugees had reached europe one million 
 refugees are joining our communities they 're becoming our neighbors their children are attending our children 's schools  
 so we 've adapted the leaflet to meet the needs of european
  in areas with a really high refugee influx 
 for example the swedish healthcare uploaded it onto their website and within the first forty five minutes  it was downloaded three hundred and forty three times
 really highlighting how important it is for volunteers  practitioners and other parents to have open access 
 psychological first aid messages 
 in two thousand and thirteen i was sitting on the cold hard floor of a refugee
  camp tent
 with mothers sitting around me as i was conducting a focus group  
 across from me stood an elderly lady with what seemed to be a 13 year old girl lying beside her with her head on the elderly lady 's knees 
 the girl stayed quiet throughout the focus group not talking at all with her knees curled up against her
  the end of the focus group and as i was thanking the mothers for their time 
 the elderly lady looked at me while pointing at the young girl and said to me can you help us with 
 not quite sure what she expected me to do  i looked at the young girl and smiled and in arabic i said salaam alaikum shu ismak 
 what 's your name 
 she looked at me really confused and unengaged but then said
  is the pet 's name
 for the arabic female name hala and is only really used to refer to really young girls at
 that point i realized that actually hala was probably much older than thirteen 
 it turns out hala was a 25 year old mother to three young children  
 hala had been a confident bright bubbly loving caring mother to her children  but the war had changed all of that 
 she had lived through
 being dropped in her town she had lived through explosions  
 when fighter jets were flying around their building dropping bombs her children would be screaming terrified from the noise  
 hala would frantically grab pillows and cover her children 's ears to block out the noise  all the while screaming herself  
 when they reached the refugee camp and she knew they were finally in some kind of safety she completely
  withdrew to acting like her old childhood self she completely rejected her family
 her children her husband  hala simply could no longer cope 
 this is a parenting struggle with a really tough ending  but sadly it 's not uncommon 
 those who experience armed conflict and displacement will face serious emotional struggles 
 and that 's something we can all
 if you have been through a devastating time in your life if you have lost someone or something you really care about 
 how would you continue to cope  
 could you still be able to care for yourself and for your family 
 given that the first years of a child 's life are crucial for healthy physical and emotional development
  and that one point five billion people are experiencing armed conflict many of whom are now joining our communities
 we cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the needs of those who are experiencing war and displacement 
 we must prioritize these families ' needs both those who are internally displaced 
  and every single one of us in whatever capacity it is that we function in our society  
 when we begin to recognize the individual faces of the conflict  
 when we begin to notice those intricate emotions on their faces we begin to see them as humans
  we begin to see the needs of these families  and these are the real human needs 
 when these family needs are prioritized interventions for children in humanitarian settings
 will prioritize and recognize the primary role of the family in supporting children  
 family mental health will be shouting loud and clear in global international agenda and children will be less likely
  to enter social service systems in resettlement countries because their families would have had support earlier on  and we will be more
 more welcoming more caring and more trusting to those who are joining our communities 
 we need to stop wars we need to build a world where children can dream of planes dropping gifts and not bombs
  bombs  
 until we stop armed conflicts raging throughout the world families will continue to be displaced  leaving children vulnerable  
 but by improving parenting and caregiver support it may be possible to weaken the links between war and psychological difficulties in children and their families
