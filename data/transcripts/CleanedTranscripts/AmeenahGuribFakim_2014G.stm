  you know it 's a big privilege for me to be working in one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world the mascarene islands in the indian ocean these islands mauritius
  unique plants found nowhere else in the world  and today i will tell you about five of them and their particular features
 and why these plants are so unique 
 take a look at this plant i call it benjoin in the local vernacular  and the botanical name is
  that the same plant has got leaves that are different shapes and sizes  
 now these plants have evolved very far away from the mainland  and within specific ecosystems 
 often these particular features have evolved as a response to the threat presented by the local
  fauna  in this case grazing tortoises 
 tortoises are known to have poor eyesight  and as such they tend to avoid the plants they don 't recognize  
 so this evolutionary foil safeguards the plant against these rather cute animals  
 and protects it and of course ensures its survival 
 now the question you
  asking yourself is why is she telling us all these stories  
 the reason for that is that we tend to overlook the diversity and the variety of the natural world 
 these particular habitats are unique and they are host to a whole lot of plants  
 we don 't realize how valuable and how precious these resources are and yet
 through our insouciance we keep on destroying them
 we 're all familiar with the macro impact of urbanization  climate change  resource exploitation  
 but when that one last plant or animal for that matter
 when that very last specimen has disappeared from the face of this earth we would have lost an entire subset of the earth
  's biology  and with it important plants with medicinal potential
 or which could have ingredients that would speak to the cosmetic nutrition  pharma and even the ethno veterinary sectors be gone forever  
 and here we have a very prime example of the iconic dodo which comes from mauritius and of course we
  know plants have a fundamental role to play well first of all they feed us
 and they also give us the oxygen we breathe  
 but plants are also the source of important  biologically active ingredients that we should be studying very carefully  
 because human societies over the millennia they have developed
  medicinal resources 
 here 's a data point 
 one point four percent of the entire land surface is home to forty percent of the species of higher plants thirty five percent of the species of vertebrates and this one point four percent represents
  biodiversity hotspots in the world  and this one point four percent of the entire land surface already provides for thirty five percent of the ecosystem services that vulnerable people depend on  
 and as you can see the island of mauritius where i work and where i live  
 belongs to one such biodiversity hotspot  and i study the unique plants on the island for
  the local people they used a decoction of the leaves against infectious diseases  
 now our work that is the scientific validation of this traditional information has shown
 that precisely
  that leaf extract shows activity  potent activity against a wide range of bacteria that could be pathogenic to humans 
 now could this plant be the answer to antibiotic resistance 
 you know antibiotic resistance is proving to be a big challenge globally  
 while we may not be sure  one thing is certain we will not want this plant to disappear
  but the harsh reality is that this particular plant is in fact considered to be vulnerable in its natural habitat  
 this brings me to another example this bush here is known as baume de l 'ile plate in the local vernacular  the botanical name is
 it 's a plant which
  which is endemic to mauritius  it used to grow on the mainland  but through the sheer pressures of urbanization has been pushed out of the mainland  
 and we 've managed to bring it back from the brink of extinction by developing in vitro plants which are now growing in the wild 
 now one thing i must point out straightaway is that
 not all plants can be developed in vitro  
  we are happy in our comfort zone these plants also need their ecosystem to be preserved 
 and they don 't react endemic plants don 't react to very harsh changes in their ecosystem  and yet we know what are the challenges that climate change for example is posing to these plants 
 now the local people again use the leaves in traditional medicine against respiratory
  our preliminary labwork on the leaf extract has shown that precisely
 these leaves contain ingredients that are very close in terms of structures chemical structures to those medicines which are sold in the chemist 's shop against asthma 
 so who knows
 what humanity will benefit from
 should this plant decide to reveal all
  i come from the developing world
 where we are forever being challenged with this issue of population explosion 
 africa is the continent which is getting younger  and whenever one talks about population explosion one talks about the issue of food security
 as being the other side of the same coin  now this plant here the baobab could be part of the
  neglected food plant it defines the landscape of west africa 
 where it is known as the tree of life  and later on i will tell you why the africans consider it to be the tree of life  
 now interestingly there are many legends which are associated with this plant 
 because of its sheer size it was meant to be lording over lesser plants 
 so god didn 't like this arrogance  uprooted it  and planted it upside down  
 hence its particular shape
 and if you look at this tree again within the african context 
 in west africa it 's known as the palaver tree 
 because it performs great social functions  
 now if you have a problem in the community  meeting under the palaver tree with the chiefs or the tribesmen would be synonymous to trying to find a solution to that
 particular problem and also to reinforce trust and respect among members of the community 
 from the scientific point of view  
 there are eight species of baobab in the world  there 's one from africa one from australia  and six are endemic to the island of madagascar  
 the one i have showed you is the one from africa
  the flower this beautiful white flower it opens at night is pollinated by bats and it gives rise to the fruit which is curiously known as the monkey apple the monkeys are not stupid animals they know what 's good for them  
 now if you open the fruit of the baobab  you 'll see a white floury pulp which is very rich in nutrients
 and has got protein  more protein than in human milk  yes you heard right
 than in human milk  
 and this is one of the reasons why the nutrition companies of this world  they are looking for this fruit to provide what we know as reinforced food 
 the seeds give an oil a very stable oil which is sought after by the cosmetic industry
 to give to produce body
  and if you look at the trunk  the trunk of course safeguards water which is often harvested by a thirsty traveler  and the leaves are used in traditional medicine against infectious disease 
 now you can see now why the africans consider it to be the tree of life  it 's a complete plant 
 and in fact the sheer size of these trees is hiding a massive potential not only for the
  and the cosmetic industry what i have showed you here is only the species from africa
 we have six species yet in madagascar  and we don 't know what is the potential of this plant  but one thing we know is that the flora is considered to be threatened with extinction 
 let me take you
 to africa again and introduce you to one of my very favorite
  now here you 'll find that even jesus has competition 
 now this plant here has developed remarkable tolerance to drought  which enables it to withstand
 up to ninety eight percent dehydration over the period of a year without damage  and yet it can regenerate itself almost
  we 're always on the lookout for the elixir of youth  we don 't want to get old and rightly so why should we  especially if you can afford it 
 and this gives you an indication of what the plant looks like
 before now if you are an inexperienced gardener  the first thing you 'll do when you visit the garden is to uproot this plant because it 's dead  
 but if you water it
  this is what you get  
 absolutely amazing  
 now if you look at our aging process the aging process is in fact the loss of water from the upper epidermis  resulting in wrinkling as we know it especially women we are so conscious of this 
 and
 this plant in fact is giving the cosmetic chemists very important ingredients that are actually
 finding ways to slow down the aging process and at the same time reinforce the cells against the onslaught of environmental toxins  
 now  these four examples i have just given you
 are just a very tiny reminder
 as to how our health and our survival are
 closely linked to the health
 and the resilience of our ecosystem and why we should be very careful about preserving biodiversity  
 every time a forest is cut down  
 every time a marsh is filled in  
 it is a potential lab that goes with it and which we will never ever recover  and i know what i 'm talking about coming
  from mauritius and missing the dodo  let me finish with just one last example
 conservation issues are normally guided towards rare endemic plants  
 but what we call exotic plants  that is the ones which grow in many different habitats across the world
  they also need to be considered you know why because the environment plays a very important role in modifying the composition of that plant 
 so let 's take a look at this plant here
 it 's a weed  we call it a weed  now  centella asiatica grows across the world in many different habitats in africa in asia
 and this plant has been instrumental
  grows across the world in africa in asia the best quality centella comes from madagascar  because
 that centella contains the three vital ingredients which are sought after by the pharma and the cosmetic companies  
 and the cosmetic companies are already using it to make regenerating cream
 now there is an ancient saying
 that for every disease known to mankind  there is a plant to cure it  
 now  you may not believe in ancient sayings you may think they 're obsolete now that our science and technology are so powerful 
 so you may look on centella as being an insignificant 
  but you know  there is no such thing as a weed  it 's a plant  it 's a living biological lab
 that may well have answers to the question that we may have but we have to ensure
 that it has the right to live  thank you
