  i worked on a film called apollo thirteen and when i worked on this film i discovered something about how our brains work and how our brains work is that when we 're sort of infused with either enthusiasm or awe 
 or fondness or whatever it changes and alters our perception of things it changes what we see it changes what we remember
 and as an experiment because i dauntingly
 create a task for myself of recreating a saturn v launch
 for this particular movie  because i i put it out there i felt a little nervous about it so i need to do an experiment and bring a
 group of people like this in a projection room and play this stock footage and when i played this stock
  simply wanted to find out
 what people remembered what was memorable about it  what should i actually try to replicate what should i try to
 emulate to some degree  so this is the footage that i was showing everybody  and what i discovered
 is because of the nature of the footage and the fact that we 're doing this film there was an emotion that was built into it and our collective memories of what this launch meant to us and all these various
  when i showed it and i asked  immediately after the screening was over what they thought of it  what was your memorable shots they changed them they were
 had camera moves on them  they had all kinds of things shots were combined  and i was just really curious  i mean what the hell were you looking at just a few minutes ago and how come
 how 'd you come up with this sort of description  and what i discovered is 
 what i should do is not actually replicate what they saw is replicate what they remembered so this is our
 of the of the launch based on basically taking notes  asking people what they thought  and then the combination of all the different shots and all the different things put together created their sort of collective consciousness of what they remembered it looked like but not what it really looked like so this is what we
 created for apollo thirteen launch
  so literally what you 're seeing now is the confluence of a bunch of different people a bunch of different memories including my own of taking a little bit of liberty
 with the subject matter i basically shot everything with short lenses which means that you 're very close to the action  but framed it very similarly to the long lens shots which gives you a sense of distance so i was basically was setting up something that would remind you of something you haven 't really quite seen before
  and then i 'm going to show you exactly what it is that you were reacting to when you were reacting to
  so now i 'm in a parking lot basically it 's a tin can and i 'm basically recreating the launch with fire extinguishers  fire
 i have wax that i threw in front of the lens to look like ice  and so basically if you believed any of the stuff that i just showed you what you were
 reacting to what you 're emoting to is something that 's a total falsehood
  and i found that really kind of fascinating 
 and in this particular case this is the climax of the movie  and you know the weight of achieving it was simply take a model throw it out of a helicopter and shoot it 
 and that 's simply what i did  that 's me shooting and i 'm a fairly mediocre operator so i got that nice sense of verisimilitude of a kind of  you know  following the rocket all the way down and giving that little sort of edge i was desperately trying to
  so then i come up to the next thing we had a nasa consultant who was actually an astronaut who was actually on some of the missions of
 apollo fifteen  and he was there to basically double check my science 
 and  i guess somebody thought they needed to do that 
 i don 't know why  but they thought they did 
 so we were he 's a hero he 's an astronaut and we 're all sort of excited and you know i gave myself the liberty of saying you know some of the shots i did
  't really suck that bad  
 and so maybe you know  we were feeling kind of a little good about it so i brought him in here and he needed to really check and see what we were doing and basically give us our a plus report card  and so i showed him some shots we were working on and
 waiting for the reaction that you hope for  which is what i got
  it 's what you dream about 
 so what i got from him is he turned to me and said 
 you would never ever design a rocket like that you would never have a rocket go up while the gantry arms are going out can you imagine the tragedy that could possibly happen with that you would
  never ever design a rocket like that 
 and he was looking at me it 's like yeah i don 't
 know if you noticed but i 'm the guy out in the parking lot recreating one of america 's finest moments with fire extinguishers 
 laughter and i 'm not going to argue with you you 're an astronaut a hero and i 'm from new jersey  so 
 i 'm just going to show you some footage i 'm just going to show you some footage and tell me what you think  and then i did kind of get the reaction i was hoping for  so i showed him this and this is actual footage that he was on this is apollo fifteen this was his mission  
 so i showed him this  
 and the reaction i got was interesting 
 so  and what happened was i mean what i sort of intuned in that is that he remembered
  it differently he remembered that was a perfectly safe sort of gantry system perfectly safe rocket launch  because he 's sitting in a rocket that has like a hundred thousand pounds of thrust built by the lowest bidder he was hoping it was going to work out okay 
 so he twisted his memory around now
  ron howard ran into buzz aldrin who was not on the movie so he had he had no idea that we were faking any of this footage and he just responded
  i saw some shots i 'd never seen before did you guys  what vault did you find that stuff in and i said well no vault buzz we
 generated all that from scratch and he said huh that 's pretty good can we use it
  if you don 't know the story  doesn 't end well 
 jim cameron actually photographed the real titanic so he basically set up or basically shattered the suspension of disbelief because what he photographed was the real thing a
 mir sub going down or actually two mir subs going down to the real wreck
  and he created this very haunting footage  it 's really beautiful and it conjures up all these various different emotions but he couldn 't photograph everything 
 and to tell the story i had to fill in the gaps which is now rather daunting because now i have to recreate back to back what really happened and i had  i 'm the only one who could really blow it at that point  
 so this is the footage he photographed  and it was
  going to just let it run so you kind of absorb this sort of thing  and i 'll describe my sort of reactions when i was looking at it for the very first time i got the feeling that 
 my brain wanted to basically see it come back to life i automatically wanted to see this this
  this magnificent ship basically in all its glory and conversely i wanted to see it
 not in all its glory basically go back to what it looks like  so i conjured up an effect that i 'm later going to show you
 what i tried to do which is kind of the heart of the movie for me 
 and so that 's why i wanted to do the movie that 's why i wanted to create the sort of things i created  and i 'll show you you know another thing that i found interesting is what we
  when you take a look at it so here 's the behind the scenes a couple of little shots here so when you saw my footage 
 you were seeing this basically a bunch of guys flipping a ship upside down  and the little mir subs are actually about the size of small footballs and shot in smoke
  jim went three miles went down and i went about three miles away from the studio and photographed this in a garage
  and so but what you 're emoting to or what you 're looking at had the same feeling the same haunting quality that
  jim 's footage had so i found it so fascinating that
 our brains sort of once you believe something 's real you transfer everything that you feel about it this quality you have  and it 's totally artificial it 's totally make believe 
 yet it 's not to you  and i found that that was a very interesting thing to explore and use  and it caused me to create the next effect that i 'll show you which is
 this sort of magic transition
  all i was really attempting to do
 is basically have the audience cue the effect so it became a seamless experience for them that i wasn 't showing you my sort of interpretation i was showing you what you wanted to see 
 and the very next shot right after this
 so you can
  if there 's two subs in the same shot i shot it because where 's the camera coming from 
 and when jim shot it it was only one sub because he was photographing from the other and i don 't remember if i did this or jim did this i 'll give it to jim because
 he could use the pat on the back 
 okay  so now the titanic transition so this is what i was referring to where i wanted to basically magically transplant from one state of the titanic to the other
  shot once 
 and what i was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you gloria stuart 
 that was the last time titanic ever saw
  what i did is basically i had another screening room experience where i was basically tracking where where i was looking or where we were looking and of course you 're looking at the two people on the on the bow of the ship  
  and then at some point i 'm changing the periphery of the shot i 'm changing it 's becoming the rusted wreck  and then i would run it every day and then i would find exactly the moment that 
 i stopped looking at them and start noticing the rest of it and the moment my eye shifted we just marked it to the frame the moment my eye shifted
  i immediately started to change them so now somehow you missed where it started and where it stopped  and so i 'll just show it one more time and
 it 's literally done by using what our brains naturally do for  us which is
 as soon as you you shift your attention something changes and then i left the little scarf going  because it really wanted to be a ghostly
  last time i ever saw daylight it was a long film to work on 
 now hugo was another interesting movie because the movie itself is about film illusions it 's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence of vision that creates a
 motion picture and one of the things i had to do is we
  sasha baron cohen is a very clever very smart guy 
 comedian wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of the buster keaton sort of slapstick things  and he wanted his his leg brace to get caught on a moving train 
 very dangerous very impossible to do and particularly on our stage because there literally is no way to actually
 move this train  because it fits so snugly into our set so let me show you the scene  and then i basically used the trick
 that was identified by sergei eisenstein which is  if you have a camera that 's moving with a moving object what is not moving appears to be moving and what is moving appears to be stopped  
 so what you 're actually seeing now is the train is not moving at all  
 and what is actually moving is the floor  
 video of what you 're looking at there which is our little test so that 's actually what you 're seeing 
 and i thought it was sort of an interesting thing because it was  part of the homage of the of the movie itself is is coming up with this sort of genius trick which i can 't take credit for i 'd love to but i can 't because it was invented like in one thousand nine hundred and ten or something like that 
 is
 i told marty and it 's kind of one of those mind things that it 's
  really hard to really get until you actually see it work and i said you
 know what i was going to do and he said so let me see if i can get this straight 
 the thing with the wheels  that doesn 't move 
 and the thing without the wheels that moves precisely 
 brings me to the next and final marty 's not going to see this is he 
 this isn 't viewed outside of
  the next illustration is something that
  there 's like all one shot theory it 's a very elegant way of telling a story especially if you 're following somebody on a journey  and that journey basically tells something about their personality in a very concise 
  way  and what we wanted to do based on the shot in goodfellas which is one of the great shots ever
  treated in a special way  he was the master of his of his universe and we wanted hugo to feel the same way so we created this shot that 's hugo music
 and we felt that if we could basically move the camera with him we would feel what it feels like to be this boy who is basically the master of his universe  and his universe
  is  you know behind the scenes in the bowels of this particular
 train station that only he can actually navigate through and do it this way  and we had to make it feel that this is his normal everyday sort of life so the idea of doing it as one shot was very important  
 and of course in shooting in 3d which is basically it 's a huge camera
 that 's hanging off of a giant
  so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task and make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got when you saw the goodfellas shot so what you 're now going to see
 is how we actually did it it 's actually five separate sets shot at five different times with two different boys the one on the left is where the shot ends and the shot on the right is where it
 takes takes over  and now we switch boys so it went from asa butterfield who 's the star of the show to
 his stand in i wouldn 't say his stunt double there 's a crazy rig that we built for this 
 and so this is and now this is
 set number three we 're into
  and then we 're going to go into basically the very last moment of the shot is is actually the steadycam shot everything else was shot on cranes and various things
  it literally was done over five different sets two different boys different times and it all had to feel like it was all one shot  and what was
 sort of great for me
 was it was probably the best reviewed shot i 've ever worked on and you know
 i was kind of proud of it when i was done  which is  you should never really be proud of stuff i guess so i
 was kind of proud of it and i went to a friend of mine and
  what do you think was the reason and he said because no one knows you had anything to do with it 
 so all i can say is  thank you and that 's my presentation for
