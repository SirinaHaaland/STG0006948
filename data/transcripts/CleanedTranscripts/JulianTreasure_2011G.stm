  we spend roughly sixty percent of our communication time listening  but we 're not very good at it  we retain just twenty five percent of what we hear now not you not this talk
  let 's define listening as making meaning from sound it 's a mental process and it 's a process of extraction 
 we use some pretty cool techniques to do this one of them is pattern recognition so in a cocktail party like this 
 if i say david  sara pay attention some of you just sat up
  we recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal  and especially our name  
 differencing is another technique we use if i left this
  pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes you would literally cease to hear it we listen to differences we discount sounds that remain the same  
 and then there is a whole range of filters these filters take us from all sound down to what we pay attention to most people are entirely unconscious 
 of these filters  but they actually create our reality in a way because they tell us what
  we 're paying attention to right now i 'll give you one example of that intention is very important in sound in listening 
 when i married my wife i promised her i would listen to her every day as if for the first time 
 now that 's something i fall short of on a daily basis 
 but it 's a great intention to have in a
  but that 's not all sound places us in space and in time 
 if you close your eyes right now in this room you 're aware of the size of the room from the reverberation and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces you 're aware of how many people are around you because of the micro noises you 're receiving  
 and sound places us in time as well because sound always has time embedded in it in fact i would suggest that our listening is the main way that we
  experience the flow of time from past to future 
 so sonority is time and meaning a great quote i said at the beginning we 're losing our listening why did i say that 
 well there are a lot of reasons for this 
 first of all we invented ways of recording first writing then audio recording and now video recording as well the premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared 
 secondly the world is now
  so noisy with this cacophony going on visually and auditorily  it 's just hard
 to listen it 's tiring to listen  
 many people take refuge in headphones  
 but they turn big public spaces like this shared soundscapes  into millions of tiny little personal
  this scenario nobody 's listening to anybody  
 we 're becoming impatient we don 't want oratory anymore we want sound bites and the art of conversation is being replaced
 dangerously i think by personal broadcasting i don 't know how much listening there is in this conversation which is sadly very common especially in the uk  
 we 're becoming desensitized our media have to scream at us with these kinds of headlines in order to get our attention
 and that means it 's harder for us to pay attention to the quiet the subtle the understated 
 this is a serious problem that we 're losing our listening this is not trivial 
 because listening is our access to understanding conscious listening always creates understanding and only without conscious listening
 can these things happen a world where we
 't listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed 
 so i 'd like to share with you five simple exercises tools you can take away with you to improve your own conscious listening would you like that audience yes 
 good the first one is silence 
 just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate so that
  you can hear the quiet again if you can 't get absolute silence go for quiet that 's absolutely fine 
 second i call this the mixer so even if you 're in a noisy environment like this and we all spend a lot of
 listen in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can i hear how many individual channels in that mix am i listening to you can do it in a beautiful place as well like
  lake how many birds am i hearing where are they where are those ripples  it 's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening  
 third  this exercise i call savoring and this is a beautiful exercise it 's about enjoying mundane sounds this for example 
 is my tumble dryer it 's a waltz
 one
  or just try this one on for size 
 wow  
 so mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention i call that the hidden choir it 's around us all the time 
 the next exercise is probably the most important of all of these if you just take one thing
  away this is listening positions the idea that you can move your listening position
 to what 's appropriate to what you 're listening to 
 this is playing with those filters remember i gave you those filters it 's starting to play with them as levers to get conscious about them and to move to different places these are just some of the listening positions or scales of listening positions that you can use there are many 
 have fun with that it 's very exciting
 an acronym you can use this in listening in communication if you 're in any one of those roles and i think that probably is everybody who 's listening to this talk
 the acronym is rasa which is the sanskrit word for juice or essence and rasa stands for receive 
  is very important in communication and ask ask questions afterwards 
 now sound is my passion it 's my life i wrote a whole book about it so i live to listen that 's too much to ask for most people 
 but i believe that every human being needs to listen consciously
 in order to live fully
 connected in space and in time to the physical world around us connected
  in understanding to each other not to mention spiritually connected because every spiritual path i know of has listening and contemplation
 at its heart 
 that 's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill 
 why is it not taught it 's crazy  and if we can teach listening in our schools
  we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous scary world that i talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time or at least capable of doing it  
 now i don 't know how to do that 
 but this is ted
  and i think the ted community is capable of anything  so i invite you to connect with me connect with each other take this mission out and let 's get listening taught in schools 
 and transform the world in one generation to a conscious listening world a world of connection
