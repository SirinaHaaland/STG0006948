  an image is worth more than a thousand words  so i 'm going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few images that i recently captured
  by now my talk is already six thousand words long and i feel like i should stop here at
 the same time i probably owe you some explanation about the
  images that you just saw 
 what i am trying to do as a photographer as an artist is to bring the world of art and science together  
 whether it is an image of a soap bubble captured at the very moment where it 's bursting as you can see in this image  
 whether it 's a universe made of tiny little beads of oil paint 
 strange liquids that
  behave in very peculiar ways  or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces 
 i 'm always trying to link those two fields together  what i find very intriguing about those two
 is that they both look at the same thing  they are a response to their surroundings  and
  do it in a very different way  
 if you look at science on one hand 
 science is a very rational approach to its surroundings  whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings 
 what i am trying to do is i 'm trying to bring those two views into one
 so that my images both speak to the viewer 's heart but also to the viewer 's brain  let me demonstrate
  this based on three projects 
 the first one has to do with making sound visible  now as you may know sound travels in waves  so if you have a speaker a
 speaker actually does nothing else than taking the audio signal transform it into
  which is then transported through the air is captured by our ear  and transformed into an audio signal again
 now i was thinking how can i make those sound waves visible
  so i came up with the following setup i took a speaker  
 i placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker  and then i added tiny little crystals
 on top of that speaker  and now if i would play a
  sound through that speaker  it would cause the crystals to move up and down  now this happens very fast in the blink of an eye 
 so together with lg we captured this motion with a camera that is able to capture more than three thousand frames per second  
 let me show you
 what this looks like
 i agree it looks pretty amazing  
 but i have to tell you a funny story 
 i got an indoor sunburn doing this while shooting in los angeles  
 now in los angeles you could get a decent sunburn just on any of the beaches  but i got mine indoors  
 and what happened is that if you 're shooting at three thousand frames per second you need to have a silly amount of light lots of lights
  we had this speaker set up and we had the camera facing it and lots of lights pointing at the speaker  and i would set up the speaker put the tiny little crystals 
  on top of that speaker  and we we would do this over and over again  and it was until midday that i realized that i had a completely red face because of the lights pointing at the speaker what
  of my face was completely red and i looked like the phantom of the opera for the rest of the
 week  
 let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances 
 has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid ah some of you have excellent  should i skip that part
  ferrofluid has a very strange behavior it 's a liquid that is completely black it 's got an oily consistency  
 and it 's got tiny little particles of metal in it which makes it magnetic  
 so if i now put this liquid into a magnetic field it would change its appearance
  now i 've got a live demonstration over here
 to show this to you
 so i 've got a camera pointing down at this plate and underneath that plate  there is a magnet  
 now i 'm going to add some of that ferrofluid
 to that magnet let
  slightly move it to the right
 and maybe focus it a little bit more
 excellent  
 so what you can see now is that the ferrofluid has formed spikes this is due to the attraction and the repulsion of the individual particles
  now this looks already quite interesting but let me now add some watercolors to it 
 those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with you wouldn 't paint with syringes but
 it works just the same
  so what happened now is 
 when the watercolor was flowing into the structure the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid that 's because the ferrofluid itself
 is hydrophobic that means it doesn 't mix with the water  and at the same time it tries to maintain its position above the
  structures of channels and tiny little ponds of colorful water paint  so that was the second project  let me now turn to the last project which involves
 the national beverage of scotland 
 this image  and also this one were made using whiskey
 now you might ask yourself  how did he do that did he drink half a bottle of whiskey and then
 draw the hallucination he got from
 being drunk onto paper 
 i can assure you i was fully conscious while i was taking those pictures 
 now whiskey contains forty percent of alcohol  and alcohol has got some very interesting properties
  maybe you have experienced some of those properties before  but i am talking about the physical properties not
 the other ones  so when i open the bottle 
 the alcohol molecules would spread in the air and that 's because alcohol is a very volatile substance  
 and at the same time alcohol is highly flammable  
 and it was with those two properties
 that i was able to create
 the images that you 're seeing right now 
 let me demonstrate this over here
  and what i have here is an an empty glass vessel it 's got nothing in it  and now i 'm
  now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle  and now let 's set that on fire
  goes really fast and it 's not that
 impressive i could do it again to show it one more time  but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey and that i should rather drink it
 but let me show you a slow motion in a completely darkened room of what
 i just showed you in this live
  so what happened is that the
 flame traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom  burning the mix of the air molecules and the alcohol  
 so the images that you saw at the beginning  they are actually a flame
 stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle
  and you have to imagine it was flipped around one hundred and eighty degrees  so that 's how those images
 were made thank you 
 so 
 i have now showed you three projects  and you might ask yourself  what is it good for what 's the idea behind it is it just a waste of whiskey is it just some strange
  materials 
 those three projects  they 're based on very simple scientific phenomena such as magnetism the sound waves  
 or over here the physical properties of a substance
 and what i 'm trying to do is i 'm trying to use these phenomena and show them in a poetic and unseen way  
 and therefore invite the viewer to pause for a
  moment and think about all the beauty that is constantly surrounding us  
 thank you very much
