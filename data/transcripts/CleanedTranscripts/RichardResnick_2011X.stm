  i present to you the human genome 
 chromosome one top left  bottom right are the sex chromosomes  
 women have two copies of that big x chromosome men have the x and of course that small copy of the
 sorry boys but it 's just a tiny little thing that makes you different  so if you zoom in on this genome  then
 what you see of course is this double helix structure the code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters or we call them bases a c g and t how many are there in the human genome three billion is that a big number  
  everybody can throw around big numbers but in fact if i were to place one base on each pixel of this 
  screen 
 we would need three thousand screens to take a look at the genome so it 's really quite big and perhaps because of its size 
 a group of people all by the way with y chromosomes decided they would want to sequence it 
 and so fifteen years actually and about four billion dollars later the genome was sequenced and published in two thousand and three the final version was published and they keep working on
  was all done on a machine like this it costs about a dollar for each base a very slow way of doing it well folks i 'm here to tell you
 that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it 
 so now what we do is take a genome we make maybe fifty copies of it we cut all those copies up into little 50 base reads and then we sequence them massively parallel
  then we bring that into software and reassemble it and tell you what the story is so to give you a picture of what this looks like the human genome project three gigabases right 
 one run on one of these modern machines two hundred gigabases
 in a week and that two hundred is going to change to six hundred this summer and there 's no sign of this pace slowing  
 the price of a base to sequence a base has fallen one hundred million times that 's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in
  waiting until two thousand and eleven and now you can drive to jupiter and back twice 
 world population  
 pc placements the archive of all of medical literature  moore 's law  
 the old way of sequencing and here 's all the
  this is a long scale you don 't typically see lines that go up like that  
 so the worldwide capacity to sequence human genomes is something like fifty thousand to one hundred thousand human genomes this year  we know this based on the machines that are being placed this is expected to double triple or maybe quadruple year over year for the foreseeable future 
 in fact there 's one lab in particular that represents twenty percent of all that capacity it 's called the beijing genomics institute 
 the chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new moon
 by the way what does this mean for medicine so a woman  age 
 presents with stage two estrogen receptor positive breast cancer  she is treated with surgery chemotherapy and radiation she goes home 
 two years later she comes back with stage 3c ovarian cancer unfortunately treated again with surgery and chemotherapy
  comes back three years later at age forty two with more ovarian cancer more chemotherapy six months later  
 she comes back with acute myeloid leukemia  
 she goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later  so first the way in which this woman was treated in as little as ten years will look like bloodletting  
 and it 's because of people like my colleague rick wilson at the genome institute at washington
  who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem and he took skin cells healthy skin
 and cancerous bone marrow and sequenced the whole genomes of both of them
  in a couple of weeks no big deal  then he compared those two genomes in software and what he found  among other things was a deletion a 
  deletion across three billion bases in a particular gene called 
 if you have this deleterious mutation in this
  ninety percent likely to get cancer in your life so unfortunately this doesn 't help this woman  but it does have severe profound if you will
 implications to her family 
 i mean if they have the same mutation and they get this genetic test and they understand it then they can get regular screens and can catch cancer early and potentially live a significantly longer life 
 let me introduce you to the beery twins diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two their mom is a very brave woman who didn 't believe it the symptoms weren 't matching up and through some heroic efforts and a lot of
  internet searching she was able to convince the medical community that in fact they had something else they had 
  dystonia  and so they were given l dopa 
 and their symptoms did improve but they weren 't totally asymptomatic significant problems remained turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named joe beery who was lucky enough to be the
  a company called life technologies they 're one of two companies that makes these massive whole genome sequencing tools and so 
  he got his kids sequenced what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called spr which is responsible for producing serotonin among other things 
 so on top of l dopa they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug and they 're effectively normal now  guys this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing at the time this was a few years ago it cost $ one hundred thousand today it 's $ ten thousand next year
  year after $ one hundred give or take a year that 's how fast this is moving  so here 's little nick
 likes batman and squirt guns and it
 turns out nick shows up at the children 's hospital with this distended belly like a famine victim and it 's not that he 's not eating 
 it 's that when he eats his intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut  
 so a hundred surgeries later he looks at his mom and says
  me i 'm in so much pain 
 his pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics and he has no idea what 's going on but he says let 's get this kid 's genome sequenced and what they find is a single point mutation in a gene responsible 
  for controlling programmed cell death  so the theory is that he 's having some immunological reaction to what 's going on to the food essentially  and that 's a natural reaction which causes some programmed cell death but the gene that regulates that down is
 and so this informs among other things of course a treatment for bone marrow transplant which he undertakes and after nine months of grueling recovery he 's now eating steak with a1 sauce 
 the prospect of using the genome as a universal diagnostic is upon us today 
 today it 's here  and what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra five ten twenty years just because
  of this one thing which is a fantastic story 
 unless you think about humanity 's footprint on the planet and our ability to keep up food production  so it turns out
 that the very same technology is also being used
 to grow new lines of corn  wheat soybean and other crops that are highly tolerant of drought of flood of pests
  as long as we continue to increase the population we 'll have to continue to grow and eat genetically modified foods  and that 's the only position i 'll take today  unless there 's anybody in the audience who 'd like to volunteer to stop eating
  none not one this is a typewriter 
 a staple of every desktop for decades and in fact the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing  
 and then more general versions of word processors came about but ultimately it was a disruption
  on top of a disruption it was bob metcalfe inventing the ethernet and the connection of all these computers that fundamentally changed everything suddenly we had netscape we had yahoo 
 and we had indeed the entire dot com bubble 
 not to worry though that was quickly rescued by the ipod 
  this is where we are today this is the genomic revolution today this is where we are what i 'd like you to consider is what does it mean when these dots don 't represent the individual bases of your genome but they connect to genomes all across the planet
 i just recently had to buy life insurance and i was required to answer a i have never had a genetic test b i 've had one here you go or c i 've had one and i 'm not telling  
 thankfully i was able to answer
  and i say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening  
 but what would have happened if i had said c  
 consumer applications for genomics will flourish do you want to see if you 're genetically compatible with your girlfriend  dna sequencing on your iphone there 's an app for that 
 personalized genomic massage anyone
  who 's here today with your significant other just turn over to them swab their mouth send it to the lab and you 'll know for sure 
 do you really want to elect a president whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy think of it it 's two thousand and sixteen and the leading candidate releases not only her four
  also her personal genome  and it looks really good then she challenges all her competitors to do the same do you think that 's not going to happen do
 you think it would have helped john mccain 
 how many people in the audience have the last name resnick like me raise your hand anybody  nobody 
 typically there 's one or two so my father 's father was one of ten resnick brothers they all hated each other  and all moved to different parts
  so it 's likely i 'm related to every resnick that i ever meet but i don 't know so imagine if my genome were de identified sitting in software 
 and a third cousin 's genome was also sitting there and there was software that could compare the two and make these associations not hard to imagine my company has software that does this right now 
 imagine one more thing that that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consent would you be willing to meet your third cousin and if we both say yes voil welcome to chromosomally linkedin
 now this is probably a good thing right bigger clan gatherings and so on but maybe it 's a bad thing as well how many fathers in the room  raise your hands 
 ok so experts think that one to three percent of you are not actually the father of your child
  they don 't in any way represent the quality of our relationships or the nature of our society at least not yet 
 and like any new technology it 's really in humanity 's hands to wield it for the betterment of mankind
 or not and so i urge you all to wake up and to tune in and to influence the genomic revolution that 's happening all around you thank you
