  so my moment of truth
 did not come all at once in two thousand and ten i had the chance to be considered for promotion
 from my job as director of policy planning at the u s state department this was my
  moment
 to lean in to push myself forward
 for what are really only a handful of the very top foreign policy jobs  
 and i had just finished a big 18 month project for secretary clinton  successfully  
 and i knew i could handle a bigger job 
 the woman
 i thought i was
  would have said yes  
 but i had been commuting for two years between washington and princeton new jersey where my husband and my two teenage sons lived  
 and it was not going well  
 i tried on the idea of eking out another two years in washington or maybe uprooting my sons from their school and my husband from his work and asking them
  but deep down i knew
 that the right decision was to go home  
 even if i didn 't fully recognize the woman who was making that choice 
 that was a decision based on love
 and responsibility  i couldn 't keep watching my oldest son make bad choices without being
  to be there for him when and if he needed me  
 but the real change came more gradually over the next year  while my family was righting itself 
 i started to realize that even if i could go back into government i didn 't want to 
 i didn 't want to miss the last five years that my sons were at
  home  i finally allowed myself to accept
 what was really most important to me not what i was conditioned to want
 or maybe what i conditioned myself to want and that decision led
  to a reassessment of the feminist narrative that i grew up with
 and have always championed i am still completely committed to the cause of 
 equality  
 but let 's think about what that equality really means and how best to achieve it
  i always accepted
 the idea that the most respected and powerful people in our society
 are men at the top of their careers so that the measure of
 male female equality ought to be how many women are in those positions
  prime ministers presidents ceos  directors managers nobel laureates  
  i still think we should do everything we possibly can
 to achieve that goal but that 's only half of real equality  
 and i now think we 're never going to get there unless we recognize the other half  
 i suggest that real
  does not just mean valuing women on male terms  it means creating
 a much wider range of equally respected choices for women
 and for men and to get there we have to change our workplaces our policies and our culture
  in the workplace real
  equality means valuing family just as much as work and understanding that the two reinforce each other 
 as a leader and as a manager  i have always acted on the mantra 
 if family comes first work does not come second
 life comes
  if you work for me  and you have a family issue  
 i expect you to attend to it  and i am confident and my confidence has always been borne out that the work will get done 
 and done better 
 workers who have a reason to get home to care for their children or their family members are more focused more efficient more
  breadwinners who are also caregivers have a much wider range of experiences and contacts 
 think about a lawyer who spends part of his time at school events for his kids talking to other parents he 's much more likely to bring in new clients 
  for his firm than a lawyer who never leaves his office  
 a lot of patience
 and empathy  creativity  resilience adaptability those are all attributes that are ever more important in a 
 high speed horizontal  networked global economy  
 the best
  companies actually know this 
 the companies that win awards for workplace flexibility in the united states include some of our most successful corporations 
 and a two thousand and eight national study on the changing workforce showed that employees in flexible and effective workplaces
 are more engaged with their work they 're more satisfied and more loyal they have lower levels of stress and higher levels of mental health 
 and a two thousand and twelve
  study
 of employers showed that deep flexible practices actually lowered operating costs
 and increased adaptability in a global service economy  so
 you may think that the privileging of work over family
  the obsession with work is no longer a uniquely american disease  
 twenty years ago  when my family first started going to italy we used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta 
 siesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day it 's actually just as much about embracing the warmth of a family
  when we go fewer and fewer businesses close for siesta  reflecting the advance of global corporations
 and 24 hour competition so making a place for those we love is actually a global imperative 
 in policy terms  
 real equality means recognizing that the work that women have traditionally done
 is just as important as
  the work that men have traditionally done no matter who does it 
 think about it
 breadwinning and caregiving are equally necessary for human survival at least if we get beyond
 a barter economy  somebody has to earn an income and someone else has to convert that income to care and sustenance
 for loved ones
  now most of you when you hear me talk about breadwinning and caregiving 
 instinctively translate those categories into men 's work and women 's work and we don 't
 typically challenge why men 's work is is advantaged  but consider
  like my friends sarah and emily  they 're psychiatrists  they got married five years ago and now they have two year old twins  
 they love being mothers  but they also love their work and they 're really good at what they do  
 so how are they going to divide up  breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities should one of them stop working or reduce hours to
  should they both change their practices so they can have much more flexible schedules 
 and what criteria should they use to make that decision is it who makes the most money
 or who is most committed to her career or who has the most flexible boss 
 the same sex perspective helps us see that
 juggling work and family are not women 's problems
  and sarah and emily are the lucky ones  because they have a choice about how much they want to work  
 millions of men and women have to be both breadwinners and caregivers just to earn
 the income they need  and many of those workers are scrambling
  they 're patching together care arrangements that are inadequate and often actually unsafe
  if  breadwinning and caregiving are really equal then why shouldn 't a government invest as much in an infrastructure of care
 as the foundation of a healthy society
 as it invests in physical infrastructure as the backbone of a successful economy  the governments that get it
  no surprises here
 the governments that get it  norway  sweden  denmark  the netherlands  provide universal
 child care  support for caregivers at home school and early childhood education  
 protections for pregnant women and care for the elderly and the disabled 
 those governments invest
 in that infrastructure the same way they invest in roads and bridges and tunnels and trains  
 those societies also show you that  breadwinning and caregiving reinforce each other 
 they routinely rank
 among the top fifteen countries of the most globally competitive economies but
  the same time  they rank very high on the oecd better life index in fact  they rank higher than other governments like my own 
 the u s or switzerland that have higher average levels of income
  infrastructures of care would make a big difference  but we 're not going to get
 equally valued choices unless we change our culture and the kind of cultural change required
 means re socializing men 
 increasingly in developed countries women are socialized to believe that our place is
  no longer only
 in the home  
 but men are actually still where they always were 
 men are still socialized to believe that they have to be breadwinners that to derive their 
 from how high they can climb over other men on a career ladder the feminist revolution still has a long way to go
  certainly not complete  but sixty years after the feminine mystique was published 
 many women actually have more choices than men do 
 we can decide to be a breadwinner a caregiver or any combination of the two 
 when a man on the other hand
  to be a caregiver  he puts his manhood on the line 
 his friends may praise his decision  but underneath  they 're scratching their heads
 isn 't the measure of a man
 his willingness to compete with other men for power and prestige  
 and as many women hold that view as men do we know that lots of women
 still judge
  the attractiveness of a man based in large part on how successful he is in his career 
 a woman can drop out of the work force and still be an attractive partner for a man that 's a risky proposition  
 so as parents and partners we should be socializing our sons and our husbands
 to be
  whatever they want to be  either caregivers
 or breadwinners 
 we should be socializing them to make caregiving cool for guys 
 i can almost hear lots of you thinking no way 
 but in fact  the change is actually already
  happening at least in the united states lots of men take pride in cooking and frankly obsess over stoves 
 they are in the birthing rooms  
 they take paternity leave when they can they can walk a baby or soothe a toddler just as well as their wives can 
 and they are increasingly doing much more of the housework 
 indeed there are male college students
  now who are starting to say i want to be a 
 that was completely unthinkable fifty or even thirty years ago  
 and in norway  where men have an automatic three month 's paternity leave  but they lose it if they decide not to take it a
 high government official told me that companies are starting to look at prospective male employees and raise an
 eyebrow
 if they didn 't in fact take their leave when they had kids 
 that means that it 's starting to seem like a character defect not to want to be a fully engaged father  
 so
 i was raised to believe that championing
 women 's rights
 meant doing everything we could to get women to the top  
 and i still hope that i live long enough to see men and women equally represented at all levels of the work force  
 but i 've come to believe that we have to value family
 every bit as much as we value work and that we should entertain the idea that doing
  right by those we love will make all of us better at everything we do  
 thirty years ago carol gilligan a wonderful psychologist studied adolescent girls
 and identified an ethic of care an element of human nature every bit as important as the ethic of justice it
  you don 't care is just as much a part of who we are as that 's not fair 
 bill gates agrees he argues that the two great forces of human nature are 
 and caring for others  let 's bring them both together  let 's make the feminist revolution
 a humanist revolution
  as whole human beings we will be better caregivers and breadwinners 
 you may think that can 't happen  but i grew up in a society where my mother put out small vases of cigarettes for dinner parties
  where blacks and whites used separate bathrooms and where everybody
 claimed to be heterosexual
  not so much 
 the revolution for human equality
 can happen  it is happening  it will happen 
 how far and how fast is up to us thank you
