  i was recently traveling in the highlands of new guinea  
 and i was talking with a man who had three wives i asked him how many wives would you like to have and
 there was this long pause and i thought to myself is he going to say five is he going to say ten 
 is he going to say
  he leaned towards me and he whispered none laughter
 eighty six percent of human societies permit a man to have several wives polygyny  but in the vast majority of these cultures only about five 
  or ten percent of men actually do have several wives  having several partners can be a toothache 
  can fight with each other 
 sometimes they can even poison each other 's children  
 and you 've got to have a lot of cows a lot of goats a lot of money a lot of land  in order to build a harem  
 we are a pair bonding species ninety seven percent of mammals do not pair up to rear their young human beings do 
 i 'm not suggesting that we 're not
 that we 're necessarily sexually faithful to our partners i 've looked at adultery in
  the genetics of it and some of the brain circuitry of it it 's very common around the world  but we are built to love  
 how is technology changing love  i 'm going to say almost not at all 
 i study the brain i and my colleagues have put over one hundred people into a brain scanner
  just fallen happily in love  
 people who had just been rejected in love and people who are in love long term and it is possible to remain in love long term 
 and i 've long ago maintained that we 've evolved three distinctly different brain systems for mating and reproduction sex drive feelings of intense romantic love
  and feelings of deep cosmic attachment to a  long term partner and together these three brain systems
 our sexual our romantic and our family lives  but they lie way below the cortex way below the limbic system
 where we feel our emotions generate our emotions they lie in the most primitive parts of the brain linked with
 energy  focus  craving  motivation
  and drive in this case the drive to win life 's greatest prize a mating partner  they evolved over four point four million years ago among our first 
  ancestors and they 're not going to change if you swipe left or right on tinder
  we 're seeing new rules and and taboos
 for how to court  but you know is this actually dramatically changing love  what about the late 
  when the automobile became very popular and we suddenly had rolling
  how about the introduction of the
 birth control pill  unchained
 from the great threat of pregnancy and social ruin  women could finally express their primitive and primal sexuality 
 even dating sites are not changing love  
 i 'm chief scientific advisor to match com i 've been it for eleven years  i keep telling them and they agree with me  that these are not dating sites they are introducing
  sites when you sit down in a bar 
 in a coffee house on a park bench your ancient brain snaps into action like a sleeping cat awakened  
 and you smile and laugh and listen
 and parade the way our ancestors did one hundred thousand years ago
  we can give you various people all the dating sites can but the only real algorithm is your own human brain technology is not going to change that 
 technology is also not going to
 change who you choose to love  
 i study the biology of personality  and i 've come to believe that we 've evolved four very broad styles of thinking and behaving linked with the dopamine
  and estrogen systems  so i created a questionnaire
 directly from brain science to measure the degree to which you express the traits the constellation of traits
 linked with each of these four brain systems  i then put that questionnaire on various dating sites
 in forty countries fourteen million or more people
  have now taken the questionnaire and i 've been able to watch who 's naturally drawn to whom 
 and as it turns out those who were very expressive of the dopamine system tend to be curious creative spontaneous energetic i would imagine there 's an awful lot of people like that 
  in this room they 're drawn to people like themselves curious creative people need people like themselves 
  tend to be religious religiosity is in the serotonin system
 and traditional people go for traditional people in that way similarity attracts in the other two cases  opposites attract people very expressive of the testosterone 
  system tend to be analytical logical  direct  decisive and they go for their opposite they go for somebody who 's high estrogen somebody who 's got very good verbal skills and people skills
 who 's very intuitive and who 's very nurturing and emotionally expressive 
 we have natural patterns of mate choice modern technology is not going to change who we choose to love  
 but technology is producing one modern trend that i find particularly important  it 's associated with the concept of paradox of choice for
 millions of years
  lived in little hunting and gathering groups you didn 't have the opportunity to choose between one thousand people on a dating site  
 in fact i 've been studying this recently and i actually think there 's some sort of sweet spot in the brain i don 't know what it is but apparently from reading a lot of the data
  we can embrace about
 five to nine alternatives and after that you get into what academics call
 overload and you don 't choose any  
 so i 've come to think that due to this cognitive overload  we 're ushering in a new form of courtship that i call slow love 
 i arrived at this during my work with match com every year for the last six years we 've done a study called singles in
  we don 't poll the match population we poll the american population  we use 
 people a representative sample of americans based on the us census we 've got data now on over thirty thousand people and
 every single year i see some of the same patterns every single year when i ask the question over fifty percent of people have had a one night stand
  not necessarily last year but in their lives
 fifty percent have had a friends with benefits during the course of their lives  and over fifty percent have lived with a person long term before marrying 
 americans think that this is reckless i have doubted that for a long time  
 the patterns are too strong there 's got to be some darwinian explanation not that many people are crazy  
 and i stumbled then on a statistic that really came home to me
 it was a very interesting
  academic article in which i found that
 percent of singles in america today who are living long term with somebody have not yet married because they are terrified of divorce they 're terrified 
  of the social legal emotional  economic consequences of divorce  so i came to realize that i don 't think this is recklessness  i think it 's caution 
  's singles want to know every single thing about a partner before they wed 
 you learn a lot between the sheets not only about how somebody makes love  but whether they 're kind whether they can listen and at my age whether they 've got a sense of humor 
 and in an age where we have
  we have very little fear of pregnancy and disease and we 've got no feeling of shame for sex before marriage  i think people are taking their time
 to love and actually what 's happening is what we 're seeing is a real expansion of the precommitment stage
 before you tie the knot where marriage used to be the beginning of a relationship now it 's the finale  but the human brain
  the human brain always triumphs  and indeed in the united states today eighty six percent of americans will marry by age forty nine and even in cultures around the world where they 're not marrying as often 
  they are settling down eventually with a long term partner  so it began to occur to me  during this long extension
  if you can get rid of bad relationships before you marry maybe we 're going to see more happy marriages  so i did a study of one thousand one hundred married people
 in america not on match com of course and i asked them a lot of questions but one of the questions was would you 
 the person you 're currently married to
 and family life is not technology it
 's not even slow love  
 it 's actually women piling into the job market in cultures around the world for millions of years our ancestors lived in little hunting and gathering groups  women commuted to work to gather their fruits and vegetables they came home with sixty to eighty percent
  family was the rule 
 and women were regarded as just as economically socially and sexually powerful as men then the environment changed some ten thousand years ago we began to settle down on the farm
 and both men and women became obliged really to marry the right person from the right background from the right religion and from the right
  and social and political connections men 's jobs became more important they had to move the rocks fell the trees plow the land they brought the produce to local markets and came home with the equivalent of money
 along with this we see a rise of a host of beliefs  the belief of virginity at marriage 
 arranged marriages strictly arranged marriages the belief that the man is the head of the household that the wife 's place is in the home
 and most important  honor thy husband and ' til death do us
  part these are gone  
 they are going and in many places they are gone  we are right now in a marriage revolution we are shedding ten thousand years 
 of our farming tradition and moving forward towards egalitarian relationships between the sexes something i regard as highly compatible with the ancient human spirit
 i 'm not a pollyanna there
 's a great deal to cry about i 've studied divorce in eighty cultures i 've studied as i say adultery in many there 's a whole pile of problems 
 as william butler yeats the poet once said love is the crooked thing 
 i would add nobody gets out alive 
  in fact i think the poet randall jarrell really sums it up best he said the dark uneasy world of family life where the greatest can fail 
 and the humblest succeed 
 but i will leave you with this love and attachment will prevail technology cannot change it  and i will conclude by saying
  there 's another speaker here with us that works in your same field
  she comes at it from a different perspective esther perel is a psychotherapist who works with couples 
 you study data  esther studies the stories the couples tell her when they come to her for help
  let 's have her join us on the stage
 helen 's talk was there any part of it that resonated with you through the lens of your own work that you 'd like to comment on esther
 perel it 's interesting because on the one hand the need for love
 is ubiquitous and universal  but the way we love the meaning we make out of it the rules that govern our
  i think are changing fundamentally  we come from a model
 that until now was primarily regulated around duty and obligation the needs of the collective and loyalty and we have shifted it to a model of free choice and individual
 and individual rights and
  and happiness  and so  
 that was the first thing i thought that the need doesn 't change but the context and the way we regulate these relationships changes a lot 
  paradox of choice  you know on the one hand we relish the novelty and the playfulness 
 to be able to have so many options and at the same time as you talk about this cognitive overload  i see many many people who who
 dread
  that comes with this massa of choice  creating a case of fomo 
 and then leading us fomo fear of missed opportunity or fear of missing out it 's like how do i know i have found ' the one ' the right one so we 've created what i call this thing of stable ambiguity 
 stable ambiguity is when you are too afraid to be alone but also not really willing to engage in
  of tactics that kind of prolong the uncertainty of a relationship but also the uncertainty of the breakup so here on the internet you have three major ones 
 one is icing and simmering which are great stalling tactics that offer a kind of holding pattern that emphasizes the undefined
  nature of a relationship but at the same time gives you enough of a comforting consistency and enough freedom of the undefined boundaries yeah 
 and then comes ghosting  and ghosting is basically you disappear from this massa of texts on the spot  and you don 't have to deal with the pain that you inflict on another  because you 're making
  as i was listening to you like how a vocabulary
 also creates a reality  and at the same time  that 's my question to you do you think when the context changes it still means 
  that the nature of love remains the same you study the brain and i study people 's relationships and stories so
  think it 's everything you say plus  but i don 't always know the degree to which a changing context  
 does it at some point begin to change if the meaning changes does it change the need or is the need clear of the entire context
  to your first one there 's no question that we 've changed that we now want a person to love 
 and for thousands of years we had to marry the right person from the right background and right kin connection  and in fact  in my studies
 of five thousand people every year i ask them what are you looking for and every single year over ninety seven
  of people want somebody that respects them somebody they can trust and confide in somebody who makes them laugh 
 somebody who makes enough time for them and somebody who they find physically attractive
 physically attractive  that never changes  and there 's certainly you know
  no question about it but it 's interesting the millennials actually want to be
 very good parents  whereas the generation above them wants to have a very fine marriage but is not as focused on being a good parent
  of personality  there 's your culture everything you grew up to do and believe and say and there 's your temperament basically what i 've been talking about is your temperament and that temperament is certainly going to change with changing times and changing beliefs  and
 in terms of the paradox of choice there 's no question about it that this is a pickle there were millions of years where you found that sweet boy at the other side of the water hole  and you went for it
  you hf i do want to say one more thing the
 bottom line is in hunting and gathering societies they tended to have two or three partners during the course of their lives
 they weren 't square and i 'm not suggesting that we do but the bottom line is  
 we 've always had alternatives  mankind is always in fact  the brain is well built to what
  to try and decide do i come do i stay do i go do i stay what are the opportunities here how do i handle this there and so i think we 're seeing another play out of that now
