  's really quite an honor to be here tonight
 and i 'm really glad that i stayed here and listened because i
 i 've really been inspired and
 i 'm going to play some songs for you tonight that are literally world premieres i 've been working on my on my new record and i 've never played these songs for anybody except the microphone
 this is a song that that i wrote
 about
 the meaning of technology which goes
  perfectly with this gathering i started thinking about when i was in college especially as a blind person
 doing a research paper was a major undertaking
 you had to go to the library see if you could get them to find the books for you you know footnotes and all that now you can just go on google
 just look it up
 i wish i had that when i was in college anyway
  this is a a song about
 we have all this but what are we going to do with it
 it 's called all the answers thank you whew
  thank you
 whew it 's a miracle i didn 't make any mistakes on
  it 's a feel the fear and do it anyway kind of thing
 this next song is a song that started out as a dream
 a childhood dream
 it was it was one of the titles that i was sort of thinking about calling my record except there 's a couple of problems one thing is it 's unpronouncable
 and it 's a made up
  word it 's called tembererana and the song is based on what i think was my first sort of childhood
 attempts
 to to think about invisible forces so tembererana was these dreams in which i would be
 running away from
 bad feelings is the only way i can put it
 so this is called tembererana it 's based on an argentinian rhythm called carnivalito
