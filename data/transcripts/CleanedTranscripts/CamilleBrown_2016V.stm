  the bop is a type of social
 dance dance is a language and social dance is an expression that emerges
  a community 
 a social dance isn 't choreographed by any one person  
 it can 't be traced to any one moment  
 each dance has steps that everyone can agree on  but it 's about the individual and their creative identity
  because of that social dances bubble up they change and they spread like wildfire 
 they are as old as our remembered history

 the present always contains the past 
 and the past shapes who we are and who we will be 
 the juba dance was born from enslaved africans ' experience on the plantation
 brought to the americas stripped of a common spoken language  this dance was a way for enslaved africans to remember where they 're from 
 it may have looked something like this 
 slapping thighs  shuffling feet and patting hands 
 this was how they got around the slave owners ' ban on drumming
  improvising complex rhythms just like ancestors did with drums in haiti or in the yoruba communities of west africa 
 it was about keeping cultural traditions alive and retaining a sense of inner freedom under captivity
  it was the same subversive spirit that created this dance 
 the cakewalk a dance that parodied the mannerisms of southern high society a way for the enslaved to throw shade at the masters  
 the crazy thing about this dance is that the cakewalk was performed for the masters who never suspected they were being made fun of

 started by a tight knit black community
  near charleston south carolina the charleston permeated dance halls where young women suddenly had the freedom to kick their heels and move their legs
 now social dance is about community and connection 
 if you knew the steps it meant you belonged to a group  but what if it becomes a worldwide craze  
 enter the twist  it 's no surprise that the twist can be traced back to the
  brought to america from the congo during slavery
  but in the late ' 50s right before the civil rights movement the twist is popularized by chubby checker and dick clark 
 suddenly everybody 's doing the twist  white teenagers kids in latin america making its way into songs and movies  through social dance
