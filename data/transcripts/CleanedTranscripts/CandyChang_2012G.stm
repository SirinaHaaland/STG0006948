  there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives we don 't bump into every neighbor so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on 
 though we do share the same public
  so over the past few years i 've tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space using simple tools like stickers stencils and chalk  
 and these projects came from questions i had like  
 how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments 
 laughter how can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each other 's doors at a bad time  
 how can we share more
  of our abandoned buildings and gain a better understanding of our landscape
 how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts  so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today now 
 i live in new orleans  and i am in love with new orleans 
 my soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees  shading lovers drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years
 and i trust a city that always makes way for music  i feel like every time someone sneezes new orleans has a parade 
 the city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in america  
 i live near this house  and i thought about how i could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood  and i also thought about something that changed my life
  forever 
 in two thousand and nine i lost someone i loved very much
 her name was joan and she was a mother to me and her death was sudden and unexpected
  and i thought about death a lot
  this made me feel deep gratitude for the time i 've had and 
 brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now  
 but i struggle to maintain this perspective in my
  i feel like it 's easy to get caught up in the day to day and forget what really matters to you  so with help from old and new friends  i turned the side of this abandoned house
 into a giant chalkboard  and stenciled it with a fill in the blank sentence before i die  i want to 
 so anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk 
 reflect on their life and share their personal aspirations in public space 
  know what to expect from this experiment  but by the next day the wall was entirely filled out 
 and it kept growing  and i 'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall 
 before i die  i want to be tried for piracy
  die i want to straddle the international dateline 
 before i die  i want to sing for millions 
 before i die  i want to plant a tree 
 before i die i want to live off the grid before i die  i want to hold her one more time
 before i die  i want to be someone 's cavalry 
 before i die  i want to be completely myself 
 so this neglected space became a constructive one and people 's hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud
  and they consoled me during my own tough times it 's about knowing you 're not alone 
 it 's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways it
 's about making space for reflection and contemplation  and remembering what really matters most to us
 as we grow and change i made this last
  and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community  so my civic center colleagues and i made a tool kit 
 and now walls have been made in countries around the world  including kazakhstan  
 south africa  
 australia  argentina  and beyond
 together we 've shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we 're given the opportunity to have a voice and share more
  with one another two
 of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people 
 in our age of increasing distractions 
 it 's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender 
 death is something that we 're often discouraged to talk about or even think about
 i 've realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do  
 thinking about death clarifies your life 
 our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community  
 and with more ways to share our hopes  fears and stories the people around us can not only help us make better places
 they can help us lead better lives  thank you
