  on my way here  the passenger next to me and i had a very interesting conversation
 during my flight  he told me it seems like the united states has run out of
  because they 're just making some up cat psychologist  dog whisperer  tornado chaser 
 a couple of seconds later he asked me so what do you do
  participation in peace processes and conflict resolution  and because of my work i recognize
 that the only way to ensure the full participation of women globally is by reclaiming religion 
 now this matter is vitally important to me as a young muslim woman i am very proud of my faith
  gives me the strength and conviction to do my work every day  it 's the reason i can be here in front of you  
 but i can 't overlook the damage that has been done in the name of religion 
 not just my own but all of the world 's major faiths  the misrepresentation and misuse and manipulation of religious scripture
 has influenced our social and cultural norms
 our laws our daily lives to a point where we sometimes don 't recognize it 
 my parents moved from libya north africa to canada in the early 
 and i am the middle child of eleven children yes eleven  but growing up i saw my parents
  spiritual people pray and praise god for their blessings  namely me of course  but among others 
 they were kind and funny
 and patient limitlessly patient  the kind of patience that having eleven kids forces you to have 
 and they were fair i was never subjected to religion through a cultural lens i
  was treated the same the same was expected of me  i was never taught that god judged differently based on gender 
 and my parents ' understanding of god as a merciful and beneficial friend and provider
 shaped the way i looked at the world 
  of course my upbringing had additional benefits being one of eleven children is diplomacy one hundred and one 
 to this day i am asked where i went to school like did you go to kennedy school of government and i look at them and i 'm like no i went to the murabit school of international affairs it 's
 extremely exclusive you would have to talk to my mom to get in lucky for you she 's here
  being one of eleven children and having ten siblings teaches you a lot about power structures and alliances  
 it teaches you focus you have to talk fast or say less because you will always get cut off  
 it teaches you the importance of messaging you have to ask questions in the right way to get the answers you know you want  
  you have to say no in the right way to keep the peace but the most important lesson i learned growing up
 was the importance of being at the table  
 when my mom 's favorite lamp broke  i had to be there when she was trying to find out how and by who because i had to defend myself 
 because if you 're not then the finger is pointed at you and before you know it you will be grounded  i am not speaking from experience of course
 when i was fifteen in two thousand and five  i completed high school and i moved
 from canada saskatoon
 to zawiya my parents ' hometown in libya a very traditional city  
 mind you i had only ever been to libya before on vacation  
  was ice cream and trips to the beach and really excited relatives  
 turns out it 's not the same as a  15 year old young lady  
 i very quickly became introduced to the cultural aspect
 of religion the words haram meaning religiously prohibited
  meaning culturally inappropriate
 were exchanged carelessly 
 as if they meant the same thing and had the same consequences  
 and i found myself in conversation after conversation with classmates and colleagues professors friends even relatives  
 beginning to question my own role and my own aspirations  
 and even
  the foundation my parents had provided for me i found myself questioning the role of women in my faith  
 so at the murabit school of international affairs we go very heavy on the debate  
 and rule number one is do your research  so that 's what i did  and it surprised me how easy it was
 to find women in my
  the islamic movement in its infancy we wouldn 't be here if it weren 't for her  
 so why weren 't we learning about her why weren 't we learning about these women why were women being relegated to positions
 which predated the teachings of our faith  and why if we are equal in the eyes of god are we not equal in the eyes of men 
 to me it all came back to the lessons i had learned
 as a child 
 the decision maker  the person who gets to control the message is sitting at the table  
 and unfortunately in every single
  are not women 
 religious institutions are dominated by men and driven by male leadership and they create policies in their likeness  
 and until we can change the system entirely  
 then we can 't realistically expect to have full economic and political participation of women 
 our foundation is broken
  my mom actually says you can 't build a straight house on a crooked foundation 
 in two thousand and eleven the libyan revolution broke out and my family was on the front lines  
 and there 's this amazing thing that happens in war a cultural shift almost very temporary  
 and it was the first time that i felt it was not only acceptable for me to be involved but it was encouraged it was demanded
 myself and other women had a seat at the table  we weren 't holding hands or
 a medium  we were part of decision making we were information sharing we were crucial  
 and i wanted and needed for that change to be permanent  
 turns out that 's not that easy it only took a few weeks before the women that i had
  previously worked with were returning back to their previous roles and most of them were driven by words of encouragement
 from religious and political leaders most of whom cited religious scripture as their defense 
 it 's how they gained popular support for their opinions 
 so initially i focused on the economic and political empowerment of women i thought that
  lead to cultural and social change it turns out it does a little  but not a lot 
 i decided to use their defense as my offense  and i began to cite and highlight islamic scripture as well 
 in two thousand and twelve and two thousand and thirteen my organization
  the single largest and most widespread campaign in libya  
 we entered homes and schools and universities even mosques 
 we spoke to fifty thousand people directly  and hundreds of thousands more through billboards and television commercials radio commercials and posters  
 and you 're probably wondering how a women 's rights organization was able to do this in communities which had previously opposed our sheer existence  
 i used scripture i used
  verses from the quran and sayings of the prophet hadiths his sayings which
 are for example the best of you is the best to their family do not let your brother oppress another 
 for the first time friday sermons led by local community imams promoted the rights of women they discussed taboo issues like
  violence policies were changed 
 in certain communities we actually had to go as far
 as saying the international human rights declaration which you opposed because it wasn 't written by religious scholars  
 well  those same principles are are in our book  
 so really the united nations just copied us
 by changing the message  we were able to provide an alternative narrative which promoted the rights of women in libya  
 it 's something that has now been replicated internationally  
 and while i am not saying it 's easy believe me  it 's not liberals
 will say you 're using religion and call you a bad conservative conservatives will call you a lot of colorful things  
 i 've heard everything from your parents must be extremely ashamed of you false they 're my biggest fans
 to you will not make it to your next birthday again wrong  because i did  and i remain
 a very strong believer that women 's rights and religion are not mutually exclusive  
 but we have
  be at the table  
 we have to stop giving up our position because by remaining silent we allow for the continued persecution and abuse of women worldwide 
 by saying that we 're going to fight for women 's rights and fight extremism with bombs and warfare  we completely
  cripple local societies which need to address these issues so that they 're sustainable  
 it is not easy  challenging distorted religious messaging 
 you will have your fair share of insults and ridicule and threats  
 but we have to do it we have no other option than to reclaim the message of human rights the principles of our faith  
 not for us
  for the women in your families not for the women in this room not even for the women out there  but for societies that would be transformed
 with the participation of women 
 and the only way we can do that our only option is to be and remain at the table  thank you
