  an english composer  technologist and astronomer called william herschel noticed an object on the sky that didn 't quite move the way the rest of the stars did  
  recognition that something was different that something wasn 't quite right was the discovery of a planet the planet uranus 
 a name that has entertained countless generations of children  
 but a planet that overnight doubled the size of our known solar system 
 just last month nasa announced the discovery of five hundred and seventeen new planets in orbit around nearby stars almost doubling
  overnight the number of planets we know about within our galaxy  
 so astronomy is constantly being transformed by this capacity to collect data 
 and with data almost doubling every year  within the next two decades me may even reach the point for the first time in history
 where we 've discovered the majority of the galaxies within the universe but as we enter this era of big data what we 're beginning to find is there 's a difference between
  more data being just better
 and more data being different capable of changing the questions we want to ask  
 and this difference is not about how much data we collect it 's whether those data open new windows into our universe  whether they change the way we view the sky 
 so what is the next window into our universe  what is the next chapter for astronomy well i
 'm going to show you some of the tools and the technologies that we 're going to develop over the next decade  and how these technologies together with the
  smart use of data may once again transform astronomy
 by opening up a window into our universe  the window of time why time well time is about origins and it 's about evolution  
 the origins of our solar system how our solar system came into being is it unusual
 or special in any way about the evolution of our universe  why our universe is continuing to expand and what is
  this mysterious dark energy that drives that expansion 
 but first i want to show you how technology is going to change the way we view the sky so imagine if you were sitting in the mountains of northern chile
 looking out to the west towards the pacific ocean
 a few hours before sunrise this is the view of the night sky that you would see and it 's a beautiful view with the milky way just
  peeking out over the horizon but it 's also a static view  and in many ways  this is the way we think of our universe  eternal and unchanging  
 but the universe is anything but static it constantly changes on timescales of seconds to billions of years 
 galaxies merge they collide at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour
  they explode in these extravagant displays in fact if we could go back to our tranquil skies above chile  and we allow time to move forward
 to see how the sky might change over the next year  the pulsations that you see
 are supernovae the final remnants of a dying star
 exploding  brightening and then fading from view  each one of these supernovae five billion times the
  brightness of our sun  so we can see them to great distances but only for a short amount of time 
 ten supernova per second explode somewhere in our universe  if we could hear it it would be popping like a bag of popcorn  
 now if we fade out the 
  not just brightness that changes our sky is in constant motion this swarm of
  objects you see streaming across the sky are asteroids as they orbit our sun  and it 's these changes and the motion and it 's the dynamics of the system
 that allow us to build our models for our universe to predict its future
 and to explain its past  
 but the telescopes we 've used over the last decade are not designed to capture the data at this scale the hubble space telescope
 twenty five years it 's been producing some of the most detailed views of our distant universe 
 but if you tried to use the hubble to create an image of the sky  it would take thirteen million individual images 
 about one hundred and twenty years to do this just once 
 so this is driving us to new technologies and new telescopes telescopes that can go faint to look at the distant universe but also telescopes that can go
  wide
 to capture the sky as rapidly as possible telescopes like the large synoptic survey telescope  or the lsst 
 possibly the most boring name ever for one of the most fascinating experiments in the history of astronomy 
 in fact
 proof if you should need it that you should never allow a scientist or an engineer to name anything not even your children
  we 're building the lsst we expect it to start taking data by the end of this decade i 'm going to show you how we think it 's going to transform our views of the universe  
 because one image from the lsst is equivalent to three thousand images from the hubble space telescope  
 each image three and a half degrees on the sky  seven times the width of the full moon  well how do you capture
  an image at this scale  
 well you build the largest digital camera in history using the same technology you find in the cameras in your cell phone or in the digital cameras you can buy in the high street 
 but now at a scale that is five and a half feet across 
 about the size of a volkswagen beetle where one image is three billion pixels  so if you wanted to look at an image in its full resolution just a single
  image it would take about one thousand five hundred high definition tv screens  
 and this camera will image the sky  taking a new picture every twenty seconds constantly scanning the sky
 so every three nights we 'll get a completely new view of the skies above chile over the mission
  it will detect forty billion stars and galaxies and that will be for the first time we 'll have detected more objects in our universe than
 people on the earth  now we can talk about this in terms of terabytes and petabytes and billions of objects 
 but a way to get a sense of the amount of data that will come off this camera
 is that it 's like playing every ted talk ever recorded
  hours a day  seven days a week for ten years 
 and to process this data means searching through all of those talks for every new idea and every new concept looking at each part of the video to see how one frame may have changed from the next 
 and this is changing the way that we do science changing the way that we do astronomy 
 to a place where software and algorithms have to mine through this data where the software is as critical to the science
 as the telescopes and the cameras that we 've built 
 now  
 thousands of discoveries will come from this project but i 'm just going to tell you about two of the ideas about origins and evolution that may be transformed by our access to data at this scale  
 in the last five years nasa has discovered over one thousand planetary systems around nearby stars  but the
  we 're finding aren 't much like our own solar system  
 and one of the questions we face is is it just that we haven 't been looking hard enough or is there something special or unusual about how our solar system formed 
 and if we want to answer that question we have to know and understand the history of our solar system in detail  and it 's the details that are crucial 
 so now  if we look back at the sky
  asteroids that were streaming across the sky  these asteroids are like the debris of our solar system  
 the positions of the asteroids are like a fingerprint of an earlier time when the orbits of neptune and jupiter were much closer to the sun  
 and as these giant planets migrated through our solar system  they were scattering the asteroids in their wake  
 so studying the asteroids is like performing forensics
  performing forensics on our solar system  
 but to do this we need distance and we get the distance from the motion and we get the motion because of our access to time  
 so what does this tell us  well if you look at the little yellow asteroids flitting across the screen these are the asteroids that are moving
  because they 're closest to us closest to earth 
 these are the asteroids we may one day send spacecraft to to mine them for minerals  but they 're also the asteroids that may one day impact the earth 
 like happened sixty million years ago with the extinction of the dinosaurs 
 or just at the beginning of the last century when an asteroid wiped out almost one thousand square miles of siberian forest 
 or even just last year as one burnt up over russia  releasing the energy of a small nuclear bomb
  so studying the forensics of our solar system doesn 't just tell us about the past it can also predict the future  including our future 
 now when we get distance 
 we get to see the asteroids in their natural habitat in orbit around the sun  so every point in this visualization that you can see is a real asteroid 
 its orbit
  has been calculated from its motion across the sky  
 the colors reflect the composition of these asteroids 
 dry and stony in the center water rich and primitive towards the edge water rich asteroids which may have seeded the oceans and the seas that we find on our planet when they bombarded the earth at an earlier time
  will be able to go faint and not just wide we will be able to see these asteroids far beyond the inner part of our solar system  
 to asteroids beyond the orbits of neptune and mars to comets and asteroids that may exist almost a light year from our sun  
 and as we increase the detail of this picture  increasing the detail by factors of ten to one hundred we will be able to answer questions such as is there evidence
  for planets outside the orbit of neptune to find earth impacting asteroids long before they 're a danger  
 and to find out whether maybe our sun formed on its own or in a cluster of stars and maybe it 's this sun 's stellar siblings that
 influenced the formation of our solar system and maybe that 's one of the reasons why solar systems like ours seem to be so rare
  now distance and changes in our universe distance
 equates to time as well as changes on the sky  
 every foot of distance you look away  or every foot of distance an object is away you 're looking back about a billionth of a second in time  
 and this idea or this notion of looking back in time has revolutionized our ideas about the universe
  but multiple times the first time was in one thousand nine 
 when an astronomer called edwin hubble showed that the universe was expanding  leading to the ideas of the big bang and the observations were simple 
 just twenty four galaxies
 and a hand drawn picture  but
 just the idea that the more distant a
  galaxy  the faster it was receding was enough to give rise to modern cosmology 
 a second revolution happened seventy years later when two groups of astronomers showed that the universe wasn 't just expanding it was accelerating 
 a surprise like throwing up a ball into the sky and finding out the higher that it gets the faster it moves away  
 and they showed this by measuring the
  of supernovae and how the brightness of the supernovae got fainter with distance 
 and these observations were more complex they required new technologies and new telescopes because
 the supernovae were in galaxies that were two thousand times more distant than the ones used by hubble 
 and it took three years to find just
  because a supernova only explodes once every hundred years within a galaxy 
 three years to find forty two supernovae by searching through tens of thousands of galaxies 
 and once they 'd collected their data this is what they found 
 now this may not look impressive  but this
  is what a revolution in physics looks like 
 a line predicting the brightness of a supernova eleven billion light years away and a handful of points that don 't quite fit that line  
 small changes give rise to big consequences  
 small changes allow us to make discoveries like the planet found by herschel 
 small changes turn our understanding of the universe on its
  slightly too faint meaning slightly further away  requiring that a universe must not just be expanding  but this expansion must be accelerating  
 revealing a component of our universe which we now call dark energy a component that drives this expansion
 and makes up sixty eight percent of the energy budget of our universe today  
 so what is the next revolution likely to be
 well what is dark energy and why does it exist each of these lines shows a different model for what dark energy might be 
 showing the properties of dark energy 
 they all are consistent with the forty two points  but the ideas behind these lines are dramatically different some people
  think about a dark energy that changes with time or whether the properties of the dark energy are different depending on where you look on the sky  
 others make differences and changes to the physics at the  sub atomic level 
 or they look at large scales
 and change how gravity and general relativity work or they say our universe is just one of many part of this mysterious multiverse  but
  all of these ideas all of these theories amazing and admittedly some of them a little crazy  but all of them consistent with our forty two points  
 so how can we hope to make sense of this over the next decade  
 well imagine if i gave you a pair of dice 
 and i said you wanted to see whether those dice were loaded or fair one roll of the dice would tell you very little  
 but the more times you rolled them the more data you collected the more confident you would
  become not just whether they 're loaded or fair  but by how much  and in what way 
 it took three years to find just forty two supernovae because the telescopes that we built
 could only survey a small part of the sky  with the  lsst we get a completely
  new view of the skies above chile every three nights 
 in its first night of operation  it will find ten times the number of supernovae used in the discovery of dark energy 
 this will increase by one thousand within the first four months one point five million supernovae
 by the end of its survey  
 each supernova a roll of the dice each supernova testing which theories of dark energy are consistent and which
  ones are not 
 and so by combining these supernova data
 with other measures of cosmology we 'll progressively rule out the different ideas and theories of dark energy until hopefully
 at the end of this survey around two thousand and thirty
  expect to hopefully see a theory for our universe  a fundamental theory for the physics of our universe  to gradually emerge 
 now in many ways the questions that i posed are in reality the simplest of questions 
 we may not know the answers but we at least know how to ask the questions  
 but if looking through tens of thousands of galaxies revealed
  turned our understanding of the universe on its head  
 when we 're working with billions of galaxies 
 how many more times are we going to find forty two points that don 't quite match what we expect 
 like the planet found by herschel
 or dark energy
 or quantum mechanics or general relativity all ideas that came because the
  data didn 't quite match what we expected what 's so exciting about the next decade of data in astronomy
 is we don 't even know how many answers are out there waiting  
 answers about our origins and our evolution how many answers are out there that we don 't even know the the questions that we want to ask
