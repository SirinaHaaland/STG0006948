  an encounter i had with cnn
 summarizes what i 'm going to be talking about today which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic the
 editor of
  discover told us
 ten of them i 'm going to give you the eleventh  so they came to me cnn and they said professor seligman
 would you tell us about the the state of psychology today we 'd like to interview you about that
  really better give you a longer sound bite how many words do i get this time
 give you a real sound bite  this time you can have three words  professor seligman what is the state of psychology today 
 not good enough
 that 's what i 'm going to be talking about i want to say why psychology was good why it was not good and how it
 may become in the next ten years good enough  and by parallel
  summary i want to say the same thing about technology  about entertainment and design because i think the issues are very similar 
 so why was psychology good 
 well for more than sixty years psychology worked within the disease model ten years ago when i was on an airplane and i introduced myself to my seatmate 
 and told them what i did they 'd move away from me
  they were saying psychology is about finding what 's wrong with you spot the loony  and now when i tell people what i do 
 they move toward me  what was good
 about psychology about the $ thirty billion investment nimh made about working in the disease model about what you mean
  sixty years ago  none of the disorders were treatable it was entirely smoke and mirrors  and now fourteen of the disorders are treatable two of them actually curable 
 and the other
 thing that happened is that a science developed a science of mental illness we found out we could
 take fuzzy concepts like
  and measure them with rigor that we could create a classification of the mental illnesses  that we could
 understand the causality of the mental illnesses we could
 look across time at the same people people for example who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia
 and ask what the contribution of mothering of genetics are and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the
  mental illnesses  and best of all we were able in the last fifty years to invent
 drug treatments and psychological treatments and then we were able to test them rigorously in 
  placebo controlled designs throw out the things that didn 't work  keep the things that actively
  the conclusion of that is psychology and psychiatry of the last sixty years can actually claim that we can make
 miserable people less miserable  and i think that 's terrific  i 'm proud of it
 but what was not good  the consequences of that were three things the first was moral  
 that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists
  pathologizers 
 that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble  bricks fell on you and we forgot that people made choices and decisions we forgot responsibility 
 that was the first cost 
 the second cost
 was that we forgot about you people we forgot about improving
  became a dirty word no one works on that and the third problem about the disease model
 is in our rush to do something about people in trouble  in our rush to do something about repairing
  never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier
 positive interventions so that was not good  and so that 's what led
 people like nancy etcoff  dan gilbert mike 
  myself to work in something i call positive psychology which has three aims  the first
 is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness
  it should be
 just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage it should be interested in the best things in life  
 and it should be just as concerned
 with making the lives of normal people fulfilling and
 with genius with nurturing high talent
  in the last ten years and the hope for the future we 've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology a science of what makes life worth living  
 it turns out that we can measure
 different forms of happiness and any of you for free can go to that website [ www authentichappiness org ] and take
 the entire panoply of tests of happiness you can ask  how do you stack
  up for positive emotion for meaning for flow  against literally tens of thousands of other people
 we created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex 
  ratio how they 're defined how to diagnose them what builds them and what gets in their way
  between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a
 cause of happiness 
 i 've spent my life working on extremely miserable people  and i 've asked the question how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you and starting about
 six years ago we asked about extremely happy people how do they differ from the rest of us
  it turns out there 's one way very surprising they 're not more religious they 're not in better shape they don 't have more money they 're not better looking they
 don 't have more good events and fewer bad events the one way in which they differ they 're extremely social  they
 don 't sit in seminars on saturday
  they don 't spend time alone each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends
 but watch out here this is merely correlational data not causal  
 and it 's about happiness in the first hollywood sense i 'm going to talk about happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer 
  and i 'm going to suggest to you that 's not nearly enough in just a moment
 we found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries from the buddha to tony robbins about one hundred and twenty interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy  
 and we find that we 've
 been able to manualize many of them and we actually carry out
 efficacy and effectiveness studies that is  which ones actually make people
  lastingly happier in a couple of minutes i 'll tell you about some of those results but the upshot of this is that the mission
 i want psychology to have in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill
 and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable is  can psychology actually make people happier 
 and to ask that question
  is not a word i use very much
 we 've had to break it down into what i think is askable about happy and i believe there are three different
 i call them different because different interventions build them  it 's possible to have one rather than the other three different happy lives the first happy life
  this is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can 
 and the skills to amplify it the second is a life of engagement a life in your work your parenting  
 your love your leisure time stops for you 
 that 's what aristotle was talking about and third the meaningful life i want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them  the first life is the pleasant life  and it 's simply
  best we we can find it it 's having as many of the pleasures as you can as much positive emotion as you can and
 learning the skills savoring mindfulness
 that amplify them that stretch them over time and space  
 but the pleasant life has three drawbacks  and it 's why positive psychology is not 
 and why it doesn 't end
  here  the first drawback is it turns out the pleasant life your experience of positive emotion  is
 about fifty percent heritable and in fact 
 not very modifiable so the different tricks that
 matthieu and i and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are fifteen to twenty percent
 tricks getting more of it second is that positive emotion habituates it habituates
 rapidly indeed it 's all like french vanilla ice cream  the first taste is one hundred percent by the time you 're down to the sixth taste it 's gone 
 and as i said it 's not
 particularly malleable
 and this leads to the second life i have to tell you about my friend len to talk about
 why positive psychology is more than positive emotion  more than building pleasure in two of the three great arenas of life  by the time len was thirty len was enormously successful 
 the first arena
 was work by the time he was twenty he was an options trader by the
  he was twenty five he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company
  second in play he 's a national champion bridge player   
 but in the third great arena of life love len is an abysmal failure  and the reason he was was that len is
  american women said to len  when he dated them you 're no fun  you don 't have positive emotion  get lost and
 len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a park avenue psychoanalyst who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of
  but it turned out there wasn 't any sexual trauma it turned out that
 len grew up in long island and he played football and watched football and
 played bridge  len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities the question is is
  and i want to say not contrary to what psychology told us about
 the bottom fifty percent of the human race in positive affectivity 
 i think len is one of the happiest people i know he 's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness  
 and that 's because len like most of you is enormously capable of flow  when he walks onto the floor of the american exchange at
  thirty in the morning time stops for him and it stops till the closing bell when the first card is played
 till ten days later when the tournament is over time stops for len  and this is indeed what
 mike csikszentmihalyi has been talking about about flow and it 's distinct from pleasure in a very important way 
 pleasure has raw feel you know it 's happening  
 it 's thought and feeling but what mike told you yesterday during flow
  you can 't feel anything
 you 're one with the music time stops you have intense concentration  and this is indeed the characteristic
 of what we think of as the good life and we think there 's a recipe for it and it 's knowing what your highest strengths
  there 's a valid test of what your
 five highest strengths are and then re crafting your life
 to use them as much as you possibly can re crafting your work  your love  your play  your friendship your parenting 
 just one example
  one person i worked with was a bagger at genuardi 's hated the job she 's working her way through college 
 her highest strength was social intelligence
  she re crafted bagging
 to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer 's day  
 now obviously she failed  but what she did was to take her highest strengths and re craft work to use them as much as possible 
 what you get out of that is not smiley ness you don 't look like
 debbie reynolds you don 't giggle a lot what you get is more absorption
 so that 's the second path the first path positive emotion  the second path is
  flow and the third path is meaning this is the most venerable of the happinesses  traditionally and meaning in this view consists of
 very parallel to
  it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are and using them
 to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are
 i mentioned that for all three kinds of lives
 the pleasant life  the good life the meaningful life
 people are now hard at work on the question are there things that lastingly change those lives and
  answer seems to be yes and i 'll just give you some samples of it it
 's being done in a rigorous manner it 's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works  so we do
  studies of different interventions just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect when we teach people
 about the pleasant life how to have more pleasure in your life  
 one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills the savoring skills and you 're assigned to design a beautiful day  
 next saturday 
 set a day aside design yourself a beautiful day  and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures  and we can show in that way that
 the pleasant life is enhanced  gratitude visit  
 i want you all to do this with me now if you would  close your eyes i
 'd like you to
 remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction
  you never properly thanked the
 person has to be alive
  now ok 
 you can open your eyes i hope all of you have such a person 
 your assignment when you 're learning the gratitude visit is to write a 300 word testimonial to that person 
 call them on the phone in phoenix
  ask if you can visit don 't tell them why show up at their door  you read the testimonial
 everyone weeps when this happens  and what happens is when we test people
 one week later a month later three months later  they 're both happier and less depressed
  another example is a strengths date in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths
 on the strengths test and then
  to design an evening in which they both use their strengths we find this is a strengthener of
 relationships  and fun versus philanthropy it 's so heartening to be in a group like this in which
 so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy  well my undergraduates and the people i work with haven 't
  so we actually have people do something altruistic
 and do something fun 
 and contrast it and what you find is when you do something fun  it has a square wave walk set when you do something philanthropic to help another person 
 it lasts and it lasts 
 so those are examples of positive
 interventions  so the next to last thing i want to say
  interested in how much life satisfaction people have this is really what you 're about 
 and that 's our target variable  and we ask the question as a function of the three different lives  how much life satisfaction do you get  
 so we ask and we 've done this in fifteen replications involving
 thousands of people to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure the pursuit of positive emotion
  the pleasant life the pursuit of engagement time stopping for you and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction 
 and our results surprised us  they were backward of what we thought  it turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution
 to life satisfaction the pursuit of meaning is the strongest   the pursuit of engagement is also very strong 
 where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement
 and you have meaning then pleasure 's the whipped cream and the cherry which is to say the full life the sum is greater than
 than the parts  if you 've got all three conversely if you have none of the three the empty life the sum is less than the parts 
 and what we 're asking now is does the very same relationship
  physical health morbidity how long you live and productivity follow the same relationship that is is in a corporation is
 productivity a function of positive emotion  engagement and meaning is health a function of positive engagement 
 of pleasure and of meaning in life and there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be
  the last speaker had a chance to
 try to integrate what he heard and so this was amazing for me i 've never been
 in a gathering like this  
 i 've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much which was one of the remarkable things 
 but i found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology  entertainment and design
 in the following way  we all know that technology  entertainment and design have been and can be used for
 destructive purposes  we also know that technology entertainment and design
 can be used to relieve misery and by the way the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important
  i thought when i first became a therapist thirty years ago  that if i 
 good enough to make someone not depressed not anxious not angry  that i 'd make them happy  
 and i never found that i found the best you could ever do was to get to zero  
 that they were empty  and it turns out the skills of happiness the skills
 of the pleasant life the skills of engagement the skills of meaning are
 different from the skills of relieving misery and so the parallel thing
 holds with technology  entertainment and design i believe that is  it is possible
 for these three drivers of our world to increase
 to increase positive emotion  and that 's typically how they 've been used but once you fractionate happiness the way i do
 not just positive emotion that 's not nearly enough
 there 's flow in life and there 's meaning in life as laura lee told us design and i believe  entertainment and
  can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well  so in conclusion
  the eleventh reason for optimism in addition to
 to the space elevator is that i think
 with technology entertainment and design we can actually increase
 the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet  and if
  in the next decade or two increase the pleasant life the good life and the meaningful life  it will be good enough  if entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion  
 meaning
 eudaemonia it will be good enough  and if design
 can increase positive emotion
  and flow and meaning what we 're all doing together will become good enough  thank you
