  once upon a time we lived in an economy of financial growth and prosperity  
 this was called the great moderation  the misguided belief by most economists
 central banks that we have transformed into a new world of
 growth and prosperity  this was seen by robust and steady gdp growth by low and controlled inflation 
 by low unemployment and controlled and low financial volatility
 recession in two thousand and seven and two thousand and eight the great crash  broke this illusion
 a few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector cascaded into
 five trillion dollars of losses in world gdp and almost $
  great recession
 was that
 this was completely surprising this came out of the blue this was like the wrath of the gods  
 there was no responsibility so as a reflection of this we started the financial crisis observatory we had the goal to
 diagnose in real time financial bubbles
 and identify in advance their critical time 
 what is the underpinning scientifically of this financial observatory  we developed a theory called
  are special  
 they are outliers  they are generated by specific mechanisms that may make them predictable  
 perhaps controllable  
 consider the financial price
 time series a given stock your perfect stock or a global index
  very good measure of the risk of this financial market is the peaks to valleys that represent a worst case scenario
 when you bought at the top and sold at the bottom you can look at the statistics the frequency of the occurrence
 of peak to valleys of different sizes which is represented in this graph now
  be represented by a universal power law represented by this
 red line here more interestingly  there are outliers  there are exceptions
 which are above this red line occur one hundred times more frequently at least  than the extrapolation would predict them to
  they are due to
 trenchant dependancies
 such that a loss is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss
 these kinds of dependencies are largely missed
 by standard risk management tools which ignore them and see lizards
  should see dragon kings 
 the root mechanism of a dragon king is a slow maturation towards instability which is the bubble  and the climax of the bubble is often the crash  
 this is similar to the slow heating of water in this test tube
  reaching the boiling point where the instability of the water occurs and you have the phase transition to vapor 
 and this process  which is absolutely non linear cannot be predicted by standard techniques
 is the reflection of a collective emergent behavior which is fundamentally endogenous  so the the cause of the crash the cause of the crisis has to 
  be found in an inner instability of the system and any tiny perturbation will make this instability
  occur 
 now  some of you may have come to the mind that is this not related to the black swan concept you have heard about frequently
  remember black swan is this rare bird that you see once and suddenly shattered your belief that all
 swans should be white 
  captured the idea of
 unpredictability  unknowability that the extreme events are fundamentally unknowable  
 nothing can be further from the  dragon king concept i propose which is exactly the opposite that most extreme events are actually knowable and predictable  
 so we can be empowered and take responsibility and make predictions about them  so let 's
  are many early warning signals that are predicted by this theory let me just focus on one of them the 
  growth with positive feedback  what does it mean  imagine you have an investment that returns the first year five percent 
 the second year ten percent the third year twenty percent 
  exponential growth corresponds to a constant growth rate let 's say of ten percent
 the point is that many times during bubbles  there are positive feedbacks which can be of many times such that
 previous growths enhance  push forward  increase the next growth
  growth which is very trenchant not sustainable  and the key idea is that the mathematical solution of this class of models
 exhibit finite time singularities which means
 that there is a critical time where the system will break will change regime  it may be a crash  it may be just a plateau something else  and the key idea is that the critical time 
  the information about the critical time is contained in the early development of this super exponential growth  
 we have applied this theory early on that was our first success to the diagnostic of the rupture of key elements on the iron rocket  
 using acoustic emission you know this little noise that you hear a structure emit sing to you when they are stressed  and
  a collective phenomenon of positive feedback the more damage gives the more damage so you can actually predict 
 within of course a probability band when the rupture will occur so this is now so successful that it is used in the initial phase of [ unclear ] the flight  
 perhaps more surprisingly the same type of theory applies to biology and medicine  
  the act of giving birth  epileptic seizures from seven months of pregnancy a mother starts to feel episodic
 precursory contractions of the uterus
 that are the sign
 of these maturations toward the instability giving birth to the baby the
 dragon king so if you measure the precursor
  epileptic seizures
 also come in a large variety of size and when the brain goes to
 a super critical state you have dragon kings which have a degree of predictability and this can help the patient to deal with this illness  
 we have applied this theory to many systems landslides  glacier collapse
 the dynamics of prediction of success  blockbusters  youtube videos movies  and so on  
 but perhaps the most important application is for finance 
 and this theory illuminates i believe the deep reason for the financial crisis that we have gone through this is rooted
  followed by many other bubbles the biggest one was the new economy internet bubble in two thousand  crashing in two thousand  the real estate bubbles in many countries financial derivative 
  bubbles everywhere  stock market bubbles also everywhere  commodity and all bubbles
 a global bubble  this is a measure of global overvaluation
 of all markets  expressing what i call an illusion of a perpetual money machine
 that suddenly broke in two thousand and seven  the problem is that we see
  in particular through quantitative easing of a thinking of a perpetual money machine nowadays
 to tackle the crisis since two thousand and eight in the u s in europe in japan  
 this has very important implications to understand the failure of quantitative easing as well as austerity measures as long as we don 't attack the
  the structural cause of this perpetual money machine thinking now  these are big claims  why would you believe me 
 well perhaps because in the last fifteen years
 we have come out of our ivory tower  and started to publish ex ante and i stress the term ex ante it means in advance before the crash confirmed
 the existence of the bubble or the financial excesses  these are a few
 of the major bubbles that we have lived through in recent history 
 again many interesting stories for each of them let me tell you just one or two
 stories that deal with massive bubbles  we all know the chinese miracle  this is the expression of the stock market of a
  a factor of three
 three hundred percent in just a few years in september two thousand and seven i was invited as a keynote speaker of a macro hedge fund
 management conference and i showed to the conference a prediction
 that by the end of two thousand and seven  this bubble would change regime  there might be a crash
  how do you believe
 the very smart very motivated very informed macro hedge fund managers
 reacted to this prediction you know they had made billions just surfing this bubble until now  
 they told me didier yeah  the market might be overvalued  but you forget
  the beijing olympic games coming in august two thousand and eight and it 's very clear that the chinese government is controlling the economy and doing what it takes to also
 avoid any wave and control the stock market three weeks after my presentation the markets lost twenty percent
 and went through a phase of volatility  
 upheaval  and a total market loss of seventy percent until the end of the year so how can we be so collectively wrong by
 misreading or ignoring the science
 of the fact that when an instability has developed and the system is ripe any perturbation makes it essentially impossible to control 
 the chinese market
 collapsed  but it rebounded 
 in two thousand and nine  we also identified that this new bubble a smaller one was unsustainable so
  published again a prediction in advance  stating that by august two thousand and nine  the market will correct will not continue on this track 
 our critics reading the prediction  said 
 no it 's not possible the chinese government is there they have learned their lesson 
 they will control  they want to benefit from the growth perhaps these critics have not learned their
 previously  so the crisis did occur  the market corrected the same critics then said ah 
 yes but you published your prediction you influenced the market it was not a prediction 
 maybe i am very powerful then now  this is interesting
  it shows that it 's essentially impossible until now to develop a science of economics because we are sentient beings who anticipate and there is a problem of  self fulfilling prophesies  
 so we invented a new way of doing science we created the financial bubble experiment the idea is the following we monitor the markets  
 we identify excesses bubbles
  we do our work  we write a report
 in which we put our prediction of the critical time we don 't release the report it 's kept secret  but with modern encrypting
 encrypting techniques we have a hash  we publish a public key and six months later  
 we release the report and there is authentication 
 and all this is done on an international
 archive so that we cannot be
  accused of just releasing the successes  let me tease you
 with a very recent analysis 17th of may two thousand and thirteen just two weeks ago  we identified that the u s stock market was on an unsustainable path
 and we released this on our website on the 21st of may that there will be a change of regime  the next day  the market started to change regime
  is not a crash  this is just the third or fourth act of a massive bubble in the making  
 scaling up the discussion at the size of the planet we see the same thing wherever we we look it 's observable in the biosphere 
 in the atmosphere in the ocean showing these
 trajectories characterizing an unsustainable path and announcing a phase transition
 this diagram on the right shows a very beautiful compilation of studies suggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear possibility for a nonlinear
 transition just in the next few decades  so there are bubbles everywhere  
 from one side this is exciting for me  as a professor who chases bubbles and slays dragons as the media has sometimes called
  me  but can we really slay the dragons  very recently with collaborators  we studied a
 dynamical system where you see the dragon king as these big loops
 and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times
 that removed when control is on  these dragons
  the case that this is probably one of the biggest gaps of mankind which has the responsibility to steer
 our societies and our planet toward sustainability in the face of growing
  we learn that most systems have pockets of predictability it is possible to develop advance diagnostics of crises so
 that we can be prepared  we can take measures we can take responsibility 
 and so that never again will extremes and crises like the great recession
 or the european
  crisis take us by surprise  thank you
