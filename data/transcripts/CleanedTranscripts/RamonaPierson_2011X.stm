  i 'm actually going to share something with you i haven 't talked about probably in more than ten years  so bear with me as i take you through this journey 
 when i was twenty two years old i came home from work
  put a leash on my dog and went for my usual run  
 i had no idea that at that moment my life was going to change forever while i was preparing my dog for the run 
 a man was finishing drinking at a bar  picked up his car keys got into a car and
 headed south or wherever he was i was running across the street and the only thing that i
 i actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head  and i remember putting my hands on the ground
 and feeling my life 's blood emptying out of my neck
 and my mouth  
 what had happened is he ran a red light and hit me and my dog  she ended up underneath the car 
 i flew out in front of the car and then he ran over my legs my left leg got caught up in the wheel well spun it around
 the bumper of the car hit my throat slicing it open 
 i ended up with blunt chest trauma your aorta comes up behind your heart it 's your major artery and
 it was severed so my my blood was gurgling out of my mouth it foamed and horrible things were happening to me
  i had no idea what was going on but strangers intervened  
 kept my heart moving  beating  i say moving because it was quivering and they were trying to put a beat back into it 
 somebody was smart and put a bic pen in my neck
 to open up my airway so i could get some air in there and
 my lung collapsed so somebody cut me open and put a pen in there as well to
  to stop that catastrophic event from happening 
 somehow i ended up at the hospital i was wrapped in ice  and then eventually put into a drug induced coma  
 eighteen months later i woke up i was blind i couldn 't speak and i
  the hospital really has no idea what to do with people like that and in fact they started to call me a gomer 
 that 's another story we won 't even get into 
 i had so many surgeries to put my neck back together to repair my heart a few times some things worked some things didn 't i
 had lots of titanium put in me cadaver bones to try to
  get my feet moving the right way  
 and i ended up with a plastic nose porcelain teeth and all kinds of other things but eventually i started to look human again  
 but
 it 's hard sometimes to talk about these things so bear with me  
 i had more than fifty surgeries  but who 's counting
  so eventually the hospital decided it was time for me to go they needed to open up space for somebody else that they thought could
 could come back from whatever
 they were going through  everybody lost faith in me being able to recover  
 so they basically put a map up on the wall threw a dart and it landed at a senior home here in colorado  
  all of you are scratching your head a senior citizens ' home what in the world are you going to do there but if you think about all of the skills and talent that are in this room right now 
 that 's what a senior home has  so there were all these skills and talents that these seniors had 
 the one advantage they had over most of you is wisdom
 because they had a long life  
 and i needed that wisdom at that moment in my life  but imagine what it was like for them when i showed up at their doorstep 
 at that point i had gained four pounds so i was sixty eight pounds  
 i was bald  i was wearing hospital scrubs and somebody donated tennis shoes for me and
 i had a white cane in one hand and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand so the senior citizens realized
 that they needed to have an emergency meeting 
 so they pulled back and they were looking at each other and they were going ok  
 what skills do we have in this room this kid needs a lot of work so
 they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs
  but one of the first things they needed to do was assess what i needed right away i needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being since i 'd been eating through
 a tube in my chest and and through my veins so i had to go through
 trying to to eat again and they went through that process  
 and then they had to figure out well  she needs furniture she is sleeping in the corner of this apartment
  they went to their storage lockers and all gathered their extra furniture gave me pots and pans blankets
 everything  and then then the next thing that i needed was
 a makeover 
 so out went the green scrubs and in came the polyester and floral prints we
  not going to talk about the hairstyles they tried to force on me once my hair grew back but i did say no to the blue hair 
 so eventually  what went on is 
 they decided that well i need to learn to speak you can 't be an independent person if you 're not able to speak and you can 't see  
 so they figured not being able to see is one
  but they need to get me to talk so while sally the office manager was teaching me to speak in the day it 's hard because
 when you 're a kid you take things for granted you learn things unconsciously but for me i was an adult and it was embarrassing and i had to learn how to coordinate my
 new throat with my tongue and my
 new teeth and my lips and capture the air and get the word out so i acted like a
 but the men had a better idea they were going to make it fun for me  
 so they were teaching me cuss word scrabble at night 
 laughter and then secretly how to swear like a sailor laughter
 i 'm going to just leave it to your imagination
 as to what my first words were
 when sally finally got my confidence built 
 so i moved on from there and a former teacher who happened to have alzheimer 's took on the task of teaching me to write 
 the redundancy was actually good for me
  one of the pivotal times for me was actually learning to cross the street again
 as a blind person  so close your eyes 
 now imagine you have to cross a street you don 't know how far that street is 
 and you don 't know if you 're
 going straight
  and you hear cars whizzing back and forth  
 and you had a horrible accident that landed you in this situation  so there were two obstacles i had to get through 
 one was post traumatic stress disorder 
 every time i approached the the corner or the curb i would panic and the second one was
 was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street  so one of the seniors
 just came up to me and she pushed me up to the
  corner and said when you think it 's time to go just stick the cane out there if it 's hit don 't cross the street 
 laughter made perfect sense 
 but by the third cane that went whizzing across the road 
 they realized that they needed to put their resources together  and they raised funds  so that i could
  go to the braille institute and actually gain the skills to be
 a blind person  and also to go get a guide dog who transformed my life  and i was able to return to college because of
 the senior citizens who invested in me and also the guide dog and skill set i had gained ten years later i gained my sight back not magically
  in for three surgeries and one of them was experimental it was actually robotic surgery that removed a hematoma from behind my eye  
 the biggest change for me was that the world moved forward 
 that there were innovations and all kinds of new things cellphones
  all these things that i had never seen before and as a blind person your visual memory fades  
 and is replaced with how you feel about things and
 and how things sound and how things smell  
 so one day i was in my room and i saw this thing sitting in my room i thought it was a monster so i was walking around it 
 and i go i 'm just going to touch it and i touched it and i went
 everything is different
 when you 're a sighted person  because you take that for granted but when you 're blind you have the tactile memory for things 
 the biggest change for me was looking down at my hands and seeing that i 'd lost ten years of my life
  i thought that time had stood still for some
  reason and moved on for family and friends but when i looked down i realized that time marched on for me too and that i needed to get caught up so i got got going on it 
 we didn 't have words like crowdsourcing and radical collaboration when i had my accident but the concept held true people working with people to rebuild me people working with people to reeducate me  
 i wouldn 't be standing here today if it wasn 't for extreme radical collaboration thank you so much
