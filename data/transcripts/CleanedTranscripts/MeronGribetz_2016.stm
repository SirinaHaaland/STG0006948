  today 's computers are so amazing
 that we fail to notice how terrible
 they really are i
 'd like to talk to you today about this problem and how we can fix it with neuroscience first i 'd like to take you back to a frosty
  night in harlem in two thousand and eleven that had a profound impact on me 
 i was sitting in a dive bar outside of columbia university  where i studied computer science and neuroscience  
 and i was having this great conversation with a fellow student about the power of holograms to one day replace computers 
 and just as we were getting to the best part of the conversation
  of course his phone lights up
  and he pulls it towards himself and he looks down and he starts typing  
 and then he forces his eyeballs back up to mine and he goes keep going i 'm with you 
 but of course his eyes were glazed over and the moment was dead  
 meanwhile across the bar i noticed another student holding his phone this time towards a group he was swiping through pictures on instagram  and these kids were laughing hysterically  
 and that dichotomy between how crappy i
  was feeling and how happy they were feeling about the same technology really got me thinking  
 and the more i thought of it the more i realized it was clearly not the digital information that was the bad guy here 
 it was simply the display position that was separating me from my friend and that was binding those kids together 
 see they were connected around something just like our ancestors who evolved their social cognitions telling stories around the campfire
 and that 's exactly what tools should do i think they should extend our bodies and i think computers today are doing quite the opposite  
 whether you 're sending an email to your wife or you 're composing a symphony or just consoling a friend you 're doing it in pretty much the same way you 're hunched over these rectangles fumbling with buttons and menus
  and i think this is the wrong way i think we can start using a much more natural machine  we should use machines that bring our work back into the world we
 should use machines that use the principles of neuroscience to extend our senses versus going against them  
 now it just so happens that i have such a machine here it 's called the meta two  let 's try
  now in front of me right now i can see the audience  and i can see my very hands 
 and in three two one we 're going to see an immersive hologram appear a very realistic hologram appear in front of me of our very glasses i 'm wearing on my head right now 
  and of course this could be anything that we 're shopping for or learning from  and i can use my hands to very nicely kind of move it around
  around with fine control  and i think iron man would be proud  
 we 're going to come back to this in just a bit 
 now if you 're anything like me your mind is already reeling with the possibilities of what we can do with this kind of technology so let 's look at a few  my mom is an architect
  naturally the first thing i imagined was
 laying out a building in 3d space instead of having to use these 2d floor plans  she 's actually touching graphics right now and selecting an interior decor this was all shot through a gopro through our very glasses 
 and this next use case is very personal to me it 's professor adam gazzaley 's glass brain project courtesy of 
  as a neuroscience student i would always fantasize about the ability to to learn and memorize these
 complex brain structures with an actual machine where i could touch and
 play with the various brain structures now what you 're seeing is called augmented reality  but to me it 's part of a much more important story
 a story of how we can begin to extend our bodies with
 digital devices  instead of the other way around now
  in the next few years humanity 's going to go through a shift i think we 're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world 
 just imagine for a moment what this could mean for storytellers for painters for brain surgeons for interior decorators and maybe for all of us here today
  and what i think we need to do as a community is really try and make an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends the human experience instead 
  of gamifying our reality or cluttering it with digital information and that 's what i 'm very passionate about 
  much about which phone we buy in terms of the hardware we buy it for the operating system as a neuroscientist i always dreamt of building the ios of the mind if you will 
 and it 's very very important that we get this right because we might be living inside of these things for at least as long as we 've lived with the windows graphical user interface  
 and i don 't know about you but living inside of windows scares me
 to isolate the single most intuitive interface out of infinity we use neuroscience to drive our design guidelines instead of letting a bunch of designers fight it out in the boardroom  
 and
 the principle we all revolve around is what 's called the neural path of least resistance 
 at every turn we 're connecting the ios of the brain with our brain on for the first time our brain 's terms in other words
  we 're trying to create a zero learning curve computer  we 're building a system that you 've always known how to use
 here are the first three design guidelines that we employ in this  brand new form of user experience first and foremost you are the operating system  
 traditional file systems are complex and abstract and they take your brain extra steps to decode them  we 're going against the neural path of least resistance
  reality you can of course place your holographic ted panel over here  and your holographic email on the other side of the desk  and 
 your spatial memory evolved just fine to go ahead and retrieve them you could put your holographic tesla that you 're shopping for or whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show 
  get it back the second interface guideline we call touch to see 
 what do babies do when they see something that grabs their interest they try and reach out and touch it and that 's exactly how the natural machine should work as well  
 turns out the visual system gets a fundamental boost from a sense we call proprioception that 's the sense of our body parts in space so by touching our work directly
  to control it better we 're also going to understand it much more deeply 
 hence touch to see 
 but it 's not enough to experience things ourselves we 're inherently these social primates  
 and this leads me to our third guideline the holographic campfire from our first story 
 our  mirror neuron subsystem suggests that we can connect with each other and with our work much better if we can see each other 's faces and hands in
  so if you look at the video behind me you can see two meta users playing around with the same hologram making eye contact connected around this thing  instead of being distracted by external devices 
 let 's go ahead and and try this again with neuroscience in mind  
 so again our favorite interface the ios of the mind
  i 'm going to now take a step further and go ahead and grab this
 pair of glasses and leave it right here by the desk  i 'm now with you i 'm in the moment we 're connecting 
 my spatial memory kicks in and i can go ahead and grab it and bring it right back here reminding me that i am the operating system  
 and now my proprioception is working  and i can go ahead and explode these glasses into a thousand parts and touch the very sensor that
  is currently scanning my hand but it 's not enough to see things alone so in a second my co founder ray is going to make a 3d call ray 
 ringing hey ray how 's it going guys  i can see this guy in front me in full
  long ray  how 's it going  ray great we 're live today mg ray give
 the crowd a gift of the holographic brain we saw from the video earlier  guys  this is not only going to change phones it 's also going to change the way we collaborate  
 thank you so much  thanks ray ray you 're welcome mg 
  this is the message that i discovered in that bar in two thousand and eleven the future of computers is not locked inside one of these screens 
 it 's right here inside of us so if there 's one idea
 that i could leave you with here today it 's that the natural machine is not some figment of the future it 's right here in two thousand and sixteen 
 which is why all
  hundred of us at meta including the administrative staff the executives the designers the engineers before 
 're all going to be throwing away our external monitors and replacing them with a truly and profoundly more natural machine  thank you very much
  so help me out on on one thing because
 there 've been a few augmented reality demos shown over the last year or so out there and there 's sometimes a debate among technologists about are we really 
  seeing the real thing  on screen there 's this issue of field of view that somehow
  would actually see
 wearing the glasses 
 were we seeing the real deal there mg absolutely the real deal not only that we took extra measures to shoot it with a gopro through the actual lens in the various videos that you 've seen here  we 
  want to try to simulate the experience for the world that we 're actually seeing through the glasses and not cut any corners ca thank you so much
