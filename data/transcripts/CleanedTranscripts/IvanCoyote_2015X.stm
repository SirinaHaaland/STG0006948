  few things that
 all of us need we all need
 air to breathe  we need clean water to drink  we need food to eat we need shelter and love you know love is great
  and we all need a safe place to pee 
 yeah as a trans person who doesn 't fit neatly into the gender binary if i could change the world tomorrow
 to make it easier for me to navigate the very first thing i would do is blink and create single
  trans people and trans issues they 've been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately and this is a great and necessary thing but most of that attention has been focused on a very few individuals
  most of whom are kinda rich
 and pretty famous  and probably don 't have to worry that much anymore about where they 're going to pee in between classes at their community college 
 or where they 're going to get changed into their gym strip at their public high school  fame and money
 insulates these television star trans people from most of the everyday challenges that the rest of us have to tackle on a daily basis
  public bathrooms they 've been a problem for me since as far back as i can remember first when i was just a little
 baby tomboy and then later as a
  am most likely to be questioned or harassed  
 i 've often been verbally attacked behind their doors i 've been hauled out by security guards with my pants still halfway pulled up  
 i 've been stared at screamed at whispered about and one time
 i got smacked in the face by a little old lady 's purse that from the
  looks of the shiner i took home that day i am pretty certain contained at least seventy dollars of rolled up small change and a large hard candy collection 
 laughter and i know what some of you are thinking  
 and you 're mostly right  i can and do just use the men 's room
 most of the time these days  
 but that doesn 't solve my change room dilemmas does it
  have to use the men 's room because i 'm not a man  i 'm a trans person and now we 've got these
  fearmongering politicians that keep trying to pass these bathroom bills have you heard about these they try to legislate to try and force people like myself to use the bathroom
 that they deem most appropriate
 according to the gender i was
  assigned at birth and if if these politicians ever get their way 
 in arizona or california or florida or just last week in houston texas or ottawa  
 well then using the men 's room will not be a legal option for me either  
 and every time one of these politicians brings one of these bills to the table i can 't help but wonder you know just
 who will and exactly how would we go about enforcing laws like these right panty checks really
  genital inspections outside of
 bath change rooms at public pools there 's no legal or ethical or plausible way to
 to enforce laws like these anyway
  exist only to foster fear and promote transphobia 
 they don 't make anyone safer 
 but they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us 
 and meanwhile our trans children suffer they drop out of school or they opt out of
  additional challenges when accessing pools and and gyms  but also universities  
 hospitals  libraries  
 don 't even get me started
 on how they treat us in airports  if we don 't move now
 to make sure that these places are truly open and
  accessible to everyone then we just need to get honest
 and quit calling them public places  we need to just admit
 that they are really only open for people who fit neatly
 into one of two gender boxes  which i do not 
 i never have
 and this starts very early  i know a little girl she 's the daughter of a friend of mine  she 's 
 tomboy  
 i 'm talking about cowboy boots and caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars the whole nine yards one time i asked her what her favorite color was she told me
 so that awesome little kid  she came home from school last october from her half day of preschool 
 with soggy pants on because the other kids at school were harassing her when she tried to use the girls ' bathroom  
  and she had drank two glasses of that red juice at the halloween party  and i mean who can resist that red juice right it 's so good  
 and she couldn 't hold her pee any longer her and
 her classmates were four years old they already felt empowered enough
 to police her use of
  she was four years old she had already
 been taught the brutal lesson that there was no bathroom door at preschool with a sign on it that welcomed people like her 
 she 'd already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem 
 and that problem started with her
 and was hers alone
  so my friend asked me to talk to her little daughter  and i did  i wanted to tell her
 that me and her mom were going to march on down and talk to that school and the problem was going to go away but i knew that wasn 't true i wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got older but i couldn
  so i asked her to tell me the story of what had happened 
 asked her to tell me how it made her feel mad
 and sad she told me so i told her that she wasn 't alone
 and that it wasn 't right what had happened to her and then she asked me if i had ever peed in my pants before  i said yes
  i had but not for a really long time which of course was a lie  because you know how you hit like 
  and sometimes you just i don 't know you pee a little bit when you cough or sneeze when you 're running upstairs or you 're stretching don 't lie it happens  
  i told her when you get older your bladder is going to
 grow bigger too 
 when you get old like me you 're going to be able to hold your pee for for way longer  i promised her 
 until you can get home she asked me  i said
  until you can get home 
 she seemed to take some comfort in that 
 so
 let 's just build some single stall gender neutral bathrooms with a little bench for getting changed into your gym clothes 
 we can 't change the world overnight
 for our children but we can give them a safe
  and private place to escape that world if only for just a minute this we can do 
 so let 's just do it  
 and if you are one of those people who is sitting out there right now already coming up with a list of reasons in your head why this is not a priority or it 's too expensive 
 or telling yourself that giving a trans person a
  safe place to pee or get changed in
 supports a lifestyle choice that you feel offends your morality or your masculinity 
 or your religious beliefs then let me just appeal to the part of your heart that probably hopefully  
 does care about the rest of the population  
 if you can 't bring yourself
  to care enough about people like me then what about women and girls with
 body image issues what about anyone with body image stuff going on
 what about that boy at school who is a foot shorter than his classmates whose voice still hasn 't dropped yet hey
  eight  what a cruel master you can be right 
 what about people with anxiety issues  
 what about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there what about folks with bodies who for whatever reason don 't fit into the mainstream idea of what a body should look like how many of us
 still feel shy or
  afraid to disrobe in front of our peers  and how many of us allow that fear to keep us from something as important as physical
 exercise 
 would all those people not benefit from these single stall
  but we can give everybody a place to get changed in so that we can all get to work
 making the world safer for all of us  thank you for listening
