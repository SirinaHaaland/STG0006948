  i 'm thrilled to be here tonight to share with you something we 've been working on for over two years  
 and it 's in the area of additive manufacturing also known as 3d printing 
 you see this object here it looks fairly simple but it 's quite complex at the same time
  it 's a set of concentric geodesic structures
 with linkages between each one 
 in its context  it is not manufacturable by traditional manufacturing techniques  
 it has a symmetry such that you can 't injection mold it 
 you can 't even manufacture it
  this is a job for a 3d printer but most 3d printers would take between three and ten hours to fabricate it  and we 're going to take the risk tonight
 to try to fabricate it onstage during this 10 minute talk  wish us luck 
 now 3d printing is actually a misnomer it 's actually 2d printing over and over again 
 and it in fact uses the technologies associated with
  think about inkjet printing where you lay down ink on a page
 to make letters and then do that over and over again to build up a three dimensional object  
 in microelectronics they use something called lithography to do the same sort of thing to make the transistors and integrated circuits and build up a structure
 several times these are all 2d printing
  'm a chemist a material scientist too  and my co inventors are also material scientists one a chemist one a physicist  
 and we began to be interested in 3d printing 
 and very often as you know new ideas
 are often simple connections between people with different experiences in different communities  and that 's our story 
  operate in this fashion where you have an object arise out of a puddle
 in essentially real time
 with essentially no waste to make a great object okay just like the movies and could we be
 inspired by hollywood and come
  up with ways to actually try to get this to work and that was our challenge  
 and our approach would be if we could do this then we could fundamentally address the three issues holding back 3d printing from being a manufacturing process 
 one 3d printing takes forever 
 there are mushrooms that grow faster
  the layer by layer process
 leads to defects in mechanical properties and if we could grow continuously we could eliminate those defects and
 in fact if we could grow really fast  we could also start using materials
 that are  self curing and we could have amazing properties so if we could pull this off imitate hollywood we could in fact address
 our approach is to use some standard knowledge in polymer chemistry
 to harness light and oxygen
 to grow parts continuously 
 light and oxygen work in different ways light can take a resin and convert it to a solid can convert a liquid to a solid 
 oxygen inhibits that process
  so light and oxygen are polar opposites from one another
 from a chemical point of view  
 and if we can control spatially the light and oxygen we could control this process  and we refer to this as clip [ continuous liquid interface production ]
 it has three functional components one  it has a reservoir
 that holds the puddle just like the t 1000 at the bottom of
  the reservoir is a special window i 'll come back to that 
 in addition it has a stage that will lower into the puddle and pull the object out of the liquid  the third component
 is a digital light projection system
 underneath the reservoir illuminating with light in the ultraviolet region now the key is that this window in the bottom of this reservoir
  's not only transparent to light but it 's permeable to oxygen it 's got characteristics like a contact lens 
 so we can see how the process works you can start to see that as you lower a stage in there in a traditional process with 
  window  you make a two dimensional pattern
  and you end up gluing that onto the window with a traditional window  and so in order to introduce the next layer you have to separate it introduce new resin 
 reposition it and do this process over and over again  
 but with our very special window  what we 're able to do is with oxygen coming through the bottom as light hits it 
 that oxygen inhibits the reaction  and we form a dead zone this dead zone is on the order of tens of microns thick
 that 's two or three diameters of a red blood cell right at the window interface that remains a liquid  and we pull this object up 
 and as we talked about in a science paper as we change the oxygen content we can change the dead zone thickness  
 and so we have a number of key variables that we control oxygen content the light the light intensity the dose to cure the viscosity the geometry  and we use very
  sophisticated software to control this process  the result is pretty staggering
 to one hundred times faster than traditional 3d printers
  which is  game changing in addition  as our ability to deliver liquid to that interface 
 we can go one thousand times faster i believe  
 and that in fact opens up the opportunity for generating a lot of
  and as a chemical engineer i get very excited at heat transfer and the idea that we might one day have 
  printers because they 're going so fast 
 in addition because we 're growing things we eliminate the layers 
 and the parts are monolithic  you don 't see the surface structure you have molecularly smooth surfaces
  and the mechanical properties of most parts made in a 3d printer
 are notorious for having properties that depend on the orientation with which how you printed it because of the layer like structure  but when you grow objects like this 
 the properties are invariant with the print direction  these look like 
 parts which is very different than traditional 3d manufacturing
  we 're able to throw the entire polymer chemistry textbook at this  and we 're able to design chemistries that can give rise to the properties you really want
 in a 3d printed object there it is that 's great 
 you always take the risk that something like this won 't work onstage right 
  have materials with great mechanical properties for the first time we can have elastomers that are high elasticity or high dampening  think about vibration control or great sneakers for example 
 we can make materials that have incredible strength
 high strength to weight ratio really strong materials
 really great elastomers so throw that
 in the audience there so great material properties  and so the opportunity now if you actually make a part
 that has the properties to be a final part and you do it in  game changing speeds  you can actually transform manufacturing 
 right now in manufacturing  what happens is the so called digital thread in digital manufacturing we go from a cad drawing a design 
 to a prototype to manufacturing often
 digital thread is broken right at prototype because you can 't go all the way to manufacturing because most parts don 't have the properties to be a final part 
 we now can connect the digital thread
 all the way from design to prototyping to manufacturing
 and that opportunity really opens up all sorts of things from
 better fuel efficient cars dealing with great lattice properties with high strength to weight ratio  new turbine blades all sorts of wonderful things  
  about if you need a stent in an emergency situation instead of the doctor
 pulling off a stent out of the shelf that was just standard sizes having a stent that 's designed for you for your own anatomy
 with your own tributaries  printed in an emergency situation in real time out of the properties such that the stent could go away after eighteen months
  dentistry and making these kinds of structures
 even while you 're in the dentist chair 
 and look at the structures that my students are making at the university of north carolina  these are amazing microscale structures you know the world is really good at 
  moore 's law has driven things from ten microns and
  we 're really good at that but it 's actually very hard to make things from ten microns to one thousand microns the mesoscale 
 and subtractive techniques from the silicon industry can 't do that very well they can 't etch wafers that well  
 but this process is so gentle we can grow these objects up from the bottom using additive manufacturing
 and make amazing things in tens of seconds  opening up new sensor technologies  
  so the opportunity of making a part in real time that has the properties to be a final part
 really opens up 3d manufacturing and for us this is very exciting because this really is owning the intersection
 between hardware software and molecular science and i can 't wait to see what designers
  engineers around the world are going to be able to do with this great tool thanks for listening
