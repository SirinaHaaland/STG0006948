  charlotte blonsky who were a married couple living in the bronx in new york city  invented something they got a patent in
 to assist women
 in giving birth 
 this device consists of a large  round table and some machinery
  when the woman is ready to deliver her child she lies on her back she is strapped down to the table 
 and the table is rotated at high speed
  the child comes flying out through centrifugal force 
 if you look at their patent carefully
  especially if you have any engineering background or talent  you may decide that you see one or two points where the design is not
  doctor ivan schwab in california is one of the people one of the main people who helped answer the question why don 't
 woodpeckers get headaches 
 and it turns out the answer to that is because their brains are packaged inside their skulls in a way different from the way our brains we being human
  have our brains packaged 
 they the woodpeckers  typically will peck they will bang their head on a piece of wood thousands of times every day 
 every day  
 and as far as anyone knows that doesn 't bother them in the slightest how does this happen 
 their brain does not slosh around like ours does their brain is packed in very
  at least for blows coming right from the front 
 not too many people paid attention to this research until the last few years when 
 in this country especially people are becoming curious about what happens to the brains of football players who bang their heads repeatedly and
 the woodpecker
 maybe relates to that 
 there was a paper published in the medical journal the lancet in england a few years ago called a man who pricked his finger
 and smelled putrid for five years dr caroline mills and her team received this patient
 and didn 't really know what to do about it the man had cut his finger he worked processing chickens  
 and then he started to smell really really bad so bad that when he got in a room
 doctors and the nurses they couldn 't stand being in the room with him it was intolerable they tried every drug every other treatment they could think of after a year  he 
  still smelled putrid after two years still smelled putrid three years  four years  still smelled putrid  
 in new zealand dr lianne parkin and her team tested an old tradition in
  her city  they live in a city that has huge hills san francisco grade hills  and in the winter there it gets very cold and very icy there are lots of injuries 
 the tradition that they tested they tested by asking people who were on their way to work in the morning to stop and try something out 
 try one of two conditions
  the tradition is that
 in the winter in that city  you wear your socks on the outside of your boots and what they discovered by
 experiment and it was quite graphic when they saw it was that it 's true that if you wear your socks on the outside rather than the inside you 're much more likely
 to survive and not slip and fall  now i hope you will agree with me that
 these things i 've just described
  to you each of them deserves some kind of prize 
 and that 's what they got each of them got an ig nobel prize in 
 i together with bunch of other people started the ig nobel prize ceremony  every year we give
  it 's that you 've done something that makes people laugh and then think what you 've done makes people laugh
 and then think  whatever it is there 's something about it that when
 people encounter it at first their only possible reaction is to laugh and then a week later it 's still rattling around
  in their heads and all they want to do is tell their friends about it that 's the quality we look for every year we get
 in the neighborhood of nine thousand new nominations for the ig nobel prize of those  consistently between ten percent and twenty percent
 of those nominations are people who nominate
  it 's very difficult numerically to win a prize
 if you want to
 even if you don 't want to it 's very difficult numerically  
 you should know that when we choose somebody to win an ig nobel prize we get in touch with that person  very quietly  
 we offer them the chance to
  if they want to
 happily for us  almost everyone who 's offered a prize decides
 to accept 
 what do you get if you win an ig nobel prize  well  you get several things you get an ig nobel prize
  the design is different every year 
 these are always handmade
 from extremely
  you 're looking at a picture of the prize we gave last year  two thousand and thirteen
  most prizes in the world also give their winners some cash some money
 we don 't have any money so we can 't give them in fact the winners have to
 pay their own way to come to the ig nobel ceremony  
 which most of them do last year though we did manage to scrape up some money  last year  each
 of the ten ig nobel
  prize winners received from us
 ten trillion dollars a $ ten trillion  bill from zimbabwe 
 you may remember that zimbabwe had a little adventure for a few years there of inflation 
 they ended up printing bills that were in denominations as large as one hundred trillion dollars  the man responsible who runs the
  national bank there by the way won an ig nobel prize in mathematics the
 other thing you win is an invitation to come to the ceremony which happens at harvard university 
 and when you get there  you come to harvard 's biggest meeting place and classroom it fits one thousand one hundred people it 's jammed to the gills and up on the stage waiting to shake your hand waiting to hand you your ig 
  nobel prize are a bunch of nobel prize winners that 's the heart of the ceremony the winners are kept
  secret until that moment even the nobel laureates who will shake their hand don 't know who they are until they 're announced  
 i am going to tell you about just a very few of the other medical related prizes we 've given keep in mind we 've given two hundred and thirty prizes there are lots of these people who walk among you maybe you have one a
 paper was published about thirty years ago called injuries due to falling coconuts
  by dr peter barss who is canadian 
 dr barss came to the ceremony and explained that as a young doctor he wanted to see the world so he went to papua new guinea 
 when he got there he went to work in a hospital and he was curious what
 kinds of things happen to people that that bring them to the hospital he looked through the records
  and he discovered that
 a surprisingly large number of people in that hospital were there because of injuries due to falling coconuts 
 one typical thing that happens is people will come from the highlands where there are not many coconut trees down to visit their relatives on the coast where there are lots and they 'll think that 
  a coconut tree is a fine place to stand and maybe lie down a coconut tree that is ninety feet tall and has coconuts that weigh two pounds that can drop off at any time
  team of doctors in europe published a series of papers about colonoscopies  you 're all familiar with colonoscopies one way or another 
 or in some cases one way and another  
 they in these papers explained to their fellow doctors who perform colonoscopies
  how to minimize the chance that when you perform a colonoscopy your patient will explode 
  one of the authors  flew in from paris to the ceremony  where he explained the history of this 
  when colonoscopies were becoming a common
 technique for the first time people were figuring out how to do it well  and there were some difficulties at first
  basic problem i 'm sure you 're familiar with that
 you 're looking inside a long  narrow  dark place and so 
 you want to have a larger space you add some gas to inflate it so you have room to look around now that 's added to the gas the methane gas that 's already
  the gas that they used at first in many cases was oxygen so they added oxygen to methane gas  and then they wanted to be able to see they needed light so they 'd put in a light source  which in the 1950s was very hot  so you had
 methane gas which is flammable oxygen
 and heat  they stopped using oxygen pretty quickly 
 now it 's rare that
  final thing that i want to tell you about is a prize we gave to  dr elena bodnar 
 dr elena bodnar invented a brassiere that in an emergency can be quickly separated into a pair of protective face masks 
 one to save your life one to save the life of some lucky bystander
  why would someone do this you might wonder dr bodnar came to the ceremony and she explained that she grew up in ukraine she was one of the doctors who treated victims of 
  the chernobyl power plant meltdown  and they later discovered that a lot of the worst medical problems came from the particles people breathed in so she was always thinking after that about could there be some simple mask that was available everywhere
  when the unexpected happens years later she moved to america she had a baby one day she looked and on the floor her infant son had picked up her bra and had her bra
 on his face and that 's where the idea came from she came to the ig nobel ceremony with the first prototype of the bra and she demonstrated
