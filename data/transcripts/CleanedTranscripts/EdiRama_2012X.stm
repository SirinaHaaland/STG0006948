  in my previous life  i was an artist i still paint  i love art  i love the joy that color can give
 to our lives and to our communities  and i try to bring
  something of the artist in me in my politics  and i see
 part of my job today  the reason for being here  not
 just to campaign for my party  but for
  and the role it can play
 for the better in our lives 
 for eleven years  i was mayor of tirana our capital  
 we faced many challenges  art was part of the answer  
 and my name in the very beginning was linked with two things  
 demolition
 of illegal constructions in order to get public
  space back  and use of colors in order to revive the hope
 that had been lost in my city  
 but this use of colors was not just an artistic act rather  it was a form
 of political action
 in a context when the city budget i had available after being elected
 amounted to zero comma something 
 when we painted the first building by splashing a radiant orange
 on the somber gray
 of of a facade something unimaginable
 happened there was a traffic
  traffic jam
 and a crowd
 of people gathered as if it were the location of some spectacular accident 
 or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star  
 the french e u official
 in charge of the funding rushed to block the painting he screeched that he
  because the colors you have ordered do not meet european standards he replied 
 well i told him the surroundings do not meet european standards  
 even though this is not what
 we want  but we will choose the colors ourselves because this is exactly what we want
  and if you do not let us continue with our work  i will hold a press conference
 here  right now  right in this road  and we will tell people that you look to me
 just like the censors of the socialist realism era then
 he was kind of troubled  and asked me for a compromise
  but i told him no  i 'm sorry  compromise in colors is gray  and we have enough gray
 to last us a lifetime so
 it 's time for change 
 the rehabilitation of public spaces
 revived the feeling of belonging
 to
  city that people lost  the pride of people
 about their own place of living  and there were feelings that had been buried
 deep for years
 under the fury of the illegal  barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space and when colors came out
 everywhere a mood of change
 started transforming
 the spirit of people big noise raised up what is this what is happening what are colors doing to us 
 and we made a poll the most fascinating poll i 've seen in my life  we asked people
  and then the second question was do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue 
 to the first question sixty three percent of people said yes  we like it
 thirty seven said no we don 't like it but to the second question  half of them that didn 't like it  they wanted it to continue 
 so we noticed change people started to
  drop
 less litter in the streets for example started to pay taxes started
 to feel something they had forgotten  and beauty
 was acting
 as a guardsman where
 municipal police or the state itself were missing one day i remember walking
  along a street that had just been colored  and where we were in the process of planting trees  when i saw a shopkeeper
 and his wife putting a glass facade to their shop they had thrown the old shutter
 in the garbage collection place why
  what policemen you can see it for yourself there are colors streetlights new pavement
 with no potholes
  it 's beautiful  it 's safe and indeed  it was beauty that was giving people
 this feeling of being protected  and this was not a misplaced feeling  crime
 did fall  the freedom that was won in
  while the barbarism of the ' 90s brought about a loss of hope for the city  the paint on on the walls
 did not feed children  nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant  but it gave hope
 and light  and helped to make people see there could be a different way of doing things a different spirit
  different feel to our lives and that
 if we brought the same energy and hope to our politics  we could build a better life
 for each other and for our country  we removed one hundred
  only from the riverbanks  we demolished more than five thousand illegal buildings all over the city
  then
 everybody accepted it
 and all businessmen paid it regularly by means of open competitions  we managed
 to recruit in our administration many young people  and we thus managed to build a 
 public institution where men and women were equally represented
 international organizations
 have invested a lot in albania
 during these twenty years not all of it well spent when i told the world bank directors that i wanted
 them to finance
 a project to build a model reception hall for citizens precisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption
 they did not understand me but people were waiting in long queues
 under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer
 from two tiny windows
 of two metal kiosks  they were paying in order to skip the queue
  queue  the reply to their requests
 was met by a voice coming from this
 dark hole and on the other hand a mysterious hand coming out
 to take their documents
 while searching through
 old documents for the bribe
 we could change the invisible clerks
 within the kiosks  every week  but we could not change this corrupt practice i
 'm convinced i told a german official
 with the world bank that it would be impossible for them
 to be bribed if they worked in germany in a german administration
 just as i am convinced
 that if you put german officials from the german administration in those holes  they would be bribed
 just the same
  with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience it
 's about system it 's about organization it 's also about environment and respect  
 we removed the kiosks  we built
 the bright new reception hall that made people tirana citizens think they had traveled abroad when they entered
 to make
  requests we created an online system
 of control and so speeded up all the processes  we put the citizen first and
 not the clerks  the corruption
 in the state administration of countries like albania it 's not up to me to say also like greece can be
  fought only by modernization  reinventing the government by reinventing politics itself
 is the answer  and not reinventing people based on a ready made formula that the developed world often tries in vain to impose
  things have come to this point because politicians in general  but especially in our countries let 's face it think people are stupid  
 they take it for granted that come what may people have to follow them  
 while politics more and more fails to offer answers
 for
 their public concerns or the
 of the common people politics has come to resemble
 a cynical team game played by politicians while the public has been pushed aside
 as if sitting on the seats
 of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation
  seen from those stairs all politicians today seem the same  and politics has come
 to resemble
 a sport
 that inspires more aggressiveness and pessimism than social cohesion and the
  because he mobilized people as never before through the use of social networks  
 he did not know each and every one of them  but with an admirable ingenuity  he managed to transform them into activists by giving them all the
  possibility to hold in their hands the arguments and the instruments that each would need to campaign in his name by making his own campaign 
 i tweet  i love it  
 i
 love it because it lets me get the message out  but it also lets people
  get their messages to me this is politics not from top down  but from the bottom up and sideways  
 and allowing everybody 's voice to be heard is exactly what we need 
 politics is not just about leaders it 's not just about politicians and laws it is about how people think how they view the world around them how they use their time and their energy 
  when people say all politicians are the same  ask yourself if obama was the same as bush
 if franois hollande is the same as sarkozy  they are not 
 they are human beings with different views and different visions for the world 
 when people say nothing can change just stop and think
 what the world was like
 ten
  hundred years ago our world is defined by the pace of change  we can all change the world  i gave you
 a very small example
 of how one thing  the use of color can make change happen i want to make more change
 as prime minister of my country  but every single one of you
 can make change happen if you want to president roosevelt
  he said believe you can and you are halfway there
