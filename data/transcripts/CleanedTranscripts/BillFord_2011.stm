  by birth and by choice  i 've been involved with the auto industry my entire life  and for the past thirty years  i 've worked at ford motor company 
 and for most of those years  i worried about how am i going to
 sell more cars and trucks  
 but today i worry about what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks 
 what happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles  triples or even quadruples 
 my life is guided by two great passions and the first is automobiles  
 i literally grew up with the ford motor company  i thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest ford or lincoln and leave it in the driveway  
 and i decided about that time
  about age ten that it would be really cool if i was a test driver so
 my parents would go to dinner  they 'd sit down i 'd sneak out of the house i 'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway  and it was a blast and that went on for about two years  
 until i think i was about twelve my dad brought home a lincoln
  it was snowing that day  
 so he and mom went to dinner  and i snuck out and thought it 'd be really cool to do donuts or even some figure eights in the snow 
 my dad finished dinner early that evening and he was walking to the front hall and out the front door just about the same time i hit some ice
 and met him at the front door with the car
 and almost ended up in the front hall so it kind of cooled my test driving for a little while
  began to love cars then and my first car was a one thousand nine 
 mustang  and even though the color was pretty hideous i did love the car and it really cemented my love affair with cars that 's continued on to this day  
 but cars are really more than a passion of mine  they 're quite literally in my
  my great grandfather was henry ford and on my mother 's side my great grandfather was harvey firestone  so
 when i was born i guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me 
 but my great grandfather henry ford really believed that the mission of the ford motor company was to make people 's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them  
 because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress  
 and that 's a belief that i share
  share 
 my other great passion is the environment 
 and as a young boy i used to go up to northern michigan and fish in the rivers that hemingway fished in and then later wrote about and
 it really struck me as the years went by in a very negative way  when i would
  go to some stream that i 'd loved and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies  and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it 
 and so even at a young age that really resonated with me and the whole notion of environmental preservation 
 at a very basic level  sunk in with me as a high schooler i started to read authors like thoreau and aldo leopold and edward abbey  
 and i really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world
  but it never really occurred to me
 that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict
 with nature  and that was true until i got to college  
 and when i got to college  you can imagine my surprise when i would go to class and a number of my professors would say that ford motor company and my family was
 everything that was wrong
  with with our country they thought that
 we were more interested as an industry in profits rather than progress  and that we filled the skies with smog
 and frankly we were the enemy  i joined ford
 after college after some soul searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do  but i decided that i wanted to go and see if i could affect change there and
  as i look back over thirty years ago it was a little naive to think at that age that i could  but i wanted to and i really discovered that my professors weren 't completely wrong 
 in fact when i got back to detroit my environmental leanings weren 't exactly embraced by those in my own company and certainly by those in the industry  i had some
  very interesting conversations as you can imagine there were some
 within ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense
 should just disappear
 and that i needed to stop hanging out with environmental wackos 
 i was considered a radical and i 'll never forget the day i was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists
  intention of of doing that and i kept speaking out about the environment and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability  
 and in time my views went from controversial
 to more or less consensus today i mean i think most people in the industry understand that we 've got to get on with it and the good news is today we are tackling the
  of cars and the environment
 not only at ford but really as an industry  
 we 're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights  
 and with new technology we 're reducing and i believe someday we 'll eliminate co2 emissions 
 we 're starting to sell electric cars which is great we 're developing alternative powertrains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word
  although we 've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do  i can see the day where my two great passions cars and the environment actually come into harmony  
 but unfortunately as we 're on our way to solving one monstrous problem and as i said we 're not there yet we 've got a lot of work to do  but i can see where we will
 but even as we 're in the process of doing that another huge problem is looming and
 people aren 't noticing
  and that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened 
 just as the environment is the problem  put in its simplest terms is one of mathematics 
 today there are approximately six point eight billion people in the world  and within our lifetime that number 's going to grow to about nine billion 
 and at that population level our planet
  will be dealing with the limits of growth and with that growth comes some severe practical problems one of which
 is our transportation system simply won 't be able to deal with it 
 when we look at the population growth in terms of cars it becomes even clearer today there are about eight hundred million cars on the road
  but with more people and greater prosperity around the world that number 's going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid century 
 and this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before 
 now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives today the average american spends about a week a year stuck in traffic
  and that 's a huge waste of time and resources  but that 's nothing compared to what 's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest 
 today the average driver in beijing has a five hour commute 
 and last summer many of you probably saw this
 there was a hundred mile traffic jam that took eleven days to clear in china in the decades to come
  percent of the world 's population will live in cities  and fifty of those cities will be of ten million people or more 
 so you can see the size of the issue that we 're facing when you factor in population growth 
 it 's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow 
 frankly four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam
  so if we make no changes today what does tomorrow look like well i think you probably already have the picture 
 traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge and they 're really very very inconvenient but that 's all they are but the bigger issue is
 that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care
  particularly to people that live in city centers and our quality of life is going to be severely compromised  
 so what 's going to solve this 
 well the answer isn 't going to be more of the same 
 my great grandfather once said before he invented the model t if i had asked people then what they wanted 
  so the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads 
 when america began moving west  we didn 't add more wagon trains  we built railroads  
 and to connect our country after world war ii we didn 't build more two lane highways  we built the interstate highway system 
 today we need that same leap in thinking for
 for us to create a viable future we are going to build smart cars  but we also need to build smart roads smart parking smart public
 transportation systems and more  we don 't want to waste our time sitting in traffic sitting at tollbooths or looking for parking spots  
 we need an integrated system that uses real time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale
  without hassle or compromises for travelers 
 and frankly that 's the kind of system that 's going to make the future of of personal mobility sustainable  
 now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world 
 the city of masdar in abu dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another and they go underneath the city streets  and up above you 've got a series of pedestrian walkways 
 on new york city 's
  gridlock will soon be replaced with a connected system
 of vehicle specific corridors  
 pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created and all of this will will cut down the average rush hour commute to get across town in new york
 from about an hour today at rush hour to about twenty minutes 
 now if you look at hong kong they have a very interesting system called octopus there it 's a system that really ties
  together all the transportation assets
 into a single payment system  so parking garages  buses trains  they all operate within the same system  
 now shared car services are also springing up around the world  and these efforts i think are great they 're relieving congestion  and they 're frankly starting to save some fuel
  these are all really good ideas that will move us forward  
 but what really inspires me is what 's going to be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other 
 very soon the same systems that we use today to bring music and and entertainment and gps information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network 
 every morning i drive about thirty miles from my home in ann arbor to my office in dearborn michigan and every night i go home my commute
  is a total crapshoot  and i often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home 
 but very soon we 're going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other so if the car ahead of me 
 hits traffic it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way  
 and these systems are being tested
  right now and frankly they 're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon  
 but the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless  so just imagine 
 one day very soon you 're going to be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system so you get in your
  and as you get in your car your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive no more driving around looking for one which frankly is one of the biggest
 users of fuel in today 's cars in urban areas is looking for parking spots 
 or think about being in new york city and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone so you don 't have to wait in the cold to hail one 
 or being at a future ted conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here
  and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time this is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles
 into a single system  so i think it 's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem  but as we
  and also fossil fuels there is no one silver bullet 
 the solution is not going to be more cars more roads or a new rail system 
 it can only be found i believe in a global network of interconnected solutions 
 now i know we can develop the technology that 's going to make this work  but we 've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions
  whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven 't even thought of yet our overall 
  and infrastructure must support all the future options  we need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue  
 companies  entrepreneurs  venture capitalists they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity as well as an enormous social
  and just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge and it 's really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power how much money
 and how much serious thought has really over the last three years just poured into the green energy field 
 we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock but we need people like all of you in this room leading thinkers  
  all of you to think about how you can help solve this this huge issue  and we need people from all walks of life not just inventors we need policymakers
 and government officials to also think about how they 're going to respond to this challenge this isn 't going to be solved by any one person or one group it 's going to really require a 
  national energy policy  frankly for each country  because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels traffic jams
 and also how integrated the systems already are  
 but we need to get going and we need to get going today  and we must have an infrastructure that 's designed to support this flexible future 
 you know we 've come a long way  
 since the model t  most people never traveled more than twenty five miles from home in their entire lifetime and since then the
  has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live  where we work where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around  
 we don 't want to regress and lose that freedom 
 we 're on our way to solving and as i said earlier i know we 've got a long way to go
 the one big issue that we 're all focused on that threatens it and that 's the environmental issue
  but i believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity
 and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock  
 because in doing so we 're going to preserve what we 've really come to take for granted which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world  
 and it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this  because if you can envision
  as i do a future of zero emissions
 and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today that 's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow  
 i believe we 're at our best when we 're confronted with big issues  this is a big one  and it won 't wait  so let 's get started now thank you
