  so last year on the fourth of july experiments at the large hadron collider discovered the higgs boson  it was a historical day 
 there 's no doubt that from now on the fourth of july will be remembered not as the day of the declaration of independence  but as the
  day of the discovery of the higgs boson  well at least here at cern  but for me the biggest surprise of that day
 was that there was no big surprise 
 in the eye of a theoretical physicist the higgs boson is a clever explanation of how some elementary particles gain mass  
 but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory and incomplete solution
  too many questions are left unanswered 
 the higgs boson does not share the beauty  the symmetry the elegance of the rest of the elementary particle world 
 for this reason the majority of theoretical physicists believe that the higgs boson could not be the full story  
 we were expecting new particles and new phenomena accompanying the higgs boson
  instead so far the measurements coming from the lhc show no signs of new particles or unexpected phenomena 
 of course  the verdict is not definitive 
 in two thousand and fifteen the lhc will almost double the energy of the colliding protons  and these more powerful collisions will allow us to explore further the particle world
  and we will certainly learn much more  
 but for the moment  since we have found no evidence for new phenomena let us suppose that the particles that we know today  including the higgs boson  
 are the only elementary particles in nature  
 even at energies much larger than what we have explored so far
 let 's see where this
  hypothesis is going to lead us 
 we will find a surprising and intriguing result about our universe  
 and to explain my point let me first tell you what the higgs is about and to do so we have to go back
 to one tenth of a billionth of a second after the big bang  and according to the higgs theory
  at that instant a dramatic event took place in the universe
 underwent a phase transition 
 it was something very similar to the phase transition that occurs when water turns into ice below zero degrees  
 but in our case the phase transition is not a change in the way the molecules are arranged inside
  the material  but is about a change of the very fabric of 
 during this phase transition empty space became filled with a substance that we now call higgs field  
 and this substance may seem invisible to us  but it has a physical reality it surrounds us all the time just like the air we breathe in this room
 and some elementary particles interact with this substance gaining energy in the process  and this intrinsic energy is what we call the mass of a particle  
 and by discovering the higgs boson  the lhc has conclusively proved that this substance is real  
 because it is the stuff the higgs bosons are made of 
 and this in a nutshell
 is the essence of the higgs story  but this story is far more interesting than that 
 by studying the higgs theory  theoretical physicists discovered not through an experiment but with the power of mathematics 
 that the higgs field does not necessarily exist only in the form that we observe today  
 just like matter
  exist as liquid or solid so the higgs field  the substance that fills
 all space time could exist in two states  
 besides the known higgs state  there could be a second state in which the higgs field is billions and billions times denser than what we observe today  
 and the mere existence of another state
 of the higgs field poses a potential problem 
 this is because 
 according to the laws of quantum mechanics it is possible to have transitions between two states  even in the presence of an energy barrier separating the two states  
 and the phenomenon
  because of quantum tunneling  i could disappear from this room and reappear in the next room 
 practically penetrating the wall 
 but don 't expect me to actually perform the trick in front of your eyes  because the probability for me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small 
 you would have to wait a really long time before it happens
 but believe me quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon and it has been observed in many systems 
 for instance the tunnel diode a component used in electronics works thanks to the wonders of quantum tunneling  
 but let 's go back to the higgs field
  quantum tunneling a bubble of this state could suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at a certain time  
 and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water  bubbles of vapor form inside the water then they expand turning liquid into into gas 
 in the same
  higgs state could come into existence because of quantum tunneling  the bubble would then expand at the speed of light invading all space and turning the higgs field from the familiar state into a new state 
 is this a problem  
 yes it 's a big a problem  we may not realize it in ordinary life  but the intensity of the higgs field is critical for the structure of matter 
  the higgs field were only a few times more intense  we would see atoms shrinking neutrons decaying inside atomic nuclei nuclei disintegrating 
  and hydrogen would be the only possible chemical element in the universe  
  is not just a few times more intense than today  but billions of times and if space time were filled by this higgs state 
 all atomic matter would collapse 
 no molecular structures would be possible no life 
 so i wonder is it possible that in the future the higgs field will undergo a phase transition
  through quantum tunneling will be transformed into this nasty ultra dense state 
 in other words  i ask myself what is the fate of the higgs field in our universe  
 and the crucial ingredient necessary to answer this question is the higgs boson mass  and experiments at the lhc found that
  this is tiny when expressed in familiar units because it 's equal to something like ten to the minus twenty two grams  
 but it is large in particle physics units  because it is equal to the weight of an entire molecule of a dna constituent 
 so armed with this information from the lhc
  together with some colleagues here at cern  we computed the probability that our universe could quantum tunnel into 
 higgs state  and we found a very intriguing result our calculations showed
 that the measured value of the higgs boson mass is very special 
 it has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation 
  field is in a wobbly configuration that has lasted so far but that will eventually collapse  so
 according to these calculations  we are like campers who accidentally set their tent at the edge of a cliff  
 and eventually the higgs field will undergo a phase transition and matter will collapse into itself 
 so is
  this how humanity is going to disappear 
 i don 't think so 
 our calculation shows that quantum tunneling of the higgs field is not likely to occur in the next ten to the one hundred years  
 and this is a very long time it 's even longer than than the time it takes for italy to form a stable government
  even so we will be long gone by then 
 in about five billion years  our sun will become a red giant as large as the earth 's orbit  
 and our earth will be
 kaput  and in a thousand billion years  if dark energy keeps on fueling space expansion at the present rate 
 you will not even be
  able to see as far as your toes  because everything around you expands at a rate faster than the speed of light  
 so it is really unlikely that we will be around to see the higgs field collapse  
 but the reason why i am interested in the transition of the higgs field is because i want to address the question 
 why
 is the higgs boson
  mass so special why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition 
 theoretical physicists always ask why questions 
 more than how a phenomenon works theoretical physicists are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the
  can give us clues about the fundamental principles of nature  and indeed a possible answer to my question
 opens up new universes  literally 
 it has been speculated that our universe is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse made out of a multitude of bubbles and each bubble is a different universe
 with different fundamental constants and different physical laws  
 and in this context you can only talk about the probability of finding a certain value of the higgs mass 
 then the key to the mystery could lie in the statistical properties of the multiverse  
 it would be something like what happens with sand dunes on a beach in principle you could imagine to
  find sand dunes of any slope angle in a beach  and yet  
 the slope angles of sand dunes are typically around thirty thirty five degrees  and the reason is simple 
 because wind builds up the sand gravity makes it fall as a result  the vast majority of sand dunes have slope angles around the critical value  near to collapse
  and something similar could happen for the higgs boson mass in the multiverse 
 in the majority of bubble universes  
 the higgs mass could be around the critical value near to a cosmic collapse of the higgs field  because of two competing effects just as in the case of sand 
 my story
  have an end because we still don 't know the end of the story this is
 science in progress  
 and to solve the mystery  we need more data  and hopefully  the lhc will soon add new clues to this story  
 just one number the higgs boson mass  and yet  out of
  this number we learn so much 
 i started from a hypothesis that the known particles are all there is in the universe even beyond the domain explored so far 
 from this 
 we discovered that the higgs field that permeates space time may be standing on a knife edge ready
 for cosmic collapse  and we discovered that this
 may be a hint that our universe is only a grain of sand in a giant beach  the multiverse  
 but i don 't know if my hypothesis is right 
 that 's how physics works a single measurement
 can put us on the road to a new understanding of the universe
 or it can send us down a blind alley  but whichever it turns
  out to be there is one thing i 'm sure of the journey will be full of surprises  thank you
