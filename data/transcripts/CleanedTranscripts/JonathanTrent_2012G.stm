  some years ago i set out to try to understand if there was a possibility to develop biofuels
 on a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels but not compete with agriculture
  so here 's what i came up with 
 imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it just underwater  and we fill it with wastewater and some form of microalgae that produces oil  and we make it out of some kind of flexible material that moves with waves underwater  
 and the system that we 're going to build of course will use solar energy to grow the algae and they use co2 which is good  and they produce oxygen as they grow
  the algae that grow
 are in a container that distributes the heat to the surrounding water and you can harvest them and make biofuels and cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed and of course you 'd have to make a large area of this so you 'd
 have to worry about other stakeholders like fishermen and ships and such things but hey we 're talking about biofuels and we know the importance
  of potentially getting an alternative liquid fuel  
 why are we talking about microalgae 
 here you see a graph showing you the different types of crops that are being considered for making biofuels  so you can see some things like soybean 
 which makes fifty gallons per acre per year or sunflower or canola or jatropha or palm  
  graph there shows what microalgae can contribute 
 that is to say microalgae contributes between two thousand and five thousand gallons per acre per year compared to the fifty gallons per acre per year from soy  
 so what are microalgae microalgae are micro that is they 're extremely small as you can see here
 a picture of those single celled organisms compared to a human hair 
 those small organisms have been around for millions of years and there 's thousands of different species of microalgae in the world
  some of which are the fastest growing plants on the planet and produce as i just showed you lots and lots of oil 
 now  why do we want to do this offshore  
 well  the reason we 're doing this offshore is because if you look at our coastal cities there isn 't a choice 
 because we 're going to use waste water as i suggested  and if you look at where most of the waste water treatment plants are they 're embedded in the cities
  this is the city of san francisco which has nine hundred miles of sewer pipes under the city already  and it releases its waste water offshore  
 so
 different cities around the world treat their waste water differently some cities process it some cities just release the water  but in all cases the water that 's released is perfectly adequate for growing microalgae 
 so let 's envision what the system
  might look like we call it omega which is an acronym for offshore membrane enclosures for growing algae at nasa you have to have good acronyms  
 so how does it work i sort of showed you how it works already  we put waste water and some source of 
 into our floating structure  and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow  and they sequester
  otherwise go off into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas 
 they of course use solar energy to grow and the wave energy on the surface provides energy for mixing the algae  and the temperature is controlled by the surrounding water temperature 
 the algae that grow produce oxygen as i 've mentioned  and they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food and
  products of interest  
 and the system is contained what do i mean by that it 's modular let 's say something happens that 's totally unexpected to one of the modules it leaks it 's struck by lightning
  the waste water that leaks out is water that already now goes into that coastal environment  and the algae that leak out are biodegradable  and because they 're living in waste water they 're fresh water algae 
 which means they can 't live in salt water so they die  the plastic we 'll build it out of is some kind of
  have good experience with and we 'll rebuild our modules to be able to reuse them again  
 so we may be able to go beyond that when thinking about this system that i 'm showing you and that is to say we need to think in terms of the water the fresh water  which is also going to be an issue in the future and we 're working on methods now for recovering the waste
  the other thing to consider is the structure itself it provides
 a surface for things in the ocean  and this surface which is covered by seaweeds and and other organisms in the ocean will become enhanced marine habitat so it increases biodiversity  
 and finally because it 's an offshore structure  we can think in terms of how it might contribute to an aquaculture
  so you 're probably thinking gee this sounds like a good idea what can we do to try to see if it 's real 
 well  i set up laboratories in santa cruz at the california fish and game facility
  and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks to test some of these ideas  we also set up experiments in san francisco at one of the three waste water treatment plants 
 again a facility to test ideas  and finally we wanted to see where
  where we could look at what the impact of this structure would be
 in the marine environment  and we set up
 a field site at a place called moss landing marine lab in monterey bay where we worked in a harbor to see what impact this would have on marine organisms 
 the laboratory that we set up in santa cruz was our
  it was a place where we were growing algae and welding plastic and building tools and making a lot of mistakes or as edison said we were finding the ten thousand ways that the system wouldn 't work 
 now we grew algae in waste water  
 and we built tools that allowed us to get into the lives of algae so that we could monitor the way they grow what makes them happy how do we make sure that we 're going to have a culture that will survive and thrive
  important feature that we needed to develop were these so called photobioreactors or pbrs these were the structures that would be floating at the surface made out of some inexpensive plastic material that 'll allow the algae to grow  and we had built lots and lots of designs 
 most of which were horrible failures and when we finally got to a design that worked at about thirty gallons we scaled it up to four hundred and fifty gallons in san francisco  
 so let me show you how the system
  works we basically take waste water with algae of our choice in it  and we circulate it through this floating structure this tubular flexible plastic structure  and 
  it circulates through this thing and there 's sunlight of course it 's at the surface and the algae grow on the nutrients but this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag the algae are not going to suffocate because of co2 as we would they suffocate because they produce
  oxygen and they don 't really suffocate but the oxygen that they produce is problematic  and they use up all the co2 
 so the next thing we had to figure out was how we could remove the oxygen which we did by building this column which circulated some of the water and put back co2 which we did by bubbling the system before we recirculated the water  
 and what you see here is
  which was the first attempt at building this type of column  the larger column that we then installed in san francisco in the installed system  
 so the column actually had another very nice feature and that is the algae settle in the column  and this allowed us to accumulate the algal biomass in a context where we could easily harvest it  
 so we would remove the algaes that concentrated in the bottom of this column and then we could harvest that by a procedure where you float
  the algae to the surface and can skim it off with a net  
 so we wanted to also investigate what would be the impact of this system in the marine environment  and i mentioned we set up this experiment at a field site in moss landing marine lab  
 well  we found of course that this material became overgrown with algae and we needed then to develop a cleaning procedure  and we also looked at how
 seabirds and marine mammals interacted and in fact you see here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting and would periodically
 work its way across this little floating water bed  and we wanted to hire this guy or train him to be able to clean the surface of these things but that 's for the future  
 now really what we were doing we were working in four areas our research covered the biology of the system which included studying the way algae grew but
  also what eats the algae and what kills the algae  
 we did engineering to understand what we would need to be able to do to build this structure  not only on the small scale but how we would build it on this enormous scale that will ultimately be required 
 i mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals and looked at basically the environmental impact of the system
  and finally we looked at the economics  and what i mean by economics is what is the energy required to run the system do you get more energy out of the system than you have to put into the system 
  to be able to make the system run  and what about operating costs and what about capital costs  and what about just the whole economic structure  
  don 't have a lot of time and i 'd like to show you the artist 's conception of how this system might look if we find ourselves in a protected bay
 somewhere in the world  and we have in the background in this image the waste water treatment plant and a source of flue gas for the co2 
 but when you do the economics of this system you find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work  
 unless you look at the
  system as a way to treat waste water  sequester carbon  
 and potentially for photovoltaic panels or wave energy or even wind energy 
 and if you start thinking in terms of integrating all of these different activities you could also include in such a
 facility aquaculture  so we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculture where we 're growing mussels or scallops
  growing oysters and things that would be producing high value products and food and this would be a market driver as we build the system to larger and larger scales so that it becomes 
  ultimately competitive with the idea of doing it for fuels  
 plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputation right now 
 and so we 've been thinking cradle to cradle what are we going to do with all this plastic that we 're going to need to use in our marine environment  
 well  i don 't know if you know about this but in california there 's a huge amount of plastic that 's used in fields right now as plastic mulch  
 and this is plastic that 's making these tiny little greenhouses right along the surface of the soil  and this provides warming the soil to increase the growing season  
 it allows us to control weeds
 and of course it makes the watering much more efficient  
 so the omega system will be part of this type of an outcome  and that when we 're finished using it in the marine environment we 'll be using it hopefully on fields 
 where are we going to put this  and what will it look like offshore  here 's an image of what we could do in san
  san francisco produces sixty five million gallons a day of waste water  
 if we imagine a five day retention time for this system we 'd need three hundred and twenty five million gallons to accomodate  and that would be about one thousand two hundred and eighty acres of these omega modules 
 floating in san francisco bay well that 's less than one percent of the surface area of the bay  
  diesel that would be required in san francisco  and that 's without doing anything about efficiency 
 where else could we potentially put this system there 's lots of possibilities
  there 's of course  san francisco bay as i mentioned san diego bay is another example mobile bay or chesapeake bay  but the reality is as sea level rises there 's going to be lots and lots of new opportunities to consider
 laughter so what i 'm telling you about is a system of
 integrated activities biofuels production is integrated with alternative energy is integrated with aquaculture 
 i set out to find
 a pathway to innovative production of sustainable
  and en route i discovered that what 's really required for sustainability is integration more than innovation
