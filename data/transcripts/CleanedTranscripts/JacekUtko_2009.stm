  newspapers are dying for a few reasons 
 readers don 't want to pay for yesterday 's news  and advertisers follow them your iphone your laptop is much more handy than new york times on sunday  
 and we should save trees in the end  so it 's enough to bury any industry
 rather ask can anything save newspapers there
 are several scenarios for the future newspaper some people say it should be free it should be tabloid or even smaller a4 it
 should be local
 run by communities or niche for some smaller groups like business but then it 's not free it 's very expensive it should be
  and we 'd rather read it during breakfast because later we listen to radio in a car  check your mail at work and in the evening you watch tv  
 sounds nice but this can only buy time
 because in the long run i think there is no reason no practical reason for newspapers to survive so what can we do 
 let me tell you my story  twenty years ago
 swedish publisher started to set newspapers in the former soviet bloc after a few years they had several newspapers in central and eastern europe  
 they were run by an inexperienced staff with no visual culture no budgets for visuals
 in many places there were not even art directors i decided to be
 work for them as an art director  
 before i was an architect and my grandmother asked me once what are you doing for a living 
 i said i 'm designing newspapers what there 's nothing to design there it 's just boring letters 
 laughter and she was right  i was very frustrated  until one day  i came to london and i 've seen performance by cirque du soleil  
 and i had a revelation i thought these guys took some creepy
  and put it to the highest possible level of performance art i thought 
 oh my god maybe i can do the same with these boring newspapers and i did we started to redesign them one by one 
 the front page became our signature 
 it was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers i 'm not going to tell you stories about
 teamwork or cooperation my approach
  i wanted
 my artistic statement my interpretation of reality  i wanted to make posters not newspapers not even magazines posters we were experimenting with
 type with illustration with photos  and we had fun soon it started to bring results 
 in poland  our pages were named covers of the year three times in
  other examples you can see here are from latvia lithuania estonia
 the central european countries 
 but it 's not only about the front page the secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece as one composition
 like music and music has a rhythm has ups and downs 
  and design is responsible for this experience  
 flipping through pages is readers experience  and i 'm responsible for this experience 
 we treated two pages both spreads as a one page because that 's how readers perceive it 
 you can see some russian pages here which got many awards on biggest infographic competition in spain but
 the real award came from society for newspaper design just a year after redesigning this newspaper in poland  they name it
 's best designed newspaper and two years later the same award came to estonia 
 isn 't amazing  
 what really makes it amazing that the circulation of these newspapers were growing too 
 just some examples in russia plus eleven after one year plus twenty nine after three years of the redesign 
  same in poland  plus thirteen  up to thirty five percent
 raise of circulation after three years you can see on a graph after years of stagnation the paper started to grow just after redesign  
 but the real hit was in bulgaria  and that is really amazing  
 did design do this design was just a part of the process and the process we made was not about changing the look it was about improving the product completely
  i took an architectural rule about function and form and translated it into newspaper content and design  
 and i put strategy at the top of it so first you ask a big question why we do it what is the goal then we adjust the content accordingly accordingly  and then usually after two months we start designing 
  my bosses in the beginning were very surprised why am i asking all of these business questions instead of just showing them pages 
  process from the very beginning to the very end  
 so what is the lesson behind it 
 the first lesson is about that design can change not just your product it can change your workflow actually it can change everything in your company it can turn your company upside down  it can even change you 
 and who 's responsible designers  give power to designers
  but the second is even more important 
 you can live in a small poor country like me you can work for a small company 
 in a boring branch  you can have no budgets no people
 but still can put your work to the highest possible level 
 and everybody can do it you just need inspiration vision and determination and you need to remember that to be good
