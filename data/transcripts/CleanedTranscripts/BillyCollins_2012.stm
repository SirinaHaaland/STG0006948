  to give you your recommended dietary allowance of poetry 
 and the way i 'm going to do that is present to you five animations of five of my
  and let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about because the mixing of those two media is a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act 
 but when i was united states poet laureate
 and i love saying that 
 it 's a great way to start sentences 
 when i was him back then i was approached by j walter thompson the ad company and they were
 hired sort of by the sundance channel and the idea was
  to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them 
 and i was initially resistant because i always think poetry can stand alone by itself 
 attempts to put my poems to music have had disastrous results in all cases 
 and the poem if it 's written with the ear  already has been set to its
  own verbal music as it was composed 
 and surely if you 're reading a poem that mentions a cow 
 you don 't need on the facing page a drawing of a cow  i mean let 's let the reader do a little work  
 but i relented because it seemed like an interesting possibility  and also i 'm like a total cartoon junkie since
  i think more influential than emily dickinson or coleridge or wordsworth
 on my imagination were warner brothers  merrie melodies and loony tunes cartoons  
 bugs bunny is my muse  
 and this way poetry could find its way onto television of all places 
 and i 'm pretty much all for poetry in public places poetry on buses poetry on subways 
 on billboards
  on cereal boxes  when i was poet laureate there i go again
 i can 't help it it 's true 
 i created a poetry channel on delta airlines that lasted for a couple of years so you could tune into poetry as you were flying
  off the shelves and more into public life 
 start a meeting with a poem that would be an idea you might take with you when you get a poem on a billboard or on the radio or on a cereal box or whatever 
 it happens to you so suddenly that you don 't have time
 to deploy your anti poetry deflector shields
 that were installed in
  let us start with the first one it 's
 a little poem called budapest and in it i reveal or pretend to reveal  the secrets of the creative
 process narration 
 budapest my pen moves along the page like the snout of a strange animal
 shaped like a human arm
 and dressed in the sleeve
 of a loose green sweater  
 i watch it sniffing the paper ceaselessly  intent as any forager that has nothing on its mind
 but the grubs and insects that will allow it to live another day  
 it wants only to be here tomorrow dressed perhaps in the sleeve of a plaid shirt  nose pressed against the
  page  writing a few more dutiful lines
 while i gaze out the window and imagine budapest
 or some other city where i have never been bc 
 so that makes it seem a little easier writing is not
 actually as easy as that for me but i
  i like to pretend that it comes with ease one of my students came up after class an introductory class and
 she said you know poetry is harder than writing 
 which i found both erroneous and profound 
 so i like to at least pretend it just flows out a friend of mine has a slogan  he 's another poet he says that
  if at first you don 't succeed  hide all evidence you ever tried 
 the next poem is also rather short 
  poetry just says a few things in different ways and i think you could boil this poem down to saying 
 some days you eat the bear other days the bear eats you and it uses the
  some days i put the people in their places at the table  bend their legs at the knees if they come with that feature
  and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs 
 all afternoon they face one another the man in the brown suit  the woman in
  but other days i am the one who is lifted up by the ribs
 then lowered into the dining room of a dollhouse to sit with the others at the long table  very funny  
 but how would you like it
 if you never knew from one day to the next
 if you were going to spend it striding around like a vivid god your shoulders
  in the clouds or sitting down there amidst the wallpaper
 staring straight ahead
 with your little plastic face bc there
 's a horror movie in there
  the next poem is called forgetfulness and it 's really just a kind of poetic essay on the subject of mental
 slippage and the poem begins with a certain
 species of forgetfulness that someone called literary amnesia in other words  forgetting the things that you have read
  go followed obediently by the title the plot  the heartbreaking conclusion 
 the entire novel  which suddenly becomes one you have never read never even heard of 
 it is as if one by one the memories you used to harbor
 decided to retire
  to the southern hemisphere of the brain to a little fishing village where there are no phones 
 long ago you kissed the names of the nine muses good bye and you watched the quadratic equation pack its bag
  and even now as you memorize the order of the planets something else is slipping away a state flower perhaps the address of an
  you are struggling to remember  it is not poised on the tip of your tongue not even lurking in some obscure corner
 of your spleen it has floated away down a dark mythological river whose name begins with an l
 as far as you can recall  well on your own way to oblivion
 where you will join those
 who have forgotten even how to swim
 and how to ride a bicycle no wonder you rise in the middle of the night
 to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war 
 no wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem that you used to know
  next poem is called the country and it 's based on when i was in college i met a
 classmate who remains to be a friend of mine he lived and still does in rural vermont i lived in new
  and we would visit each other and when i would go up to the country he would teach me things like
 deer hunting which meant getting lost with a gun basically and
 trout fishing and stuff like that and then he 'd come down to new york city and i 'd teach him what i knew which was largely
 smoking and drinking and in that way we traded lore with each other
  's coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a domestic point of etiquette in country living that i had a very hard time at first processing it 's called the country narration 
 the country 
 i wondered about you when you told me never to leave a box of wooden strike anywhere matches just lying around the house  because the mice might get into them and start a fire
 but your face was absolutely straight when you twisted the lid down on the round tin
 where the matches you said are always stowed 
 who could sleep that night  
 who could whisk away the thought of the one unlikely mouse padding along a cold water pipe behind the floral wallpaper gripping a single wooden match between
  the needles of his teeth 
 who could not see him rounding a corner the blue tip scratching against  rough hewn beam  the sudden flare
 and the creature for one bright  shining moment suddenly thrust ahead of his time
 ancient night  and who could fail to notice  lit up in the blazing insulation the tiny looks of wonderment
 on the faces of his fellow mice one time inhabitants of what once was
 your house in the country
  and the last poem is called the dead i wrote this after a friend 's funeral but not so much about the friend as something the eulogist kept saying as all eulogists tend to do which is
 how happy the deceased would be to look down and see all of us assembled and that to me was a bad start to the afterlife having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified  
  the dead are always looking down on us they say  
 while we are putting on our shoes or making a sandwich  they are looking down through the glass bottom boats of heaven as they row themselves slowly through eternity 
 they watch the tops of our heads moving
  when we lie down in a field or on a couch  drugged perhaps by the hum of a warm afternoon 
 they think we are looking back at them  which makes them lift their oars and fall silent
 and wait like parents for us to close our eyes
  other poems will be animated it took a long time i mean it 's rather uncommon to have this marriage a long time to put those two together
 but then again it took us a long time to put the wheel and the suitcase together 
 laughter i mean we had the wheel for some
 you would be all done in only one more year 
 of course you couldn 't have done that all alone so never mind you 're fine just being yourself you 're loved for just being you 
 but did you know that at your age judy garland was pulling down one hundred and fifty thousand dollars a picture  
 joan of arc was leading the french army to victory
 and blaise pascal had cleaned
  up his room
 no wait i mean he had invented the calculator 
 of course there will be time for all that later in your life  after you come out of your room and begin to blossom 
 or at least pick up all your socks 
 for some reason i keep remembering that lady
  lady jane grey was queen of england when she was only fifteen  but then she was beheaded so never mind her as a role model 
 a few centuries later 
 when he was your age franz schubert was doing the dishes for his family  
 but that did not keep him from composing two symphonies  four operas and two complete
  but of course that was in austria at the height of romantic lyricism not here in the suburbs of cleveland 
 frankly who cares if annie oakley was a crack shot at fifteen
 or if maria callas debuted as tosca at seventeen we think you 're special just being you
 playing with your food and staring into space
  by the way i lied about schubert doing the dishes  but that doesn 't mean he never helped out around the house
