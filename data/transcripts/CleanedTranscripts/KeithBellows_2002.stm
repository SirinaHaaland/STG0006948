  the reason i put this up here is because when i was in africa
 last year  my wife and i were driving around we had this wonderful guide who showed us something
 that surprised both of us and it was very revealing in terms of the
 fascination that comes with the design of animals it turns out that in about the 1880s the missionaries came to africa
 to spread the word of christianity to teach english to the natives  and they brought blackboards and chalk and i 'd like you to imagine that
  that 's a blackboard and i just used some chalk on there  and
 they brought quite a bit of this stuff but over the years the blackboards were fine but they ran out of chalk  and
 this is a real crisis for them  and
 that 's where the hyena comes in the hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world
  enables the hyena to essentially
 eat bones now  the end product of that action
 is up on the board here what the missionaries would do is they 'd walk around
 and they 'd pick up hyena shit  and the incredible thing about hyena shit is it makes great
  not what i 'm here to talk about but it is
 a fascinating
 aspect of animal design what i 'm here to talk about is the camel  when i started talking to richard about what i was going to speak about 
 i had recently come back from jordan where i had an amazing experience with a camel 
 and we were in the desert
 in a small jeep there were four of us two bedouin drivers 
 you can just imagine this expanse is  an ocean of sand one hundred and five degrees one water bottle  
 and we were driving
 in what they told us was their very very best jeep didn 't look like it to me and as we started to
  go through the desert
  the jeep broke down the guys got out they put the hood up they started working under the hood 
 got it going again about a hundred yards it broke down this went on about  6 7 times we were getting more and more alarmed we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert  and
 eventually  our worst nightmare happened they flooded the engine  and they said ah no problem  we just get out and walk
  and sure enough about half a mile we came over the crest of this hill and there was a huge gathering of bedouin with their camels the guy went up and started
 dickering and ten dollars later we had four camels  they went down like elevators  we got on them  they went back up and the bedouin
  got behind each of the camels with a little whip  and
 they started slashing away at the back of the camels and they started galloping and if you 've ever been on a camel it is a very very uncomfortable ride 
 there 's also one other aspect about these camels about every ten steps  they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg 
 so we kept on going and this camel camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg
  and eventually three miles later we arrived at our destination where a jeep was supposed to meet us  and the camels come down again like elevators  
 we sort of clumsily get off and they  obviously try to take another chunk out of my leg  and i 've developed a very
 wonderful relationship with this creature by this point  and i 've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch and
 much meaner by the way than the bedouin who greeted me and tried to sell
  think we want to be bringing a camel and you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel
  so i did the next best thing 
 i went to the washington zoo  richard said i want you to get up close and personal with this camel  
 i want you to inspect its mouth look at its teeth go underneath it go above it
 go around it  pull its tail up take a look in there  i want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can so i got a
 national geographic film crew  we went down there  and
 i took one look at this camel  it is a two thousand pound creature who is
  if you 've ever seen a two thousand pound camel in rut it is a scary scary thing to behold  and if
 richard thought i was getting in the ring with that camel  someone was smoking bedouin high grade so we
 got as close to it as possible and i 'm going to share this chris if you want to roll this film then i 'm going to show you a little bit
  more about the design of camels
  're similar to seals in the way
  what i didn 't show you
  you got that swinging thing going  well
 and you 're glad i didn 't show you this one of the other things about the camel 's beautiful design
 is that its penis points backwards that way the camel can dip its tail in the in the stream  and just whacker the entire
 area around him and that 's how he really marks his territory  now  what you also didn 't see was that
 and you may have noticed in the pen beside him
 and by the way the camel 's name is suki
  the pen beside him is jasmine jasmine has been his mate for some time but on this particular occasion it was very very clear
 that
 as horny as suki was jasmine was having none of it  and so we started thinking well 
 if poor old suki is in search of a mate  what would suki
  show you another film but before i do i just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort 
  of the suv of the sand  the ship of the desert it 's so vital 
 to to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found largely mongolia and sahara  that there are one hundred and sixty words in arabic to describe
  and if this is a creature that was designed by committee it 's certainly been like no committee i 've ever been on so
 here 's here 's what suki would do in search of a mate can you roll it please
  i just want to leave you with one last thought which is probably the most important thing to take away  
  the animal are pretty lucky creatures because by and large  we really don 't have to
 adapt to our environment we adapt our environment to us and we 've seen that repeatedly through this conference not just this year but in past years  
 but this creature that you 've just seen
 ultimately adapts and keeps adapting and adapting i think when you look at the animal kingdom that is one of the most remarkable things 
 it doesn 't have an environment that adapts to it  it has to adapt to the environment 
 ricky thank you very much for
