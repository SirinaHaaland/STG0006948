  this was in an area called wellawatta a prime residential area in colombo 
 we stood on the railroad tracks that ran between my friend 's house and the beach the tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally
  but at that point the water had receded to a level three or four feet below normal 
 i 'd never seen the reef here before there were fish caught in rock pools left behind by the receding water 
 some children jumped down and ran to the rock pools with bags  they were trying to catch fish no one realized that this was a very bad idea 
 the people on the tracks just continued to watch them  
 i turned around to check
  on my friend 's house then someone on the tracks screamed 
 before i could turn around everyone on the tracks was screaming and running the water had started coming back 
 it was foaming over the reef the children managed to run back onto the tracks no one was lost there but the water continued to climb 
 in about two minutes it had reached the level of the railroad tracks and was coming over it 
 we had run about one hundred meters by this time it continued to rise i saw an old man
  standing at his gate knee deep in water refusing to move he said he 'd lived his whole life there by the beach  and that he would
 rather die there than run 
 a boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house to get his dog who was apparently afraid 
 an old lady crying was carried out of her house and up the road by her
  the slum built on the railroad reservation between the sea and the railroad tracks was completely swept away  
 since this was a high risk location the police had warned the residents and no one was there when the water rose  but they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings 
 for hours afterwards the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around all of this was from the houses in the slum 
 when the waters subsided it was as if it had never existed
  this may seem hard to believe unless you 've been reading lots and lots of news reports
 but in many places after the tsunami villagers were still terrified when what was a tranquil sea swallows up people homes and long tail boats mercilessly without warning
 and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming i 'm not sure you 'd want to calm down either 
 one of the scariest things about the tsunami that i 've not seen mentioned is the complete lack of information
 this may seem minor but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor after rumor that another tidal wave  bigger than the last will be coming at exactly one p m or 
  perhaps tonight or perhaps you don 't even know if it is safe to go back down to the water to catch a boat to the hospital 
  instead  which is more protected we don 't think another wave is coming right away 
 at the phi phi hill resort i was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television  but i strained to listen for information  
 they reported that there was an eight point five magnitude earthquake in sumatra which triggered the massive tsunami 
 having this news was comforting in some small way to understand what had just happened to us however the report focused on what had already occurred
  and offered no information on what to expect now 
 in general everything was merely hearsay and rumor and not a single person i spoke to for over thirty six hours knew anything with any certainty 
 those were two accounts of the asian tsunami from
 two internet blogs that essentially sprang up
  now going to show you two video
 segments from the tsunami that that also were shown on blogs i should warn you they 're pretty powerful one from thailand and the second one from phuket as well
  it 's coming again new wave
  first day there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting there was a dearth of live video and some people complained about this they said the blogsters let us down 
 what became very clear was that within a few days  the outpouring of information
  had was a group of essentially unorganized  unconnected writers video bloggers  etc who were able to come up with a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense of what it was like to actually be there
 than the mainstream media could give us  and so in some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment a moment in which the blogosphere came to a certain degree of age
 now 
 i 'm going to move now from this kind of the sublime in the traditional sense of the word that is to say awe inspiring terrifying to the somewhat more mundane  because when we think 
  about blogs  i think for most of us who are are concerned about them we 're primarily concerned with things like politics technology etc
  i want to ask three questions in this talk in the ten minutes that remain about the blogosphere  
 the first one is what does it tell us about our ideas about what motivates people to do things 
 the second is do blogs genuinely have the possibility of of
 accessing a kind of collective intelligence that has previously remained for the most part untapped  and then the third part is
  what are the potential problems or the dark side of blogs as we know them
  ok the first question what do they tell us about why people do things one of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically and of course the internet more generally and it 's going to seem like a very obvious point but i think it is an important one to think about
 is that the people who are generating these enormous reams of content every day
  who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing linking commenting on the substance of the internet are doing so primarily for free  
 they are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and to some extent the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job  
 and this is at least to a traditional economist somewhat remarkable 
 because the traditional account of economic man would say that  basically you do things for
 a concrete reward primarily financial 
 but instead what we 're finding on the internet and one of the great geniuses of it is that people have found a way to work together without any money involved at all they have come 
  up with in a sense a different method for organizing activity
  which we 're familiar with from linux as being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations  
 and you know if you think about this with the tsunami what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists who are producing enormous amounts of material for no reason other than to 
  tell their stories  that 's a very powerful idea  and it 's a very powerful reality  and it 's one that offers really interesting possibilities for organizing a whole host
  activities
 down the road 
 so i think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us is that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational 
 and we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money or you have to pay for for it to be good but
 that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products without any money at all changing hands there are a few bloggers somewhere maybe around twenty now who do
  in fact make some kind of money and a few who are actually trying to make a full time living out of it  but the vast majority of them are doing it because they love it or they love the attention or whatever it is  so howard 
  rheingold has written a lot about this and and i think is writing about this more but this notion of voluntary cooperation is an incredibly powerful one and one worth thinking about the second
  collective intelligence
  you know as chris mentioned i wrote a book called the wisdom of crowds 
 and the premise of the wisdom of crowds is that under the right conditions groups can be remarkably intelligent 
 and they can actually often be smarter than even the smartest person within them  
 the simplest example of this is  if you ask a group of people to do something
  like guess how many jellybeans are in a jar  if i had a jar of jellybeans and i asked you all to guess how many jellybeans were in that jar  your average guess would be remarkably good it would be somewhere probably within three and five percent of the number of
 beans in the jar  and it would be better than ninety to ninety five percent of you there may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers but
 for the most part
  the group 's guess would be better than just about all of you
 and what 's fascinating is that you can see this phenomenon at work in many more complicated situations  for instance if you look at the odds on horses at a racetrack they predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win
  in a sense the group of betters at the racetrack is forecasting the future in probabilistic terms  
 you know if you think about something like google  which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the web
  to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information
 we know that google does an exceptionally good job of doing that and it does that because collectively this disorganized thing we call the world wide web actually has a remarkable order or a remarkable intelligence in it  
 and this i think is one of the real promises of the blogosphere  
  in the gift pack has talked about it as saying that as a writer he 's recognized that his readers know more than he does and
 this is a very challenging idea  it 's a very challenging idea to mainstream media  it 's a very challenging idea to anyone who has invested an enormous amount of time and expertise and who has a lot of
 energy invested in the notion that he or she knows better than everyone else  but what the blogosphere offers is the
 of getting at the kind of collective distributive intelligence that is out there  
 and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it 
 each blog post each blog commentary may not in and of itself 
 be exactly what we 're looking for but collectively
  the judgment of those people posting those people linking 
 more often than not is going to give you a very interesting and enormously valuable picture of of what 's going on 
 so  that 's the positive side of it that 's the positive side of what is sometimes called participatory 
  journalism or citizen journalism  etc that in fact we are giving people who have never been able to talk before a
  able to access information that that has always been there but has essentially gone untapped  
 but there is a dark side to this and that 's what i want to spend the the last part of my talk on 
 one of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the internet and you spend a lot of time thinking about the internet is that it is very easy to fall in love with the internet it is very easy to fall in love with the decentralized  bottom up structure of the internet 
 it is very easy to think that networks are necessarily
  good things that being linked from one place to another that being tightly linked in a group is a very good thing  
 and much of the time it is  but there 's also a downside to this a kind of dark side in fact
 and that is that the more tightly linked we 've become to each other the harder it is for each of us to remain independent
  one of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that once you are linked in the network the network starts to shape your views and starts to shape your interactions with everybody 
  else  that 's one of the things that defines what a network is a network is not just the product of its component parts
 it is something more than that it is as steven johnson has talked about an emergent phenomenon 
 now this has all these benefits it 's very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating
  information it gives you access to
 a whole host of people it allows people to coordinate their activities in very good ways  but the problem is that groups are only smart
 when the people in them are as independent as possible 
 this is the paradox of the wisdom of crowds  or the paradox of collective intelligence 
 that what it requires is actually a form of independent thinking 
 networks make it harder for people to do that because they drive attention to the things that the network values  so one of the phenomena  that 's very clear in the blogosphere
 is that once a meme  once an idea gets going 
 it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on  because other people have say a link people have linked to it  and so other people in turn link to it etc
 that phenomenon of piling on the existing links
 is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere particularly of the political blogosphere and it is one that essentially throws off this beautiful decentralized 
  bottom up intelligence that blogs can manifest in the right conditions  the metaphor that i like to use is the metaphor of the circular mill 
  about ants you know this is a conference inspired by by nature when we talk about bottom up decentralized phenomena  the ant colony is the classic metaphor because no individual 
  ant knows what it 's doing but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent
  so the ant colony is a great model you have all these little parts that collectively add up to to a great thing but we know that occasionally ants go astray  
 and what happens is that if army ants are wandering around and they get lost  they start to follow a simple rule just do what the ant in front of you does  
 and what happens is that the ants eventually end up in a circle 
 and there 's this famous example of one that was
 thousand two hundred feet long and lasted for two days  and the ants just kept marching around and around in a circle until they died  
 and that i think is a sort of thing to watch out for that 's the thing we have to fear
 is that we 're just going to keep marching around and around until we die now i want to connect this back though to
  because one of the great things about the tsunami in terms of the blogosphere 's coverage not in terms of the tsunami itself
 is that it really did represent a genuine  bottom up phenomenon  you saw sites that had never existed before getting huge amounts of traffic  you saw people being able to offer up their independent points of view
 in a way that they hadn 't before there you really did see the intelligence of the web manifest itself 
 so that 's the upside the circular mill is the downside and i think that the former is what we really need to strive for
