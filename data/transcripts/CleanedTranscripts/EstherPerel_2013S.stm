  why does good sex so often fade even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever  
 and why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex contrary to popular belief or the next question would be can we want
  what we already have that 's the million dollar question right 
 and why is the forbidden so erotic what is it about transgression that makes desire so potent  
 and why does sex make babies and babies spell erotic disaster in couples it
 's kind of the fatal erotic blow isn 't it  and when you love
  how does it feel and when you desire how is it different these are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration
 on the nature of erotic desire
 and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love  
 so i travel the globe  and what i 'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered there seems to be a crisis of desire  
 a crisis of desire as in owning the wanting
 desire as an expression of our individuality of our free choice of our preferences of our identity
 desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies you know this is the first time in the history of humankind
  where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term
 fourteen children for which we need to have even more because many of them won 't make it and not because it is exclusively a woman 's marital duty this 
  is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire 
 sustaining desire in a committed relationship i think is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs on the one hand our need for security 
 for predictability  for safety  for dependability  
 for reliability  for permanence all these anchoring grounding experiences of our lives that we call
 but we also have an equally strong need men and women for adventure  for novelty  for mystery  for risk  for danger 
  for the unknown for the unexpected surprise you get the gist 
  passionate marriage used to be a contradiction in terms marriage was an economic institution
 in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship 
 but now we want our partner to still give us all these things but in addition i want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate
  lover to boot and we live twice as long 
 so we come to one person and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide  
 give me belonging  give me identity give me continuity but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one
  give me comfort give me edge give me novelty give me familiarity give me predictability give me surprise and we think it 's a given and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that 
 so now we get to the existential reality of the story right because
 i think in some way and i 'll come back to that but the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination so
 why does good sex so often fade what is the relationship between love and desire  how do they relate and how do they conflict  because therein lies the mystery of eroticism  
 so if there is a verb for me that comes with love it 's to have and if there is a verb that comes with desire  it is to want 
 in love we want to have we want to know the beloved  we want to
  minimize the distance we want to contract that gap we want to neutralize the tensions we want closeness  
 but in desire  we tend to not really want to go back to the places we 've already gone  forgone conclusion does not keep our interest 
 in desire we want an other somebody on the other side that we can go visit that we can go spend some time with that we can go
  see what goes on in their red light district  
 you know in desire we want a bridge to cross  or in other words i sometimes say fire needs air desire needs space 
 and when it 's said like that it 's often quite
 abstract but then i took a question with me and i 've gone to more than twenty countries in the last few years with
  and i asked people when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner not attracted sexually per se but most drawn  
 and across culture across religion and across gender except for one
 there are a few answers that just keep coming back so the first group is i am most drawn to my partner
 when she is away  when we are apart  when we reunite
  when i get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner when my imagination comes back in the picture  
 and when
 i can root it in absence and in longing  which is a major component of desire  but then the second group is even more interesting 
 i am most drawn to my partner when i see him in the studio  when she is onstage  when he is in his element when she 's doing something she 's passionate about 
  when i see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him  when i see her hold court 
  i look at this person by the way in desire people rarely talk about it when we are blended into one five centimeters from each other i don 't know in inches how much that is 
 but it 's also not when the other person is that far apart that you no longer see them  it 's when i 'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance 
 where this person that is already so familiar  so known is momentarily once again
  somewhat mysterious somewhat elusive 
 and in this space between me and the other lies the erotic lan lies that movement toward the other  
 because sometimes as proust says  mystery is not about traveling to new places but it 's about looking with new eyes  and so when i see my partner on his own or her own  doing something in which they are enveloped 
 i look at this person and i momentarily get a shift in perception  and i stay open
  to the mysteries that are living right next to me and then more importantly  in this description about the other
 or myself it 's the same what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire  nobody needs anybody there is no caretaking in desire  caretaking
  i have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them wanting them is one thing needing them is a shot down and women have known that forever because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge 
 laughter for good reasons right  and then the third group of answers usually would be when
 i 'm surprised  when we laugh together
 as somebody said to me in the office today when he 's in his tux so i said you know it 's either the tux or the cowboy boots   
 but basically it 's when there is novelty  but novelty isn 't about new positions it isn 't a repertoire of techniques novelty is what parts 
  of you do you bring out what parts of you are just being seen because in some way one could say sex isn 't something you do
 sex is a place you go 
 it 's a space you enter inside yourself and with another or others so where do you go in sex  what parts of you do you connect to what 
  do you seek to express there is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive is it a place where you can finally surrender and not have to take
  responsibility for everything is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes what comes out there it 's a language  it isn 't just a behavior and it 's the 
  poetic of that language that i 'm interested in which is why i began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence you know
 which means
 that it 's sexuality transformed by the human imagination 
 we are the only ones who can make love for hours have a blissful time  multiple orgasms and touch nobody just because we can imagine it  
 we can hint at it  we don 't even have to do it  we can experience that powerful thing called anticipation which is a mortar to desire
 the ability to imagine it as if it 's happening to experience it as if it 's happening while nothing is happening and everything is happening at the same time 
 so when i began to think about eroticism i began to think about the poetics of sex  
 and if i look at it as an intelligence then it 's something that you
  but the central agent is really that piece called the imagination  but more importantly  for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark 
  what sustains desire  i had to go back to the original definition of eroticism the mystical
  and i went through it through a bifurcation by looking actually at trauma 
 which is the other side and i looked at it  looking at the community that i had grown up in which was a community in belgium all holocaust survivors 
 and in my community there were two groups  those who didn 't die  and those who came back to life  
 and those who didn 't die lived often very tethered to the ground  could not experience pleasure  could not trust because when you 're vigilant
  worried  anxious and insecure  you can 't lift your head to go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative  
 those who came back to life were those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death they knew how to keep themselves alive  
 and when i began to listen to the sexlessness of the couples that i work with i sometimes would hear people say i want more sex
  but generally people want better sex and better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness of vibrancy of renewal of vitality of eros of energy that sex used to afford them or that they 've hoped it would afford them  
 and so i began to ask a different question 
 i shut myself off when
  began to be the question i turn off my desires when which is not the same question as what turns me off is and you turn me off when 
 and people began to say i turn myself off when i feel dead inside  when i don 't like my body  when i feel old  when i haven 't had time for myself when i haven 
  't had a chance to even check in with you  when i don 't perform well at work when i feel low self esteem when i don 't
  when i don 't feel like i have a right to want to take to receive pleasure 
 and then i began to ask the reverse question i turn myself on when because most of the time people like to ask the question you turn me on what turns me on and i 'm out of the question  
 you know  now if you are dead inside the other person can do a lot of things for valentine 's it won 't make a dent there is nobody at the reception
  i turn myself on when i turn on my desires i wake up when
 in this paradox between love and desire  what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love
 mutuality  reciprocity protection  worry  responsibility for the other are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire
 desire comes with a host of feelings that are not always such
 favorites of love jealousy possessiveness  aggression  power  dominance naughtiness mischief  basically most of us
 will get turned on at night by the very same things that we will demonstrate against during the day  you know the erotic mind is not very politically correct if everybody was
  fantasizing on a bed of roses we wouldn 't be having such interesting talks about this 
 but no in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don 't always know how to bring to the person that we love because 
 we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word 
  in the presence of another  
 so i want to draw that little image for you because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs we are born with that our need for connection our need 
  for separateness or our need for security and adventure  or our need for togetherness and for autonomy  and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap
  and at some point all of us need to go out into the world
 to discover and to explore that 's the beginning of desire that exploratory need  curiosity discovery  
 and then at some point they turn around and they look at you 
 and if you tell them hey kiddo the world 's a great place go for it there 's so much fun out there then they can turn away and they can
  experience connection and separateness at the same time they can go off in their imagination off in their body off in their playfulness all the while knowing that there 's somebody when they come back 
 but if on this side there is somebody who says i 'm worried  i 'm anxious 
 i 'm depressed my partner hasn 't taken care of me in so long what 's so good out there don 't we have everything you need together you and i
  are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize some of us will come back 
 came back a long time ago and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgo a part of himself in order not to lose the other 
 i will lose my freedom in order not to lose
  i will learn to love in a certain way that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibility and extra protection  
  and i won 't know how to leave you in order to go play in order to go experience pleasure in order to discover to enter inside myself  translate this 
  into adult language  it starts very young  it continues into our sex lives
 comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time  are you going to be there are you going to curse me scold me are you going to be angry with me 
 and they may be gone  but they 're never really away and those are often the people that will tell you in the beginning it was super hot because in the beginning  
 the growing intimacy wasn 't yet so strong that it actually led
 to the decrease of desire  the more connected i became the more responsible i felt the less i was able to let go in your presence the third child doesn 't really come back  
 so what happens if you want to sustain desire  it 's that real dialectic piece on the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go on the other hand if you can 't go you can 't have pleasure you
  't culminate you don 't have an orgasm  you don 't get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own so
 in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs there are a few things that i 've come to understand erotic couples do one they have a lot of
  they understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them 
 they also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm 
 they also understand that an erotic space isn 't about you begin to stroke the other it 's about you create a space where you leave management inc maybe where you leave the
  where you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things and being responsible responsibility and desire just butt heads they don 't really do well together
 erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes  it 's pretty much like the moon it has intermittent eclipses  
 what they know is they know how to resurrect it they know how to bring it back and they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth which is the myth of spontaneity  
 which is that it 's just going to fall from heaven while you 're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in 
  a long term relationship already has committed sex is premeditated
 does good sex
