  when my father and i started a company to 3d print human tissues and organs some people initially thought we were a little crazy  
 but since then much progress has been made both
  our lab and other labs around the world and given this we started getting questions like if you can grow
 human body parts can you also grow animal products like meat
 and leather when someone first suggested this to me quite frankly i thought they were a little crazy  but what i soon came to realize
 was that this is not so crazy after all what 's crazy is what we do today i 'm convinced that in thirty years
  when we look back on today
 and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals to make our hamburgers and our handbags we 'll see this as being wasteful
 and indeed crazy  did you know
 that today we maintain a global herd of sixty billion animals to provide our meat
  over the next few decades as the world 's population expands to ten billion this will need to nearly double to one hundred billion animals 
 but maintaining this herd takes a major toll on our planet animals are not just raw materials they 're living beings  
 and already our livestock is one of the largest users of land  
 fresh water and one of the biggest
  of greenhouse gases which drive climate change 
 on top of this when you get so many animals so close together
  it creates a breeding ground for disease and opportunities for harm and abuse  
 clearly we cannot continue on this path which puts the environment  public health and food security at risk  there is another way
  essentially animal products
 are just collections of tissues 
 and right now we breed and raise highly complex animals only to create products that are made of relatively simple tissues 
 what if  instead of starting with a complex and sentient animal  
 we started with what the tissues are made of 
 the basic unit of life
 the cell 
 this is biofabrication where cells themselves can be used to grow biological products like tissues and organs  
 already in medicine biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts like
 ears  
  blood vessels and bone that have been successfully implanted into patients  
 and beyond medicine  biofabrication can be a humane  sustainable and scalable new industry  
 and we should begin
 by reimagining leather 
 i emphasize leather because it is so widely used  it is beautiful  and it has long been a part of our history
  leather is also technically simpler than growing other animal products like meat it mainly uses one cell type  and it is
 largely two dimensional 
 it is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators  
 until biofabrication is better understood  
 it is clear that initially at least more people would be willing to wear novel materials than would be willing to eat
  novel foods no matter how delicious in this sense leather is a gateway material a beginning
 for the mainstream mainstream biofabrication industry  if we can succeed here it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat
 closer on the horizon now how do we do it to grow leather  we begin by taking cells from
  an animal through a simple biopsy 
 the animal could be a cow  lamb or even something more exotic this process does no harm and daisy the cow can live a happy life  we then isolate the skin cells and multiply them in a cell culture medium 
 this takes millions of cells and expands them into billions
  and we then coax these cells to produce collagen as they would naturally this collagen is the stuff between cells it 's natural connective tissue it
 's the extracellular matrix but in leather it 's the main building block  
 and what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen and we spread them out to form sheets  and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another like phyllo pastry 
 to form thicker sheets which we then let mature  
 and finally we take
  this multilayered skin
 and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process we create leather 
 and so i 'm very excited to show you for the first time 
 the first batch
 of our cultured leather  fresh from the lab this is
  without the animal sacrifice  
 it can have all the characteristics of leather
 because it is made of the same cells and better yet  there is no
 hair to remove no scars or insect 's bites  and no waste this leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet
  a handbag
 or a car seat  it is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow or an alligator  
 and because we make this material we grow this leather from the ground up we can control its properties in very interesting ways 
 this piece of leather
 is a mere seven tissue layers thick and as you can see  it is nearly
  layers thick
 and quite opaque you don 't have that kind of
 fine control with conventional leather and we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities like
 softness  breathability  durability  elasticity
 and even things like pattern we can mimic nature
  nature  but in some ways also improve upon it 
 this type of leather can do what today 's leather does  but with imagination  probably much more 
 what could the future of animal products look like 
 it need not look like this which is actually the state of the art
  it could be much more like this 
 already we have been manufacturing with cell cultures for thousands of years beginning with products like wine beer and yogurt  and speaking of food 
 our cultured food has evolved  and today we prepare cultured food in beautiful sterile facilities like this a brewery is essentially a bioreactor
  it is where cell culture takes place  
 imagine that in this facility  instead of brewing beer
  we were brewing leather
 or meat
  imagine touring this facility  
 learning about how the leather or meat is cultured  
 seeing the process from beginning to end  
 and even trying some  
 it 's clean  open and educational and this is in contrast to the hidden guarded and remote factories where leather and meat is produced today
  perhaps biofabrication
 is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind  it 's environmentally responsible  efficient
 and humane  it allows us to be creative  we can design new materials new products and
  we need to move past just killing animals
 as a resource to something more civilized and evolved  
 perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured thank you
