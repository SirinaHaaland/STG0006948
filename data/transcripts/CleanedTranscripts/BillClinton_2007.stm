  i thought in getting up to my ted wish
 i would try to begin by putting in perspective
 what i try
  to do and how it fits with
 what they try to do
  we live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent  but insufficient
 in three major ways it is first of all profoundly unequal  
 half the world 's people still living on less than two dollars a day a billion people with no access to clean water two and a half billion no access to sanitation 
 a billion going to bed hungry every night
 one in four deaths every year from aids tb malaria
 and the variety of infections associated with dirty water eighty percent of them under five years of age  even in wealthy countries
 it is common now to see inequality growing in the united states since two thousand and one
 we 've had five years of economic growth five years of productivity growth in the workplace
  but median wages are stagnant
 and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent the percentage of working families without health care up by four percent 
 so this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us which is why we 're all here in
 northern california doing what we do
  enjoying this evening
 is profoundly unequal  it is also unstable  unstable because of the threats of
 terror weapons of mass destruction the spread of global disease
 and a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren 't not so many years ago  
 and perhaps most important of all it is unsustainable because of climate change  resource depletion
 and species destruction 
 when i think about the world i would like to leave to my daughter and the grandchildren i hope to have 
 it is a world that moves
 away from unequal unstable unsustainable interdependence to integrated communities
  nationally and globally that share the characteristics of all successful communities a broadly shared accessible set of opportunities 
 a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise
 and a genuine sense of belonging 
 all easier said than done  when the terrorist incidents occurred in the united kingdom a couple of
  years ago i think even though they didn 't claim as many lives as we lost in the united states on nine eleven i think the thing that troubled the british most was that
 the perpetrators were not invaders but homegrown citizens
 whose religious and political identities were more important to them
 than the people they grew up with went to school with worked with shared weekends with shared meals with in other words
  thought their differences were more important than their common humanity 
 it is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century 
 into this mix people like us who are not in public office have more power to do good than at any time in
  because more than half the world 's people live under governments they voted in and can vote out 
 and even non democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion  
 because
 primarily of the power of the internet people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money
 that can change the world for some public good
  when the tsunami hit south asia the united states contributed one point two billion dollars thirty percent of our households gave half of them gave over the internet  
 the median contribution was somewhere around fifty seven dollars  
 and thirdly because of the rise of non governmental organizations they
 businesses other citizens ' groups have
 enormous power to affect the lives of our fellow human beings
  beings 
 when i became president in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three there were none of these organizations in russia there are now a couple of hundred thousand  
 none in india there are now at least a half a million active 
 none in china there are now two hundred and fifty thousand registered with the government probably twice again that many who are not registered for
 political reasons  
 when i organized my foundation
  and i thought about the world as it is and the world that i
 hope to leave to the next generation  and i tried to be realistic about
 what i had cared about all my life that i could still have an impact on 
 i wanted to focus on activities that would help to
 alleviate poverty
  fight disease  combat climate change  bridge the religious racial and other divides that torment the world  but to do it in a way that would
 either use whatever particular skills we could put together in our group
 to change the way some public good function was performed so that it would sweep across the world more
  you saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with aids drugs and i want to say that the head of
 our aids effort and the person who also is primarily active in the wish i 'll make tonight ira magaziner is here with me and i want to thank him for everything he 's done
  out of office
 and was asked to work first in the caribbean to try to help deal with the aids crisis  
 generic drugs were available for about five hundred dollars a person a year 
 if you bought them in vast bulks you could get them at a little under four hundred dollars the first country we went to work in the bahamas was paying three thousand five hundred dollars for these drugs  
 the market was so terribly disorganized
  that they were buying this medicine through two agents who were gigging them sevenfold 
 so the very first week we were working we got the price down to five hundred dollars and all of a sudden they could save seven times as many lives for the same amount of money 
 then we went to work with the manufacturers of aids medicines one of whom was cited in the film  and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy
 because even at five hundred dollars these drugs were being sold on a 
 basis so we worked on improving the productivity of the operations and the supply chain and went to a 
  absolutely certain payment business i joked that that the main contribution we made to the battle against aids was to get the manufacturers to change from a jewelry store
  to a grocery store strategy  
 but the price went to one hundred and forty dollars from five hundred 
 and pretty soon the average price was one hundred and ninety two dollars now we can get it for about one hundred dollars  
 children 's medicine was six hundred dollars because nobody could afford to buy any of it we negotiated it down to one hundred and ninety
  the french imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax to create a something called unitaid got a bunch of other countries to help that children 's medicine is now sixty dollars a person a year  
 the only thing that is keeping us from
 basically saving the lives of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive are the absence of systems necessary
 to diagnose treat and care for people and deliver this medicine  
  we started a childhood obesity initiative with the heart association in america we tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry right deals
 with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools  
 we just reorganized the markets  and it occurred to me that in this whole
 non governmental world somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets 
  is now what we 're trying to do and working with this large cities group to fight climate change  
 to negotiate huge big volume deals that will enable cities which generate seventy five percent of the world 's greenhouse gases to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a way that is good economics  
 and
  this whole discussion as if it 's some sort of economic burden is a mystery to me i think it 's a bird 's nest on the ground  
 when al gore won his well deserved oscar for the inconvenient truth movie 
 i was thrilled  but i had urged him to make a second movie quickly for those of you who saw an inconvenient truth 
 the most important
 slide in the gore lecture is the last one  which shows here 's where greenhouse gases are going if we
  don 't do anything here 's where they could go and then there are six different categories of things we can do
 to change the trajectory  we need a movie on those six categories  and all of you need to have it embedded in your brains
 and to organize yourselves around it so we 're trying to do that 
 so organizing these markets is one thing we try to do now we have taken on a second thing and this gets to my wish
  it has been my experience in working in developing countries
 that while the headlines may all be the pessimistic headlines may say well we can 't do this that or the other thing because of corruption
 i think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption  and feeds
  we now have the money given these low prices to distribute aids drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach 
 today these low prices are available in the twenty five countries where we work and in a total of sixty two countries and about five hundred and fifty thousand people are getting the benefits of them 
 but the money is there to reach others
  the systems are not there to reach the people so
 what we have been trying to do 
 working first in
 rwanda and then in malawi and other places but i want to talk about rwanda tonight
 is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area that can be used to deal with aids
  infectious diseases maternal and child health and a whole range of health issues
 poor people are grappling with in the developing world that can first be scaled for the whole nation of rwanda and then will be a model that could literally be implemented
 in any other poor country in the world and the test is one will it do the job will it provide high quality care
  will it do it at a price
 that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to ten years  
 because the longer i deal with these problems the more convinced i am that we have to whether it 's economics health education whatever we have to build systems 
 and the absence of systems that function
 break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight you think about whatever your life has been
 however many obstacles you have faced in your life 
 at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the result you achieved 
 in a world with no systems with chaos  everything becomes a guerilla struggle 
  and this predictability is not there  and it becomes almost impossible to save lives educate kids develop economies  whatever 
 the person in my view who has done the best job of this
 in the health care area of building a system in a very poor area
 is dr paul farmer who many of you know has worked for now twenty years
  primarily in haiti where he started but they 've also worked in russia in peru and other places around the world 
 as poor as haiti is in the area where farmer 's clinic is active and they serve a catchment area far greater than
 the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve
 since one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight they have not lost one person to tuberculosis
  and they 've achieved a lot of other amazing health results so
 when we decided to work in rwanda on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the aids problem  we wanted to build a healthcare network because it had been totally destroyed
 during the genocide in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four and the per capita income was still under
 a dollar a day
  asked paul farmer if he would help 
 because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in haiti and a model in rwanda that we could then take all over the country  
 number one it would be a wonderful thing for a country that has suffered as much as any on earth in the last fifteen years and number two 
 we would have something that that could then be adapted to any other poor country
 anywhere in the world and so we have set about
 doing that now we started working together eighteen months ago 
 and we 're working in an area called southern kayonza which is one of the poorest areas in
 rwanda with a group that originally includes about four hundred thousand people 
 we 're essentially implementing what paul farmer did in haiti
  and trains paid community health workers
 who are able to identify health problems  
 ensure that people who have aids or tb are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly  
 who work on bringing about health education clean water and sanitation
  providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care if they have
 problems of the severity that require it 
 the procedures that make this work have been perfected as i said by paul farmer and his team in their work in rural haiti over the last twenty years  
 recently we did an evaluation of the first eighteen months of our efforts in rwanda 
  the results were so good that the rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country 
 and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it i
 'll tell you a little bit about our team because it 's indicative of what we do we have about five hundred people around the world working in our aids program
  some of them for nothing just for transportation room and board  
 and then we have others working in these other related programs 
 our business plan in rwanda was put together under the leadership of diana noble  
 who is  an unusually gifted woman but not unusual in the type of people who have
 been willing to do this kind of work she was the youngest partner at schroder ventures in london in her
  she was ceo of a successful e venture she started and built
 reed elsevier ventures and at forty five she decided she wanted to do something different with her life  
 so she now works full time on this for very little pay  
 she and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this
 health system up for the whole country and it would be worthy of
  the kind of private equity work she used to do
 when she was making a lot more money for it when we came to this rural area forty five percent of the children under the age of five
 had stunted growth
 due to malnutrition
 percent of them died before they reached the age of five  mortality
  over fifteen percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and
 inadequate sanitation
 all entirely preventable and treatable 
 over thirteen percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses again all preventable and treatable  
 and not a single soul in this area was being treated for aids or tuberculosis
  within the first eighteen months
  the following things happened  we went from zero to about two thousand people being treated for aids that 's eighty percent of the people who need treatment in this area  
 listen to this less than four tenths of one percent of those being treated
 stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment that 's lower than the figure in the united states  less than three tenths of one percent
  transfer to the more expensive second line drugs four hundred thousand pregnant women were brought into counseling
 and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system 
 that 's about forty three percent of all the pregnancies about forty percent of all the people i said
 i meant forty thousand about forty percent of all the people who need tb treatment are now getting it in just eighteen months up from zero when we started 
 forty three percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program to prevent malnutrition and early death are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow 
 we 've started the first malaria treatment programs they 've ever had there  
 patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide that we have renovated
 along with
  four other clinics  complete with solar power generators good lab technology  
 we now are treating three hundred and twenty five people a month 
 despite the fact that almost one hundred percent of the aids patients are now treated at home 
 and the most important thing
 is because we 've implemented paul farmer 's model  using community health workers
 we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of rwanda
 for between five and six percent of gdp  and that the government could sustain that
 without depending on foreign aid after five or six years and
  for those of you who understand healthcare economics you know that all wealthy countries
 spend between nine and eleven percent of gdp on health care except for the united states we spend sixteen but that 's a story for another day 
 we 're now working with partners in health and the ministry of health in rwanda and our foundation folks
 to scale this system up
  we 're also beginning to do this in malawi and
 and we have similar projects in tanzania mozambique kenya and ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing to save as many lives as quickly as we can 
 but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world  
  set up the information technology  the solar energy the water and sanitation the transportation infrastructure  
 but over a five to 10 year period we will take down the need for outside assistance
 and eventually it will be phased out my wish
 is that ted assist us in our work and help us to build a high quality rural health system in a poor country rwanda
  that can be a model for africa and indeed for any poor country anywhere in the world  my belief
 is that this will help us to build a more integrated world
 with more partners and fewer terrorists with more productive citizens and fewer haters a place we 'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up
  it has been an honor for me particularly to work in rwanda where we also have a major economic development project
 in partnership with sir tom hunter the scottish philanthropist 
 where last year we using the same thing with aids drugs  cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates
 on microcredit loans by thirty percent
 and achieved three to
 four hundred percent increases in crop yields with the farmers 
 these people have been through a lot
 and none of us most of all me helped them
 when they were on the verge of destroying each other 
 we 're undoing that now and they are so over it and so into their future  
 we 're doing this in an environmentally responsible way
  doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid to the thirty five percent of the people that have no access but to do it with clean energy  
 to have responsible reforestation projects the rwandans interestingly enough have been quite good
 mr wilson in preserving their topsoil
 there 's a couple of guys
 from southern farming families the first thing i did when i went out to this place was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt and see what they 'd done with
