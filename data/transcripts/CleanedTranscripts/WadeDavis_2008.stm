  the imagination as we know it came into being when our species descended from our progenitor homo erectus
  infused with consciousness began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world 
 for a time we shared the stage with our distant cousins neanderthal who clearly had some spark of awareness but whether it was the increase in the size of the brain or the development 
  of language or some other evolutionary catalyst we quickly left neanderthal gasping for survival 
  thousand years ago  our direct ancestors had already  and for five thousand years been crawling into the belly of the earth where in the light of the flickers of tallow candles they had brought into being the great art of the upper paleolithic  
 and i spent two months in the caves of southwest france with the poet clayton eshleman who wrote a beautiful book called juniper fuse and you could look at this art and you could of course see the complex social
  organization of the people who brought it into being 
 but more importantly  it spoke of a deeper yearning something far more sophisticated than hunting magic and the way clayton put it was this way he said you know  
 clearly at some point we were all of an animal nature and at some point  we weren 't and he viewed 
  a kind of original attempt through ritual to rekindle a connection that had been irrevocably lost so he saw this art not as
 hunting magic but as postcards of nostalgia
 and viewed in that light it takes on a whole other resonance and the most amazing thing about the upper paleolithic art
 is that as an aesthetic expression  it lasted for almost twenty thousand years if these were postcards of nostalgia  ours was a very long farewell indeed  
 and it was also the beginning of our discontent because if you wanted to distill all of our experience since the paleolithic it would come down to two words
 how and why and these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged now all people share the same raw  adaptive imperatives we all have children 
 we all have to deal with the mystery of death the world that waits beyond death  the elders who fall away into their elderly years all of this is part of our common experience and this shouldn 't surprise us because after all biologists have finally proven it to be true
  that philosophers have always dreamt to be true and that is the fact that we are all brothers and sisters we are all cut from the same genetic cloth all of humanity probably is descended from a thousand people who who left africa roughly seventy thousand years ago  
 but the corollary of that is that if we all are brothers and sisters and share the same genetic material all human populations share
  the same raw human genius the same intellectual acuity and so whether that genius is placed into technological wizardry has been the great achievement of the west or by 
  contrast into unraveling the complex threads of memory inherent in a myth is simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation there is no progression of affairs in human 
 experience there is no trajectory of progress there 's no pyramid that conveniently places victorian england at the apex and descends down the flanks to the so called primitives of the world
 all peoples are simply cultural options different visions of life itself  
 but what do i mean by different visions of life making for completely different possibilities for existence 
 well let 's slip for a moment into the greatest culture sphere ever brought into being by the imagination that of polynesia  ten thousand square kilometers 
  by watching the reverberation of waves across the hull of their
  knowing full well that every island group in the pacific has its unique refractive pattern that can be read with the same perspicacity with which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint  
 these are sailors who in the darkness in the hull of the vessel can distinguish as many as thirty two different sea swells moving through the canoe at any one point in time distinguishing local wave disturbances 
 from the great currents that pulsate across the ocean that can be followed with the same ease that a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea indeed if you took all
  of the genius that allowed us to put a man on the moon and applied it to an understanding of the ocean what you would get is polynesia  
 and if we slip from the realm of the sea into the realm of the spirit of the imagination  you enter the realm of tibetan buddhism  
 and i recently made a film called the buddhist science of the mind why did we use that word science what is
 science but the empirical pursuit of the truth what is buddhism but two thousand five hundred years of empirical observation as to the nature of mind  i travelled for a month in nepal with our good friend 
 matthieu ricard and you 'll remember matthieu famously said to all of us here once at ted western science is a major response to minor needs we spend all of our lifetime trying to live to be one hundred without losing our teeth  
 the well being of all sentient creatures 
 and with the blessing of trulshik rinpoche  we began a pilgrimage to a curious destination accompanied by a great doctor  
 and the destination was a single room in a nunnery where a woman had gone into lifelong retreat fifty five years before and en route we took darshan from rinpoche  and he sat with
  and told us about the four noble truths the essence of the buddhist path 
 all life is suffering that doesn 't mean all life is negative it means things happen  
 the cause of suffering is ignorance by that the buddha did not mean stupidity he meant clinging to the illusion that life is static and predictable the third noble truth said that ignorance can be 
  overcome and the fourth and most important of course was the delineation of a contemplative practice that not only had the possibility of a transformation of the human heart but had two thousand five hundred years of empirical
  evidence that such a transformation was a certainty  and so when this door opened onto the face of a woman who had not been out of that room in fifty five years you did not see a mad woman 
  you saw a woman who was more clear than a pool of water in a mountain stream  
  you know we don 't really believe you went to the moon but you did you may not believe that we achieve enlightenment in one lifetime but we do 
 and if we move from the realm of the spirit to the realm of the physical to the sacred geography of peru
 i 've always been interested in the relationships of indigenous people that literally believe that the earth is alive responsive to all of their aspirations all of their needs  and of course  the
  population has its own reciprocal obligations 
 i spent thirty years living amongst the people of chinchero
 and i always heard about an event that i always wanted to participate in once each year the fastest young boy in each hamlet is given the honor of becoming a woman  
 and for one day he wears the clothing of his sister and he becomes a transvestite a waylaka  and for that day he leads all able bodied men on a run  but it 's not your ordinary run  you start off at eleven thousand five hundred feet you
  run down to the base of the sacred mountain antakillqa you run up to fifteen thousand feet descend three thousand feet climb again over the course of twenty four hours  
 and of course the waylakama spin the trajectory of the route is marked by holy mounds of earth where coke is given to the earth libations of alcohol to the wind the vortex of the feminine is brought to the
  and the metaphor is clear  you go into the mountain as an individual  but through exhaustion through sacrifice you emerge as a community that has once again reaffirmed its sense of place in the planet  and at forty eight i was the only outsider ever to go through this 
 only one to finish it i only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day than anyone in the 4 000 year history of the plant 
 but these
 localized rituals become pan andean and these fantastic festivals like that of the
  occurs when the pleiades reappear in the winter sky  it 's kind of like an andean woodstock sixty thousand indians on pilgrimage to the end of a dirt road that leads to the sacred 
  valley called the sinakara which is dominated by three tongues of the great glacier  the metaphor is so clear you bring the crosses from your community in this wonderful fusion of christian
  you place the cross into the ice in the shadow of ausangate the most sacred of all apus or sacred mountains of the inca  
 and then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses now these ideas and these events allow us even to deconstruct iconic places that many of you have been to like machu picchu 
 machu picchu was never a lost city on the contrary it was completely linked in to the fourteen thousand
 kilometers of royal roads the inca made in less than a century  but more importantly it was linked in to the andean notions of sacred geography 
 the intiwatana  the hitching post to the sun is actually an obelisk that constantly reflects the light that falls on the sacred apu of machu picchu which is sugarloaf 
  mountain called huayna picchu  if you come to the south of the intiwatana you find an altar  climb huayna picchu find another
  you find to your astonishment that it bisects the intiwatana stone goes to the skyline  hits the heart of salcantay  the second of the most important mountains of the incan empire 
  and then beyond salcantay of course when the southern cross reaches the southernmost point in the sky  directly in that same alignment the milky way overhead  but what is enveloping machu picchu from below the
 sacred river the urubamba or the vilcanota  which is itself the earthly equivalent of the milky way  but it 's also the trajectory that viracocha walked at the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being and where does the river
 rise  
 right on the slopes of the koariti so five hundred years after columbus these ancient rhythms of landscape are played out in ritual 
 now when i was here at the first
  i showed this photograph two men of the elder brothers the descendants  survivors of el dorado these of course  are the descendants of the ancient 
  tairona civilization if those of you who are here remember that i mentioned that they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but
  periods deliberately chosen to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother 's womb 
 all that time the world only exists exists as an abstraction as they are taught the values of their society  values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the 
  cosmic balance  now  the measure of a society is not only what it does but the quality of its aspirations  and i always wanted to go back into these mountains  to see if this could possibly be true as indeed had been reported by the great anthropologist
 reichel dolmatoff so literally two weeks ago i returned from having spent six weeks with the elder brothers on what was clearly the most extraordinary trip of my life  
 these really are a people who live and breathe the realm of the sacred a baroque religiosity that is simply awesome  they consume more coca leaves than any human population
  half a pound per man per day  the gourd you see here is
 everything in their lives is is symbolic their central metaphor is a loom they say upon this loom i weave my life they refer to the movements as they exploit the ecological niches 
  of the gradient as threads when they pray for the dead they make these gestures with their hands spinning their thoughts into the heavens you can see the calcium buildup on the head of
  the gourd is a feminine aspect the stick is a male you put the stick in the powder to take the sacred ashes well they 're not ashes they 're burnt
 limestone to empower the coca leaf to change the ph of the mouth to facilitate the absorption of cocaine hydrochloride 
 but if you break a gourd you cannot simply throw it away because every stroke of that stick that has built up that calcium  the measure of a man 's life has
  fields are planted in such an extraordinary way that the one side of the field is planted like that by the women the other side is planted like that by the men metaphorically you turn it on the side and you have a piece of cloth 
 and they are the descendants of the ancient tairona civilization the greatest goldsmiths of south america who in the wake of the conquest retreated into this isolated volcanic massif that 
  soars to twenty thousand feet above the caribbean coastal plain there are four societies the kogi
 the wiwa the  kankwano
 and the arhuacos  i traveled with the arhuacos  and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man danilo villafane
 if we just jump back here for a second 
 when i first met danilo in the colombian embassy in washington i couldn 't help but say you know you look a lot like an old friend of mine well it turns out he was the son of my friend adalberto from
 the farc  
 and i said danilo you won 't remember this but when you were an infant i carried you on my back up and down the mountains and because of that danilo invited us to go to the very 
  heart of the world a place where no journalist had ever been permitted not simply to the flanks of the mountains but to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims  
  a man who i 've known since one 
 and this is one of those initiates no it 's not true that they 're kept in the darkness for eighteen years but they are kept within the confines of the ceremonial men 's circle 
 for eighteen years this little boy will never step outside of the sacred fields that surround the men 's hut for all that time until he begins his journey of initiation for that entire time the world only exists as an
  abstraction as he is taught the values of society  including this notion that their prayers alone maintain the cosmic balance  before we could begin our journey we had to be cleansed at the portal 
  of the earth  and it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest and you see that the priest never wears shoes because holy feet there must be nothing between the feet and the earth for
  and this is actually the place where the great mother sent the spindle into the world that elevated the mountains and created the homeland that they call the heart of the world  we traveled high into the paramo
 and as we crested the hills we realized that the men were interpreting every single bump on the landscape in terms of their own intense religiosity  and then of course 
 as we reached our final destination a place called mamancana we were in for a surprise because the farc were waiting to kidnap us 
  up being taken aside into these huts hidden away until the darkness  and then abandoning all our gear  we were forced to ride out in the middle of the night in a
 quite dramatic scene it 's going to look like a john ford western
  and we ran into a farc patrol at dawn so it was quite harrowing it will be a very interesting film but what was fascinating is that the minute there was a sense of dangers  the mamos went into a circle of divination 
  this is a photograph literally taken the night we were in hiding as they divine their route to take us out of the mountains  we were able to because we had trained people 
  in filmmaking continue with our work and send our wiwa and arhuaco filmmakers to the final sacred lakes to get the last shots for the film  and we followed the rest of the arhuaco back to the sea  taking the elements from the highlands to the sea
  and here you see how their sacred landscape has been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos  
 and yet still they pray  and it 's an amazing thing to think that this close to miami two hours from miami  there is an entire civilization of 
  people praying every day for your well being they call themselves the elder brothers they dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the younger brothers
  cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the earth  
 now if we slip to another end of the world i was up in the high arctic to tell a story about global warming inspired in part by
 the former vice president 's wonderful book 
 and what struck me so extraordinary was to be again with the inuit a people who don 't fear the cold but take advantage of it a people who
 find a way with their
  imagination to carve life out of that very frozen a people for whom blood on ice is not a sign of death but an affirmation of life 
 and yet tragically when you now go to those northern communities you find to your astonishment that whereas the sea ice used to come in in september and stay till july in a place like kanak in northern 
  greenland it literally comes in now in november and stays until march so their entire year has been cut in half
  now i want to stress that none of these peoples that i 've been quickly talking about here are disappearing worlds these are not dying peoples on the contrary  
 you know if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see you discover that the world is not flat the world remains a rich
 tapestry it remains a rich topography of the spirit these myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being new failed attempts
  being modern they 're unique facets of the human imagination they 're unique answers to a fundamental question what does it mean to be human and alive  and when asked that question 
  they respond with six thousand different voices and collectively those voices become our human repertoire for dealing with the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia 
  shouldn 't suggest to anyone that we have all of the answers for all of the questions that will confront us in the ensuing millennia  the myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us  
  they are unique answers to that fundamental question  what does it mean to be human and alive  
  but the legacy of humanity 's brilliance  right now as we sit here in this room of those six thousand languages spoken the day that you were born fully half aren 't being taught to children 
  so you 're living through a time when virtually half of humanity 's intellectual social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away this does not have to happen 
  these peoples are not failed attempts at being modern quaint and colorful and destined to fade away as if by natural law in every case these are dynamic living
  peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that 's actually an optimistic observation because it suggests that if human beings are the agents of cultural destruction  we can also be and must be the facilitators of cultural survival
