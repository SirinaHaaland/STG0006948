  imagine that a plane is about to crash with two hundred and fifty children and babies and if you knew how to stop that would you 
 now imagine
 that sixty planes full of babies under five
  crash every single day  
 that 's the number of kids that never make it to their fifth birthday  
 six point six million children never make it to their fifth birthday  
 most of these deaths are preventable  and that doesn 't just make me sad it makes me angry
  makes me determined  diarrhea and pneumonia are among the top two killers
 of children under five 
 and what we can do to prevent these diseases isn 't some smart new technological innovations it
 's one of the world 's oldest inventions a
 bar of soap  
 washing hands
  a habit we all take for granted can reduce diarrhea by half can reduce respiratory infections by one third 
 handwashing with soap
 can have an impact on reducing flu 
 trachoma  
 sars  and most recently in the case of cholera and ebola outbreak one of the key interventions
 is handwashing with soap  handwashing with soap keeps kids in school
 it stops babies from dying handwashing with soap is one of the most 
 ways of saving children 's lives it can save over six hundred thousand children every year that 's the equivalent
 of stopping ten jumbo jets full of babies and children from crashing every single day  i think you 'll agree with me
  that 's a pretty useful public health intervention  
 so now just take a minute  i think you need to get to know the person next to you why don 't you just shake their hands  
 please shake their hands all
 right get to know each other they look really pretty all right  
 so what if i told you
  that the person whose hands you just shook
 actually didn 't wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet 
 they don 't look so pretty anymore right  pretty yucky you would agree with me  
 well  statistics are actually showing that four people out of five
 don 't wash their hands when they come out of the toilet globally  
 and the same way we don 't do it when we 've got fancy toilets  running water  and soap available it 's the
  same thing in the countries where child mortality is really high 
 what is it is there no soap  
 actually soap is available 
 in ninety percent of households in india ninety four percent of households in kenya you will find soap  
 even in countries where soap
  we are at fifty percent 
 so why is it why aren 't people washing their hands 
 why is it that mayank 
 this young boy that i met in india  isn 't washing his hands  well 
 in mayank 's family  soap is used for bathing soap is used for laundry soap is used for washing dishes 
 his parents think sometimes it 's a precious commodity so they 'll keep it in a cupboard
 they 'll keep it away from him so he doesn 't waste it  on average in mayank 's family  they will use soap for washing hands once a day
 at the very best and sometimes even once a week for washing hands with soap  what 's the result of that children pick up disease
 in the place that 's supposed to love them and protect them the most in their homes
  think about where you learned to wash your hands  did you learn to wash your hands at home  did you learn to wash your hands in school  
 i think behavioral scientists will tell you that it 's very difficult to change the habits that you have had early in life  
 however we all
  and local cultural norms are something that
 shape how we change our behavior  and this is where the private sector comes in every second
 in asia and africa
 one hundred and eleven mothers will buy this bar to protect their family  many women in india will tell you they learned all about hygiene 
  from this bar of soap from lifebuoy brand iconic brands like this one have a responsibility to do good
 in the places where they sell their products it 's that belief  plus the scale of unilever that allows us to keep
 talking about handwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers 
 big businesses and brands can change and shift those social norms and make a difference for those habits that are so stubborn 
 think about it
 marketeers
 spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other  
 and actually they know how to transform science and facts into compelling messages just for a minute imagine
 when they put all their forces behind a message as
  handwashing with soap
 the profit motive is transforming health outcomes in this world  but it 's been happening for centuries the  lifebuoy brand was launched in 
 in victorian england
 to actually combat cholera last week  i was in ghana
 with the minister of health  because if you don 't know there 's a cholera outbreak in ghana at the moment a hundred and eighteen years
  the solution is exactly the same it 's about ensuring that they have access to this bar of soap 
 and that they 're using it because that 's the number one way to actually stop cholera from spreading  
 i think
 this drive for profit is extremely powerful sometimes more powerful than the most committed charity
 or government government is doing what they can 
  such as cholera or ebola at the moment  but with competing priorities the budget is not always there 
 and when you think about this 
 you think about what is required to make handwashing a daily habit it requires sustained funding
 to refine this behavior 
  in short those
 that fight for public health are actually dependent upon the soap companies to keep promoting handwashing with soap  we have friends
 like usaid 
 the global public private partnership for handwashing with soap  london school of hygiene and tropical medicine  plan wateraid that all believe
 for a 
 partnership  win for the public sector because we help them reach their
  targets  win
 for the private sector because we build new generations of future handwashers and most importantly  win for the most vulnerable 
 on october fifteen we will celebrate global handwashing day schools communities our friends in the public sector
 and our friends in the private sector yes on that day even our competitors we all join hands
  hands to celebrate the world 's most important public health intervention 
 what 's required and again where the private sector can make a huge difference is coming up with this big creative thinking
 that drives advocacy if you take our help a child reach five campaign  we 've created great
  great films that bring the message of handwashing with soap to the everyday person
 in a way that can relate to them 
 we 've had over thirty million views most of these discussions are still happening online i urge you to take five minutes and look at those films 
 i come from mali one of the world 's poorest countries  i grew up in a family where every dinner conversation was around social justice
  i trained in europe 's premier school of public health  i think i 'm probably one of the only women in my country with this high degree in health  
 and the only one with a doctorate in handwashing with soap 
 nine years ago  i decided
  successful public health career in the making 
 that i could make the biggest impact coming 
 selling and promoting the world 's best invention in public health soap  we run today the world 's largest handwashing program
 by any public health standards  we 've reached over one hundred and eighty three million people
 in sixteen countries my team and i have the ambition to reach one billion by
 over the last four years business
 has grown double digits  whilst child mortality has reduced in all the places where soap use has increased  
 it may be uncomfortable for some to hear business growth and lives saved somehow equated in the same sentence
 but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more without it
  and without talking about it we cannot achieve the change that we need 
 last week my team and i spent time
 visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing 
 the death of a newborn  i 'm a mom i can 't imagine anything more powerful
 and more painful 
 this one is from myanmar
  had the most beautiful smile the smile i think that life gives you when you 've had
 a second chance her son myo is her second one she had
 a daughter who passed away at three weeks  
 and we know that the majority of children that actually die die in the first month of their life  
 and we know that if we give a bar of soap to every skilled birth attendant
  and that if soap is used before touching the babies we can reduce and make a change in terms of those numbers  
 and that 's what inspires me inspires me to continue in this mission to know that i can equip her
 with what 's needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world nurturing her newborn  
  and next time you think of a gift
 for a new mom and her family don 't look far buy her soap it 's the most beautiful invention in public health  
 i hope you will join us
 and make handwashing part of your daily lives and our daily lives and help more children like myo reach their fifth birthday  thank you
