  i 'm an ocean chemist i look at the chemistry of the ocean today i look at the chemistry of the ocean in the past
 the way i look back in the past is by using the fossilized remains of deepwater corals you can see an image of one of these corals behind me  it was collected from close to antarctica thousands
  meters below the sea so very different than the kinds of corals you may have been lucky enough to see if you 've had a tropical holiday
  so i 'm hoping that this talk will give you a four dimensional view of the ocean  
 two dimensions  such as this beautiful  two dimensional image of the sea surface temperature  this was taken using satellite so it 's got tremendous spatial
  the overall features are extremely easy to understand the equatorial regions are warm because there 's more sunlight 
 the polar regions are cold because there 's less sunlight and that allows big icecaps to build up on antarctica and up in the northern hemisphere 
 if you plunge deep into the sea  or even put your toes in the sea you know it gets colder as you go down  and that 's mostly because the deep waters that fill the abyss of the ocean come from the cold polar regions where the waters are dense
  travel back in time twenty thousand years ago  the earth looked very much different and i 've just given you a cartoon version of one of the major differences you would have seen if you went back that long 
 the icecaps were much bigger they covered lots of the continent and they extended out over the ocean  
  overall  and much much colder in the polar regions 
 what i 'm trying to understand and what other colleagues of mine are trying to understand is how we moved from that cold climate condition to the warm climate condition that we enjoy today  
 we know from ice core research that the transition from these cold conditions to warm conditions wasn 't smooth as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation
  and we know this from ice cores because if you drill down into ice you find annual bands of ice and you can see this in the iceberg you can see those blue white layers  
 gases are trapped in the ice cores  so we can measure co2 that 's why we know co2 was lower in the past and the chemistry of the ice also tells us about temperature in the polar regions 
  and if you move in time from twenty thousand years ago to the modern day  you see that temperature increased it didn
  't increase smoothly  sometimes it increased very rapidly  then there was a plateau then it increased rapidly it was different in the two polar regions and co2 also increased in jumps  
 so we 're pretty sure the ocean has a lot to do with this the ocean stores huge amounts of carbon about sixty times more than is in the atmosphere it also acts to transport heat across the equator  and the ocean is full of nutrients and it controls
  primary productivity  
 so if we want to find out what 's going on down in the deep sea we really need to get down there see what 's there and start to explore  this is some spectacular footage coming from a seamount 
  about a kilometer deep in international waters in the equatorial atlantic far from land you 're amongst the first people to see this bit of the seafloor
  along with my research team  
 you 're probably seeing new species  we don 't know you 'd have to collect the samples and do some very intense taxonomy  
 you can see beautiful bubblegum corals there are brittle stars growing on these corals  those are things that look like tentacles coming out of corals there are corals made of different forms of calcium carbonate 
 growing off the basalt of this massive undersea mountain and the dark sort of stuff
  going to talk a little more about those as we travel back in time 
 to do that we need to charter a research boat  this is the james cook an ocean class research vessel moored up in tenerife looks beautiful right great if you 're not a great mariner  
 sometimes it looks a little more like this this is us trying to make sure that we don 't lose precious samples everyone 's scurrying around and i get terribly
  's not always a lot of fun but overall it is so
 we 've got to become a really good mapper to do this you don 't see that kind of spectacular coral abundance everywhere it is global and it is deep  but we need 
  to really find the right places  we just saw a global map and overlaid was our cruise passage from last year 
 're traveling from west to east over part of the ocean that would look featureless on a big scale map  but actually some of these mountains are as big as everest 
 so with the maps that we make on board  we get about 100 meter resolution enough to pick out areas to deploy our equipment but not enough to see very much to do that we need to fly remotely operated vehicles about five meters off the seafloor  
 and if we do that we can get maps that
  resolution down thousands of meters here is a 
 vehicle  you can see an array of big lights on the top  there are high definition cameras  manipulator arms  and lots of little boxes and things to put your samples 
 here we are on our first dive of this particular cruise plunging down into the ocean  we go pretty fast to make sure the remotely operated vehicles are not affected by
  any other ships and we go down  and these are the kinds of things you see these are
 deep sea sponges  meter scale  
 this is a swimming holothurian it 's a small sea slug  basically  this is slowed down most of the footage i 'm showing you is speeded up because all of this takes a lot of time  
  and this animal you 're going to see coming up was a big surprise  i 've never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprised this was after about fifteen hours of work and we were all a bit trigger happy and suddenly this giant sea monster started rolling past
 it 's called a  pyrosome or colonial tunicate if you like this wasn 't what we were looking for we were looking for corals  deep sea corals 
 you 're going to see a picture of one in a moment it 's small about five centimeters high
  calcium carbonate so you can see its tentacles there moving in the ocean currents 
 an organism like this probably lives for about a hundred years and as it grows it takes in chemicals from the ocean  and the chemicals or the amount of chemicals depends on the temperature 
  it depends on the ph  it depends on the nutrients and if we can understand how these chemicals get into the skeleton we can then go back collect fossil specimens and reconstruct what the
  ocean used to look like in the past 
 and here you can see us collecting that coral with a vacuum system  and we put it into a sampling container  we can do this very carefully i should add 
 some of these organisms live even longer  this is a black coral called leiopathes an image taken by my colleague brendan roark about five hundred meters below hawaii  four thousand years is a long time if
 you take a branch from one of these corals and polish it up
  this is about one hundred microns across 
 and brendan took some analyses across this coral you can see the marks and he 's been able to show that these are actual annual bands so even at five hundred meters deep in the ocean corals can record seasonal changes  which is pretty spectacular 
 but four thousand years is not enough to get us back to our last glacial maximum  so what do we do we go in for these fossil specimens
  this is what makes
  really unpopular with my research team so going along there 's giant sharks everywhere there are  pyrosomes there are swimming holothurians there 's giant sponges  but i make everyone go down to these 
  dead fossil areas and spend ages kind of shoveling around on the seafloor  and we pick up all these corals  bring them back we sort them out but each one of these is a different
  and if we can find out how old they are and then we can measure those chemical signals this helps us to find out what 's been going on in the ocean in the past  
 so on the left hand image here i 've taken a slice through a coral polished it very carefully and taken an optical image on the right hand side we 've taken that same piece of coral put 
  it in a nuclear reactor  induced fission  and every time there 's some decay  you can see that marked out in the coral so we can see the uranium distribution why are we doing this uranium is a very poorly
  regarded element but i love it the decay helps us find out about the rates and dates of what 's going on in the ocean  and if you remember from the beginning that 's what we want to get at when we 're thinking about climate  
 so we use a laser to analyze uranium and one of its daughter products thorium in these corals  and that tells us exactly how old the fossils are 
 this beautiful animation of the southern ocean i 'm just going to use illustrate how we 're using these corals
  to get at some of the ancient ocean feedbacks  you can see the density of the surface water in this animation by ryan abernathey it
 's just one year of data  but you can see how dynamic the southern ocean is the intense mixing particularly the drake passage  which is shown by the box 
 is really one of the strongest currents in the world coming through here flowing from west to east
  's very turbulently mixed because it 's moving over those great big undersea mountains  and this allows co2 and heat to exchange with the atmosphere in and out and essentially the oceans are breathing through the southern ocean 
 we 've collected corals from back and forth
 across this antarctic passage  and we 've found quite a surprising thing from my uranium dating the corals migrated from south to north
  this transition from the glacial to the interglacial we don 't really know why but we think it 's something to do with the food source and maybe the oxygen in the water 
 so here we are i 'm going to illustrate what i think we 've found about climate from those corals in the southern ocean we
 went up and down sea mountains  we collected little fossil corals  this is my illustration of that 
 we think back in the glacial from the analysis we 've made in the corals that the deep part of the southern
  ocean was very rich in carbon and there was a low density layer sitting on top that stops carbon dioxide coming out of the ocean  
 we then found corals that are of an intermediate age  and they show us that the ocean mixed partway through that climate transition 
 that allows carbon to come out of the deep ocean 
 and then if we analyze corals closer to the modern day  or indeed if we go down there today anyway and measure
 the chemistry of the corals we see that we move to a position where carbon can exchange in and out so this is the way we can use fossil corals to help us learn about the environment
 so i want to leave you with this last slide it 's just a still taken out of that first piece of footage that i showed you  
 this is a spectacular coral garden we didn 't even expect to find things this beautiful  
 it 's thousands of meters deep there are new
  species  
 it 's just a beautiful place there are fossils in amongst and now i 've trained you to appreciate the fossil corals that are down there  
 so next time you 're lucky enough to fly over the ocean or sail over the ocean  just think there are massive sea mountains down there that nobody 's ever seen before  and there are beautiful corals  thank you
