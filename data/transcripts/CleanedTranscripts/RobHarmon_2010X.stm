  this is a river  
 this is a stream  this is a river 
 this is happening all over the country  there are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the united states
  on this map the colored areas represent
 water conflicts 
 similar problems are emerging in the east as well 
 the reasons vary state to state but mostly in the details  
 there are four thousand miles of dewatered streams in montana alone 
 they would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife they 're the veins of the
  ecosystem  and they 're often empty veins 
 i want to tell you the story of just one of these streams  because it 's an archetype
 for the larger story this is prickly pear creek  it runs through a populated area from east helena
 to lake helena it supports wild
  nearly every year
 for more than a hundred years  
 it looked like this in the summer how did we get here  well  it started back in the late 
 when people started settling in places like montana in short there was a lot of water and there weren 't very many people  
 but as more people showed up wanting water the folks who were there first got a little
  concerned 
 and in one thousand eight hundred and sixty five montana passed its first water law it basically said everybody near the stream can share in the stream  
 oddly a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream  and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers  there were precedent setting suits in
  the montana supreme court ruled
 in a case involving prickly pear that the folks who were there first had the first or senior water rights 
 these senior water rights are key the problem is that all over the west now it looks like this 
 some of these creeks have claims for fifty to one hundred times more water than is actually in the stream
 and the senior water rights holders if they don 't use their water right  they risk losing their water right
 along with the economic value that goes with it  so they have no incentive to conserve  so it 's not just about the number of people 
 the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don 't use it
  so after decades of lawsuits and one hundred and forty years now of experience we still have this  
 it 's a broken system  
 there 's a disincentive to conserve because if you don 't use your water right you can lose your water right  
 and i 'm sure you all know this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural
  now i 'm going to change gears here  most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation 's free 
 and some of you 'll be happy to know that it involves beer 
 laughter there 's another thing happening around the country  which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint  
 they 're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water they 're trying to be really efficient with their water use and they 're concerned
  about how their water use affects the image of their brand  well  it 's a national problem but i 'm going to tell you another story from montana and
 it involves beer  
 i bet you didn 't know it takes about five pints of water to make a pint of beer  if you include all the drain  it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of
  the brewers in montana have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption  
 but they still use millions of gallons of water i mean  there 's water in beer  
 so
 what can they do about this remaining water footprint
 that can have serious effects on the ecosystem  these ecosystems are really important to the montana
 brewers and their customers after all there 's a strong correlation between water and fishing and for some there 's a strong correlation between fishing and beer 
 so the montana brewers and their customers are concerned
 and they 're looking for some way to address the problem so how can they address this remaining water footprint  remember prickly pear 
 up until now 
 business water stewardship
 has been limited to measuring and reducing
  and we 're suggesting that the next step is to restore  
 remember prickly pear it 's a broken system you 've got a disincentive to conserve because if you don 't use your water right you risk losing your water right well
 we decided to connect these two worlds the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks in some states
  senior water rights holders can leave their water in the stream while legally protecting it from others  
 and maintaining their water right  
 after all it is their water right  and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream  
 it 's their right to do so  
 but they have no incentive
  to do so  so working with local water trusts  we created an incentive to do so  we pay them
 to leave their water in stream that 's what 's happening here  this individual has made the choice
 and is closing this water diversion  leaving the water in the stream  he doesn 't lose the water right  he just chooses to apply that right  or some portion
 of it to the stream  instead of to the land  
 because he 's the senior water rights holder  he can protect the water from other users in the stream 
 ok he gets paid to leave the water in the stream  
 this guy 's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream
  we then take the measured water we divide it into thousand gallon increments  
 each increment gets a serial number and a certificate  and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded 
  ecosystems the brewers pay to restore water to the stream it
 provides a simple  inexpensive and measurable way to return water to these degraded ecosystems  while giving
  farmers an economic choice
 and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them after one hundred and forty years of conflict
 and one hundred years of dry streams a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved  we
  willing buyer willing seller solution a solution that does not require litigation  it 's about giving
 folks concerned about their water footprints
 a real opportunity to put water where it 's critically needed  into these degraded ecosystems  while at the same time
 providing farmers a meaningful economic choice
 about how their water is used these transactions create allies
  not enemies they connect people rather than dividing them  and they provide needed economic support for rural communities  and most importantly it 's working  
 we 've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems  we 've connected senior water rights holders with brewers in montana with hotels and tea companies 
 in oregon  and with high tech companies that use a lot of water in the southwest and when we make these
  connections  we can and we do turn this into this
