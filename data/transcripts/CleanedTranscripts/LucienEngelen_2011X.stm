  i would like to talk to you about why many ehealth projects fail  
 and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients  
 and one thing we did at radboud university is we appointed a chief listening officer  not in a very scientific way she puts up a little cup of
  coffee or a cup of tea
 and asks patients family relatives what 's up how could we help you 
 and we think we like to think that this is one of the major problems why all
 maybe not all but most of the ehealth projects fail  since we stopped listening this is my weight scale it 's a very simple thing it
  and every morning i hop on it and yes i 've got a challenge as you might see  and i put my challenge on 
 but the thing is that it 's made this simple that whenever i hop on it sends my data to google health as well  
 and it 's collected by my general practitioner as well  so he can see what 's my problem
  in weight not on the very moment that i need cardiologic
 support or something like it but also looking backward  
 but there 's another thing as some of you might know i 've got more than four thousand followers on twitter  so every morning i hop on my weight scale
 and before i 'm in my car people start talking to me i think you need a light lunch today lucien 
 but that 's the nicest thing that could happen since this is peer pressure peer pressure used to help patients
 since this could be used for obesity it could be used to stop patients from smoking 
 but on the other hand it also could be used to get people out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control 
  of their health as of next week  it will soon be available there will be this little blood pressure meter
  and people will be able from their homes to take their blood pressure  send it to their doctor
 and eventually share it with others  for instance  for over a one hundred dollars  
 and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect  not only their own control again be captain of their own ship  
 but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face like
  cost explosion doubled demand and things like that 
 make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team  and you can do this with techniques like this  
 but also by crowdsourcing and
 one of the things we did that i would like to share with you introduced by a little video
 the
  all got navigation controls in our car  we maybe even have it in our cellphone  
  we perfectly know where all the atms are just about the city of maastricht the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are  
 and sure  we could find fast food chains  but where
 would be the nearest aed to help this patient we asked around and nobody knew 
 nobody knew where the nearest lifesaving aed was to be obtained right now  so what we did we crowdsourced the netherlands
 we set up a website  and asked the crowd if you see an aed please submit it
  tell us where it is tell us when it 's open since sometimes in office hours it 's closed of course  
 and over ten thousand aeds in the netherlands already have been submitted the next step we took was to find the applications for it  and we built an ipad application  
 we made an application for layar  augmented reality to find these aeds and whenever you
  and somebody collapses you can use your iphone and within the next weeks also your microsoft cellphone to find the nearest aed which can save lives  
 and as of today  we would like to introduce this not only as aed4eu which is what the product is called  but also
 and we would like to start this on a worldwide level  
 and ask all of our colleagues in the rest of the world colleague universities to help us to find and work and act like a hub to crowdsource
  all these aeds all around the world that whenever you 're on holiday and somebody collapses  might it be your own relative
 or someone just in front of you you can find this 
 the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us validate these aeds these might be courier services or cable guys for instance  just to see whether the aed that is submitted is still in place  
 so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better but take control of it
