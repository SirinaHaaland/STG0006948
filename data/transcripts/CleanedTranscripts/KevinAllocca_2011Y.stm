  the trends manager at youtube and i professionally watch youtube videos it 's true 
 so we 're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters we all want to be stars
 celebrities singers
  i was younger that seemed so very very hard to do 
 but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world 's culture
  any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday but there are over forty eight hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute  
 and of that only a tiny
  tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment so
 how does it happen three things tastemakers communities of participation and unexpectedness
  shot outside his home in yosemite national park in two thousand and ten it was viewed twenty three million times 
 this is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer  
 but he didn 't actually set out to make a viral video bear he just wanted to share a rainbow  because that 's what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear 
 and he had posted lots of nature videos in fact and
 this video had actually been posted all the way back in january  so what happened here 
 jimmy kimmel actually jimmy kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become  because
 tastemakers like jimmy kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience
  think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope 
 rebecca black 's friday is one of the most popular videos of the year it 's been seen nearly two hundred million times this year  
 this is a chart of what it looked like and similar to double rainbow it seems to have just sprouted
  up out of nowhere 
 so what happened on this day  well it was a friday this is true  
 and if you 're wondering about those other spikes those are also fridays 
 laughter but what about this day this one particular friday  well
  picked it up a lot of blogs starting writing about michael j nelson from mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twitter but what 's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience accelerating the process  
 and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it and now there are ten thousand parodies of friday
  even in the first seven days there was one parody for every other day of the week 
 unlike the one way entertainment of the 20th century this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon either by spreading it or by doing something new with it
  is a looped animation with looped music it 's this just like this it 's been
 viewed
 nearly fifty million times this year  and if you think that that is weird you should know that there is a three hour version of this that 's been viewed four million times 
 even cats were watching this
  what 's important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this this techie  geeky internet culture there were
  someone made an old timey version 
 and then it went international 
 an entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from
 being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of because we don 't just enjoy now we participate  
 and who could have predicted any of this who could have predicted double rainbow or rebecca black or nyan cat what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it
  in a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute  only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have 
 when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in new york city i admit i wasn 't very interested
  by being totally surprising and humorous casey niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times  and so this approach
  what does it mean  
 tastemakers creative participating communities complete unexpectedness 
 these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity
  i mean as mentioned earlier one of the biggest stars in the world right now justin bieber got his start on youtube 
 no one has to green light your idea and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture  
 and these are not characteristics of old media and they 're barely true of the media of today 
 but they will define the entertainment of the future  thank you
