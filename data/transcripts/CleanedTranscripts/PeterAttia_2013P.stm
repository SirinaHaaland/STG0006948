  never forget that day back in the
 spring of two thousand and six 
 i was a surgical resident at the johns hopkins hospital  taking emergency call  i got paged by the e r around two in the morning
 to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer on her foot
 can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as i pulled the curtain back
 to see her 
 and everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital that wasn 't being asked  the question that was being asked of me was a different one which was 
 did she also need an amputation
 now  looking back on that night  i 'd love so desperately to believe that
  that i treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion i 'd shown the 
 newlywed who came to the e r three nights earlier with lower back pain
 that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer  in her case i knew there was nothing i could do that
  actually going to save her life the cancer was too advanced but i was committed to making sure that
 i could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable  i brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee
 i
 brought some for her parents  but more importantly  see i passed no judgment on her because obviously she had done nothing to bring this on herself 
 so why was it that just a few nights later as i stood in that same
  diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation  why did i hold her in such bitter contempt  
 you see unlike the woman the night before this woman had type two diabetes  
 she was fat  and we all know that 's from eating too much and not exercising enough right  
 i mean how hard can it be 
  i looked down at her in the bed i thought to myself if you just tried caring even a little bit you wouldn 't be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you 've never met about to amputate your foot  
 why did i feel justified in judging her  
 i 'd like to say i don 't know but i actually do you see in the hubris of my youth  i
 i thought i had her all figured out she ate too much she got unlucky she got diabetes  case closed  
 ironically at that time in my life i was also doing cancer research immune based therapies for melanoma to be specific and in that world i was actually taught to question
  everything to challenge all assumptions and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards  
  melanoma  i never once questioned the conventional wisdom i actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science 
 three years later  i found out how wrong i was  but this time i was the patient
  despite exercising three or four hours every single day and following the food pyramid to the letter  i 'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called
  metabolic syndrome some of you may have heard of this i had become
 you can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat whether we burn it or store it this
 is called fuel partitioning in the lingo  now failure to produce enough insulin
  and insulin resistance as its name suggests is when your cells get increasingly resistant to the effect of insulin trying to do its job  once you 're 
  on your way to getting diabetes which is what happens when your pancreas can 't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin 
 now your blood sugar levels start to rise  and an entire cascade of pathologic events
 sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease cancer
  alzheimer 's disease  and amputations just like that woman a few years earlier 
 with that scare i got busy changing my diet radically  adding and subtracting things most of you would find almost assuredly shocking 
 i did this and lost forty pounds weirdly while exercising less i 
 as you can see i guess i 'm not overweight anymore more importantly i don 't have insulin resistance  
 but most
  important i was left with these three burning questions that wouldn 't go away  
 how did this happen to me if i was supposedly doing everything right 
 if the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me was it possible it was failing someone else  
 and underlying these questions  i became almost maniacally obsessed
 in trying to understand the real relationship
  between obesity and insulin resistance  
 now most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance  
 logically then if you want to treat insulin resistance you get people to lose weight right  you treat the obesity 
 but what if we have it backwards what if obesity isn 't the cause of insulin resistance at all in fact what if it 's a symptom of a much deeper problem
 the tip of a proverbial iceberg
  i know it sounds crazy because we 're obviously in the midst of an obesity epidemic  but hear me out what if obesity is a coping mechanism
 for a far more sinister problem going on underneath the cell  
 i 'm not suggesting that obesity is benign but what i am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils
 you can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity of our cells to partition fuel as i alluded to a moment ago  
 taking those calories that we take in and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately 
 when we become insulin resistant the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state so now when insulin says to
  i want you to burn more energy than the cell considers safe the cell in effect says no thanks  i 'd actually rather store this energy 
 and because fat cells are actually missing most of the complex cellular machinery found in other cells it 's probably the safest place to store it 
 so for many of us about seventy five million americans 
 the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat not the reverse
 getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat 
 this is a really subtle distinction  but the implication could be profound 
 consider the following analogy think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table
  the bruise hurts like hell and you almost certainly don 't like the discolored look  but we all know the bruise per se is not the problem 
 in fact it 's the opposite it 's a healthy response to the trauma all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury to salvage cellular debris
 and prevent the spread of infection to elsewhere in the body now  imagine we thought bruises were the
  and we evolved a giant medical establishment and a culture around treating bruises  
 masking creams  painkillers you name it all the while ignoring the fact that people are still banging their shins into coffee tables 
 how much better would we be if we treated the cause
 telling people to pay attention when they walk through the living room
 rather than the effect getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world
  getting it wrong and the pharmaceutical industry can still do very well for its shareholders but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins 
 cause
 and effect  
 so what i 'm suggesting is maybe we have the cause and effect wrong on obesity and insulin resistance
  maybe we should be asking ourselves is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight
  gain and the diseases associated with obesity at least in most people 
 what if being obese is just a metabolic response to something much more threatening  an underlying epidemic  
 the one we ought to be worried about 
 let 's look at some suggestive facts we know that thirty million obese americans in the united states don 't have insulin
  and by the way they don 't appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people conversely we know that six million lean people in the united states are 
 and by the way they appear to be at even greater risk for those metabolic diseases i mentioned a moment ago than their obese counterparts now i don 't know why but it might be because 
 in their case their cells haven 't actually figured out the right thing to do with that excess energy  
  resistance  and you can be lean and have it this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy for what 's going on 
 so what if we 're fighting the wrong war fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance  
 even worse what if blaming the obese means we 're blaming the victims 
 what if some of our fundamental ideas about
  obesity are just wrong  
 personally i can 't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore  let alone the luxury of certainty 
 i have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this  but i 'm wide open to others  now my hypothesis because everybody always asks me is this 
 if you ask yourself what 's a cell
 cell trying to protect itself from when it becomes insulin resistant the answer probably isn 't too much food it 's more likely too much glucose  blood sugar 
 now we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run and there 's even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly 
 so if you put these physiological processes to work  
 i 'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains sugars and starches that 's driving this epidemic
  obesity and diabetes  but through insulin resistance you see  and not necessarily through just overeating and and 
 when i lost my forty pounds a few years ago i did it simply by restricting those things  which admittedly suggests i have a bias based on my personal experience
  but that doesn 't mean my bias is wrong and most important all of this can be tested scientifically  
 but step one is accepting the possibility that our current beliefs about obesity diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong and therefore must be tested 
 i 'm betting my career on this today  i devote all of my time to working on this problem
  go wherever the science takes me  i 've decided that what i can 't and won 't do anymore
 is pretend i have the answers when i don 't  i 've been humbled enough by all i don 't know 
 for the past year i 've been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country  
 and the best part is just like
  abraham lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals we 've done the same thing we 've recruited a team of scientific rivals the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses for what 's at the heart of this epidemic some think it 's
 too many calories consumed others think it 's too much dietary fat others think it 's too many refined grains and starches  but this team of 
 highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things
 this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer 
 and two if we 're willing to be wrong if we 're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom
 with the best experiments science can offer we can solve this problem  
 i know it 's tempting to want an answer right now some form of action or policy some dietary prescription eat this not that
 but if we want to get it right we 're going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription 
 briefly to address this our research program is focused around three meta themes or questions first  how do the various foods we consume impact our metabolism hormones and enzymes and through what nuanced
  based on these insights can people make the necessary changes in their diets in a way that 's safe and practical to implement 
 and finally  once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their diet 
 how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the default
 rather than the exception just because you know what to do doesn 't mean you 're always going to do it sometimes we have to put cues around
  around people to make it easier  and believe it or not that can be studied scientifically  
 i don 't know how this journey is going to end  but this much seems clear
 to me at least we can 't keep blaming
 our overweight and diabetic patients like i did 
 most of them actually want to do the right thing  but they have to know what
  that is and it 's got to work  i dream of a day when
 our patients can shed their excess pounds
 and cure themselves of insulin resistance  because as medical professionals 
 we 've shed our excess mental baggage and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently
 to go back to our original ideals
 open minds the courage to throw out yesterday 's ideas when they don 't appear to be working
  and the understanding that scientific truth isn 't final  but constantly evolving  
 staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science
  if obesity is nothing more than a proxy
 for metabolic illness
 what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy  
 sometimes i think back to that
 night in the e r seven years ago  i wish i could speak with that woman again i 'd
 like to tell her how sorry i am i 'd
  a doctor i delivered the best clinical care i could
  but as a as a
 human being  i let you down
  you didn 't need my judgment and my contempt  you needed my empathy
 and compassion and above all else  you needed a doctor who was willing to consider
 maybe you didn 't let the system down maybe the system
  of which i was a part was letting you down  if you 're watching this now i hope you can forgive me
