  i 'm going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope 
 when we go to the physician today when we go to the doctor 's office and we walk in there are words that we just don 't want to hear  
 there are words that we 're truly afraid of 
 diabetes
  cancer  parkinson 's alzheimer 's heart failure lung failure things that we know
 are debilitating diseases for which there 's relatively little that can be done  and what i want to lay out for you today is
 a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease  why it 's important  why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if if you think it already hasn
 and where we are clinically today  and where we might go tomorrow and what some of the hurdles are  and we 're going to do all of that in eighteen minutes i promise 
 i want to start with this slide because this slide sort of tells the story the way science magazine thinks of it this was an issue from two thousand and two that they published with a lot of different articles
  on the bionic human it was basically a regenerative medicine issue regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple
 concept that everybody can understand it 's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale
  so we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there
 we know that if we have a damaged hip you can put an artificial hip in and this is the idea that science magazine used on their front cover  this is the complete
  antithesis of regenerative medicine this is not regenerative medicine 
 regenerative medicine is what business week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago the idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate 
  symptoms with devices and drugs and the like and i 'll come back to that theme a few times instead of doing that we will regenerate lost function of the body
  by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue  so that at the end of the treatment you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment 
 very few good ideas if you agree that this is a good idea very few good ideas are truly novel  and this is just the same 
 if you look back in
  charles lindbergh who was better known for flying airplanes was actually one of the first people along with alexis carrel one of the nobel laureates from rockefeller 
 to begin to think about could you culture organs and they published this book in 
 where they actually began to think about what could you do in 
 to grow whole organs  we 've come a long way since
 i 'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that 's going on but before doing that what i 'd like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you 
 many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life and reducing poverty and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe 
 one of the challenges is is that the richer we are the longer we live 
  and the longer we live the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older  this is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population 
  over the age of sixty five and you can basically see that the richer a country is 
 population is thirty 
 then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again maybe a little bit of asthma  if the average age in your country is forty five to fifty five
 now the average person is looking at diabetes early onset diabetes heart failure coronary artery disease things that are inherently more difficult to treat and much more expensive to treat just have a look at the demographics in
  who were basically outside of being really sick paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease in two thousand and ten 
 two workers per retiree in the u s and this is matched in every industrialized wealthy country
  treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this this is age versus cost of health care  and you can see that right around
 age forty five forty to forty five there 's a sudden spike in the cost of health care it
 's actually quite interesting if you do the right studies
  you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care plotted over your lifetime and about seven years before you 're about to die there 's a spike  
 and you can actually
 there are very few things very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat
 these kinds of diseases and experience
  what i would call healthy aging i
 'd suggest there are four things and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system all those things do is change who pays  they don 't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is 
 one thing you can do is not treat you can ration health care  
 we won 't talk about that anymore it 's too depressing you can prevent  obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention
 but perhaps most interesting to me anyway and most important is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression  and then 
  treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom think of it in terms of diabetes for instance 
  for ten twenty thirty forty years and we do ok  insulin 's a
 pretty good therapy but eventually it stops working and diabetes leads to a predictable
 onset of of debilitating disease  why couldn 't we just inject the pancreas with something
 to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease perhaps even before it was symptomatic  and it might be a little bit
  expensive at the time that we did it but if it worked  we would truly be able to do something different 
 this video  i think gets across the concept that i 'm talking about quite dramatically  this is a newt re growing its limb  
 if a newt can do this kind of thing why can 't we i
 'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment but what we 're talking about in
  regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body  for tissues and for for organs themselves  
 so today
 today 's reality is that if we get sick  the message is we will treat your symptoms and you need to adjust to a new way of life 
 i would pose to you that tomorrow
 and when tomorrow is we could debate  but it
  's within the foreseeable future we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation there 's a limb prosthetic up here similar actually one on the
 soldier that 's come back from iraq there are three hundred and seventy soldiers that have come back from iraq that have lost limbs  
 imagine if instead of facing that they could actually face the regeneration of that
  it 's a wild concept i 'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept  
 but it 's applicable again to every organ system how can we do that the way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body we need to learn to speak the body 's language 
 and to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus 
 a mammalian fetus if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy will re grow that limb
  dna has the capacity
 to do these kinds of wound healing mechanisms it 's a natural process  but it is lost as as we age 
 in a child before the age of about six months if they lose their fingertip
 in an accident they 'll re grow their fingertip by the time they 're five they won 't be able to do
  so to engage in that conversation with the body we need to speak the body 's language and there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today 
 i 'm going to give you an example of three of these
 tools through which to converse with the body  the first is cellular therapies  clearly  
 we heal ourselves in a natural process using cells to do most of the work 
  if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body  they may do the healing 
 secondly we can use materials we heard yesterday about the importance of new materials if we can invent materials  design materials or extract materials 
  from a natural environment then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself and finally we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal 
  example of each of these and i 'm going to start with materials steve badylak who 's at the university of pittsburgh about a decade ago had a remarkable idea and that idea was that the small intestine of a pig  
 if you threw away all the cells and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active may contain all
  all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself and he asked a very important question he asked the question if i take that material which is a natural 
  material that usually induces healing in the small intestine and i place it somewhere else on a person 's body 
  response or would it make small intestine if i tried to make a new ear  i wouldn 't be telling you this story if it
  about to show you
 is a compelling picture 
 however for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends the lights are down this is a good time to look at your feet 
 check your blackberry do anything other than look at the screen what i 'm about to show you
  diabetic ulcer  and although
 it 's good to laugh before we look at this this is the reality of diabetes i think a lot of times we hear about diabetics diabetic ulcers we just don 't connect
 the ulcer with the eventual treatment which is amputation if you can 't heal it so i 'm going to put the slide up now it won 't be up for long this is a
  the treatment for this is amputation this is an older lady she has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes  and has decided to die with what ' s left of her body intact  
 and
 this lady decided after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer that she would try this this new therapy that steve invented that 's what the wound looked like eleven weeks later that material contained only natural signals  
 and that material induced the body
  to switch back on a healing response that it didn 't have before there 's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you i 'll let you know when you can look again  
 this is a horse the horse is not in pain  if the horse was in pain i wouldn 't show you this slide the horse just has another nostril that 's developed because of a riding accident  
 just a few weeks after treatment
  this case taking that material turning it into a gel 
 and packing that area and then repeating the treatment a few times and the horse heals up and if you took an ultrasound of that area  it would look great here 's a dolphin where the fin 's been re attached there are now four hundred thousand patients around the world
 who have used that material to heal their wounds could you regenerate a limb  darpa just gave steve fifteen million
  project to begin the process of asking that question and i 'll show you the fifteen million dollar picture  
 this is a seventy eight year old man who 's lost the end of his fingertip remember that i mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips  after treatment that 's what it looks like 
 this is happening today this is clinically relevant today  there are materials that do this
  here are the heart patches but could you go a little further could you say instead of using material can i take some cells along with the material 
 and remove a damaged piece of tissue put a bio degradable material on there you can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish  this was done by teruo okano 
 at tokyo women 's hospital he can actually grow beating tissue in a dish  he chills the dish  it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish
  'm going to show you cell based regeneration  
 and what i 'm going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient again if you 're squeamish  you don 't want to watch but this one 's kind of cool 
 so  this is a bypass operation just like what al gore had
 with a difference in this case at the end of the bypass operation you 're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure
 being injected directly into the heart of the patient 
 and i 'm standing up here because at one point i 'm going to show you just how early this technology is here go the stem cells right into the beating heart of the patient and
 if you look really carefully it 's going to be right around this point you 'll actually see a back flush you see the cells coming back out
 we need all sorts of new technology new devices to get the cells to the right place
 at the right time 
 just a little bit of data a tiny bit of data this was a randomized trial at this time this was an n of twenty now there 's an n of about one hundred 
 basically if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass they get a little bit better if you give them stem cells as well as their bypass for these particular patients they became asymptomatic 
 these are now two years out
  the coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early  
 and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state  this is the same procedure but now done minimally invasively with only three holes in the body where they 're taking 
  the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure there go the cells we don 't have time to go into all of those details  but basically that works too you can take
  patients who are less sick  and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state
 through that kind of therapy  here 's another example of stem cell therapy that isn 't quite clinical yet but i think very soon will be 
 this is the work of kacey marra from pittsburgh  along with a number of colleagues around the world they 've decided that liposuction fluid which in the united states we have a lot of liposuction fluid
  it 's a great source of stem cells stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid so you could go in you could get your tummy tuck 
 out comes the liposuction fluid  and in this case the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons 
 all done in the lab  and i think fairly soon you will see patients being treated with their
  i talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease here 's just one example before i close up this is equally tragic we have a very abiding and 
  and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the institute for surgical research in the us army who have to treat the now eleven thousand
  treat it everything that is done to treat burn basically we do a sodding approach  we
 make something over here  and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound and we try and get the two to take 
 in this case here a new wearable bio reactor has been designed it should be tested clinically later this year at isr
  will lay down in the wound bed  
 the gun that you see there sprays cells that 's going to spray cells over that area the reactor will serve to fertilize the environment  deliver other things as well at the same time 
 and therefore we will seed
 that lawn as opposed to try the sodding approach it 's a completely different way of doing it 
 so my eighteen minutes is up so let me finish up with some good news  and maybe a little
  bit of bad news  the good news
 is that this is happening today  it 's very powerful work clearly the images kind of get that across it 's incredibly difficult because it 's highly inter disciplinary 
 almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen a
  number of governments and a number of regions have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease the japanese government were perhaps the first when they decided to invest first three billion later another two billion
 in this field it 's no coincidence japan is the oldest country on earth in
 terms of its average age  they need this to work or their health system dies  so they 're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this
  the same thing china just launched a national tissue engineering center the first year budget was two hundred and fifty million us dollars 
 in the united states we 've had a somewhat different approach 
 oh for al gore to come and be in the real world as president  
 we 've had a different approach and the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along but there 's been no strategic investment
 to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way
