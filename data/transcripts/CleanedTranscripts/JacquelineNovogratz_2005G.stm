  i want to start with a story a la seth godin from when i was twelve years old
  my uncle ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater at least i thought it was beautiful  and it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach  and
 mount kilimanjaro and mount meru were kind of right across the chest that were also fuzzy and i
  it whenever i could thinking it was the most fabulous thing i owned until
 one day in ninth grade when i was standing with a number of the football players and my body had clearly changed and matt who was
 undeniably my nemesis in high school said in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to
 go on ski trips but we could all ski on mount novogratz
 i was so humiliated and mortified that i immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater  
 we drove to the goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously my idea being that i would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again 
 fast forward eleven years later
  the
 steep slopes when i see ten feet in front of me a little boy eleven years old running toward me  wearing my sweater  
 and i 'm thinking
 no this is not possible but so curious i run up to the child
 of course scaring the living bejesus out of him grab him by the collar turn it over and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater i tell that
  story because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this earth  we so often don 't realize what our action and our inaction
 does to people we think we will never see and never know  
 i also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be that this traveled into the goodwill
  in virginia 
 and moved its way into the larger industry which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to africa and asia  
 which was a very good thing providing low cost clothing and at the same time certainly in rwanda  it destroyed the local retailing industry 
 not to say that it shouldn 't have but that we have to get better at answering the
  where i was doing two things i had started a bakery with twenty unwed mothers we were called the bad news bears and our notion was we were going to corner the
 snack food business in kigali which was not hard because there were no snacks before us  and because we had a good business model
  we actually did it  and i watched these women transform on a micro level but at the same time i started a micro finance bank and tomorrow iqbal quadir is going to talk about grameen which is the
 grandfather of all micro finance banks  which now is a worldwide movement you talk about a meme but then
 it was quite new  especially in an economy that was moving from barter into trade we got a lot of things right we focused on a business model
 we insisted on skin in the game the women made their own decisions at the end of the day as to how they would use this access to credit
 to build their little businesses earn more income so they could take care of their families better 
 what we didn 't understand what was happening all around us with the
 confluence of fear  ethnic strife
 and certainly an aid game if you will that was playing into
 this
  invisible but certainly palpable
 movement inside rwanda  that at that time  thirty percent of the budget was all foreign aid  
 the genocide happened in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four seven years after these women all worked together to build this dream 
 and the good news was that the institution 
 the banking institution  lasted in fact it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country
  the bakery was completely wiped out but the lessons
  for me were that accountability counts
 got to build things with people on the ground using business models where as steven levitt would say the incentives matter  
 understand however complex we may be incentives matter so when chris raised to me
 how wonderful everything
 that was happening in the world that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist on the one hand i absolutely agree with him
  and i was so thrilled to see what happened with the g8 that the world  because of people like tony blair and bono and bob geldof
 the world is talking about global poverty the world is talking about africa in ways i have never seen in my life it 's thrilling and at the same time  
 what keeps me up at night is a fear that we 'll
  fifty billion dollars in increased aid to africa forty billion in reduced debt
 as the victory as more than chapter one as our moral absolution and in fact what we need to do is see that as chapter one 
 celebrate it close it and recognize that we need a chapter two that is all about execution all about the how to and if you remember one thing from
 i want to talk about today 
 it 's that the only way to end poverty to make it history 
 is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services
 to the poor in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable if we do that we really can make poverty history  and it was that that
 whole philosophy that encouraged me to start
 my
  which is trying to build some mini blueprints for how we might do that
 in water health and housing in pakistan india  kenya tanzania and egypt  and i want to talk a little bit about that and
 some of the examples so you can see what it is that we 're doing 
 but before i do this and this is another one of my pet peeves i want to talk a little bit about who the poor are because we too often talk about them as these
 strong huge masses of people yearning to be free
  in fact it 's quite an
 amazing story on a macro level 
 four billion people on earth make less than four dollars a day that 's who we talk about when we think about the poor 
 if you aggregate it it 's the third largest economy on earth and yet most of these people go invisible 
 where we typically work there 's people making between one and three dollars a day  who are these people they
  farmers and factory workers they work in government offices they 're drivers they
 are domestics they typically
 pay for critical goods and services like water like healthcare  like housing  and they pay thirty to forty times what their middleclass counterparts pay
 certainly where we work in karachi and nairobi the
 poor also are willing to make and do make smart decisions if you give them
  opportunity so two examples one is in india  where there are two hundred and forty million farmers most of whom make less than two dollars a day  
 where we work in aurangabad  the land is extraordinarily parched 
 you see people on average making sixty cents to a dollar this guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named ami tabar what he did was see what was happening
  in israel larger approaches and
 figure out how to do a drip irrigation which is a way of of bringing water directly to the plant stock 
 but previously previously it 's only been created for  large scale farms so ami tabar took this
 and modularized it down to an
 eighth of an acre a couple of principles build small make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor this family
  sarita and her husband bought a 15 dollar unit when they were living in a literally a 
  with a corrugated iron
 roof after one harvest they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter acre a
 couple of years later i meet them they now make four dollars a day which is pretty much middle class for india  and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just
 laid to build their house and i swear you could see the future in that
  woman 's eyes  something i truly believe you can 't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets and i again give jeffrey sachs of harvard huge
 kudos for bringing to the world this notion of his rage for five dollars you can save a life  malaria is a disease that kills
 one to three million people a year three hundred
  to five hundred million cases are reported it 's estimated that africa loses about thirteen billion dollars a year to the disease 
 five dollars can save a life we can send people to the moon we can see if there 's life on mars why can 't we get five dollar nets to five hundred million people 
 the question though is not why can 't we the question is
 how can we help africans do this for themselves a lot of hurdles one production is too low two price is too high three 
 this is a good road in
 in right near where our factory is located distribution is a nightmare but not impossible we started by making a
  loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in africa so that they could transfer technology from japan and build these 
  nets  here are just some pictures of the factory 
  three years later  the company has employed another thousand women
  it contributes about six hundred thousand dollars in wages to the the economy of tanzania it 's the largest company in tanzania  
 the throughput rate right now is one point five million nets three million by the end of the year we hope to have seven million
 at the end of next year  
 so the production side is working on the distribution side though as a world we have a lot of work to do right now ninety five percent of these nets are being bought by the
  then given primarily to people
 around africa 
 we 're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of africa 
 people their women and so i want you to meet jacqueline my namesake twenty one years old 
 if she were born anywhere else but tanzania i 'm telling you she could run wall street she runs two of the lines
  and has
 already saved enough money to put a down payment on her house she makes about two dollars a day  is creating an education fund and told me she is not
 marrying nor having children until these things are completed  
 and so when i told her about our idea that maybe we could take a tupperware model from the united states 
 and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others
 she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up
 we
 took a lesson from ideo one of our favorite companies  and quickly did a prototyping on this and
 took jacqueline into the area where she lives  she brought ten of the women with whom she
 interacts together to see if she could sell these nets five dollars apiece despite the fact that people say
 nobody will buy one and we learned a lot about how you sell things not coming in with our own notions because she didn 't even talk about malaria
  until the very end first she talked about comfort status beauty 
 these nets she said you put them on the floor bugs leave your house children can sleep through the night the house looks beautiful you hang them in the window  and we 've started making curtains  
 and not only is it beautiful but people can see status that you care about your children only then did she talk about saving
  your children 's lives  a lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor
