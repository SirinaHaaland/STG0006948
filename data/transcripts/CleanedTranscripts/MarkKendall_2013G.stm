  it 's a pleasure to be here in edinburgh  scotland the birthplace of the needle and syringe  less than a mile from here in this direction 
  a scotsman filed his very first patent on the needle and syringe his name was alexander wood  and it was at the royal college of
 physicians 
 this is the patent 
 what blows my mind when i look at it even today is that it looks almost identical to the needle in use today  yet it 's one hundred and sixty years old  
 so we turn to the field of vaccines most vaccines are delivered with the needle and
  and credit where it 's due on many levels vaccines are a successful technology  after clean water
 and sanitation vaccines are the one technology that has increased
 our life span the most that 's a pretty hard act to beat  but just like any other technology vaccines have
  the needle and syringe is a key part within that narrative this old technology  
 so let 's start with the obvious many of us don 't like the needle and syringe  i share that view  
 however  twenty percent of the population have a thing called needle phobia  that 's more than disliking the needle that is actively avoiding being vaccinated because of needle phobia  
 and that 's problematic in terms of the rollout
  rollout of vaccines  
 now related to this is another key issue which is needlestick injuries  
 and the who has figures that suggest about one point three million deaths per year take place due to 
 with needlestick injuries these are early deaths that take place  
 now these are two things that you probably may have heard of but there are two other shortcomings of the needle and syringe you may not
  have heard about one is it could be holding back the next generation of vaccines in terms of their immune responses and the second is that it could be
 responsible for the problem of the cold chain that i 'll tell you about
 as well  i 'm going to tell you about some work that my team and i are doing in australia at the university of queensland
 on a technology designed to tackle those four problems  and that
  is called the nanopatch now  this is a specimen of
 the nanopatch to the naked eye
 it just looks like a square smaller than a postage stamp but under a microscope
 what you see
  thousands of tiny projections that are invisible to the human eye  and there 's about four thousand projections on this particular square compared to to the needle and
 i 've designed those projections to serve a key role which is to work with the skin 's immune system
  so that 's a very important function tied in with the nanopatch now we make
 with a technique called deep
  and this particular technique is one that 's been borrowed from the semiconductor industry  and therefore is low cost and can be rolled out in large numbers 
 now we dry coat vaccines to the projections
 of of the nanopatch and apply it to the skin  now the simplest form of application
 is using our finger  but our finger has some limitations
  so we 've devised an applicator and it 's a very simple device you could call it a sophisticated finger it 's a spring operated device 
 what we do is when we apply the nanopatch to the skin as so 
 immediately a few things happen  so firstly the projections on the nanopatch breach through the tough 
  outer layer and the vaccine is very quickly released within less than a minute in fact  
  off and discard it and indeed we can make a reuse of the applicator itself  
 so that gives you an idea of the nanopatch and immediately you can see some key advantages we 've talked about it being needle free
 these are projections that you can 't even see and of course we get around the needle phobia issue as well  
 now if we take a step back and think about these
  other two really important advantages one
 is improved immune responses through delivery  and the second is getting rid of
 the cold chain  
 so let 's start with the first one this immunogenicity idea it takes a little while to get our heads around but i 'll try to explain it in simple terms so i 'll
 take a step back and explain to you how vaccines work in a simple way  
 so vaccines work by
  introducing into our body
 a thing called an antigen
 which is a safe form of a germ
  now that safe germ that antigen tricks our body into mounting an immune response learning and remembering how to deal with intruders 
 when the real intruder comes along
 the body quickly mounts an immune response to deal with that vaccine and neutralizes the infection  so it does that well
  now  the way it 's done today with the needle and syringe most vaccines are delivered that way with this old technology and the needle but it could be argued
 that the needle is holding back
 our immune responses it 's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin  to describe this idea 
 we need to take a journey through the skin  starting with one of those projections
 and applying the
  to the skin 
 and we see this kind of data  
 now  this is real data that thing that we can see there is one projection from the nanopatch that 's been applied to the skin and those colors are different layers now to give you an idea of scale 
  if the needle was shown here it would be too big it would be ten times bigger than the size of that screen going ten times deeper as well it 's off the grid entirely 
  skin  that red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin but the brown layer and the magenta layer are jammed full of of immune cells  
 as one example in the brown layer there 's a certain type of cell called a langerhans cell every square millimeter of our body is jammed
 full of those langerhans cells those immune cells and there 's others shown as well that we haven 't stained in this image  but you can immediately see that the
  that penetration indeed we target
 thousands upon thousands of these particular cells just residing within a hair 's width of the surface of the skin  
 now  as the the guy that 's invented this thing and designed it to do that i found that exciting  
 but so what so what if you 've targeted cells in the world of vaccines what does that mean the world of vaccines is getting better
  getting more systematic  however you still don 't really know if a vaccine is going to work until you roll your sleeves up and vaccinate and wait  
 it 's a gambler 's game even today  
 so we had to do that gamble  we
 obtained an influenza vaccine we applied it to our nanopatches and we applied the  nanopatches to the skin and we waited and this is in the live animal we waited
  month  and this is what we found out this is a data slide showing the immune responses that we 've generated with a nanopatch compared to
 the needle and syringe into muscle  so on the horizontal axis we have the dose shown in nanograms on the vertical axis we have the immune response generated and 
 that that dashed line indicates the protection threshold if we 're above that line it
  considered protective  if we 're below that line it 's not 
 so the red line is mostly below that curve and indeed there 's only one point that is achieved with the needle that 's protective  and that 's with a high dose of six thousand nanograms  
 but notice immediately the distinctly different curve that we achieve with the blue
 line that 's what 's achieved with the nanopatch the delivered dose of the nanopatch is a completely different
 that 's a real fresh opportunity  suddenly we have a brand new lever in the world of vaccines we can push it one way  where we can take a vaccine that works but 
  is too expensive and can get protection with a hundredth of the dose compared to the needle 
  that currently don 't work
 and get them over that line and get them protective  
 and certainly in the world of vaccines that can be important let 's consider the big three  hiv  malaria  tuberculosis they 're responsible for about seven million deaths per year and there is no adequate vaccination method for any of those 
 so potentially with this new lever
  we can help
 make that happen  we can push that lever to help get those candidate vaccines
 over the line now of course we 've worked within my lab with many other vaccines that have attained similar responses and similar curves
 to this what we 've achieved with influenza i 'd
 like to now switch to talk about another key shortcoming of today 's vaccines and that is the need to maintain the cold chain 
 as the name suggests the cold chain
  requirements of keeping a vaccine right from production all the way through to when the vaccine is applied to keep it refrigerated 
 now that presents some logistical challenges but we have ways to do it 
  this is a slightly extreme case in point
 but it helps illustrate the logistical challenges
 to get vaccines refrigerated and maintain the cold chain if the vaccine is too too warm
 the vaccine breaks down but interestingly it can be too cold and the vaccine can break down as well  
 now  the stakes are very high the who estimates that within africa up to half the vaccines used there
 are considered to not be working properly because at some point the cold chain has fallen
  over  so it 's a big problem and it 's tied in with the needle and syringe because it 's a liquid form vaccine and when it 's liquid it needs the refrigeration 
 a key attribute of our nanopatch is that the vaccine is dry  and when it 's dry it doesn 't need refrigeration
 within my lab we 've shown that we can keep the vaccine stored at twenty three degrees celsius for more than a year without any loss in activity at all
  that 's an important improvement we
 're delighted about it as well 
 and the thing about it is that we have well and truly proven the nanopatch within the laboratory setting  
 and as a scientist  i love that and i love science  however  
 as an engineer
  a biomedical engineer and also as a human being i 'm not going to be satisfied until we 've rolled this thing out taken it out of the lab and got it to people in large numbers and particularly the people that need it the most  
 so we 've commenced this particular journey  and we 've commenced this journey in an unusual way we 've started with
  papua new guinea  now papua new guinea
 is
 an example of a developing world country  it 's about the same size as france  
 but it suffers from many of the key barriers existing within the world of today 's vaccines 
 there 's the logistics within this country there are only eight hundred refrigerators to keep vaccines chilled many of them are old like this one in port moresby  many of them are breaking down and many are not in the highlands where
 that 's a challenge  
 but also papua new guinea has the world 's highest incidence of hpv human papillomavirus the cervical cancer [ risk factor ] 
 yet  that vaccine is not available in large numbers because it 's too expensive  so for those two reasons with the attributes of the nanopatch we 've got into the
  taken it to papua new guinea and we 'll be following that up shortly
  the birthplace of the needle and syringe
