  it is very fashionable
 and proper to speak about food in all its forms all its colors  aromas
  after the food goes through the
 digestive system 
 when it is thrown out as crap 
 it is no longer fashionable to speak about it it is rather revolting 
 i 'm a guy who has graduated from
  gram vikas which means village development organization 
 was working in the area of renewable energy on the most part we were producing biogas 
 biogas for
 rural kitchens  we produce
  person that i am i would like to call it bullshit  
 but realizing later on how important were
 sanitation and the disposal of crap in a proper way  
 we
  in india
 and most developing countries
 are because of poor quality water  
 and when we look at the reason for poor quality water you find that it is our abysmal attitude to the disposal of human waste
  rawest form  finds its way back to
 drinking water  bathing water  washing water  irrigation water  whatever water you see  
 and this is the cause for eighty percent of the diseases
 in rural areas in
  it is unfortunately
 only the women who carry water  so for all domestic needs women have to carry water  
 so that is a pitiable
 state of affairs 
 open defecation is rampant seventy percent of india defecates in the open 
 they sit there out in the open with the wind on their sails  hiding their faces
  their bases  and sitting there in pristine glory
 seventy percent of india and if you look at the world total  
 sixty percent of all the crap that is thrown into the open is by indians
  i don 't know if
 we indians can be proud of such a distinction 
 so we 
 together with a lot of villages we began to talk about how to really address this situation of sanitation 
 and we came together and formed
 a project called mantra mantra stands for movement and action network for transformation of rural areas
 so we are speaking about transformation transformation in rural areas 
 villages that agree to implement this project  
 they organize a legal society where the general body consists of all members
 who elect a group of men and women who implement the project and
  on who look after the operation and maintenance  they decide to build a toilet
 and a shower room  and from
 a protected water source water will be brought to an elevated water reservoir and
 piped to all households through
  three taps one in the toilet one in the shower one in the kitchen twenty four hours a day 
 the pity is that our cities like new delhi and bombay  do not have
  which is very much accepted by the government bureaucracy and all those who matter that poor people deserve poor solutions
 and absolutely poor people deserve pathetic solutions this combined with a nobel
  most economic is the heady cocktail that the poor are forced to drink
 we are fighting against this  we feel that
 the poor have been humiliated for centuries  and
 even in sanitation  they should not be humiliated sanitation is more about dignity than about
  human disposal of waste  and so you build these toilets and very often we have to hear that
 the toilets are better than their houses and you can see that in front are the attached houses
 and the others are the toilets so these people
  a single exception of a family in a village decide to build a toilet a bathing room  and
 for that they come together collect all the local materials local materials like rubble  
 sand  aggregates 
 usually a government subsidy is available to meet at least part of the cost of external materials like cement steel toilet commode
 and they build a toilet and a bathing room  
 also all the unskilled laborers that is daily wage earners  mostly landless are given an opportunity to be trained as masons and
 plumbers so while these people are being trained others are collecting the materials  and when both are
  ready  they build
 a toilet a shower room  and of course also a
 water tower  an elevated water reservoir 
 we use a system of two leach pits to treat the waste  from the toilet the muck comes into the first leach pit  
 and when it is full it is blocked and it can go
  to the next  but we discovered that
 if you plant banana trees  papaya trees on the periphery of these leach pits 
 they grow very well because they suck up all the nutrients and you get
 very tasty
 bananas papayas if any of you come to
  i would be happy to share these bananas and papayas with you so there you can see
 the completed toilets the water towers this is in a village where most of the people  are even illiterate  
 it is always a 24 hour water supply because
 water gets polluted very often when you store it a child dips his his or her hand into it
 something falls into it so no water is stored it 's always on tap 
 this is how an elevated water reservoir is constructed  and that is the end product  
 because it has to go high  
 and there is some space available  two or three rooms are made under the water tower  which are used by the village for different
  committee meetings  we have had clear evidence
 of the great impact of this program  
 before we started there were as usual more than eighty percent of people suffering from waterborne diseases  but
 after this  we have empirical
  usually used to spend especially in the summer months about six to seven hours a day
 carrying water  
 and when they went to carry water  because as i said earlier it
 's only women who carry water they used to take their
 little children girl children  also to carry water or else to be back at home to look after the siblings  so there
  nine percent of girl children attending school even if there was a school  and boys  about thirty percent  
 but girls it has gone to about
 ninety percent and boys  almost to one hundred percent 
  vulnerable section in a village are the landless laborers who are the daily wage earners 
 because they have gone through this training to be masons and plumbers
 and bar benders  now their ability to earn has increased
 three hundred to four hundred percent  so this is a democracy in action because
  governing board the committee people are questioning people are governing themselves  people are learning to manage their own affairs  
 they are taking their own futures into their hands  
 and
 that is democracy at the grassroots level in action 
 more than one thousand two hundred villages have so far done this 
 it benefits over four hundred thousand people
 and it 's still going on and i hope it continues to move ahead 
 for india
 and such developing countries armies and armaments  
 software companies and spaceships
 may not be as important as
 taps and toilets  thank you  thank you very much
