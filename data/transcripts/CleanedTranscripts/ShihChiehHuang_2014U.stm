  i was born in taiwan  i grew up surrounded by different types of hardware stores  
 and i like going to night markets  i love the energy of the night markets  the colors the lights the toys and all the unexpected things i find every time i go
  like watermelon with straw antennas or puppies with mohawks 
 when i was growing up i liked taking toys apart  any kind of toys i 'd find around the house like my brother 's bb gun when he 's not home  
 i also liked to make environments for people to explore and play 
 in these early installations  i would take plastic sheets plastic bags and things i would find in the hardware store or around the house
 i would take things like highlighter pen  mix it with water  pump it through plastic tubing creating these
 glowing circulatory systems for people to walk through and enjoy  
 i like these materials because of the way they look the way they feel  and they 're very affordable  
 i also liked to make devices that work with body parts i would take camera led lights and a bungee cord and strap it on my waist and i would
  videotape my belly button  get a different perspective  and see what it does 
 i also like to modify household appliances  this is an automatic night light some of you might have them at home  
 i would cut out the light sensor add an extension line and use modeling clay  stick it onto the television  
 and then i would videotape my eye and using the dark part of my eye tricking the sensor into thinking it 's night
  time so you turn on the lightbulb the white of the eye and the eyelid will trick the sensor into thinking it 's daytime and it will shut off the light  
 i wanted to collect more different types of eyes so i built this device using bicycle helmets  some lightbulbs and television sets it
 would be easier for other people to wear the helmet
 and record their eyes  this device allows me to symbolically extract other people 's
  eyes so i have a diversity of eyes to use for my other sculptures  
 this sculpture has four eyes  each eye is controlling a different device 
 this eye is turning itself around in a television  
 this eye is inflating a plastic tube
  this eye is watching a video of another piece being made  and these two eyes are activating glowing water 
 many of these pieces are later on shown in museums  biennials triennial exhibitions around the world  
 i love science and biology in two thousand and seven i was doing a research fellowship at the smithsonian natural history museum looking at bioluminous organisms in the oean 
 i love these creatures i love the way they look the way they feel they 're soft they 're slimy  
 and i was fascinated by the way they use light in their environment  either to attract mates for self defense or to attract food  
 this research inspired my work in many different ways things like movement or different light patterns 
 so i started gathering a lot of different
  types of material
 in my studio and just experimenting and trying this out trying that out and seeing what types of creatures i can come up with i used a lot of computer cooling fans
 and just kind of put them together and see what happens  
 this is an 8 000 square foot installation composed of many different creatures some hanging from the ceiling and some resting on the floor 
 from afar they look alien like but when you look closer they 're all made out of black garbage
 bags or tupperware containers
