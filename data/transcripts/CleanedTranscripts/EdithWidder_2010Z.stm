  people protect what they love i want to share with you today what i love most in the ocean  and that 's the incredible number and variety of animals in it that make
  my addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called wasp that 's not an acronym just somebody thought it looked like the insect it
 was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of two thousand feet 
 right after i completed my ph d i was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists that was using it for the first time as a tool for ocean exploration 
 we trained in a tank in port hueneme  and then my first open ocean dive was in santa barbara channel
 it was an evening dive
  i went down to a depth of eight hundred and eighty feet and turned out the lights 
 and the reason i turned out the lights is because i knew i would see this phenomenon of animals making light called bioluminescence 
 but i was totally unprepared for how much there was and how spectacular it was 
 i saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores that were longer than this room pumping out so much light
  that i could read the dials and gauges inside the suit without a flashlight and
 puffs and billows of what looked like luminous blue smoke  
 and explosions of sparks that would swirl up out of the thrusters just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire but these were icy blue embers  it was breathtaking  
 now usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all it 's these guys
  are a few other  land dwellers that can make light some insects earthworms fungi
 but in general on land it 's really rare 
 in the ocean it 's the rule rather than the exception 
 if i go out in the open ocean environment virtually anywhere in the world and i drag a net from three thousand feet to the surface 
 most of the animals
  in fact in many places  eighty to ninety percent of the animals that i bring up in that net make light  
 this makes for some pretty spectacular light shows  
 now i want to share with you a little video that i shot from a submersible i first developed this technique working from a little single person submersible called deep rover
 and then adapted it for use on the johnson sea link which you see here  so  mounted in front of the observation
  with a screen stretched across it and inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera that 's about as sensitive as a fully dark adapted human eye albeit a little
 fuzzy  
 so you turn on the camera turn out the lights that sparkle you 're seeing is not luminescence that 's just electronic noise on these super intensified cameras you don 't see luminescence until the submersible begins to move forward through the water but as it does 
  animals bumping into the screen are stimulated to bioluminesce 
 now when i was first doing this all i was trying to do was count the numbers of sources i knew my forward speed i knew the area  and so i could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter but i started to realize that i could actually identify animals by the type of flashes they produced  
 and so here in the gulf of maine at seven hundred and forty feet i can name pretty much everything you 're seeing there to the species
  like those big explosions sparks are from a little comb jelly and there 's krill and other kinds of crustaceans and jellyfish  
 there was another one of those comb jellies
  and so i 've worked with computer image analysis engineers to
 develop automatic
 recognition systems that can identify these animals and then extract the xyz coordinate of the initial impact point  and we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do
  and do nearest neighbor distances  
 but you don 't always have to go down to the depths of the ocean to see a light show like this you can actually see it in surface waters this is some shot by dr mike latz at scripps institution of a dolphin 
  swimming through bioluminescent plankton and this isn 't someplace exotic like one of the bioluminescent bays in puerto rico  this was actually shot in san diego harbor  and sometimes you can see it even closer than that because
  with
 unfiltered seawater that often has bioluminescent plankton in it so if you stagger into the head late at night and you 're so  toilet hugging sick that you forget to turn on the light you may think that you 're having a religious experience 
 so  how does a living creature make light well that was the question that 19th century french physiologist raphael dubois asked about this bioluminescent clam 
 he ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals one
  enzyme he called luciferase  the substrate he called luciferin
 after lucifer the lightbearer that terminology has stuck but it doesn 't actually refer to specific chemicals because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms 
 in fact most of the people studying bioluminescence today are focused on the chemistry because these chemicals have proved so incredibly valuable for developing antibacterial agents  cancer fighting drugs
  testing for the presence of life on mars detecting pollutants in our waters which is how we use it at orca in two thousand and eight the
 nobel prize in chemistry was awarded for work done on a molecule called green fluorescent protein that was isolated isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry of a jellyfish  
 and it 's been equated to the invention of the microscope in terms of the impact that it has had on cell biology
  and genetic engineering 
 another thing all these molecules are telling us that apparently bioluminescence has evolved at least forty times maybe as many as fifty separate times in evolutionary history which is a clear indication of how
 spectacularly important this trait is for survival so what is it about bioluminescence that 's so important to so many animals well  for animals that are
  trying to avoid predators by
 staying in the darkness light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive  
 and that 's find food attract a mate and avoid being eaten 
 so for example this fish has a  built in headlight behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attracting
  a mate and then when it 's not using it it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your lamborghini 
 this fish actually has high beams  
 and this fish which is one of my favorites has three headlights on each side of its head now this one is blue 
 and that 's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication 
 so most animals make blue light and most animals can only see blue light
  but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs  and i have no idea why there 's two and that 's something i want to solve some day
 but not only can it see blue light but it can see red light 
 so it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper 's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen 
 it 's also got a little chin
  barbel here with a blue luminescent lure on it that it can use to attract prey from a long way off and a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure  
 this is another one of my favorite fish this is a viperfish 
 and it 's got a lure on the end of a long fishing rod that it arches in front of the toothy jaw that gives the viperfish its name 
  teeth on this fish are so long that if they closed inside the mouth of the fish it would actually impale its own brain  
 so instead it slides in grooves on the outside of the head  
 this is a christmas tree of a fish everything on this fish lights up it 's not just that lure  it 's got a  built in flashlight  it 's got these jewel like light 
  organs on its belly that it uses for a type of camouflage that obliterates its
 it makes itself disappear  
 it 's got light organs in the mouth it 's got light organs in every single scale in the fins in a mucus layer on the back and the belly all used for different things some of which we know about some of which we don 't 
 and we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to pixar and i 'm very grateful to pixar for sharing my favorite topic with so many people i do
  with their budget that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money to pay a consulting fee to some poor starving graduate student who could have told them that those are the eyes of a fish that 's been preserved in formalin 
 these are the eyes of a living anglerfish  
 so  she 's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey  
 and this one has a lure with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it now we used to think that the different
  shape of the lure was to attract different types of prey  but then stomach content analyses on these fish done by scientists or more likely their graduate students 
 have revealed that they all eat pretty much the same thing 
 so now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world 
 because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males 
 this little guy has
  no visible means of self support 
 he has no lure for attracting food and no teeth for eating it when it gets there 
 his only hope for existence on this planet is as a gigolo 
 he 's got to find himself a babe and then he 's got to latch on for life so this little guy
 has found himself this babe and you will note that he 's had the good sense to attach himself in a way that
  have to look at her 
 but he still knows a good thing when he sees it and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss  
 his flesh fuses with her flesh her bloodstream grows into his body and he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac 
 laughter well this is a deep sea version of women 's lib  she always knows
  and she doesn 't have to be monogamous because some of these females come up with
 multiple males attached 
 so they can use it for finding food for attracting mates they use it a lot for defense many different ways 
 a lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud this shrimp is actually
 spewing light out of its mouth like a fire breathing dragon in order to blind or distract this viperfish so that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness  and there are a lot of different
  that can do this there 's jellyfish there 's squid  there 's a whole lot of different crustaceans
 there 's even fish that can do this this fish is called the shining tubeshoulder because it actually has a tube on its shoulder that can squirt out light  and i was luck enough to capture one of these when we were on a trawling expedition off the northwest coast of africa for blue planet
  for the deep portion of blue planet and we were using a special trawling net that
 we were able to bring these animals up alive so we captured one of these and i brought it into the lab so i 'm holding it and i 'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder
  and when i do you 'll see bioluminescence coming out
  but to me what 's shocking is not just the amount of light but the fact that it 's not just luciferin and luciferase  for this
  actually whole cells with nuclei and membranes  it 's energetically very costly for this fish to do this and we have no idea why it does it another one of these great mysteries that needs to be solved  
 now  another form of defense is something called a burglar alarm same reason you have a burglar alarm on your car the honking horn and flashing lights are meant to attract the attention 
 of hopefully the police that will come and take the burglar away when an animal 's caught in the clutches of a predator its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention
  of something bigger and nastier that will attack their attacker thereby affording them a chance for escape this jellyfish for example has a spectacular bioluminescent display  
 this is us chasing it in the submersible that 's not luminescence that 's reflected light from the gonads we capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible that allows us to bring it up in
  really pristine condition 
 bring it into the lab on the ship and then to generate the display you 're about to see all i did was touch it once per second on its nerve ring with a sharp pick that 's sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish  and once this display gets going i 'm not touching it anymore  
 this is an unbelievable light show  it 's this pinwheel of light  and i 've done calculations that show that this could be seen from as much as three hundred feet away
 by a predator  and i
  you know that might actually make a pretty good lure 
 because one of the things that 's frustrated me as a deep sea explorer is how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about because of the way we explore the ocean 
 the primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean is we go out and drag nets behind ships  and i defy you to name any other branch of science that still depends on hundreds of year old technology 
 the other primary way is we go down with submersibles and
  hundreds of dives in submersibles 
 when i 'm sitting in a submersible though i know that i 'm not unobtrusive at all i 've got bright lights and noisy thrusters any animal with any sense is going to be long gone  
 so i 've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore and so sometime ago i got this idea for a camera
  it 's not exactly rocket science we call this thing eye in the sea 
 and scientists have done this on land for years we just use a color that the animals can 't see and then a camera that can see that color you can 't use infrared in the sea  we use far red light
  but even that 's a problem because it gets absorbed so quickly made an intensified camera wanted to make this electronic jellyfish  
  so i couldn 't get the funding for this so i kluged this together i got the harvey mudd engineering clinic to actually do it as an undergraduate student project initially and then i kluged funding from 
  a whole bunch of different sources monterey bay aquarium research institute gave me time with their rov so that i could test it and we could figure out you know for example which colors of red light
  we had to use so that we could see the animals but they couldn 't see us get the electronic jellyfish working and you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was because 
  we cast these sixteen blue leds in epoxy and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used the word ziploc is still visible 
  on film by photographer mark richards who happened to be there at the precise moment that we discovered that it all came together that 's me on the left my graduate student at the time erika raymond 
 and lee fry who was the engineer on the project and we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor with the caption engineer satisfying two women
  and we were very very happy so now we had a system that we could actually take to some place that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean that might be patrolled by large predators  
 and so  the place that we took it to was this place called a brine pool which is in the northern part of the gulf of mexico it 's a magical place  and i know this footage isn 't going to look like anything to you we had a crummy camera at the
  at the edge of the brine pool there 's a fish that 's swimming towards the camera  it 's clearly undisturbed by us  and i had my window into the deep sea i for the first 
  time could see what animals were doing down there when we weren 't down there disturbing them in some way 
  after it went into its pinwheel display we recorded this  
 this is a squid  over six feet long that is so new to science it cannot be placed in any known scientific family 
 i could not have asked for a better proof of concept and based on this i went back to the national science foundation and said this is what we will discover and they gave me enough money to do it right 
 which has involved developing the world 's first deep sea webcam which has been installed in the monterey canyon for the past year and now more recently a
 modular form of this system a much more mobile form
 that 's a lot easier to launch and recover that i hope can be used on sylvia 's hope spots to help explore and protect these areas and for me learn more about the bioluminescence
  messages here is 
 there is still a lot to explore in the oceans and sylvia has said that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what 's in them and she 's right 
 so if you ever ever get an opportunity to take a dive in a submersible say yes a thousand times yes
 and please turn out the lights i promise
