  you 've heard that there 's a pack of giant asteroids headed for the united states all scheduled to strike within the next fifty years 
 now i don 't mean actual asteroids made of rock and metal that actually wouldn 't be such a problem because if we were really all going to die  we would put aside our differences
  we 'd spend whatever it took and we 'd find a way to deflect them  
 i 'm talking instead about threats that are headed our way  but they 're wrapped in a special energy field that polarizes us and therefore paralyzes us 
 last march i went to the ted conference  and i saw jim hansen speak the nasa scientist who first raised the alarm about global warming in the  1980s and it seems that the predictions he made back then are coming true 
  is where we 're headed in terms of global temperature rises  and if we keep on going the way we 're going we get
 temperature rise by the end of this century hansen says we can expect about a five meter rise in sea levels  this is what a five meter rise in sea levels would look like low lying cities all around the world
 will disappear within the lifetime of children born today  hansen closed his talk
  by saying imagine a giant asteroid on a collision course with earth that is the equivalent of what we face now yet we dither  
 taking no action to deflect the asteroid even though the longer we wait  the more difficult and expensive it becomes 
 of course the left wants to take action  but the right denies that there 's any problem
  all right so i go back from ted
  and then the following week i 'm invited to a dinner party in washington d c where i know that i 'll be meeting a number of conservative intellectuals including yuval levin 
 and to prepare for the meeting i read this article by levin in national affairs called beyond the welfare state 
 levin writes
 that all over the world nations are coming to terms with the fact that the social democratic welfare state
  is turning out to be untenable and unaffordable dependent upon dubious economics and the demographic model of a bygone era 
 all right now this might not sound as scary as an asteroid but look at these graphs that levin showed this graph shows the national debt
 as a percentage of america 's gdp  and as you see if you go all the way back to the founding we borrowed a lot of money to fight the revolutionary war
  wars are expensive but then we 'd pay it off pay it off pay it off and then oh what 's this the civil war even more expensive borrow a lot of money pay it off pay it off pay it off get down to near zero 
 and bang world war i once again the same process repeats now then we get the great depression and world war ii we rise to an astronomical level around one hundred and eighteen percent of gdp 
 's partly due to tax cuts that were unfunded  but it 's due primarily to the rise of entitlement spending especially medicare  
 we 're approaching the levels of indebtedness we had at world war ii and the baby boomers haven 't even retired yet  and when they do 
 this is what will happen this is data from the congressional budget office
  showing its most realistic forecast of what would happen if current situations and expectations and trends are extended 
 all right now what you might notice is that these two graphs are actually identical 
 not in terms of the x and y axes or in terms of the data they present but in terms of their moral and political implications  they say the same thing let me translate for you 
 we are doomed unless we start acting now what 's wrong with you people on the other side in the other party can 't you see reality
 if you won 't help then get the hell out of the way we can deflect both of these asteroids these problems are both technically solvable 
 our problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper partisan times the mere fact that one side says look there 's an asteroid 
 means that the other side 's going to say huh what no i 'm not even going to look up no 
  to understand why this is happening to us  and what we can do about it we need to learn more about moral psychology  
 so i 'm a social psychologist and i study morality and one of the most important principles of morality is that morality binds and blinds 
 it binds us into teams that circle around sacred values
 but thereby makes us go blind to objective reality  think of it like this
 large scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet there are only a few species that can do it 
 that 's a beehive that 's a termite
  mound a giant termite mound  and when you find this in other animals it 's always the same story they 're always all siblings
 who are children of a single queen so they 're all in the same boat  they rise or fall they live or die  as one 
 there 's only one species on the planet that can do this without kinship  and that of course is us  this is a reconstruction
  of ancient babylon and this is tenochtitlan now how did we do this  how did we go from being  hunter gatherers ten thousand years ago
 to building these gigantic cities in just a few thousand years it 's miraculous  and part of the explanation
 is this ability to circle around sacred values as you see temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations 
 this is an image of muslims circling the kaaba in mecca  it 's a sacred rock and when people
  circle something together they unite they can trust each other they become
 one  
 it 's as though you 're moving an electrical wire through a magnetic field that generates current when people circle together they generate a current we love to circle around things we circle around 
  flags and then we can trust each other we can fight as a team as a unit  
 the circling blinds them it causes them to distort reality  we begin separating everything into good versus evil 
 now that process feels great it feels really satisfying  but it is a gross distortion of reality  
 you can see the moral electromagnet operating in the u s congress  this is a graph that shows the degree to which voting in congress falls strictly along the
  axis so that if you know how liberal or conservative someone is you know exactly how they voted on all the major issues  
 and what you can see is that in the decades after the civil war congress was extraordinarily polarized as you would expect about as high as can be  
 but then after world war i things dropped and we get this historically low level of polarization this was a golden age of bipartisanship at least in terms of the parties
  ability to work together and solve grand national problems  
 but in the   1980s and ' 90s the electromagnet turns back on polarization rises  
 it used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals could all work together in congress they could rearrange themselves form bipartisan committees 
 but as the moral electromagnet got cranked up 
 the force field increased
 democrats and republicans were pulled apart  it became much harder for them to socialize much harder for them to cooperate 
 retiring members nowadays say that it 's become like gang warfare 
 did anybody notice that in two of the three debates obama wore a blue tie and romney wore a red tie do you know why they do this  
 it 's so that the bloods and the crips will know which
 side to vote for
  polarization is strongest among our political elites nobody doubts that this is happening in washington  but for a while there was some doubt as to whether it was happening among the people well
 in the last twelve years it 's become much more apparent that it is 
 so look at this data this is from the american national elections survey  and what they do on that survey is they ask what 's called a feeling thermometer rating so how warm or cold do you feel about
  the republican party the democratic party all sorts of groups in american life 
 the blue line shows how warmly democrats feel about democrats and they like them you
 know ratings in the 70s on a 100 point scale republicans like republicans that 's not a surprise but when you look at cross party ratings you find well that it 's lower  
 but actually when i first saw this data i was surprised that 's actually not so bad if you go back to the carter and even reagan administrations
 they were rating the other party
 's not terrible 
 it drifts downwards very slightly but
 now look what happens under george w bush and obama  it plummets something is going on here the moral electromagnet is turning back on and nowadays just very recently 
 democrats really dislike republicans republicans really dislike the democrats we 're changing  it 's as though the moral electromagnet
 is affecting us too it 's like
 put out in the two oceans and it 's pulling the whole country apart pulling left and right into their own territories like the bloods and the crips 
 now there are many reasons why this is happening to us  and many of them we cannot reverse  we will never again have a political class
 that was forged by the experience of fighting together in world war
  against a common enemy  we will never again have just three television networks all of which are relatively
 centrist and we will never again have a large group of conservative southern democrats
 and liberal northern republicans making it easy making there be a lot of overlap for bipartisan
  so for a lot of reasons those decades after the second world war were an historically anomalous time we will never get back to those low levels of polarization i believe
  but there 's a lot that we can do there are dozens and dozens of reforms we can do that will make things better because a lot of our dysfunction can be traced directly to things that congress did to itself 
 in the 1990s that created a much more polarized and dysfunctional
 and they list a whole bunch of reforms i 'm just going to group them into three broad classes here  so if you think about this as the problem of a dysfunctional hyper polarized institution well  the first step is 
 do what you can so that fewer hyper partisans get elected in the first place  and when you have closed party primaries and only the most committed republicans and democrats are voting you 're nominating and selecting
 the most extreme
 so open primaries would make that problem much much less severe  but the problem isn 't primarily that we 're electing bad people to congress 
 from my experience and from what i 've heard from from congressional insiders most of the people going to congress are good hard working intelligent people who really want to solve problems but once they get there 
 they find that they are forced to play a game
 that rewards hyper partisanship and that punishes independent
  thinking you step out of line you get punished 
 so there are a lot of reforms we could do that will counteract this for example this citizens united ruling is a disaster  because it means there 's like a money gun aimed at your head  and if you step out of line if 
  you try to reach across the aisle there 's a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent to make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising  
  of social relationships in congress the politicians i 've met
 are generally very extroverted friendly very socially skillful people 
 and that 's the nature of politics you 've got to make relationships make deals you 've got to cajole  please flatter you 've got to use your personal skills  and that 's the way politics has always
  first the house of representatives changed its legislative calendar so that all business is basically done in the middle of the week nowadays congressmen fly in on tuesday morning 
 they do battle for two days then they fly home thursday afternoon they don 't move their families to the district  they don 't meet each other 's spouses or children there 's no more relationship there 
 and trying to run congress without
  human relationships is like trying to run a car without motor oil should we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up
 and descends into paralysis and polarization 
 a simple change to the legislative calendar such as having business stretch out for three weeks and then they get a week off to go home that would change the fundamental relationships in congress  
 so there 's a lot we can do but who 's going to push them to do it 
 there are a number of groups that are working on this  no labels and common cause i think have very good ideas for changes we need to do to make our democracy more
  responsive and our congress more effective but i 'd like to supplement their work with a little psychological trick 
 and the trick is this  nothing pulls people together
 like a common threat or a common attack  especially an attack from a foreign enemy unless of course
 that threat hits on our polarized psychology in which case as i said before it can actually pull us apart sometimes a single threat can polarize
  us as we saw 
 but what if the situation we face is not a single threat but is actually more like this where there 's just so much stuff coming in it 's
 just start shooting come on everybody we 've got to just work together just start shooting because actually we do face this situation  this is where we are as a country 
 so here 's another asteroid  we 've all seen versions
  and as you can see almost all the gains in wealth have gone to the top twenty percent and especially the top one percent  
 rising inequality like this is associated with so many problems for a democracy especially it destroys our ability to trust each other to feel that we 're all in the same boat because it 's obvious we 're not some of us are sitting there safe and
 sound in gigantic private yachts other people are clinging to a piece of driftwood we 're not all in the same boat and that means nobody 's willing to sacrifice for the common good
  the left has been screaming about this asteroid for thirty years now and the right says huh what hmm no problem no problem 
 now why is that happening to us why is the inequality rising well one of the largest causes
  this graph shows the steady rise of out of wedlock births since the 1960s most hispanic and black children are now born to unmarried mothers  whites are headed that way too 
 within a decade or two most american children will be born into homes with no father  
 this means that there 's much less money coming into the house  but it 's not just money
  it 's also stability versus chaos 
 as i know from working with street children in brazil  mom 's boyfriend is often a really really dangerous person for kids
  now the right has been screaming about this asteroid since the 1960s and the left has been saying it 's not a problem it 's not a problem 
 the left has been very reluctant to say that marriage is actually good for women and for children now let me be clear i 'm not blaming
  actually more critical of the men who won 't take responsibility for their own children and of an economic system that makes it difficult for many men to earn enough money to support those children 
 but even if you blame nobody it still is a national problem and one side has been more concerned about it than the other  
 the new york times finally noticed this asteroid with a front page story last july
 showing how the decline of marriage contributes
  we are becoming a nation of just two classes when americans go to college and marry each other they have very low divorce rates 
 they earn a lot of money they invest that money in their kids some of them become tiger mothers the kids rise to their full potential and the kids go on to become
 the top two lines
 in this graph  and then there 's everybody else the children who don 't benefit from a stable marriage
  who don 't have as much invested in them who don 't grow up in a stable environment and who go on to become the bottom three lines
 in that graph  
 so once again we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing as before  we 've got a problem  we 've got to start working on this we 've got to do something
  and what 's wrong with you people that you don 't see my threat 
  but if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders 
 we 'd see that these two problems actually are best addressed together  
 because if you really care about income inequality  you might want to talk to some evangelical christian groups that are working on ways to promote marriage  
 but then you 're going to run smack into the problem that women don 't generally want to marry someone
 who doesn 't have a job so if you really care about strengthening families you might want to talk to some liberal groups who are working on promoting
 educational equality
 who are working on raising the minimum wage who are working on finding ways to stop so many men from being sucked into the criminal justice system and taken out of the marriage market
 for their whole lives  
 so to conclude there are at least four asteroids headed our way 
 how many of you can see all four  please raise your hand right now if you 're willing to admit that all four of these are national problems  please raise your hands
 almost all of you well congratulations you guys are the inaugural members of the asteroids club
  which is a club for all americans
 who are willing to admit that the other side actually might have a point in the asteroids club  we don 't start by looking for common ground common ground is often very hard to find
  we start by looking for common threats because common threats make common ground now am i being naive 
 is it naive to think that people could ever lay down their swords and left and right could actually
 work together 
 i don 't think so  
 because it happens not all that often but there are a variety of examples that point the way  this is something we can do  because americans on both sides care about the decline in civility  
 and they 've formed dozens of organizations at the national level  such as this one
 down to many local organizations  such as to the village square in tallahassee florida which tries to bring state leaders together to help facilitate
 that sort of working together human relationship that 's necessary to solve florida 's problems 
 americans on both sides care about global poverty and aids and on so many humanitarian
  liberals and evangelicals are actually natural allies and at times they really have worked together to solve these problems  
 and most surprisingly to me they sometimes can even see eye to eye on criminal justice for example 
 the incarceration rate the prison population in this country has quadrupled
 since one thousand nine hundred and eighty  now this is a social disaster  and liberals are very concerned about this the southern poverty law center is often fighting the
  a system that 's just sucking in more and more poor young men but are conservatives happy about this  
 well  grover norquist isn 't because this system costs an unbelievable amount of money 
 and so because the  prison industrial complex is bankrupting our states and corroding our souls 
 groups of fiscal conservatives and christian conservatives have come together to form a group called right
 and at times they have worked with the southern poverty law center to oppose the building of new prisons and to work for reforms that will make the justice system more efficient and more humane 
 so this is possible we can do it 
 let us therefore go to battle stations not to fight each other but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids and let our first mission be
 to press congress to reform itself before it 's too late for our nation
