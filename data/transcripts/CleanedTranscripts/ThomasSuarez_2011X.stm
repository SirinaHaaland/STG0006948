  i 've always had a fascination for computers and technology  and i made a few apps for the iphone ipod touch and ipad i 'd like to share a couple with you today 
 my first app was a unique
 fortune teller called earth fortune that would display different colors of earth depending on what your fortune was my favorite and most successful app
 is bustin jieber which is which is a justin bieber whack a mole 
 i created it because a lot of people at school disliked justin bieber a little bit 
 so i decided to make the app so
 i went to work programming it  and i released
  it just before the holidays in two thousand and ten 
 a lot of people ask me  how did i make these 
 a lot of times it 's because the person who asked the question wants to make an app also 
 a lot of kids these days like to play games  
 but now they want to make them  and it 's difficult because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program  i mean for soccer
  you could go to a soccer team for violin you could get lessons for a violin  but what if you want to make an app and
  parents might have done some of these things when they were young  but not many parents have written apps 
 laughter where do you go to find out how to make an app well  this is how i approached it this is what i did
  first of all i 've
 been programming in multiple other programming languages to get the basics down  such as python c  java etc  
 and then apple released the iphone and with it the iphone software development kit  and the software development kit
 is a suite of tools for creating and programming an iphone app 
 this opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me  and after playing with the
  software development kit a little bit i made a couple of apps i made some test apps 
 one of them happened to be earth fortune and i was ready to put earth fortune on the app store  
 and so i persuaded my parents to pay the ninety nine dollar fee to be able to put my apps on the app store 
 they agreed and now i have apps on the app store  
 i 've gotten a lot of interest and encouragement from my family
  friends teachers and even people at the apple store  and that 's been a huge help to me  
 i 've gotten a lot of inspiration from steve jobs and i 've started an app club at school  and
 a
 teacher at my school is kindly sponsoring my app club  any student at my school can
  learn how to design an app 
 this is so i can share my experiences with others
  there 's these programs called the ipad pilot program  and some districts have them  i 'm fortunate enough to be part of one 
 a big challenge is how should the ipads be used and what apps should we put on the ipads so
 we 're getting feedback from teachers
 at the school
 to see what kind of apps they 'd like when we design the app and we sell it it will be free to local districts and other districts
 that we sell to all the money from that will go into the local ed foundations 
 these days  students usually know a little bit more than teachers
  so this is a resource to teachers and educators should recognize this resource and make good use of it 
 i 'd like to finish up by
  what i 'd like to do in the future  
 first of all i 'd like to create more apps more games  i 'm working with a third party company to make an app i
 'd like to get into android programming and development 
 and i 'd like to continue my app club and find other ways for students to share knowledge with others  thank you
