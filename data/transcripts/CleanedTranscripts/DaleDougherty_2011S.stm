  have a pretty simple idea that i 'm just going to tell you over and over until i get you to believe it and that is all of us are makers i really believe that all of us
 are makers  we 're born
  we have this ability
 to make things to grasp things with our hands  we use words like grasp metaphorically to also think about understanding things 
 we don 't just live  but we make  we create things 
 well i 'm going to show you a group of makers from maker faire and various places it doesn 't come out particularly well but that 's a particularly tall bicycle
  it 's a scraper bike it 's called from oakland  and this is a
  small scooter for a gentleman of this size  but he 's trying to power it or motorize it with a drill  
 and the question he had is can i do it can it be done apparently it can so makers are enthusiasts they 're
  they 're people who love doing what they do they don 't always even know why they 're doing it  
 we have begun organizing makers at our maker faire there was one held in detroit here last summer and it will be held again next summer at the henry ford but we hold them in san francisco
 and it 's a fabulous event to just meet
  and talk to these people who make things and are there to just show them to you and talk about them and have a great conversation
  but it 's a controller at top cycles the water to fall just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc so imagine a kid am i going to get wet am i going to get wet no i didn 't get wet am i going to get wet am i going to get wet that 's the experience of a
 clever ride 
 and of course  we have fashion people are remaking things into fashion i don 't know if this is called a basket bra but it ought to be something like that we have art students
  getting together taking old radiator parts and doing an iron pour to make something new out of it they did that in the summer and it was very warm  now this one takes a little bit of explaining you know what those are right
 billy bob or billy bass or something like that  now the background is the guy who did this is a physicist
  and here he 'll
  explain a little bit about what it
  came up from houston last year to visit us in detroit here and show the
 the wonderful sashimi tabernacle choir  so are you a maker how many people here would say you 're a maker  if you raise your hand that 's a pretty good
 but there 's some of you out there
 that won 't admit that you 're makers and again think about it you 're makers of food you 're
  makers of lots of different things and partly what interests me today
 is you 're makers of your own world and particularly the role that technology has in your in your life 
 you 're really a driver or a passenger to use a volkswagen phrase  makers are in control that 's what fascinates them that 's why they do what they do they want to figure 
  out how things work they want to get access to it and they want to control it they want to use it to their own purpose
 makers today to some degree are out on the edge  
 they 're not mainstream they 're a little bit radical they 're a bit subversive in what they do but at one time 
 it was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker it was not something you 'd even remark upon  and i found this old
 with our strengths and our minds and spirit  we gather we form and we fashion
  makers and shapers and put it togetherers dd so it goes on to show you people
 making things out of wood a grandfather making a ship in a bottle a woman making a pie somewhat standard fare of the day
  it was it was a sense of pride that we made things that the world around us was made by us  
 it didn 't just exist we made it and we were connected to it that way  and i think that 's tremendously important  now i 'm going to tell you one funny thing about this 
 this particular
 reel it 's an
  so i like to think there was something going on there of the new generation of makers coming out of this plus psycho 
 this is andrew archer i met andrew at one of our community meetings putting together maker faire andrew had moved to detroit from
 duluth minnesota
  and i talked to his mom and i ended up doing a story on him for a magazine called kidrobot  he 's just a kid that grew up
 playing with tools instead of toys he liked to take things apart  his mother gave him a part of the garage and he collected things from yard sales and he made stuff 
  he didn 't particularly like school that much but he got involved in robotics competitions and he realized he had a talent and more importantly he had a real passion for it  and he began 
  building robots and  when i sat down next to him he was telling me about a company he formed and he was building some
 idea today  this is jeff and bilal and several others here in a hackerspace  and there 's about three hackerspaces or more in detroit and there 's probably even some new ones since i 've been here last 
 but these are like clubs
 they 're sharing tools sharing space sharing expertise in in what to make and so
 it 's a very interesting phenomenon that 's going across the world but essentially these are people that are
  playing with technology let me say that again playing they don 't necessarily know what they 're doing or why they 're doing it  they 're playing to discover
 what the technology can do and probably to discover what they can do themselves what their own capabilities are  
 now the other thing that i think is is taking off another reason making is taking off today is there 's some great new tools out there and you can 't see this
  very well on the screen but arduino arduino is an open source hardware platform it 's a micro controller 
 if you don 't know what those are they 're just the brains so they 're the brains of maker projects  
 and here 's an example of one and i don 't know if you can see it that well but that 's a mailbox so an ordinary mailbox and an arduino so you figure out how to
  you put this
 in your mailbox and when someone opens your mailbox you get a notification an alert message goes to your iphone  
 now that could be a dog door it could be
 someone going somewhere where they shouldn 't like a little brother into a little sister 's room there 's all kinds of different
 things that you can imagine for that now here 's something a 3d printer that 's another tool that 's really taken off really really interesting this is makerbot
 and there are industrial versions of this about twenty thousand dollars  
 these guys came up with a a kit version for seven hundred and fifty dollars  and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3d printers now they don 't know what they want to do with it  but they 're going to figure it out 
 they will only figure it out by getting their hands on
  and playing with it one of the coolest things is makerbot sent out an upgrade some new brackets for the the box well you printed out the brackets
 and then replaced the old brackets with the new ones isn 't that cool  
 so makers harvest technology from all the places around us this is a radar speed detector that was developed from a hot wheels toy  and
 do interesting things they 're really creating new areas and exploring areas that you might only think
 the military is doing drones well there is a whole community of people building autonomous airplanes or vehicles something that you could program to fly on its own without a stick or anything to figure out what path it 's going 
 fascinating work they 're doing 
 we just had an issue on space exploration diy space exploration  
 this is probably the best time
 in the history of mankind to love space
 you could build your own satellite and get it into space for like eight thousand dollars  
 think how much money and how many years it took nasa to get satellites into space  
 in fact these guys actually work for nasa and they 're trying to pioneer using off the shelf components cheap things that aren 't specialized that they can combine
  and send up into space 
 makers are a source of innovation and i think it relates back to something like the birth of the personal computer industry this is steve wozniak  where does he learn about computers it 's the homebrew computer club just like a hackerspace  
 and he says 
 i could go there all day long and talk to people and share ideas for free 
 well he did a little bit better than free  but it 's important to understand that a lot of the origins of our
 industries even like henry ford
  come from this idea of playing and figuring things out in groups well if i haven 't convinced you that you 're a maker i hope i could convince you that
 our next generation should be makers that kids
 are particularly interested in this in this ability to control the physical world and be able to use things like micro controllers and build robots  and we 've got to get this into schools or into communities in many many
  ways the ability to to
 tinker to shape and reshape the world around us 
 there 's a great opportunity today and that 's what i really care about the most an the answer to the question what will america make it 's more makers  
 thank you very much
