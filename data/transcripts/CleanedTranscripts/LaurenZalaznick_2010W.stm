  after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread  i am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about
 television so most everyone watches tv  we like it we like some parts of it
 here in america people actually love tv  the average american watches tv for almost
 five hours a day okay now i happen to make my living these days
 in television so for me that 's a good thing  
 but a lot of people don 't love it so much  they in fact berate it they call it stupid and worse believe me
 my mother growing up she called it the idiot box 
 but my idea today is not to debate whether there 's such a thing as good tv or bad tv my idea today is to tell you that i believe television has a conscience  
 so why i believe that television has a conscience is that i
 i actually believe
 that television directly reflects the moral political  
 social and emotional need states of our nation that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system  
 so all these things are uniquely human and they all add up to our idea of conscience  
 now today we 're not talking about good and bad tv we 're talking about popular
  over the course of fifty years 
 how do these nielsen ratings reflect not just what you 've heard about which is the idea of our social collective unconscious  but how do these 
  shows over fifty years reflect the idea of our social conscience how does television evolve over time
  and what does this say about our society  now speaking of evolution from basic biology you probably remember
 that the animal kingdom  including humans have four basic primal instincts  you have hunger  you have sex  you have power and you have the urge for acquisitiveness 
 as humans what 's important to remember is that we 've developed we 've evolved over time to temper or tame these basic animal instincts
  the capacity to laugh and cry  we feel awe  we feel pity that is separate and apart from the animal kingdom  
 the other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained we love to watch tv 
 this is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom  animals might love to play  
 but they don 't love to watch
  had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious why has television 
  entertainment evolved the way it has i kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders 
 so to begin to answer these questions we did a research study  we went back fifty years to the one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine one thousand nine hundred and sixty television season  
 we surveyed the top 20 nielsen shows every year for fifty years a thousand shows 
 we talked to over three thousand individuals almost three thousand six hundred aged eighteen
  and we asked them how they felt emotionally how did you feel watching every single one of these shows did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity did you feel outrage did you laugh what did this mean for you 
 so to our global ted audiences i want to say that this was a u s sample  
 but as you can see these emotional need states are truly universal and on a factual basis over eighty percent of the
  are exported around the world so i really hope our global audiences can relate 
 two acknowledgments before our first data slide for inspiring me to even think
 about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis  i thank legendary
  jack stern 
 and for the way in which i 'm going to present the data i want to thank ted community superstar hans rosling who you may have just seen  
 okay here we go  so here you see from one thousand nine hundred and sixty to two thousand and ten the fifty years of our study  
 two things we 're going to start with the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state which for this purpose we defined inspiration as television shows that
  me that make me feel much more positive about the world 
 moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which i don 't understand the difference between right and wrong   
 as we start you see in one thousand nine hundred and sixty inspiration is holding steady that 's what we 're watching tv for moral ambiguity starts to climb 
  right at the end of the 60s moral ambiguity is going up inspiration is kind of on the wane why 
 the cuban missile crisis jfk is shot  the civil rights movement race riots the vietnam war  mlk is shot  bobby kennedy is shot  watergate 
 look what happens in one thousand nine hundred and seventy inspiration plummets moral ambiguity takes off they cross but ronald reagan a telegenic president is in office it 's trying to recover  but look
  it can 't aids
 the challenger disaster chernobyl moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from one thousand nine hundred and ninety for the next twenty years take a look at this 
 this chart is going to document a very similar trend  but in this case we have comfort the bubble in red
  on tv
 you have bonanza don 't forget you have gunsmoke you have andy griffith you have domestic shows all about comfort 
 this is rising comfort stays whole irreverence starts to rise social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up you get to one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine and look what
  you have comfort irreverence and social commentary not only battling it out in our society  but you literally have two establishment shows gunsmoke and gomer pyle in one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine are the 
  television shows what 's number one  the socially irreverent hippie show rowan and martin 's laugh in they 're all living together right 
 viewers had responded dramatically look at this green spike in
  bellwether show  when you guys hear this industry term a breakout hit what does that mean it means in the one thousand nine hundred and sixty six television season the smothers brothers came out of nowhere 
 this was the first show that allowed viewers to say my god  i can comment on how i feel about the
  vietnam war about the presidency through television that 's what we mean by a breakout show  
 so then  just like the last chart look what happens in one thousand nine hundred and seventy the dam bursts  the dam bursts comfort is no longer why we watch television social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s 
 now look at this 
 the 70s means who norman
  in the entire fifty years of television that we studied  seven of ten
 shows ranked most highly for irreverence
 appeared on air during the vietnam war  five of the top 10 during the nixon administration 
 only one generation twenty years in and we discovered
 wow tv can do that it can make me feel this it can change us 
 so to this very very savvy crowd i also want to note
 the digital folks did not invent disruptive  archie bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us
  years ago 
 this is a quick chart here 's another attribute fantasy and imagination which are shows defined as takes me out of my everyday realm and makes me feel better 
 that 's mapped against the red dot unemployment which is a simple bureau of labor department statistic 
 you 'll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise
  it maps to a spike in unemployment do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed no in 
 you have the bellwether show the bionic woman that rocketed into the
  incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts unemployment  
 so here you are in my favorite chart  because this is our last twenty years 
 whether or not you 're in my business  you have surely heard or read
 of the decline of the thing called the three camera sitcom and the rise
 of reality tv  
 well as we say in the business  x marks the spot the  90s the big bubbles of humor we 're watching friends frasier cheers and seinfeld everything 's good 
 low unemployment  but look  x marks the spot in two thousand and one the september two thousand and one television season 
 humor succumbs to judgment
  once and for all why not we had a two thousand presidential election decided by the supreme court  we had the bursting of the tech bubble 
 we had nine eleven  anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon look what happens when we keep going 
 at the turn of the century  the internet takes off reality television has taken hold 
 what do people want in their tv then
  would have thought revenge
 or nostalgia give me some comfort my world is falling apart no  they want judgment  
 i can vote you off the island  i can keep sarah palin 's daughter dancing  i can choose the next american idol you 're fired that 's all great right  
 so
  as dramatically different as these television shows pure entertainment have been over the last fifty years what did i start with 
 one basic instinct remains  we 're animals we need our moms 
 there has not been a decade of television without a definitive dominant tv mom 
 the 1950s june cleever in the original comfort show leave it to beaver 
 lucille ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the
 maude findlay  the epitome of the irreverent 1970s who tackled abortion divorce even menopause on tv 
 the 1980s our first cougar was given to us in the form of alexis carrington
  murphy brown took on a vice president when she
  took on the idea of single parenthood this era 's mom  bree
 van de kamp  
 now i don 't know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience sitting on television 's shoulders  
 but i do know that i absolutely love this image  
 so to you all the women of tedwomen  the men
  of tedwomen the global audiences of tedwomen thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television but
 let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens
 throughout all these ages of television they give it life on television for sure  
 but it 's you as viewers through your collective social consciences that give it life longevity power or not 
 so thanks very much
