  world is changing in some really profound ways  
 and i worry that investors aren 't paying enough attention to some of the biggest drivers of change especially when it comes to sustainability
  and by sustainability  i mean the really juicy things like environmental and social issues
 and corporate governance  
 i think it 's reckless to ignore these things  because doing so can jeopardize future long term returns  
 and here 's something that may surprise you the balance of power to really influence sustainability
 rests with institutional investors the large investors like pension funds
 i believe that sustainable investing is less complicated than you think better performing than you believe and more important than we can imagine  
 let me remind you what we already know  
 we have a population that 's both growing and aging we have seven billion souls today heading to ten billion at the end
  we consume natural resources faster than they can be replenished and the emissions that are mainly responsible for climate change
 just keep increasing  
 now clearly these are environmental and social issues  but that 's not all 
 they 're economic issues and that makes them relevant to risk and
  and they are really complex and they can seem really far off that the temptation may be to do this bury our heads in the sand and not think about it 
 resist this if you can don 't do this at home 
 laughter but it makes me wonder if the investment rules of today
 are fit for purpose tomorrow  we know
  when they look at a company and decide whether to invest  they look at financial data metrics like sales growth cash flow market share valuation
 you know the really sexy stuff 
 and these things are fundamental of course  but they 're not enough investors should also look at performance metrics in what we call
 water availability  waste
 and pollution  just making efficient uses of resources 
 social includes human capital things like employee engagement and innovation capacity 
 as well as supply chain management
 and labor rights and human rights and governance relates to the
  of companies by their boards and investors see i told you this is the really juicy stuff but esg is the measure
 of sustainability and sustainable investing incorporates esg factors
 with financial factors into the investment process it means limiting future risk by minimizing harm to people and planet
 and it means providing capital to users
 who deploy it towards productive and sustainable outcomes  
 so if sustainability matters financially today and all signs indicate more tomorrow is the private sector paying attention 
 well the really cool thing
 is that most ceos are they started to see sustainability
 not just as important but crucial to business success about eighty percent of global ceos see sustainability as the root to growth
 in innovation
 and leading to competitive advantage in their industries  but ninety three percent see esg as the future or as important to the future of their
  so the views of ceos are clear there 's tremendous opportunity in sustainability  so how are companies actually leveraging
 esg to drive hard business results 
 one example is near and dear to our hearts in two thousand
 and twelve state street migrated fifty four applications to the cloud environment and we retired another eighty five 
 we virtualized our operating system environments  and we completed numerous automation projects
  now these initiatives create a more mobile workplace  and they reduce our real estate footprint  
 and they yield savings of twenty three million dollars in operating costs annually  
 and avoid the emissions of a one hundred thousand metric tons of carbon that 's the equivalent of taking twenty one thousand
  industrial conglomerate and about a decade ago they sold their core power tools business and reinvested those proceeds
 in a water business that 's a really big bet why did they do that well with apologies to the home improvement fans
  there 's more growth in water than in power tools 
 and this company has their sights set on what they call the new new world that 's four billion middle class people demanding food  
 energy and water 
 now 
 you may be asking yourself are these just isolated cases  i mean come on really do companies that take sustainability into account really do well financially
  the answer that may surprise you
 is yes  the data shows that stocks with better esg performance
 perform just as well as others 
 in blue we see the msci world it
 's an index of large companies from developed markets across the world and in gold  we see a subset of companies rated as having the best esg performance 
 over three plus years  
 no performance
  so that 's okay right  we want more i want more in some cases there may be outperformance from esg 
 in blue  
 we see the performance of the five hundred largest global companies and in gold  we see a subset of companies with best practice in climate change strategy and risk management 
 now over almost eight years they 've outperformed by about two thirds  
 so yes this is correlation
  's not causation  but it does illustrate that environmental leadership is compatible with good returns  so
 if the returns are the same or better and the planet benefits  wouldn 't this be the norm 
 are investors particularly institutional investors engaged well some are and a few are really at the vanguard
 hesta is a retirement fund for health and community services employees in australia with assets of twenty two billion [ dollars ] 
 they believe that esg has the potential to impact risks and returns  so incorporating it into the investment process
 is core to their duty to act in the best interest of fund members core to their duty you gotta love the aussies right
  calpers is another example  calpers is the pension fund for public employees in california 
 and with assets of two hundred and forty four billion [ dollars ] they are the second largest in the u s and the sixth largest in the world  
 now they 're moving toward one hundred percent sustainable investment
 by systematically integrated esg across the
  entire fund 
 why 
 they believe it 's critical to superior long term returns  full stop 
 in their own words long term value creation requires the effective management
 of three forms of capital financial 
 human  and physical this is why we are concerned with esg 
  i do speak to a lot of investors as part of my job and not all of them see it this way  
 often i hear we are required to maximize returns so we don 't do that here 
 or we don 't want to use the portfolio to make policy statements 
 the one that just really gets under my skin is if you want to do something about that just make money  give the profits to charities
  me clarify something right here 
 companies and investors are not singularly responsible for the fate of the planet they don 't have indefinite social obligations  and prudent investing and finance theory aren 't subordinate to sustainability  
 they 're compatible 
 so i 'm not talking about tradeoffs here 
  they hold the key the answer quite simply is they have the money 
 a lot of it  
 i mean a really lot of it the global stock market is worth fifty five trillion dollars  the global bond market seventy eight
  a half times the gdp of the u s that 's the world 's largest economy that 's some serious freaking firepower  
 so we can reconsider
 some of these pressing challenges like fresh water clean air feeding ten billion mouths 
 if institutional investors integrated esg into investment 
 what if they used that firepower to
  more of their capital to companies working the hardest at solving these challenges
 or at least not exacerbating them what if we
 work and save and invest  only to find that the world we retire into
 is more stressed and less secure than it is now what if there isn 't enough clean air and fresh water
 a fair question might be what if all this sustainability risk stuff is exaggerated  overstated it 's not urgent 
 something for virtuous consumers
 or lifestyle choice well president john f kennedy said something about this that is just
 spot on there are risks and costs to a program of action  but they are far less than the
  costs of comfortable
 inaction 
 i can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this but since this is based on widespread scientific consensus 
 the odds that it 's not completely wrong
 are better than the odds that our house will burn down or we 'll get in a car accident well maybe not if you live in boston 
 laughter but my point is
 is that we buy insurance to protect ourselves financially
 in case those things happen right  
 so by investing sustainably we 're doing two things we
 're creating insurance reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy  
 and at the same time
  you like it i like it too 
 i like it because it pokes fun at both sides of the climate change issue  i bet you can 't guess which side i 'm on  
 but what i really like about it is that it reminds me of something mark twain said which is plan for the future  because that 's where you 're going to spend the rest of your life
