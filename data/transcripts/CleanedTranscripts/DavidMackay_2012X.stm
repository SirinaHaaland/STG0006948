  when the industrial revolution started the amount of carbon sitting underneath britain in the form of coal
 was as big as the amount of carbon sitting under saudi arabia in the form of oil
  this carbon powered the industrial revolution it put the great in great britain and led to britain 's temporary world domination  
 and then in one thousand nine hundred and eighteen 
 coal production in britain peaked  and has declined ever since 
 in due course britain started using oil and gas from the north sea  and in the year two thousand oil and gas production from the north sea also peaked 
  and they 're now on the decline 
 these observations about the finiteness of easily accessible local  secure fossil fuels
 is a motivation for saying well  what 's next  what is life after fossil fuels going to be like shouldn 't we be thinking hard about how to get off fossil fuels another motivation of course 
 is climate change 
 and when people talk about life after fossil fuels and climate change action  i think there 's a lot of
 fluff a lot of greenwash a lot of misleading advertising 
 and i feel a duty as a physicist to try to guide people around the claptrap and help people understand the actions that really make a difference and to focus on ideas that do add up  
 let me illustrate this with what physicists call a
  down some numbers and get an answer it may not be very accurate  but it may make you say hmm so here 's a question  
 imagine if we said oh yes we can get off fossil fuels we 'll use biofuels problem solved transport  we don 't need oil anymore well  
 what if we grew the biofuels for a road
 on the grass verge at the edge of the road how wide
  wide would the verge have to be for that to work out ok
 so let 's put in some numbers let 's have our cars go at sixty miles per hour  let 's say they do thirty miles per gallon that 's the
 european average for new cars let 's say the productivity of biofuel plantations is one thousand two hundred liters of biofuel per hectare per year that 's true of european
  and let 's imagine the cars are spaced eighty meters apart from each other and they 're perpetually going along this road  the length of the road doesn 't matter because the longer the road the more biofuel plantation 
 what do we do with these numbers take the first number  divide by the other three and get eight kilometers  and that 's the answer  that 's how wide the plantation would have to be given these assumptions 
 and maybe that makes you say hmm 
 maybe this isn 't going to be quite so easy
  and it might make you think  
 perhaps there 's an issue to do with areas  and in this talk i 'd like to talk about land areas  and ask is there an issue about areas  the answer is going to be
 yes but it depends which country you are in so let 's start in the united kingdom since that 's where we are today 
 the energy consumption of the united kingdom the total energy consumption not just transport
  everything i like to quantify it in lightbulbs it 's as if we 've all got one hundred and twenty five lightbulbs on all the time one hundred and 
 per day per person is the energy consumption of the uk  so there 's forty lightbulbs ' worth for transport forty lightbulbs ' worth for heating and forty lightbulbs 
 ' worth for making electricity and other things are relatively small compared to those three big fish
  's actually a bigger footprint if we take into account the embodied energy in the stuff we import into our country as well  
 and ninety percent of this energy  today  still comes from fossil fuels and ten percent only from other  greener possibly greener sources like nuclear power and renewables  
 so that 's the
  the population density of the uk is two hundred and fifty people per square kilometer  i 'm now going to show you other countries by these same two measures on the vertical axis  i 'm going to show you how 
 many lightbulbs what our energy consumption per person is we 're at one hundred and twenty five lightbulbs per person and that little blue dot there is showing you the land area of the united kingdom
  two hundred and fifty people per square kilometer  let 's add european countries in blue  and
 you can see there 's quite a variety i should emphasize both of these axes are logarithmic as you go from one gray bar to the next gray bar you 're going up a factor of ten 
 next let 's add asia in red the middle east and north africa in green
 sub saharan africa in blue
  we have north america  australia and new zealand 
 you can see the great diversity of population densities and of per capita consumptions countries are different from each other top left  we have canada 
  and australia with enormous land areas very high per capita consumption two hundred or three hundred lightbulbs per person
  population densities top right  bahrain has the same energy consumption per person roughly as canada
 over three hundred lightbulbs per person  but their population density is a factor of three hundred times greater one thousand people per square kilometer  bottom right  bangladesh has the same population density
 as bahrain but consumes one hundred times less per person  bottom left
  no one but there used to be a whole load of people here 's another message from this diagram i 've added on little blue tails behind sudan  libya  china india bangladesh that 's
  fifteen years of progress  where were they fifteen years ago and where are they now and the message is  most countries are going to the right  and they 're going up up and to the right  bigger population density and higher per capita consumption so we may be off in the top
  corner slightly unusual the united kingdom accompanied by germany  japan south korea the netherlands and a bunch of other slightly odd countries 
 but many other countries are coming up and to the right to join us so we 're a picture if you like of
 what the future energy consumption might be looking like in other countries too
  i 've also added in this diagram now some pink lines that go down and to the right  those are lines of equal power consumption per unit area  which i measure in watts per square 
  meter  so for example the middle line there zero point one watts per square meter  is the energy consumption per unit area of saudi arabia  norway  mexico in purple and bangladesh fifteen years ago 
 the united kingdom is consuming one point two five watts per square meter  so is germany  and japan is consuming a bit more 
 so 
 let 's now say why this is relevant  why is it relevant well we can measure renewables in the same units and other forms of power production in the same units
 renewables is one of the leading
  ideas for how we could get off our ninety percent  fossil fuel habit  
 so here come some renewables energy crops deliver half a watt per square meter in european climates 
 what does that mean  you might have anticipated that that result given what i told you about the biofuel plantation a moment ago  well  we consume one point two five watts
  what this means is even if you covered the whole of the united kingdom with energy crops you couldn 't match today 's energy consumption 
 wind power produces a bit more two point five watts per square meter  but that 's only twice as big as one point two five watts per square meter  
 so that means if you wanted literally to produce
 total energy consumption in all forms on average from wind farms you need wind farms half the area of the uk  i 've got data to
  back up all these assertions by the way  
 next let 's look at solar power 
 solar panels when you put them on a roof deliver about twenty watts per square meter in england  
 if you really want to get a lot from solar panels you need to adopt adopt the traditional bavarian farming method where you leap off the roof  and coat the
  solar parks because of the gaps between the panels deliver less they deliver about five watts per square meter of land area  and here 's a solar park in vermont with real data  delivering four point two watts per square meter  
 remember where we are one point two five watts per square meter  wind farms two point five solar parks about five 
 so whichever of those renewables you pick
  whatever mix of those renewables you 're using if you want to power the uk on them you 're going to need to cover something like twenty percent or twenty five percent
 of the country with those renewables  i 'm not saying that 's a bad idea we just need to understand the numbers i 'm absolutely not anti renewables i love renewables but i 'm also 
 concentrating solar power in deserts delivers larger powers per unit area because you don 't have the problem of clouds
  this facility delivers fourteen watts per square meter  this one ten watts per square meter  and this one in spain five watts per square meter  being generous to concentrating solar power  i think it 's perfectly 
  credible it could deliver twenty watts per square meter  so that that 's nice of course  britain doesn 't have any deserts
 laughter so here 's a summary so far all renewables much as i love them
  diffuse they all have a small power per unit area  and we have to live with that fact  and
 that means if you do want renewables to make a substantial difference for a country like the united kingdom on the scale of today 's consumption you need to be imagining renewable facilities
 that are country sized not the entire country but a fraction of the country a substantial fraction there are
  other options for generating power as well  which don 't involve fossil fuels so there 's nuclear power and on this ordinance survey map  you can see there 's a sizewell b inside a blue square 
  kilometer that 's one gigawatt in a square kilometer  which works out to one thousand watts per square meter  so by this particular metric nuclear power isn 't as intrusive
 and nuclear power has all sorts of popularity problems  but the same goes for renewables as well here 's a photograph of a consultation exercise in full swing in the little town of penicuik just
 just outside edinburgh  and you can see the children of penicuik celebrating the burning of the effigy of the windmill so 
 people are anti everything and we 've got to keep all the options on the table what can a country like the
  uk do on the supply side well  the options are i 'd say these three power renewables  and recognizing that they need to be close to country sized 
 other people 's renewables so we could go back and talk very politely to the people in the top left hand side of the diagram and say uh 
 we don 't want renewables in our backyard but um please could we put them in yours instead and that 's a serious option it 's a way for the world to
  to handle this issue so countries like australia  russia  libya  kazakhstan could be our best friends for renewable production
 and a third option is is nuclear power  so that 's some supply side options 
 in addition to the supply levers that we can push and remember we need large amounts because at the moment we get ninety percent of our energy from fossil fuels
 in addition to those levers
  could talk about other ways of solving this issue  namely we could reduce demand  and that means reducing population i 'm not sure how to do that
 or reducing per capita consumption  
 so let 's talk about three more big levers that could really help on the consumption side first transport here are the physics principles that tell you how to reduce the energy
 consumption of transport
 people often say technology can answer everything we can make vehicles that are one hundred times more efficient and that 's almost true let me show you 
 the energy consumption of this typical tank here is eighty kilowatt hours per hundred person kilometers that 's the
 average european car eighty kilowatt hours can we make something one hundred times better by applying the physics principles i just listed yes here it is 
  it 's eighty times better in energy consumption and it 's powered by biofuel by weetabix 
 and there are other options in between because maybe the lady in the tank would say no that 's a lifestyle change don 't change my lifestyle please we could persuade her to take a train still a lot more efficient than a car but that might be a lifestyle change or there 's the 
  it comfortably accommodates one teenager and it 's
 's shorter than a traffic cone and it 's almost as efficient as a bicycle as long as you drive it at
 fifteen miles per hour  
 in between perhaps some more realistic options on the transport lever are electric vehicles so electric bikes and electric cars in the middle perhaps four times as energy efficient as the standard petrol powered tank 
 next  there 's the heating lever heating is a third of our energy consumption
  and quite a lot of that is going into homes and other buildings doing space heating and water heating  
 so here 's a typical crappy british house  it 's my house with a ferrari out front 
 what can we do to it well the laws of physics are written up there  which describe how the power
 the power consumption for heating is driven by the things you can control the
  you can control are the temperature difference between the inside and the outside there 's this remarkable technology called a thermostat you grasp it rotate it to the left  and your energy consumption in the home will decrease  i 've tried it it works some people call it a lifestyle change 
 laughter you can also get the
 fluff men in to reduce the leakiness of your building put fluff in the walls fluff in the roof a new front door and so forth
  the sad truth is this will save you money that 's not sad that 's good
  but the sad truth is it 'll only get about twenty five percent of the leakiness of your building if you do these things which are good ideas 
 if you really want to get a bit closer to swedish building standards with a crappy house like this 
 you need to be putting external insulation on the building as shown by this block of flats in london 
 you can also deliver heat more efficiently using heat pumps which use a smaller bit of high grade energy like electricity
 to move heat from your garden into your house  
 the third demand side option i want to talk about the third way to reduce energy consumption is  read your meters 
 people talk a lot about smart meters but you can do it yourself use your own eyes and be smart  read your meter  
 and if you 're anything like me it 'll change your life here 's a graph i made i was writing a book about sustainable energy and a friend asked me how much energy do you use at home
  embarrassed i didn 't actually know  and so i started reading the meter every week the old meter readings are shown in the top half of the graph and then two thousand and seven is shown in green at the bottom 
  that was when i was reading the meter every week  and my life changed because i started doing experiments and seeing what made a difference my gas consumption plummeted because i started tinkering with the thermostat 
  and the timing on the heating system  and i knocked more than half off my gas bills there 's a similar story
  for my electricity consumption 
 where switching off the dvd players the stereos the computer peripherals that were on all the time  and just switching them on when i needed them knocked another third off my electricity bills too 
 so we need a plan that adds up i 've described for you six big levers  we need
 big action because we get ninety percent of our energy from fossil fuels and so you need to push hard on most if not all of these levers  
 most of these levers have popularity problems  and if there is a lever you don 't like the the use of well  please do bear in mind that means you need even stronger effort on the other levers 
 so i 'm a strong advocate of advocate of having grown up conversations that are based on numbers and
  and i want to close with this map that just visualizes for you
 the
 requirement of land and so forth in order to get just sixteen lightbulbs per person from four of the big possible sources  
 so  if you wanted to get sixteen lightbulbs remember  today our total energy consumption is one hundred and twenty five lightbulbs ' worth if you wanted sixteen from wind 
 this map visualizes a solution for the uk it 's got one hundred and sixty wind farms each one hundred square
  kilometers in size  and that would be a twentyfold increase over today 's amount of wind 
 nuclear power to get sixteen lightbulbs per person  you 'd need two gigawatts at each of the purple dots on the map that 's a fourfold increase
 over today 's levels of nuclear power  
 biomass to get sixteen lightbulbs per person  you 'd need a land area something like three and a half wales ' worth  either in our country
 or in someone else 's country possibly ireland possibly somewhere else 
 and a fourth supply side option  concentrating solar power in other people 's deserts 
 if you wanted to get sixteen lightbulbs ' worth then we 're talking about these eight hexagons down at the bottom right the total area of those hexagons is two greater london 's
  power lines all the way across spain and france to bring the power from the sahara
 to surrey we need a plan that adds up  we need to stop shouting and start talking  
 and
 if we can have a  grown up conversation make a plan that adds up and get building maybe this low carbon revolution will actually be fun  thank you very much for listening
