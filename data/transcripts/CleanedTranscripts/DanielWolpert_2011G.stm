  i 'm a neuroscientist  and in neuroscience we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain  
 but i want to start with the easiest question and the question you really should have all asked yourselves at some point in your life  
  a fundamental question if we want to understand brain function  and that is why do we and other animals have brains 
 not all species on our planet have brains so if we want to know what the brain is for let 's think about why we evolved one 
 now you may reason that we have one to perceive the world or to think  and that 's completely wrong 
 if you think about this question for any length of time it 's blindingly obvious why we have a brain we have a brain for one reason and one reason only  and that 's to produce adaptable
  and complex movements there is no other reason to have a brain 
 think about it 
 movement is the only way you have of affecting the world around you now that 's not quite true there 's one other way  and that 's through sweating  but apart from that 
 everything else goes through contractions of muscles so think about communication speech  gestures writing sign language they 're all mediated through contractions of your muscles
  so it 's really important to remember that sensory memory and cognitive processes are all important 
 but they 're only important to either drive or suppress future movements there can be no evolutionary advantage to laying down memories of childhood or perceiving the color of a rose
 if it doesn 't affect the way you 're going to move later in life  now for those who don 't believe
  we have trees and grass on our planet without the brain  but the clinching evidence is this animal here the humble sea squirt  
 rudimentary animal has a nervous system swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life  and at some point of its life it implants on a rock  
 and the first thing it does in implanting on that rock  which it never leaves is to digest its own brain and nervous system for food  
 so once you don 't need to move you don 't need the luxury of that brain and this animal is often
  often taken as an analogy to what happens at universities when professors get tenure  but that 's a different subject 
 so
 i am a movement chauvinist  i believe movement is the most important function of the brain don 't let anyone tell you that it 's not true  now if movement is so important how well are we doing understanding how the brain controls movement and the answer is we 're doing extremely poorly it 's a very hard problem  
 but we can look at how well
  doing by thinking about how well we 're doing building machines which can do what humans can do 
 think about the game of chess how well are we doing determining what piece to move where if you pit garry kasparov here when he 's not in jail against ibm 's deep blue 
 well the answer is ibm 's deep blue will occasionally win and i think if ibm 's deep blue played anyone in this room it would win every time that problem is solved 
  picking up a chess piece dexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board if
 you put a five  year old child 's dexterity against the best robots of today the answer is simple the child wins easily there 's no competition at all 
 now why is that top problem so easy and the bottom problem so hard one reason is a very smart five year old could tell you the
  algorithm for that top problem look at all possible moves to the end of the game and choose the one that makes you win so it 's a very simple algorithm  now of course there are other moves  
 but with vast computers we approximate and come close to the optimal solution 
 when it comes to being dexterous it 's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous and we 'll see you have to both perceive and act on the world which has a lot of problems  
 but let me show you cutting edge robotics now a lot of robotics is very
  but manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages  so this is the end of a ph d project from one of the best robotics institutes  and the student has trained this robot to pour this water into a glass it 's a hard problem because the water sloshes about but it can do it  
 but it doesn 't do it with anything like the agility of a human now if you want this robot to do a different task that 's another three year ph d program  there is
 no generalization at all from one task to another in robotics  now we can compare this to
 cutting edge human performance  so what i 'm going to show you is emily fox winning the world record for cup stacking  
 now the americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking it 's a high school sport where you have twelve cups you have to stack and unstack against the clock in a prescribed order  
 and this is her getting the world record in real time
  and she 's pretty happy  we have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that and that 's what we 'd like to know 
 so in my group what we try to do is reverse engineer how humans control movement 
  and it sounds like an easy problem you send a command down it causes muscles to contract your arm or body moves and you get sensory feedback from vision from skin from muscles and so on 
 the trouble is these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be so one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is for example sensory feedback is extremely noisy  now by noise  i do not mean sound  
 we use it in the engineering and neuroscience sense meaning a random noise corrupting a signal  so the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard
  station you wanted to hear that was the noise 
 but more generally this noise is something that corrupts the signal  so for example if you put your hand under a table and try to localize it with your other hand you can be off by several centimeters due to the noise in sensory feedback 
 similarly when you put motor output on movement output it 's extremely noisy forget about trying to hit the bull 's eye in darts just aim for the same spot over and over again you have a huge spread due to movement variability
  and more than that the outside world or task is both ambiguous and variable  the teapot could be full it could be empty it changes over time  
 so we work in a whole sensory movement task soup of noise  now this noise is so great that society places a huge premium on those of us who can reduce 
  the consequences of noise  so if you 're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick
  society will be willing to reward you with hundreds of millions of dollars
  now what i want to convince you of is the brain also goes through a lot of effort to reduce the negative consequences of this sort of noise and variability 
 and to do that i 'm going to tell you about a framework which is very popular in statistics and machine learning of the last fifty years called bayesian decision theory  and it 's more recently a unifying way to think about how the brain deals with uncertainty
  and the fundamental idea is you want to make inferences and then take actions  so let 's think about the inference 
 you want to generate beliefs about the world so what are beliefs beliefs could be where are my arms in space am i looking at a cat or a fox  
 but we 're going to represent beliefs with probabilities so we 're going to represent a belief with a number between zero and one
  zero meaning i don 't believe it at all one means i 'm absolutely certain and numbers in between give you the gray levels of uncertainty  
 and the key idea to bayesian inference is you have two sources of information from which to make your inference you have data 
 and data in neuroscience is sensory input  so i have sensory input which i can take in to make beliefs  
 but there 's another source of information  and that 's effectively prior knowledge you accumulate knowledge throughout your life in
  and the point about bayesian decision theory is it gives you the mathematics of the optimal way to combine your prior knowledge with your sensory evidence to generate new beliefs  and i 've put the formula up there i 'm not going to explain what that formula is but it 's very beautiful  
 and it has real beauty and real explanatory power  and what it really says and what you want to estimate is the probability of different beliefs given your sensory input  
 so let me give you an intuitive example 
  play tennis
 and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce as it comes over the net towards you 
 there are two sources of information bayes  ' rule tells you there
 's sensory evidence you can use visual information auditory information  and that might tell you it 's going to land in that red spot  
 but you know that your senses are not perfect 
 and therefore there 's some variability of where it 's going to land shown by that cloud of red representing numbers between zero point five and maybe zero point one 
 that information is available in the current
 but there 's another source of information not available on the current shot  but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis and that 's that the ball doesn 't bounce with equal probability over the court during the match 
 if you 're playing against a very good opponent they may distribute it in that green area which is the prior distribution making it hard for you to return  now both these
  of information carry important information  and what bayes ' rule says is that i should multiply the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green to get the numbers of the yellow which have the ellipses  and that 's my belief 
 so it 's the optimal way of combining information now i wouldn 't tell you all this if it wasn 't that a few years ago we showed this is exactly what people do when they learn new movement skills and
 what it means is we really are bayesian inference machines as we go around
  we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down  but we also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is and then combine those in a real bayesian way  
 now a key part to the bayesian is this part of the formula  
 and what this part really says is i have to predict the probability of different sensory feedbacks given my beliefs  
 so that really means i have to make predictions of the future  
 and i want to convince you the brain does make predictions of the sensory feedback
  it profoundly changes your perceptions by what you do  
 and to do that i 'll tell you about how the brain deals with sensory input  so you send a command out 
 you get sensory feedback back and that transformation is governed by the physics of your body and your sensory apparatus  
 but you can imagine looking inside the brain and here 's inside the
  you might have a little predictor a neural simulator of the physics of your body and your senses  so as you send a movement command down you tap a copy of that off and run it into your neural simulator to anticipate
 the sensory consequences of your actions so as i shake this ketchup bottle  i get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row  and if i 've got a good predictor  it predicts the same thing 
 well why would i bother doing that
 i 'm going to get the same feedback anyway  well there 's good reasons  imagine as i shake the ketchup bottle someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me
 now i get an extra source of sensory information due to that external act  
 so i get two sources i get you tapping on it  and i get me shaking it but from my senses ' point of view that is combined together into one source of information  
 now there 's good reason to believe that you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events
 because external events
  actually much more behaviorally relevant than feeling everything that 's going on inside my body  
 so one way to reconstruct that is to compare the prediction which is only based on your movement commands with the reality any discrepancy 
 should hopefully be external so as i go around the world  i 'm making predictions of what i should get subtracting them off everything left over is external to me 
  clear example
 where a sensation generated by myself feels very different then if generated by another person and so we decided the most obvious place to start was with tickling it
 's been known for a long time you can 't tickle yourself as well as other people can 
 but it hasn 't really been shown it 's because you have a neural simulator  simulating your own body and subtracting off that sense
  so we can bring the experiments of the 21st century by applying robotic technologies to this problem 
 and in effect what we have is some sort of stick in one hand attached to a robot and they 're going to move that back and forward 
 and then we 're going to track that with a computer and use it to control another robot which is going to tickle their palm with another stick  
 and then we 're going to ask them to rate a bunch of things including ticklishness i 'll show you just one part of our study 
 and here i 've taken away the robots but basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward  and we replay that to the other hand
 with a time delay  either no time delay in which case light would just tickle your palm or with a time 
 so the important point here is the right hand always does the same things sinusoidal movement the left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle all we 're playing with is a tempo causality  
  and as we go from naught to zero point one second it becomes more ticklish as you go from zero point
  one to zero point two it becomes more ticklish at the end and by zero point two of a second  it 's equivalently ticklish to the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything 
 so whatever is responsible for this cancellation is extremely tightly coupled with tempo causality  and based on this illustration we really convinced ourselves in the field that the brain 's making precise predictions and subtracting them off from the sensations  
 now i have to admit these are the worst studies my lab has ever run
  because the tickle sensation on the palm comes and goes you need large numbers of subjects with these stars making them significant  so we were looking for a much more objective way to assess this phenomena  and in the intervening years i had two daughters 
 and one thing you notice about children in backseats of cars on long journeys they get into fights which started with one of them doing something to the other the other retaliating it quickly
  and children tend to get into fights which escalate in terms of force now when i screamed at my children to stop  sometimes they would both say to me
 the other person hit them harder  
 now i happen to know my children don 't lie  so i thought as a neuroscientist it was important how i could explain how they were telling inconsistent truths  
 and we hypothesize based on the tickling study
 that when one child hits another they generate the movement
  they predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off so they actually think they 've hit the person less hard than they have rather like the tickling 
 whereas the passive recipient doesn 't make the prediction feels the full blow  so if they retaliate with the same force the first person will think it 's been escalated  
 so we decided to test this in the lab now
 we don 't work with children we don 't work with hitting but the concept is identical  we bring in two adults we tell them they 're going to play a game 
 and so here 's player one and player two sitting opposite
  and the game is very simple 
 we started with a motor with a little lever a little force transfuser and we use this motor to apply force down to player one 's fingers for three seconds and then it stops  
 and that player 's been told remember the experience of that force
 and use your other finger to apply the same force down to the other subject 's finger through a force transfuser and they do
  player two 's been told remember the experience of that force use your other hand to apply the force back down  
 and so they take it in turns to apply the force they 've just experienced back and forward  
 but critically they 're briefed about the rules of the game in separate rooms  so they don 't know the rules the other person 's playing by  
 and what we 've measured is the force as a function of terms and if we look at what we start with a quarter of a newton there a number of turns perfect would be that red line  and what we see in all pairs of subjects is this
 a seventy percent escalation in force on each go  
 so it really suggests when you 're doing this based on this study and others we 've done that the brain is canceling the sensory consequences and underestimating the force it 's producing  
 so it re shows the brain makes predictions and fundamentally changes the precepts 
 so we 've made inferences we 've done
  now we have to generate actions  
 and what bayes ' rule says is given my beliefs  the action should in some sense be optimal but we 've got a problem  
 tasks are symbolic i want to drink i want to dance but the movement system has to contract six hundred muscles in a particular sequence and there 's a big gap between the task and the movement 
  system  so it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways so think about just a point to point movement i could choose these two
  infinite number of paths having chosen a particular path  i can hold my hand on that path as infinitely many different joint configurations  
 and i can hold my arm in a particular joint configuration either very stiff or very relaxed  
 so i have a huge amount of choice to make now it turns out we are extremely stereotypical  we all move the same way pretty much  
 and so it turns out we 're so stereotypical our brains have got dedicated neural circuitry to decode this stereotyping  so if i take some dots and
  set them in motion with biological motion your brain 's circuitry would understand instantly what 's going on 
 now this is a bunch of dots moving you will know what this person is doing whether happy sad old young a huge amount of information if these dots were cars going on a racing circuit you would have absolutely no idea what 's going on 
 so why is it that we move the particular ways we do
  maybe we don 't all quite move the same way maybe there 's variation in the population and maybe those who move better than others have got more chance of getting their children into the next generation  so in evolutionary scales movements get better and perhaps in life movements get better through learning  
 so what is it about a movement which is good or bad imagine i want to intercept this ball here are two possible
  if i choose the left hand path  i can work out the forces required in one of my muscles as a function of time  
 but there 's noise added to this so what i actually get based on this lovely smooth desired force is a very noisy version  so if i pick the same command through many times i will get a different noisy version each time because noise changes each time  
 so what i can show you here is how the variability of the movement will evolve if i choose that
  if i choose a different way of moving on the right for example then i 'll have a different command different noise playing through a noisy system very complicated all we can be sure of is the variability will be different if i move in this particular way  
 i end up with a smaller variability across many movements so if i have to choose between those two i would choose the right one because it 's less variable  and the fundamental idea is you want to plan 
  your movements so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise and one intuition to get is
  actually the amount of noise or variability i show here gets bigger as the force gets bigger so you want to avoid big forces as one principle  
 so we 've shown that using this we can explain a huge amount of data that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements so as to minimize negative consequences of noise  
 so i hope i 've convinced you the brain is there and evolved to control movement and it 's an intellectual challenge to understand how we do that
 it 's also relevant for disease and rehabilitation there are many diseases which effect movement  
 and hopefully if we understand how we control movement we can apply that to robotic technology 
 and finally i want to remind you when you see animals do what look like very simple tasks  the actual complexity of what is going on inside their brain is really quite dramatic  thank you very much
  that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about the the dreaming the yearning the falling in love and all these things are a kind of side show an accident
  sensation or memory without realizing why you 're laying down memories of childhood  the fact that we forget most of our childhood for example is probably fine because it doesn 't effect our movements later in life  
 you only need to store things which are really going to effect movement ca 
 so you think that people thinking about the brain and consciousness generally could get real insight by saying  where does movement play in this game dw so people have
 found out for example that studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision
 is a mistake you have to study vision with the realization of how the movement system is going to use vision  and it uses it very differently once you think about
