  when i was seven years old and my sister was just five years old we were playing on top of a bunk bed  i was two years older than my sister at the time i mean 
 i 'm two years older than her now but
 at the time it meant she had to do everything that i wanted to do and i wanted to play war so we were up on top of our bunk beds
  side of the bunk bed i had put out all of my g i joe soldiers and weaponry  and on the other side were all my sister 's my little ponies ready for a cavalry charge 
 there are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon  but since my sister is not here with us today 
 let me tell you the true story 
 which is my sister 's a little on the clumsy
  without any help or push from her older brother at all amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor i nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my 
  fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground  i was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and i played as safely and as quietly as possible  
  heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet 
 for which i have yet to be thanked i was trying as hard as i could
 she didn 't even see it coming i was trying hard to be on my best behavior and i saw my sister 's face this wail of pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and wake my parents from the long winter 's
  nap for which they had settled so i did the only thing my frantic seven year old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy and if you have children you 've seen this hundreds of times i said amy wait don 't cry  did you see how you landed 
 no human lands on all fours like that 
 amy i think this means
  amy the hurt five year old little sister but amy the special unicorn of course this option was open to her brain at no point in the past and you could see how my poor manipulated sister faced conflict 
 as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced or contemplating her new found identity as a unicorn  
 and the latter won instead of crying or ceasing our play instead of waking my parents with all the negative consequences
 a smile spread across her face and she scrambled back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn 
 with one broken leg what we stumbled across
 at this tender age of just five and seven we had no idea at the time was was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain we had stumbled across something called positive psychology which is the reason
 i 'm here today and the reason that i wake up every morning when i started talking about this research outside of academia with companies and schools the first thing they said to never do is to start
  with a graph the first thing i want to do is start with a graph this graph looks boring but it is the reason i get excited and wake up every morning and this graph doesn 't even mean anything it 's fake data  what we
  if i got this data studying you i would be thrilled because there 's a trend there and that means that i can get published  which is all that really matters
 there is one weird red dot above the curve there 's one weirdo in the room i know who you are i saw you earlier
 that 's no problem that 's no problem as most of you know because i can just delete that dot i can delete that dot because that 's clearly a measurement error
  error  and we know that 's a measurement error because it 's messing up my data so one of
 the first things we teach people in economics statistics business and psychology courses is how in a statistically valid way do we eliminate the weirdos how do we eliminate the outliers
 so we can find the line of best fit which is fantastic if i 'm trying to find out how many advil the average person should be
  if i 'm interested in your potential or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity we 're creating the cult of the average with science if i asked a question like how fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom 
 scientists change the answer to how fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom and we tailor the class towards the average  if you fall below the average  then psychologists get thrilled  because that means you 're depressed
  have a disorder or hopefully both we
 're hoping for both because our business model is if you come into a therapy session with one problem we want to make sure you leave knowing you have ten so you keep coming back we 'll go back into your childhood if necessary but 
  eventually we want to make you normal again  but normal is merely average  and positive psychology posits that if we study what is merely average we will remain merely average 
  then instead of deleting those positive outliers what i intentionally do is come into a population like this one and say
  you high above the curve in terms of intellectual  athletic musical ability creativity energy levels resiliency in the face of challenge sense of humor  whatever it is instead of deleting you what i 
  want to do is study you because maybe we can glean information not just how to move people up to the average but move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide the reason this graph is important to me is on the news the majority of the information is not positive in fact
  negative most of it 's about murder corruption diseases natural disasters and very quickly my brain starts to think that 's the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world
  the medical school syndrome
  during the first year of medical training as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases suddenly you realize you have all of them i
 have a brother in law named bobo  which is a whole other story  bobo
 married amy
  unicorn bobo called me on the phone
 from yale medical school and bobo said shawn i have leprosy 
 which even at yale is extraordinarily rare  but i had no idea how to console poor bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause 
  're finding it 's not necessarily the reality that shapes us but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality and if we can change the lens not only can we change your happiness we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time
 i applied to harvard on a dare  i didn 't expect to get in and my family had no money for college when i got a military scholarship two weeks later they let me go something that wasn 't even a possibility became a reality 
 i assumed everyone there would see it as a privilege as well that they 'd be excited to be there even in a classroom full of people smarter than you i felt you 'd be happy just to be in that
  classroom but what i found is while some people experience that when i graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students harvard asked me to i
 wasn 't that guy  
 i was an officer to counsel students through the difficult four years and in my research
  that these students no matter how happy they were with their original success success of getting into the school two weeks later their brains were focused not on the privilege of being there  nor on their philosophy or physics 
 but on the competition the workload the hassles stresses complaints when i first went in there i walked into the freshmen dining hall which is where my friends from waco texas which is where i grew up i know some of you
  this they say  why do you waste your time studying happiness at harvard what does a harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness because what that question assumes
 is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels  when in reality  if i know everything about your external world i can only predict ten
  ninety percent of your long term happiness is predicted not by the external world but by the way your brain processes the world  and if we change it if we change our formula for happiness and success  we can change the way that we can then affect reality  
 what we found is that only  twenty five % of job successes are predicted by iq seventy five percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat i talked to a new england
  most prestigious one and they said we already know that so every year instead of just teaching our students we have a wellness week and we 're so excited monday night we have the world 's leading expert will speak about adolescent depression  tuesday night it 's school violence and bullying  
 wednesday night is eating disorders thursday night is illicit drug use and friday night we 're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness 
  which i 'm glad you liked but they did not like that at all silence on the phone and into the silence i said 
 i 'd be happy to speak at your school but that 's not a wellness week that 's a sickness week you 've outlined all the negative things that can happen but not talked about the positive the absence of disease is not health here 's how we get to health  we need to reverse the formula for happiness and success
 in the last three years i 've traveled to forty five countries working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn and i found that most companies and schools follow a formula for success  which is this if i work harder i 'll be more successful  and if i 'm more successful  then i 'll be happier 
 that undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles the way that we motivate our behavior and the problem is it 's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons every time your brain has a success
 you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like you got good grades now you have to get better grades you got into a good school and after you get into a better one you got a good job now you have to get a better job you hit your sales target we 
 and if happiness is on the opposite side of success your brain never gets there  we 've pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society  
 and that 's because we think we have to be successful
  can raise somebody 's level of positivity in the present  then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage  which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than at negative 
  neutral or stressed your intelligence rises your creativity rises your energy levels rise in fact we 've found that every single business outcome improves 
  sales  doctors are nineteen percent faster more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative neutral or stressed which means we can reverse the formula if we can find a way of becoming positive in the present  then our brains work even more successfully
 as we 're able to work harder  faster and more intelligently 
 we need to be able to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of because dopamine which floods into your system when
 not only does it make you happier  it turns on all of the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way we 've found there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive 
 in just a  two minute span of time done for twenty one days in a row  we can actually rewire your brain allowing your brain to actually work
  we 've done these things in research now in every company that i 've worked with getting them to write down three new things that they 're grateful for for  twenty one days in a row three new things each day  and at the end of that their brain 
  starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative but for the positive first journaling about one positive experience you 've had over the past twenty four hours allows your brain to relive it exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters  we find that meditation allows your brain to get
  that we 've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand and finally  random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness we get people when they open up their inbox 
 to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their support network and by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies what we 've found is we can reverse the formula for happiness 
  and success  and in doing so not only create ripples of positivity but a real revolution
