  three years ago  i was standing about a hundred yards from chernobyl nuclear reactor number four 
 my geiger counter dosimeter which measures radiation was going berserk and the closer i got
  i was there covering the 25th anniversary of the world 's worst nuclear accident as you can see by the look on my face reluctantly so  
 but with good reason because the nuclear fire that burned for eleven days back in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six released four hundred times as much radiation as the bomb dropped on
  and the sarcophagus which is the the covering over reactor number four which was hastily built twenty seven years ago  now sits cracked and rusted and leaking radiation  
 so i was filming  
 i just wanted to get the job done and get out of there fast but
 then i looked into the distance and i saw some smoke
 coming from a farmhouse  and i 'm thinking who could be living here
  after all chernobyl 's soil water and air are among the most highly contaminated on earth and the reactor sits at the the center of a tightly regulated exclusion zone  or dead zone  
 and it 's a nuclear police state complete with border guards you have to have dosimeter at all times clicking away you have to have a government minder  and there 's draconian radiation rules and
 constant contamination
  the point being no human being should be living anywhere near the dead zone  but they are 
 it turns out an unlikely community of some two hundred people are living inside the zone they 're called  self settlers and almost all of them are women
 the men having shorter lifespans in part due to overuse of alcohol cigarettes  if not radiation  
  hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated at the time of the accident  but not everybody accepted that fate  the women in the zone now in their 
 are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities and it would seem common sense and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone  
 they did so illegally as one woman put it to a soldier who was trying to evacuate her for a second time 
 shoot me and dig the grave  otherwise i 'm going home
  why would they return to such deadly soil i mean were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them  or both  
 the thing is they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently  
 now around chernobyl there are scattered ghost villages eerily silent strangely charming  bucolic  
  many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident
 but a few are left like this kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy  
 others have a few residents in them  one or two babushkas or babas which are the russian and ukrainian words for grandmother  another village might have six or 
  seven residents so this is the strange demographic of the zone isolated
  and when i made my way to that piping chimney i 'd seen in the distance i saw hanna zavorotnya and i met her 
 she 's the self declared mayor of kapavati village population eight 
 and she said to me when i asked her the obvious radiation doesn 't scare me  starvation does and
 you have to remember these women
  the worst atrocities of the 20th century  stalin 's enforced famines of the 1930s the holodomor  killed millions of ukrainians and they faced the nazis in the ' 40s who
 came through slashing burning raping and in fact many of these women were shipped to germany as forced labor  
 so when a couple decades into soviet rule chernobyl happened they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy that was invisible 
 so they returned to their villages
  and are told they 're going to get sick and die soon  
 but five happy years their logic goes is better than ten stuck in a high rise on the outskirts of kiev separated from the graves of their mothers and fathers and babies  
 the whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon 
 for them  environmental contamination may not be the worst sort of devastation it turns out this holds true for
  other species as well 
 wild boar  lynx moose they 've all returned to the region in force the very real very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans 
 the dead zone  it turns out is full of life  
  a kind of heroic resilience a kind of
 plain spoken pragmatism to those who start their day at five a m pulling water from a well and end it at midnight poised to beat a bucket with a stick and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes their only
 company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka  
 and there 's a patina of simple defiance among them they told us our legs would hurt  and they do so what
  what about their health the benefits of of hardy physical living but an environment made toxic by a complicated little understood enemy radiation it
 's incredibly difficult to parse health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught the world health organization puts the number of
  organizations put that number in the tens of thousands 
 now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers are sky high and that chernobyl evacuees suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere 
 higher levels of anxiety depression alcoholism unemployment and importantly  disrupted social networks 
  like many of you  i have moved maybe twenty twenty five times in my life home is a transient concept
 i have a deeper connection to my laptop than any bit of soil  
 so it 's hard for us to understand but home is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka  and connection to the land is
  and perhaps because these ukrainian women were schooled under the soviets and versed in the russian poets
  aphorisms about these ideas slip from their mouths all the time if you leave you die 
 those who left are worse off now they are dying of sadness motherland is motherland i will never leave 
 what sounds like faith soft
  may actually be fact 
 because the surprising truth i mean there are no studies but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on earth for the 
  last twenty seven years have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation 
 how could this be here 's a theory could it be that those ties to ancestral soil
 the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms actually affect longevity  
 the power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative 
 home and community are forces that rival even radiation  
 now radiation or not these women are at the end of their lives in the next decade
  the zone 's human residents will be gone  and it will revert to a wild  radioactive place  
 full only of animals and occasionally
 daring flummoxed scientists  
 but the spirit and existence of the babushkas whose numbers have been halved in the three years i 've known them 
 will leave us with powerful new templates to think about and grapple with about
 the relative nature of risk about transformative connections to home and about the magnificent
 tonic of personal agency and
