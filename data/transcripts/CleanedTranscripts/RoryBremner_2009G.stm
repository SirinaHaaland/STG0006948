  chris has been so nice i don 't know how you keep it up chris i really don 't so nice all week he 's the kind of man you could say to chris i 'm really sorry  i 've crashed your car and
 it gets worse  i crashed it into your house your house has
  and what 's more your wife has just run off with your best friend and you know that chris would say thank you 
 thank you for sharing that 's really interesting 
 thank you for taking me to a place that i didn 't know existed thank you 
 one of the 
 thank you for inviting us one of the things about appearing later on in the ted week is that  gradually as the days go by all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say
  nuclear fusion i had about ten minutes on that
 spectroscopy that was another one  parallel universes and
 so this morning i thought oh well i 'll just do a card trick 
 that one 's gone as well and today is emmanuel 's day i think we 've agreed that already
 laughter so that 's going to look pretty shabby now 
 so what i thought i 'd do is in honor of emmanuel is 
 what i can do is to launch today the first ted global auction if i could start this is the enigma
 decoding machine who will start me with $ one thousand  anyone
  don 't go through this don 't do it 
 i 'm worried when i first
 got the invitation they said somewhere in the thing they said fifteen minutes to change the world your moment onstage fifteen minutes to change the world i don 't know about you it takes me fifteen minutes to change a plug 
 so the idea of changing the world is really quite
  of course now we know we don 't have to change a plug now we 've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless
 electric fantastic you know it inspires us three hundred years ago he 'd have been burnt at the stake for that 
 and now it 's an idea 
 it 's great it 's fantastic but you do meet some fantastic people 
 people who look at the world in a totally different way  yesterday david deutsch  another one who covered most of what i was going to say 
 but when you think of the world in that way it does make going
  to starbucks a whole new experience don 't you think i mean he must walk in and they will say would you like a macchiato or a latte or an americano or a cappuccino 
 and he 'll say 
 you 're offering me things that are infinitely variable 
 how can your coffee be true 
 and they will say would you mind if i serve the next customer
 and elaine morgan yesterday wasn 't she wonderful fantastic really good 
 her talk about the the aquatic ape and the link of course the link between between darwinism and the fact that we are all
 naked
 beneath this we 're not hirsute and we can swim rather well  and she said you know she 's ninety she 's running out of time she said and she 's desperate to find more evidence for the link and i think i 'm sitting next to lewis pugh
  swum around the north pole what more evidence do you want and there he is 
 that 's how ted brings these connections together i wasn 't here on tuesday i didn 't actually see gordon brown 's job application
  the problem i have is because gordon brown he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who 's just taken the head off a bear suit 
 hello can i tell you what happened in the woods back there uh no 
 i 'm sorry i 've only got eighteen minutes eighteen minutes to talk
  our work on climate change  i 've only got eighteen minutes unfortunately i 'm not able to tell you about all the wonderful things we 're doing to promote the climate change agenda in great britain 
 like the the third runway we 're planning at heathrow airport
 power station we 're building at king 's north and of course
  thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal  thou shalt not covet thy neighbor 's wife
 although to be honest  when i was at number eleven that was never going to be a problem
  i wrote to him just before i left office i said  ' can i rely on your support for the next month ' and he wrote back he said ' no you can
  another thing gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the mansion house in two thousand and two that was to the building the people weren 't listening but the people when talking about the finance industry he said 
 what you as the city of london have done for financial services we as a government hope to do for the economy as a whole
  you think what 's happened to financial services and you see what 's happened to the economy you think well there is a man who delivers on his promises 
 but we 're in a new world now we 're in a completely new world this is the first time that i can remember where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan you don 't know if you 're borrowing money from him or if he 's borrowing money from you 
 am i right these extraordinary things icelandic internet accounts did anyone here have an
  why would you do that  why would it 's like one step up from replying to one of those emails from nigeria isn 't it 
 asking for your bank details and you know  iceland it was never going to cut it it didn 't have that kind of of collateral what does it have it has fish  
 that 's all that 's why the prime minister went on television he said 
 this has left us all with a very big haddock
  a lot of what i do i have to try and make sense of things before i can make nonsense of them and making sense of the financial crisis is very very difficult 
 luckily  somebody like george bush was really helpful he summed it up really at a dinner he was speaking at a dinner he said wall street got drunk
  there are the known knowns the things we know we know  and then you got the known unknowns  the things we know we don 't know 
 and then you got the unknown unknowns  those are the things we don 't know we don 't know and being english when i first heard that i thought what a load of cock
  and then you 're now well actually  that 's what this is about this whole what ben bernanke has said the chaotic unwinding of the world 's
 financial system it 's about
 they don 't know they didn 't know what they were doing in two thousand and six the head of the american mortgage bankers association said  quote 
 as we can clearly see no seismic occurrence is about to overwhelm the u s economy
 now there is a man on top of his job and when the crisis was happening the head of quantitative equities at lehman brothers
 said events which models predicted predicted would happen once every ten thousand years happened every day for three days 
 so it 's extraordinary it 's a new world that 's very very difficult to make sense of
  but we have a
  new hope we have a new man america has now elected its first openly black president 
 wonderful news 
 not only that he 's left handed have you noticed this how many people here are left handed 
 you see a lot of the people that i most admire they 're
 great artists great designers great thinkers they 're left handed and somebody said to me last night you know being left handed you have to learn to write
 without smudging the ink and somebody was talking about metaphors on monday  and i thought what a wonderful metaphor isn 't it an american president who has to write
  without smudging the ink you like that one 
 as opposed to you could see george bush well what 's the metaphor there i think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing wouldn 't it well you know i 'm sorry about that 
 i 'm right handed but i seem to have smudged that ink as well 
 but you know he 's gone now he 's gone that 's eight years of american history eight minutes of my act just gone like that
 i know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the united states 
 but we proved them wrong in iraq  they said there was no link between iraq and al qaeda 
 there is now 
 but i have a message for the suicide bombers for those people
  going to make sure you don 't do it again but now he 's gone and it 's great to see one of the
 arguably one of the worst speech makers in american history now given way to one of the greatest in obama you were there maybe on the night of his victory and he spoke to the crowd in chicago he said 
 if there
 is anyone out there
 who still
  doubts that america is a place
 where all things are possible i can 't do the whole thing because it would take too long it really would but
 you get the picture and then it goes to the inauguration  and he and the chief justice they trip over each other they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up and there is george bush
  but the interesting thing is gordon brown was talking about cicero who said  people would listen to a speech they said great speech and then they 'd listen to demosthenes and they 'd say let 's march
 and we all want to believe in president obama it 's rather like that line in the film as good as it gets do you remember that film with helen hunt and jack nicholson and helen
  what do you see in me and jack nicholson just says you make me want to be a better man 
 and you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen right 
 but at the moment it 's a cicero thing we like what barack obama says but we don 't do anything about it so he comes over to this country and he says we need
 a big fiscal stimulus and everyone goes great
  it 's great to have an american president who can say the word nuclear let 's just point that out first
  north korea that very day north korea is just seeing if it can just get one over japan and land it before so where do we look for inspiration
  make this world a better place if you can i just think that 's important  i really do
 and i was hoping hillary would get to the white house because she 'd have been out of our home for four years and i you know 
 so when that didn 't work out i had to make a few arrangements let me tell you so
 there 's him in britain we have prince charles and the environment is so important all we can do my wife gets fed up with me constantly
  the great man mandela
 he 's been honored with a statue now the previous highest honor he had in britain was a visit from the team from ground force a gardening program so nelson how would you like a nice water feature
  held in prison
 for nearly thirty years
 on an island in the middle of the ocean  why would i need a bloody water feature
