  to believe that it 's less than a year since the extraordinary moment when the finance the credit which drives our economies froze 
 a massive cardiac arrest the effect  the payback perhaps for years of
 vampire predators like bernie madoff whom we saw earlier
  abuse of steroids binging and so on  and it 's only a few months since governments injected enormous sums of money to try and keep
 the whole system afloat and we 're now in a very strange sort of twilight zone where no one quite knows what 's worked or what doesn 't we don 't have any
 very clear maps any compass to guide us  we don 't know which experts to believe anymore
  what i 'm going to try and do is to give some pointers to what i think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis what things we should be looking out for
 and how we can actually use the crisis  there 's a definition of leadership which says it 's the ability to use the smallest possible crisis
 for the biggest possible effect and i want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis which is by no means small really is
  used to the full i want to start just by saying a bit about where i 'm coming from i 've got a very confused background which
 perhaps makes me appropriate for confused times i 've got a ph d in telecoms as you can see i trained briefly as a buddhist monk under this guy i
 've been a civil servant  and i 've been in charge of policy for this guy as well but what i want to talk about begins
  when i was at this city this university as a student 
 and then as now it was a beautiful place of balls and punts  beautiful people many of whom took to heart ronald reagan 's comment
 that even if they say hard work doesn 't do you any harm why risk it 
 but when i was here a lot of my fellow teenagers were in a very different situation leaving school at
  time then of rapidly growing youth unemployment 
 and essentially hitting a brick wall in terms of their opportunities and i spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts  
 and they were people who were not short of
 of wit or grace or energy but they had no hope no jobs no prospects and when people
  't allowed to be useful they soon think that they 're useless 
 and although that was great for the music business at the time it wasn 't much good for anything else and ever since then i 've wondered why it is that capitalism
 is so amazingly efficient at some things but so inefficient at others  why it 's so innovative in some ways and so un innovative in others  
 now since that time we 've actually been through an extraordinary boom the longest boom ever in the history of this country
  unprecedented wealth and prosperity but that growth hasn 't always delivered what we needed
 h l mencken once said that to every complex problem there is a simple solution and it 's wrong 
 but i 'm not saying growth is wrong but it 's very striking that throughout the years of growth many things didn 't get better rates of
  carried on up right across the western world 
 if you look at america the proportion of americans with no one to talk to about important things went up from a tenth to a quarter 
 we commuted longer to work but as you can see from this graph 
 the longer you commute the less happy you 're likely to be and it became ever clearer that economic growth doesn 't automatically translate into social growth or human growth
  we 're now at another moment when another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market there will be a million unemployed young people here by the end of the year  thousands losing their jobs everyday in america  
 we 've got to do whatever we can to help them but we 've also got to ask i think a more profound question
 of whether we use this crisis to jump forward to a different kind
  's more suited to human needs to a better balance of economy and society  
 and i think one of the lessons of history is that even the deepest crises can be moments of opportunity 
 they bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream they often lead to the acceleration of much needed reforms  
 and you saw that in the ' 30s when
  great depression paved the way for bretton woods welfare states
 and so on  
 and i think you can see around us now some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism which could grow you can see it in daily life 
 when times are hard people have to do things for themselves  and right across the world  oxford omaha  omsk 
 you can see an extraordinary explosion of urban farming people taking over land taking over roofs  turning barges into temporary farms and i 'm
  very small part of this i have sixty thousand of these things in my garden a few of these this is atilla the hen
  and i 'm a very small part of a very large movement which  for some people is about survival  but is also about values about a different kind of economy which isn 't so much about consumption and credit  
 but about things which matter to
  and everywhere too you can see a proliferation of time banks and parallel currencies people using smart technologies to link up all the resources freed up by the market 
 people buildings land and linking them to whomever has got the most compelling needs  
  i 'm from the government  and i 'm here to help 
 but i think last year when governments did step in people were quite glad that they were there that they did act 
 but now a few months on however good politicians are at swallowing frogs without pulling a face as someone once put it they can 't hide their uncertainty  
 because it 's already clear how much of the enormous amount of money they put into the economy really went into fixing the past bailing out the banks the car companies not preparing us for the
 how much of the money is going into concrete and boosting consumption not into solving the really profound problems we have to solve  and everywhere as people think about the unprecedented 
  sums which are being spent of our money and our children 's money now in the depth of this crisis they 're asking  surely  we should be using this with a longer term vision
  to deal with some of the inequalities which scar countries like this and
 the united states rather than just giving the money to the incumbents surely  we should be giving the money to entrepreneurs to civil society for people able to create the new not 
  to the big well connected companies big  clunky government programs 
  fish don 't overdo it 
 and i think more and more people are also asking why boost consumption  rather than change what we consume 
 like the mayor of so paulo who 's banned advertising billboards or the many cities like san francisco putting in infrastructures for electric cars 
 you can see a bit of the same thing happening in
 in the business world some
 i think some of the bankers who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing 
 but ask yourselves what will be the biggest sectors of the economy in ten twenty thirty years time it won 't be the ones lining up for handouts like cars and aerospace and so on 
 the biggest sector by far will be health
 already eighteen percent of the american economy predicted to grow to thirty even forty percent by
  care child care already much bigger employers than cars education six seven eight percent of the economy and growing 
 environmental services energy services the myriad of green jobs they 're all pointing to a very different kind of economy
 which isn 't just about products but is using distributed networks 
 and it 's founded above all on care on relationships on what people do to other people
  often one to one rather than simply selling them a product  
 and i think that what connects the challenge for civil society the challenge for governments and the challenge for business now is in a way a very simple one  
 but quite a difficult one  
 we know our societies have to radically change  we know
  go back to where we were before
 the crisis  
 but we also know it 's only through experiment  that we 'll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city how to care for a much older population 
 how to
 deal with drug addiction and so on  and here 's the problem 
 in science we do experiments systematically our societies now spend
  four percent of gdp
 to invest systematically in new discovery in science in technology to fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions which illuminate gatherings like this it 's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago maybe they
 are but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did 
 and what 's striking though is that in society there 's almost nothing comparable no comparable investment no systematic experiment in the things capitalism
  isn 't very good at like compassion or empathy or relationships or care now i didn 't really understand that until i met this guy
 who was then an 80 year old slightly shambolic man who lived on tomato soup and thought ironing was very overrated 
 he had helped shape britain 's post war
  its welfare state its economy  but had sort of reinvented himself as a social entrepreneur became an inventor of many many different
 organizations some famous ones like the open university which has one hundred and ten thousand students  the university of the third age which has nearly half a million older people teaching other older people 
 as well as strange things like diy garages and language lines and schools for social entrepreneurs and he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists
  he believed if you see a problem you shouldn 't tell someone to act you should act on it yourself  and he lived long enough and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed that he said you should always take no as a question
 and not as an answer and his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers not from a theory
  but from experiment and experiment involving the people with the best intelligence on social needs which were usually the people living with those needs  and he believed we live with others  
 we share the world with others and therefore our innovation must be done with others too  not doing things at people for them
 and so on now  what he did didn 't used to have a name  but i think it 's rapidly becoming quite
  's what we do in the organization named after him where we try and invent create launch new ventures whether it 's schools web companies health organizations and so on 
 and we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement of institutions working on social innovation using ideas from design or technology or 
  community organizing to develop the germs of a future world but through practice and through demonstration and not through theory
 they 're spreading from korea to brazil to india to the usa and across
 europe  
 and they 've been given new momentum by the crisis by the need for better answers to joblessness community breakdown and so on some of the ideas are strange these are complaints choirs 
 people come together to sing about the things that really bug them 
 others are much more
  pragmatic
 health coaches learning mentors job clubs and some are quite structural like social impact bonds where you raise money to invest in diverting teenagers from crime or helping
  old people keep out of hospital  and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are 
  i think is rapidly becoming a common sense and part of how we respond to the crisis  recognizing the need to invest
 in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress 
 there were big health innovation funds launched earlier this year in this country as well as a public service innovation lab across northern europe many governments now have innovation laboratories within them  
 and just a few months ago  president obama
  launched the office of social innovation in the white house  
 and what people are beginning to ask is surely just as we invest in r and d two three four percent of our gdp of our economy  what if we put let 's say one percent of public 
  spending into social innovation into elder care  new kinds of education new ways of helping the disabled  perhaps we 'd achieve similar productivity gains in 
  society to those we 've had in the economy and in technology  
  big challenges were ones like getting a man on the moon  perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now
 are ones like eliminating child malnutrition stopping trafficking 
 or one  i think closer to home for america or europe  why don 't we set ourselves the goal of achieving a billion extra years of life for today 's citizens now those are all goals which could be achieved
 within a decade but only with radical and
  systematic experiment  not just with technologies  but also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too now
 i want to end by saying a little bit about what i think this means for capitalism 
 i think what this is all about this whole movement which is growing from the margins remains quite small nothing like the resources of a cern or a darpa or an ibm or a dupont 
  us is that capitalism is going to become more social it
 's already immersed in social networks  it will become more involved in social investment  and social care and in industries where the value
 comes from what you do with others  not just from what you sell to them  and from relationships as well as from consumption  but
  it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism
 about how you embed the dna of restless continual innovation into society trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work 
 now i think this future will be quite surprising to many people 
 in recent years a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won history was over
 and
 society would inevitably have to take second
  place to economy  but i 've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today and how they talked about the monarchy
 two hundred years ago  just after the french revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in france 
 then people said monarchy dominated everywhere because it was rooted in human nature  we were naturally
  we needed hierarchy 
 just as today the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism say it 's rooted in human nature  only now it 's individualism inquisitiveness and so on 
 then monarchy had seen off its big challenger  mass democracy which was seen as a well intentioned but doomed experiment just as capitalism has seen off socialism  
 even fidel castro now says that the only thing worse than being exploited by multinational capitalism is not being exploited by multinational capitalism
 and whereas then monarchies palaces and forts dominated every city skyline and looked permanent and confident today it 's the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city 
 i 'm not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades and string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost though that might be quite tempting
  but i do think we 're on the verge of a period when just as happened to the monarchy and interestingly the military too  the central position of finance capital is going 
  to come to an end and it 's going to steadily move to the sides the margins of our society transformed from being a master into a servant a servant to the productive economy and of human needs
 will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism which is that unlike what you read in economics textbooks it 's not a self sufficient system 
 it depends on other systems on ecology on family on community and if these aren 't replenished capitalism suffers too  
 and our human nature isn 't just
 selfish  it 's also compassionate it 's not just competitive it 's
  because of the depth of the crisis  i think we are
 at a moment of choice the crisis is almost certainly deepening around us it will be worse at the end of this year 
 quite possibly worse in a year 's time than it is today but this is one of those very rare moments when we have to choose
 whether we 're just pedaling furiously to get back to where we were a year or two ago 
  and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for or whether this is a moment to jump ahead to reboot
 and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway
