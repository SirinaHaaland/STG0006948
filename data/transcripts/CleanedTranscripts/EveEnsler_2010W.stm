  for a long time there was me and my body  
 me was composed of stories of cravings of strivings of desires of the future
  me was trying not to be an outcome of my violent past  
 but the separation that had already occurred between me and my body was a pretty significant outcome 
 me was always trying to become something somebody me only existed in the trying 
 my body was often in the way 
 me was a floating head for years  i actually only wore
  it was a way of keeping my head attached  it was a way of locating myself  i worried that [ if ] i took my hat off i wouldn 't be here anymore  
 i actually had a therapist who once said to me eve you 've been coming here for two years  and to be honest it never occurred to me that you had a body 
 all this time i lived in the city because to be honest i was afraid of trees 
 i never had babies because heads cannot give birth babies actually don 't come out of your mouth
 as i had no reference point for my body  
 i began to ask other women about their bodies in particular their vaginas because i thought vaginas were kind of important 
 this led to me writing the vagina monologues which led to me obsessively and incessantly talking about vaginas everywhere i could  
 i did this in front of many strangers  one night on stage i
  actually entered my vagina  
 it was an ecstatic experience 
 it scared me it energized me and then i became a driven person a driven vagina
  i began to see my body like a thing 
 a thing that could move fast like a thing that could accomplish other things many things all at once i began to see my body like an ipad
 or a car  i would drive it and demand things from it it had no limits  it was invincible  it was to be conquered and mastered like the earth herself  
 i didn 't heed it  no i organized it and i directed it  i didn 't have patience for my body i snapped it into shape 
 i was greedy  
  more than my body had to offer if i was tired i drank more espressos  if i was afraid i went to more dangerous places  oh sure  sure i had moments of appreciation of my body 
  the way an abusive parent can sometimes have a moment of kindness my father was really kind to me on my 16th birthday for example  
  i was sober i didn 't smoke  but all that was just a more sophisticated way to manipulate my body a further disassociation like planting a vegetable field on a freeway 
 as a result of me talking so much about my vagina  many women started to tell me about theirs their stories about their bodies 
 actually these stories compelled me around the world and i 've been to over
  i heard thousands of stories and i have to tell you there was always this moment where the women shared with me that particular moment when she separated from her body
 when she left home  
 i heard about women being molested in their beds  
 flogged in their burqas  left for dead in parking lots acid burned in their kitchens  
 some women became quiet and disappeared other women became mad driven machines like me
  in the middle of my traveling i turned forty and i began to hate my body  which was actually progress because at least my body existed enough to hate it  
 well my stomach
 it was my stomach i hated it was proof that i had not measured up that i was old and not fabulous and not perfect or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape 
 my stomach was proof that i had
  failed that it had failed me that it was broken 
 my life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it in fact  it became so extreme i wrote a play about it  
 but the more i talked about it the more objectified and fragmented my body became it became entertainment it became a new kind of commodity something i was selling
  then i went somewhere else  i went outside what i thought i knew  i went to the democratic republic of congo 
 and i heard stories that shattered all the other stories  i heard stories that got inside my body  
 i heard about a little girl
 who couldn 't stop peeing on herself because so many grown soldiers had shoved themselves inside her  i heard
  woman whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets and twisted up on her head as the soldiers raped her like that 
 there are thousands of these stories and many of the women had holes in their bodies holes fistula
 that were the violation of war holes in the fabric of their souls 
 these stories saturated my cells and nerves and to be honest
  i stopped sleeping for three years  
 all the stories began to bleed together  
 the raping of the earth  the pillaging of minerals  the destruction of vaginas
 none of these were separate anymore from each other or me  militias were raping 
  babies so that countries far away could get access to gold and coltan for their iphones
  and computers 
 my body had not only become a driven machine but it was responsible now for destroying other women 's bodies in its mad quest to make more machines to support the speed and efficiency of my machine 
 then i got cancer
 or i found out i had cancer it arrived like a speeding bird smashing into a windowpane  suddenly  i had a body
 a body that was pricked and poked and punctured a body that was cut wide open 
 a body that had organs removed and transported and rearranged and reconstructed 
 a body that was scanned and had tubes shoved down it a body that was burning from chemicals 
 cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection 
 understood that the crisis in my body was the crisis in the world and it wasn 't happening later  it was happening now 
 suddenly my cancer was a cancer that was everywhere  the cancer of cruelty  the cancer of greed  the cancer that gets inside people who live down the streets from chemical 
  plants and they 're usually poor the cancer inside the coal miner 's lungs  the cancer of stress for not achieving enough
  the cancer of buried trauma  the cancer in caged chickens and polluted fish  the cancer in women 's uteruses from being raped  the cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness 
 in his new and visionary book 
 new self new world the writer philip shepherd says if you are divided from your body  
 you are also divided from the body of the world
  then appears to be other than you or separate from you  rather than the living continuum to which you belong 
 before cancer the world was something other 
 it was as if i was living in a stagnant pool and cancer dynamited the boulder that was separating me from the larger sea 
 now i am swimming in it  now i lay down in the grass and
  i rub my body in it and i love the mud on my legs and feet now i make a daily pilgrimage to visit a particular weeping willow by the seine 
 and i hunger for the green fields in the bush outside bukavu  
 and when it rains hard rain i scream and i run in circles  
 i know that everything is connected  and the scar that runs the
  length of my torso is the markings of the earthquake  and i am there with the three million in the streets of  port au prince 
 and the fire that burned in me on day three through six of chemo is the fire that is burning in the forests of the world  
 i know that the abscess that grew around my wound
 after the operation the sixteen ounces of puss is the contaminated gulf of
  mexico  and there were  oil drenched pelicans inside me and dead floating fish  
 and the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication made me scream out
 the way the earth cries out from the drilling in my second chemo my mother got very sick
 and i went to see
  and in the name of connectedness the only thing she wanted before she died
 was to be brought home
 by her beloved gulf of mexico 
 so we brought her home  and i prayed that the oil wouldn 't wash up on her beach before she died and gratefully it didn 't 
 and she died quietly in her favorite place 
 and a few weeks later i was in new orleans and this beautiful spiritual friend told me she wanted to do a healing for me and i was honored
  and i went to her house and it was morning and the morning new orleans sun was filtering through the curtains 
 and my friend was preparing this big bowl and i said what is it and she said it 's for you  
 the flowers make it beautiful  and the honey makes it sweet 
 and i said but what 's the water part and in the name of connectedness
  it 's the gulf of mexico 
 and i said of course it is 
 and the other women arrived and they sat in a circle and michaela bathed my head with the sacred water  and she sang i mean her whole body sang and the other women sang and they prayed for me and my mother 
 and as the warm gulf washed over my naked head i realized that it held the best and the worst of us  
 it was the greed and recklessness that led to the drilling explosion
 it was all the lies that got told before and after  
 it was the honey in the water that made it sweet  it was the oil that made it sick  
 it was my head that was bald and comfortable now without a hat  it was my whole self melting into michaela 's lap  
 it was the tears that were indistinguishable from the gulf that were falling down my cheek  it was finally being
 in my body  it was the sorrow that 's taken
 so long  
 it was finding my place and the huge responsibility that comes with connection  
 it was the continuing devastating war in the congo and the indifference of the world  it was the congolese women who are now
  it was my mother leaving  just at the moment that i was being born  it was the realization that i had come very close to dying
 in the same way that the earth our mother is barely holding on 
 in the same way that seventy five percent of the planet
 are hardly scraping by in the same way that there is a recipe for survival what i
  learned is it has to do with attention
 and resources that everybody deserves  it was advocating friends and a doting sister  
 it was wise doctors and advanced medicine and surgeons who knew what to do with their hands  
 it was underpaid and really loving nurses  it was magic healers and aromatic oils  it was people who came with spells and rituals
  it was having a vision of the future and something to fight for because i know this struggle isn 't my own  
 it was a million prayers  it was a thousand hallelujahs and a million oms  it was a lot of anger  
 insane humor a lot of attention outrage  it was energy love and joy it was all these things  it was
  all these things  it was all these things in the water in the world  in my body
