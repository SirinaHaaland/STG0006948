  in the space that used to house one transistor we can now fit one billion 
 that made it so that a computer the size of an entire room now fits in your
  you might say the future is small 
 as an engineer  i 'm inspired by this miniaturization revolution in computers 
 as a physician i wonder whether we could use it to reduce the number of lives lost
 due to one of the 
  diseases on earth cancer  
 now when i say that what most people hear me say is that we 're working on curing cancer  and we are but it turns out that there
  's an incredible opportunity to save lives through the early detection and prevention of cancer  
 worldwide over two thirds of deaths due to cancer are fully preventable using methods that we already have in hand today  
 things like vaccination  timely screening and of course  stopping smoking  
 but even with the best tools and technologies that we have today
  tumors can 't be detected until ten years
 after they 've started growing when they are fifty million cancer cells strong 
 what if we had better technologies to detect some of these more deadly cancers sooner when they could be removed when they were just getting started 
 let me tell you about how miniaturization might get us there 
 this is a microscope in a typical lab
 that a pathologist would use for looking at a tissue specimen like a biopsy or a pap smear 
 this $ seven thousand microscope would be used by somebody with years of specialized training to spot cancer cells 
 this is an image from a colleague of mine at rice university  rebecca richards kortum what she and her team have done is miniaturize that whole microscope into this $ ten
  part  and it fits on the end of an optical fiber  
 now what that means is instead of taking a sample from a patient and sending it to the microscope you can bring the microscope to the patient 
 and then instead of requiring a specialist to look at the images you can train the computer to score normal
  versus cancerous cells  
 now this is important  because what they found working in rural communities is that even when they have a mobile screening van that can go out into the community and perform 
  exams and collect samples and send them to the central hospital for analysis 
 because they can 't afford the trip 
 with the integrated microscope and computer analysis rebecca and her colleagues have been able to create a van that has both a diagnostic setup and a treatment 
  setup and what that means is that they can do a diagnosis and perform therapy on the spot so no one is lost to follow up 
  now as engineers we think of this as straight up miniaturization you took a big thing and you made it little 
 but what i told you before about computers was that they transformed our lives when they became small enough for us to take them everywhere  
 so what is the transformational equivalent like that in medicine  
 well  
 what if you had a detector that was so small that it could circulate in your body  find the tumor all by itself
 and send a signal to the outside world 
 it sounds a little bit like science fiction  but actually  nanotechnology allows us to do just that 
 nanotechnology allows us to shrink the parts that make up the detector from the width of a human hair  which is one hundred microns to a thousand times smaller
  which is one hundred nanometers  and that has profound implications 
 it turns out that materials actually change their properties at the nanoscale 
 you take a common material like gold  and you grind it into dust into gold nanoparticles and it changes from looking gold to looking red 
 if you take a more exotic material like cadmium selenide forms a big black crystal
 if you make nanocrystals out of this material and
  put it in a liquid  and you shine light on it 
 they glow and they glow blue green  yellow  orange  red  depending only on their size it
 's wild can you imagine an object like that in the macro world it would be like all the denim jeans in your closet
 are all made of cotton  but they are different colors
  colors depending only on their size 
 so as a physician what 's just as interesting to me is that it 's not just the color of materials that changes at the nanoscale 
 the way they travel in your body also changes 
 and this is the kind of observation that we 're going to use to make a better cancer detector  so let me show you what i mean
 this is a blood vessel in the body  surrounding the blood vessel is a tumor we
 're going to inject nanoparticles into the blood vessel and watch how they travel from the bloodstream into the tumor  
 now it turns out that the blood vessels of many tumors are leaky and so nanoparticles can leak out from the bloodstream into the tumor 
 whether they leak out depends on their
  size  so in this image the smaller hundred nanometer blue nanoparticles are leaking out and the larger 
  red nanoparticles are stuck in the bloodstream  
 so that means as an engineer  depending on how big or small i make a material i can change where it goes in your body 
 in my lab we recently made
  cancer nanodetector that is so small that it could travel into the body and look for tumors 
 we designed it to listen for tumor invasion the orchestra of chemical signals that tumors need to make to spread 
 for a tumor to break out of the tissue that it 's born in it has to make chemicals called enzymes to chew through the scaffolding of tissues
 we designed these nanoparticles to be activated by these enzymes 
 one enzyme can activate a thousand of these chemical reactions in an hour  now in engineering we call that 
 ratio a form of amplification and it makes something ultrasensitive so
  but how do i get this activated signal to the outside world where i can act on it 
 for this we 're going to use one more piece of nanoscale biology  and that has to do with the kidney
 the kidney is a filter its job is to filter out the blood and put waste into the urine 
 it turns out that what the kidney filters is also dependent on size
  in this image what you can see is that everything smaller than five nanometers is going from the blood through the kidney into the urine  
 and everything else that 's bigger is retained  
 ok  so if i make
  100 nanometer cancer detector i inject it in the bloodstream it can leak into the tumor where it 's activated by tumor enzymes
  to release a small signal that is small enough to be filtered out of the kidney and put into the urine 
 i have a signal in the outside world that i can detect  
 ok but there 's one more problem this is a tiny little signal so how do i detect it well the signal is just a
  they 're molecules that we designed as engineers they 're completely synthetic  and we can design them so they are compatible with our tool of choice 
 if we want to use a really sensitive  fancy instrument called a mass spectrometer then we make a molecule with a unique mass 
 or maybe we want make something that 's more inexpensive and portable  
 then we make molecules that we can trap on paper like a pregnancy test in fact there 's a whole world of
  paper tests that are becoming available in a field called paper diagnostics alright where are we going with this 
 what i 'm going to tell you next as a lifelong researcher  represents a dream of mine i can 't say that 's it 's a promise it 's a dream  
 but i think we all have to have dreams to keep us pushing forward even and maybe especially cancer researchers
 i 'm going to tell you what i hope will happen with my technology that my team and i will 
  put our hearts and souls into making a reality  ok here goes  i dream
 that one day  instead of going into an expensive screening facility
 to get a colonoscopy or a mammogram  or a pap smear that you could get a shot
 wait an hour  and do a urine test on a paper strip  i imagine
 that this could even happen without the need for steady electricity  or a medical professional in the room 
 maybe they could be far away and connected only by the image on a smartphone  
 now i know this sounds like a dream but in the lab we already have this working in mice where it works better than
  existing methods for the detection of lung  colon and ovarian cancer and i hope that what this means is that one day
 we can detect tumors in patients sooner than ten years after they 've started growing 
 in all walks of life all around the globe  and that this would lead to earlier treatments  and that we could save more lives
  lives than we can today  with early detection thank you
