  is excited to be going to college 
 she couldn 't wait to get out of her parents ' house to prove to them that she 's an adult and to prove to her new friends that she belongs 
  she heads to a campus party where she sees a guy that she has a crush on  let 's call him mike 
 the next day hannah wakes up with a pounding headache 
 she can only remember the night in flashes but what she does remember is throwing up in the hall
 outside mike 's room
 and staring at the wall silently while he was inside her wanting it to stop then shakily stumbling home
  doesn 't feel good about what happened  but she thinks maybe this is just what sex in college is 
 one in five women and one in thirteen men will be sexually assaulted at some point during their college career in the united states  
 less than ten percent will ever report their assault to their
  or to the police and those who do on average wait eleven months to make the report 
 hannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own but when she sees mike taking girls home from parties she 's worried about them  
 after graduation hannah learns that she was one of five women
 who mike did the exact same thing to
  and this is not an unlikely scenario
 because ninety percent of sexual assaults are committed by repeat offenders 
 but with such low reporting rates it 's fairly unlikely that even repeat perpetrators will be reported much less anything happen if they are 
 in fact only six percent
 of assaults reported to the police end with the assailant spending a single day in prison
  percent chance that they 'll get away with it this means there 's practically no deterrent to assault in the united states  
 now i 'm an infectious disease epidemiologist by training i 'm interested in systems and networks and where we can concentrate our resources to do the most good 
 so this to me is a tragic but a solvable problem
  so when the issue of campus assault started hitting the news a few years ago  it felt like a unique opportunity to make a change  and so we did 
 we started by talking to college survivors and what they wish they 'd had in college is pretty simple 
 they wanted a website one they could use at the time and place that felt safest to them
 with clearly written information about their reporting options
 with the ability to electronically report their assault rather than having the first step to go in and talk to someone who may or may not believe them 
 with the option to create a secure timestamped document of what happened to them  preserving evidence even if they don 't want to report yet  
 and lastly  and perhaps most critically
  with the ability to report their assault only if someone else reported the same assailant 
 you see knowing that you weren 't the only one changes everything it changes the way you frame your own experience 
 it changes the way you think about your perpetrator it means that if you do come forward you 'll have someone else 's back and they 'll have yours 
 we created a website that actually does this and we launched it [ 
  on two college campuses  and we included a unique matching system
 where if mike 's first victim
 had come forward  saved her record entered into the matching system and named mike  and mike 's second victim had done the same thing a few months later 
 they would have matched and the verified contact information of both survivors would have been sent to the authorities at the same time
  for investigation and follow up 
 if a system like this had existed for hannah and her peers  it 's more likely that they would have reported that they would have been believed  
 and that mike would have been kicked off campus gone to jail or at least gotten the help that he needed 
 and if we were able to stop repeat offenders like mike after just their second assault
 following a match survivors like hannah would never even be assaulted in the first place we
 percent of sexual assaults just by stopping repeat perpetrators earlier on 
 and because we 're creating a real deterrent to assault for perhaps the first time 
 maybe the mikes of the world would never even try to assault anyone 
 the type of system i 'm describing
  the type of system that survivors want is a type of information escrow  
 meaning an entity that holds on to information for you and only releases it to a third party when certain pre agreed upon conditions are met such as a match 
 the application that we built is for college campuses  but the same type of system could be used in the military or even the workplace 
 we don 't have to live in a world where
  rapists get away with it 
 we can create one where those who do wrong are held accountable 
 where survivors get the support and justice they deserve where the authorities get the information they need 
 and where there 's a real deterrent to violating the rights of another human being
