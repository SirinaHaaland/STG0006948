  also thinks you know working in caves and travelling through space it 's all very dangerous jobs it would be very dangerous if you fell down
  when einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public she loves to take in the arts if the children of the uganda need another dance partner einstein could sure fit the bill because she loves to dance can you get down
  or maybe sirena huang would like to learn some arias on her violin and einstein can sing along with some opera e [ operatic squawk ] sw very good laughter
