  come here today to talk to you about a problem it 's a very simple yet devastating problem one that spans the globe
 and is affecting all of us the problem is
 anonymous companies
  like a really dry and technical thing doesn 't it but anonymous companies are making it difficult and sometimes impossible to find out
 the actual human beings responsible sometimes for really terrible crimes  
 so why am i here
  i guess i am a lifelong troublemaker
 and when my parents taught my twin brother and i to question authority i don 't think they knew where it might lead 
 laughter and they probably really regretted it during my stroppy teenage years when predictably i questioned their authority a lot 
 and a lot of my school teachers didn 't appreciate it much
  you see since the age of about five i 've always asked the question  but why  
 but why does the earth go around the sun  but why is blood red  
 but why do i have to go to school but why do i have to respect the teachers and authority  
 and little did i realize that this question would become the basis of everything i would do 
 and so it was
 in my twenties a long time ago
  one rainy sunday afternoon in north london
 i was sitting with simon taylor and patrick alley
 and we were busy stuffing envelopes for a mail out in the office of the campaign group
 where we worked at the time  and as usual  we were talking about the world 's problems  and in particular we were talking about the civil war
 in cambodia  and we had talked about that
  many many times before but then suddenly we stopped and looked at each other
 and said  but why don 't we try and change this and from that slightly crazy question over two decades
 and many campaigns later including alerting the world to the problem of blood diamonds funding war from that crazy question global
  witness is now an 80 strong team
 of campaigners  investigators  journalists and lawyers  
 and we 're all driven by the same belief that change really is possible 
 so what exactly does global witness do 
 we investigate we report to uncover the people really responsible for funding conflict
 for stealing millions
  from citizens around the world  also known as state looting and for destroying the environment  
 and then we campaign hard to change the system itself  
 and we 're doing this because so many of the countries rich in natural resources like oil or diamonds or timber
 are home to some of the poorest and most dispossessed people on the planet
 and much of this injustice is made possible
 by currently accepted business practices  and one of these
 is anonymous companies  
 now we 've come up against anonymous companies in lots of our investigations 
 like in the democratic republic of congo where we exposed how secretive deals involving anonymous companies
 had deprived the
  citizens of one of the poorest countries on the planet
 of well over a billion dollars that 's twice the country 's health and education budget combined 
 or in liberia where an international predatory logging company
 used front companies as it attempted to grab a really huge chunk of liberia 's unique forests  or political corruption in sarawak
  malaysia  which has led to the destruction of much of its forests  well that uses anonymous companies too 
 we secretly filmed some of the family of the former chief minister and a lawyer as they told our undercover investigator exactly how these dubious deals are done using such
  and the awful thing is there are so many other examples out there from all walks of life 
 this truly is a scandal of epic proportions hidden in plain sight  
 whether it 's the ruthless mexican drugs cartel the zetas who use anonymous companies to launder profits
 while their
  tearing communities apart
 across the americas or the anonymous company  which bought up americans ' tax debts  piled on the legal fees
 and then gave homeowners a choice  pay up or lose your home imagine being threatened with losing your home
 sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars  and not being able to find out who you were really up against 
 now anonymous companies are great for sanctions busting too
 as the iranian government found out
 when through a series of front companies it owned a building in the very heart of manhattan on fifth avenue  
 despite american sanctions 
 and juicy couture home of of the velvet track suit  and other companies were the unwitting  unknowing tenants there 
 there are just so many examples the
 horesemeat scandal in europe the italian mafia  they 've used these companies for decades 
 the $ one hundred million american medicare fraud 
 the supply of weapons to wars around the world
 including those in eastern europe in the early ' 90s anonymous companies have even come to light in the recent revolution in the ukraine
 but for every case that we and others expose
 there are so many more that will remain hidden away because of the current system  and it 's just a simple truth
 that some of the people responsible for outrageous crimes for stealing from
  you and me and millions of others they are remaining faceless and they are escaping accountability
 and they 're doing this with ease  
 and they 're doing it using legal structures  and really that is unfair
  well you might well ask what exactly is an anonymous company  and can i really set one up and use it without anyone
  who i am 
 well the answer is yes you can but if you 're anything like me you 'll want to see some of that for yourself  so let me show you 
 well first you need to work out where you want to set it up 
 now at this point you might be imagining one of those lovely tropical island tax havens
 but here 's the thing  
 shockingly my own hometown london and indeed the u k is one of the best places in the world to set up an anonymous company
 and the other even better  i 'm afraid that 's america do you know in some states across america
 you need less identification to open up a company than you do to get a library card  
 like delaware  which is one of the easiest places in
  the world to set up an anonymous company 
 okay so let 's say it 's america  and let 's say it 's delaware  
 and now you can simply go online and find yourself a company service provider 
 these are the companies that can set your one up for you and remember  it 's all legal routine business practice  
 so here 's one but there are plenty of others to choose from and having made your choice you then pick what type of company you want
 and then fill in a
  contact name and address  but don 't worry  it doesn 't have to be your name  it can be your lawyer 's
 or your service provider 's and it 's not for the public record anyway  
 and then you add the owner of the company  now this is the key part  and again it doesn 't have to be you 
 because you can get creative because there is a whole universe out there of nominees to choose from
 and nominees are the people that you can legally pay to be your company 's owner 
 and if you don 't want to involve anyone else  it doesn 't even have to be an actual human being it could be another company  
 and then finally  give your company a name
 add a few more details and make your payment  and then the service provider will take a few hours or more to process it
 but there you are in ten minutes of online shopping you can create yourself
 an anonymous company  
 and not only is it easy really really easy and cheap it 's totally legal too  but the fun
 doesn 't have to end there maybe you want to be even more
  that 's no problem either  
 you can simply keep adding layers companies owned by companies 
 you can have hundreds of layers with hundreds of companies spread across lots of different countries 
 like a giant web  each layer adds anonymity  
 each layer makes it more difficult for law enforcement and others to find out who the real owner is 
 but whose interests is this all serving it might be in the
  interests of the company or a particular individual  but what about all of us the public 
 there hasn 't even been a global conversation yet about whether it 's okay to misuse companies in this way  
 and what does it all mean for us well
 an example that really haunts me is one i came
  and it 's that of a horrific fire in a nightclub in buenos aires about a decade ago  
 it was the night before new year 's eve  three thousand very happy revelers many of them teenagers were crammed into a space meant for one thousand
  and then tragedy struck a fire broke out plastic decorations were melting from the ceiling and toxic smoke filled the club  so people tried to escape
 only to find that some of the fire doors had been chained shut
  over two hundred people died  seven hundred were injured trying to get out 
 and as the victims ' families and the city and the country reeled in shock  investigators tried to find out who was responsible 
 and as they looked for the owners of the club  they
  and confusion surrounded the identities of those involved with the companies 
 now ultimately a range of people were charged and some went to jail  
 but this was an awful tragedy  
 and it shouldn 't have been so difficult just to try and find out who was responsible for those deaths 
 because in an age when there is so much information out there in the open why should this
  crucial information about company ownership stay hidden away 
 why should tax evaders  
 corrupt government officials  arms traders and more be able to hide their identities from us  the public 
 why should this secrecy be such an accepted business practice
  anonymous companies might be the norm right now
 but it wasn 't always this way  companies were created to give people a chance to innovate and not have to put everything on the line 
 companies were created to limit financial risk they were never intended to be used as a moral shield 
 companies were never intended to be anonymous and they don 't have
