  traditional prescriptions for growth in africa
 are not working very well  after one trillion dollars
 in african development related aid in the last sixty years  real per capita income today
 is lower than it was in
 aid is not doing too well in response the bretton woods institutions the imf and the world bank
 pushed for free trade not aid yet the historical record shows little empirical evidence
 that free trade leads to economic growth the newly prescribed silver bullet is microcredit
  to be fixated on this romanticized idea that every poor peasant in africa is an entrepreneur 
 yet
 my work and travel in 40 plus countries across africa have taught me that most people want jobs instead 
  let 's invest in building pan african titans like sudanese businessman mo ibrahim 
 mo took a contrarian bet on africa
 when he founded celtel international in ' ninety eight and built it into a mobile cellular provider
 with 
 million subscribers across fourteen african countries by two thousand and four the mo model might be
  better than the everyman entrepreneur model which prevents an effective means of diffusion and knowledge sharing 
 perhaps we are not at a stage in africa where many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition 
 consider these two alternative scenarios one you loan two hundred dollars
 to each of five hundred banana farmers
 allowing them to dry
  their surplus bananas and fetch fifteen percent more revenue at the local market  or two you give one hundred thousand dollars
 to one savvy entrepreneur and help her set up a factory that yields forty percent additional income to all five hundred banana farmers
  is leveraging economies of scale and using modern manufacturing processes to create value for not only its owners but its workers who have an
  ownership in the business our dream
 is to take an eric  muthomi and try to help him become
 a mo ibrahim  which requires skill  financing local and global partnerships and extraordinary perseverance 
 but why pan african 
 the scramble
  resulted in massive fragmentation and many sovereign states with small populations liberia four million cape verde five hundred thousand pan africa gives you one billion people 
 granted across fifty five countries with trade barriers and other impediments
 but
 our ancestors traded across the continent before europeans drew lines around us 
 the pan african opportunities outweigh the challenges  and that 's why we 're expanding stawi 's markets from just kenya to algeria nigeria  ghana and anywhere else that will buy our food 
 we hope to help solve food security  empower farmers
  develop the local economy  and we hope to become rich in the process  
 while it 's not the sexiest approach and maybe it doesn 't achieve the same feel good as giving a woman one hundred dollars to buy a goat on kiva org 
 perhaps supporting fewer higher impact entrepreneurs to build massive businesses that scale pan africa
 can help change this 
 the political freedom
 for which our forebearers fought is meaningless
 without economic freedom we hope to aid this fight for economic freedom
 by building world class businesses  creating indigenous wealth  providing jobs that we so desperately need and hopefully
 helping achieve this africa shall rise 
  of course this is strong rhetoric you 're making one hundred percent contrast between microcredit
 and regular investment and growing regular investment  do you think there is a role for microcredit at all sangu delle i think there is a role
  microcredit has been a great innovative way
 to expand financial access to the bottom of the pyramid  but for the problems we face in africa 
 when we are looking at the marshall plan to revitalize war torn europe it was not full of donations of sheep  
 we need more than just microcredit we need more than just give two hundred dollars we need to build big businesses  and we need jobs
