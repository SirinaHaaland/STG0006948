  began like all others you were both doing the work that you love  
 you were meeting with constituents which is something that you loved doing as a congresswoman and mark you were happily preparing for
 your next space shuttle and suddenly everything
 that you had planned or expected in your lives was irrevocably changed forever
  call from gabby 's chief of staff  she didn 't have much other information she just said gabby was shot a few minutes later i called her back and i
 actually thought for a second well maybe i just imagined getting this phone call i called her back and that 's when she told me that gabby had been shot in the head and
 from that point on i knew that our lives were going to be a lot different pm and when you arrived at the hospital
  what was the prognosis that they gave you about gabby 's condition and what recovery if any you could expect mk well for a gunshot wound to the head and a traumatic brain injury they typically can 't tell you much 
 every injury is different it 's not predictable like often a stroke might be predictable which is another tbi kind of injury so
 they didn 't know how long gabby would be in a coma didn 't know
 know when that would change and and what the prognosis would be pm gabby has your recovery
 been an effort to create a new gabby giffords or reclaim the old gabby
  when you look at the
 picture behind us 
 to come back from that kind of injury and come back strong and stronger than ever is a really tough thing to do i don 't know anybody that 's as tough as my wonderful wife right here pm 
 and what were
  first signs
 that recovery was not only going to be possible but you were going to have some semblance of the life that you and gabby had planned mk well the first thing for me was gabby was still kind of
 almost unconscious  but she did something when she was in the icu hospital bed
 that she used to do when we might be out to dinner at a
  pulled my ring off and she flipped it from one finger to the next  and at that point i knew
 that she was still in there  pm and there were certain words too didn 't she surprise you with words in
  communication she latched on to the word chicken which isn 't the best but certainly is not the worst laughter
 and we were actually worried it could have been a lot worse than that pm gabby  what 's been the toughest challenge for you during
  she wants to say she just can 't get it get it out she understands everything but the communication is just very difficult because when you look at the picture the part of your brain
 where those communication centers are are on the left side of your head  which is where the bullet passed through pm so you have to do a very dangerous thing speak
  optimistic about your continuing recovery walking  talking being able to move your arm and leg gg 
 i 'm optimistic it will be a long hard haul  but i 'm optimistic pm 
 that seems to be the number one characteristic of gabby
  she works incredibly hard every day gg on the treadmill  walked on my treadmill spanish lessons  french horn mk it 's only my wife who could be
 and if you knew her before she was injured you would kind of understand this somebody who could be injured and have such a hard time communicating and meets with a speech therapist  and then about a month ago she says i want to learn spanish
 again pm well let 's take a little closer look at
 the wife and this was even before you met gabby giffords  and she 's on a motor scooter there but it 's my understanding that 's a very tame image
 of what gabby giffords was like growing up mk yeah gabby  she used to race motorcycles
  challenge with not being able to move her right arm  but i think with something i know about velcro  
 we might be able to get her back on the bike  velcro her right hand up
 onto the handlebar pm i have a feeling we might see that picture next
  dedicate your life to service you 're going into the military and eventually to become an astronaut  so
 you meet  what attracts you to gabby mk well when we met
  oddly enough  it was the last time we were in vancouver about ten years ago we met in
 vancouver 
  on a trip that we were both taking to china that i would actually from my background i would call it a boondoggle
 gabby would  gg fact finding mission mk she would call it an important fact finding mission  
 she was a state senator at the time  and we met here at the airport before a trip to china pm would you describe it as a whirlwind
  and then she invited me on about a year or so later  she invited me on a date where 'd we go gabby
  at the florence state prison in arizona  which was 
  just outside gabby 's state senate district 
  were working on some legislation that had to do with
 crime and punishment and capital punishment in the state of arizona so she couldn 't get anybody else to go with her and i 'm like of course i want to
  that might have contributed to the reason that gabby decided to marry you you were willing to go to death row after all
  special relationship we 've gone through some tough times and it 's only made it stronger gg stronger pm 
 after you got married however you continued very independent lives actually you didn 't even live together mk 
 we had one of those commuter marriages in our case it was washington d c houston 
  sometimes we 'd go clockwise sometimes counterclockwise to all those different places  and
 we didn 't really live together
 until that saturday morning  within an hour of gabby gabby being shot i was on an airplane to tucson and that was the moment
 where that had changed things pm and also gabby you had run for congress after being a state senator
  legislation is often at a
 colossally slow pace  but my wife and i have to admit a lot of other members of congress that i know work incredibly hard i mean gabby would run around like a crazy
 never take a day off maybe a half a day off a month  and whenever she was awake she was working 
 and she really really thrived on that and still does today gg yes yes 
 pm installing solar panels on the top of her house i have to say 
 so after the tragic incident mark you decided to resign your position as an astronaut even though you were supposed to take the next
  space mission everybody including gabby  talked you into going back and you did end up taking mk kind of 
 the day after gabby was injured  
 i called my boss the chief astronaut dr peggy whitson and i said peggy i know i 'm launching in space in three months from now gabby 's in a coma  i 'm in tucson you 've got to find a replacement for me 
 so i didn 't actually resign from being an astronaut but i gave up my job and they found a
  replacement 
 months later  maybe about two months later i started about getting my job back which is something when you become this primary caregiver person  
 which some people in the audience here have certainly been in that position it 's a challenging role but at some point you 've got to figure out when you 're going to get your life back 
 and at the time i couldn 't ask gabby if she wanted me to
 go fly in the space shuttle again
  but i knew she was gg yes yes yes mk she was the biggest supporter of my career  and i knew it was the right thing to do pm and yet
 i 'm trying to imagine mark what that was like going off onto a mission one presumes safely but it 's never a guarantee
 and knowing that gabby is mk 
 well not only
  still in the hospital on the third day of that flight  
 literally while i was rendezvousing with the space station  and you 've got two vehicles moving at seventeen thousand five hundred miles an hour i 'm actually flying it looking out the window a
 bunch of computers  gabby was in brain surgery  
 literally at that time having the final surgery to 
 the piece of skull that they took out on the day she was injured with a prosthetic yeah which is the whole side of her head
  if any of you guys would ever come to our house in tucson for the first time gabby would usually go up to the freezer and pull out the piece of tupperware that has the real skull
  did gabby after mark 's flight you had to make another step of of courage too because here was congress deadlocked again  
 and
 you got out of the rehabilitation center got yourself to washington
 so that you could walk on the floor of the house i can barely talk about this without getting emotional and cast a vote
  which could have been the deciding vote gg the debt ceiling  the debt ceiling mk yeah 
 we had that vote i
 guess about five months after gabby was injured and she made this bold decision to go back a
 very controversial vote  
 but she wanted to be there to have her voice heard one more time pm and after that resigned and began what has been a very slow and
 challenging recovery  what 's life like day to day
  did a great job with this dog he 's a fabulous service dog pm so gabby what have you learned from your experiences the past few years
  this is a picture of family and friends gathering but i love these pictures because they show the gabby and mark relationship now 
 and you describe it gabby over and over
 as deeper on so
  tragic happens in a family it can pull people together here 's us watching the space shuttle fly over
 over tucson the space shuttle endeavour the one that i was the commander on its last flight 
 on its final flight on top of an airplane on a seven hundred and forty seven on its way to l a 
 nasa was kind enough to have it fly over tucson
  through these challenges of a slow and difficult recovery  and yet gabby how do you maintain your optimism and positive outlook gg 
 i want to make the world a better place pm 
 and you 're doing that even though your recovery has to remain front
  and center for both of you you are people who have done service to your country and you are continuing
 to do that with a new initiative a new purpose 
 and gabby what 's on the agenda now gg americans for responsible solutions mk that 's our
 political action
  where we are trying to get members of congress
 to take a more serious look at gun violence in this country 
 and to try to pass some reasonable legislation gg yes yes mk you know 
 this affected
 us very personally but it wasn 't what happened to gabby that got us involved it was really
 the twenty murdered first graders and kindergartners
  newtown connecticut and the response that we saw afterwards where
 well  look what 's happened so far so far the national response has been pretty much to do nothing we 're trying to change that pm there
 have been eleven mass shootings since newtown a school a week in the first two months of last year  what are you doing that 's different than other efforts to balance rights for gun ownership and responsibilities
 gun owners we support gun rights at the same time we 've got to do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of
 criminals and the dangerously mentally ill it 's not too difficult to do that 
 this issue like many others has become very polarizing and political  and we 're trying to bring some balance to the debate
  thank you both for that effort and not surprisingly for this woman of courage and of a sense of adventure  you just keep challenging yourself and the sky 
  seems to be the limit i have to share this video of your most recent adventure take a look at gabby
 who was injured in combat had a really rough time gabby visited him
 when he was at bethesda and went through a really tough period 
 he started doing better months later gabby was shot in the head and then he supported her while she was in the hospital in houston so they have a very very nice connection
 to think of the ideas that you wanted to leave with this audience gg thank you  
 hello everyone 
 thank you for inviting us here today  it 's been a long hard
  but i 'm getting better  
 i 'm working hard lots of therapy speech therapy physical therapy and yoga too  
 but my spirit is strong as ever i 'm still fighting to make the world a better place  and you can too 
 get involved with your community
  set an example be passionate be courageous be your best
