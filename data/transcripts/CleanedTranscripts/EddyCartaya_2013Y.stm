  so how many of you have ever been in a cave before  
 okay a few of you when you think of a cave most of you think of a tunnel going through solid rock and in fact that 's how most caves are around this half of the country most of your caves are made
  of limestone back where i 'm from most of our caves are made of lava rock  because we have a lot of volcanoes out there  but the caves i want to share with you today are made completely of ice specifically glacier 
  ice  that 's formed in the side of the tallest mountain in the state of oregon called mount hood  
  exciting thing for a cave explorer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave now these days with so many people hiking around it 's pretty hard to find a new cave so you can imagine how excited we were to find three 
  new caves within sight of oregon 's largest city and realize that they had never been explored or mapped before 
  that no one had ever seen or gone to before  
 so what is a glacier  
 well those of you who have ever seen or touched snow you know that it 's really light because it 's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together and it 's mostly air 
 if you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball it gets really small hard and dense well on a mountain like hood where it snows over twenty feet a year  it crushes the air out of it and gradually forms it into hard blue ice
  now each year more and more ice stacks up on top of it and eventually it gets so heavy that it starts to slide down the mountain under its own weight  forming a slow moving river of ice  
  when ice packed like that starts to move  we call it a glacier and we give it a name the name of the glacier these caves are formed in is the sandy glacier  
  forming big networks of caves sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock now the crazy thing about glacier caves
 is that each year  new tunnels form different waterfalls pop up or move around from place to place inside the cave  warm water from the top of the ice is boring its way down 
 and warm air from below the mountain actually rises up gets into the cave and melts the ceilings back taller and taller
  weirdest thing about glacier caves is that the entire cave is moving because it 's formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that 's slowly sliding down the mountain now
 this is brent mcgregor  my cave exploration partner  
 he and i have both been exploring caves a long time and we 've been climbing mountains a long time but neither one of us had ever really explored a glacier cave before 
 back in two thousand and eleven brent saw a youtube video of a couple
  hikers that stumbled across the entrance to one of these caves  
 there were no gps coordinates for it and all we knew was that it was somewhere out on the sandy glacier  
 so in july of that year  we went out on the glacier and we found a big crack in the ice  we had to build snow and ice anchors so that we could tie off ropes and rappel down into the hole this is me looking into the entrance
  at the end of this hole we found a huge tunnel going right up the mountain underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice  
 we followed this cave back for about a half mile until it came to an end 
 and then with the help of our survey tools we made a three dimensional map of the cave on our way back out 
 so how do you map a cave well cave maps aren 't like trail maps or road maps because they have pits and holes going to overlapping levels 
 to make a cave map you have to set up survey stations every few feet inside the cave
  you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations then
 you use a compass and and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings  
 now those of you taking trigonometry that particular type of math is very useful for making maps like this because it allows you to measure heights and distances without actually having to go there in
  the more i mapped and studied caves the more useful i found all that math that i originally hated in school to be 
 so when you 're done surveying 
 you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well 
 and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this and
 it 'll show you both a bird 's eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage kind of like an ant farm view  
 we named this cave snow dragon cave because it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow 
 now later this summer as
  more snow melted off the glacier we found more caves and we realized they were all connected 
 not long after we mapped snow dragon brent discovered this new cave not very far away  the inside of it was coated with ice  so we had to wear big spikes on our feet called crampons so we could walk around without slipping  
 this cave was amazing the ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green because the sunlight from far above was shining through the ice
  and lighting it all up 
 and we couldn 't understand why this cave was so much colder than snow dragon until we got to the end and we found out why there was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin going one hundred 
  and thirty feet straight up to the surface of the glacier  cold air from the top of the mountain was flowing down this hole and blasting through the cave  freezing everything inside of it 
  following year so we could be the first ones to explore it 
 it was so cold outside we actually had to sleep inside the cave  there 's our camp on the left side of this entrance room 
 the next morning  we climbed out of the cave and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier  where we finally rigged and rappelled this pit for the very first time  
 brent named this cave pure imagination i think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever
  imagined 
 so besides really cool ice what else is inside these caves  
 well not too much lives in them because they 're so cold and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year  but there are some really cool things in there there 's weird bacteria living 
  in the water that actually eat and digest rocks to make their own food to live under this ice
  in fact this past summer scientists collected samples of water and ice specifically to see if things called extremophiles tiny lifeforms that are evolved to live in completely hostile conditions 
 might be living under the ice  kind of like what they hope to find on the polar icecaps of mars someday  
  make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling and fall onto the cave floor where we end up finding them 
 for example this is a noble fir seed we found it 's been frozen in the ice for over one hundred years and it 's just now starting to sprout
  this mallard duck feather was found over one thousand eight hundred feet in the back of snow dragon cave this duck died on the surface of the glacier
  long ago and its feathers have finally made it down through over one hundred feet of ice before falling inside the cave 
 and this beautiful quartz crystal was also found in the back of snow dragon  
 even now brent and i find it hard to believe that all these discoveries were essentially in our own backyard  hidden away just waiting to be found 
 like i said earlier the idea of discovering in this busy world we live in kind of seems like something you can only do with space travel now but that 's not true every year  new caves get discovered that no one has ever been
  in before so it 's actually not too late for one of you to become a discoverer yourself you just have to be willing to look and go where people don 't often go
 and focus your eyes and your mind to recognize the discovery when you see it because it might be in your own backyard  thank you very much
