  i have a confession 
 i have been in an affair since i was seventeen years old  i wish i could talk about butterflies
  in my stomach
 or maps i drew on the ground when i think about this affair  but i cannot  
 i wish i could talk about sweet words spoken or gifts that i received from this affair  
 but i cannot  
 all i can tell you about is the aftermath about days i spent constantly
  i remember how it all began i was in my final year of high school and my class had just won in sports so
 we were singing and dancing and hugging each other  i went and took a shower  then i went for dinner  
 and when i sat down to eat my teeth started chattering
  so i couldn 't put the spoon in my mouth
 i rushed to the nurse 's office and because i couldn 't talk i just pointed at my mouth 
 she didn 't know what was happening so she told me to lie down  
 and it worked after a few minutes the chattering stopped  i was about to dash out and she told
  she insisted that i go up to the dormitories to sleep 
 here i was in my final year of high school 
 just a few months from doing my end of high school exams and a few days from doing a set of exams we call here in kenya mocks which are 
  somehow meant to gauge how prepared one is for the final exams there
  class sat down took my kenyan history notes and there i was down kenyan coastal town with the great
  was marking imaginary papers
 in and out it went 
 and with every stroke one by one my classmates stopped concentrating on their reading
 and started looking at me  
 and i tried really hard to stop it but i couldn 't because it had a life of its own  
 and then when it was
  sure everybody was looking at us 
 in its final show and official introduction i had my first full blown seizure  which was the beginning of what has been
 affair 
 seizures are the trademark characteristic for most types of epilepsy and every
 every first ever seizure needs to be assessed by a doctor to determine if one has epilepsy or if it 's a symptom of something else 
 in my case 
 it was confirmed that i had epilepsy 
 i spent a large chunk of my time
 in hospital and at home  and only went back to do my final exams i had seizures in between
  papers  but managed to get good enough grades to be admitted for an actuarial science degree at the university of nairobi 
 unfortunately  i had to drop out in my second year  
 i didn 't have good enough coping skills and a support community around me  
 i was lucky
  enough to get a job  but i was fired from that job when i had a seizure in the workplace so
 i found myself in a space where
 i was constantly asking myself why this had to happen to me  i lived in denial
  denial was maybe because of the things that had happened  dropping out of school and being fired from my job 
 or maybe it was because of the things i had heard about epilepsy and about people living with epilepsy 
 that they would never live on their own that they would never travel on their own or or even get work
  that they were outcasts with a spirit in them that they needed to be delivered from  
 and so the more i thought about these things 
 the more my seizures became became  
 and i spent days with my legs locked my speech became blurred
 and on days on end this is
  how i 'd be two or three days after a seizure my head and my hand would still be twitching  
 i felt lost
  i had so much frustration in me  and so i started writing because the people around me didn 't have
 answers to the questions that i had and so i wrote my fears
 and my doubts  i wrote about my good days and my bad days and my really ugly days
  and i shared them on a blog  
 and before long 
 i began to be seen and heard by people who had epilepsy and their families  and even those who did not have the diagnosis  
 and i moved from that girl who constantly asked why me
 to one who not only 
 but does it for those who are yet to find their voices
  my seizures are greatly reduced from two to three times a day to sometimes two to three times in one year  
  on to employ five people when i began what was kenya 's first free mental health and epilepsy support line  
 and i travel 
 and i travel to speak about my affair  
 all these things that i had been told people like me living with epilepsy could never be able to do 
 every year a population
  population as big as eighty percent of nairobi gets diagnosed with epilepsy
 across the globe  and they like me  go through the emotions of
 stigma and exclusion  and so i have made it my life journey
 to keep these
  and i keep confessing about my affair so that those people who do not have the diagnosis
 might know
 and might have a constant reminder
 that it is alright to engage with people like us that as long as they pull down the walls of stigma and exclusion  
 that we just like them can be able to take anything life throws at us  thank you
