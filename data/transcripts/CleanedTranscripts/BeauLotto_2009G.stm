  i want to start with a game  okay  and to win this game 
 all you have to do is see the reality that 's in front of you as it really is all right  so we have two panels here of colored dots 
 and
 one of those dots is the same
  in the two panels   and you have to tell me which one  now i narrowed it down to
 the gray one the green one and say the orange one  so by a show of hands we 'll start with the easiest one  show of hands how many people think it 's the gray one  
 really okay  how many people think it 's the green one  
  many people think it 's the orange one
 pretty even split  let 's find out what the reality is here is the orange one 
 laughter here is the green one  and here is the gray
  so this is pretty amazing isn 't it because nearly every living system has evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another so for us seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does and yet even at this most fundamental
  what i 'm going to talk about is not that context is everything  but why context is everything because it 's
 answering that question that tells us not only why we see what we do  
 but who we are as individuals and who we are as a society  
 but first we have to ask another question which is what is color for and instead of telling you i 'll just show you 
  what you see here is a jungle scene  and you see the surfaces according to the amount of light that those surfaces reflect 
 now can any of you see the predator that 's about to jump out at you 
 and if you haven 't seen it yet you 're dead right 
 can anyone see it anyone no now let 's see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they reflect  and now you see it  
  color enables us to see the similarities and differences between surfaces according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect  but what you 've just done is in many respects mathematically impossible 
 why because as berkeley tells us we have no direct access to our physical world other than through our senses  
 and the light that falls onto our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world not only the color
  of objects but also the color of their illumination  and the color of the space between us and those objects you vary any one of those parameters  and you 'll change the color of the light that falls onto your eye 
 this is a huge problem because it means that the same image could have an infinite number of possible real world sources
 let me show you what i mean  imagine that this is the back of your eye  okay 
  and these are two projections from the world 
 they 're identical in every single way identical in shape 
 size  spectral content they are the same as far as your eye is concerned  
 and yet they come from completely different sources  
 the one on the right comes from a yellow surface in shadow  oriented facing the left
  viewed through a pinkish medium  
 the one on the left comes from an orange surface under direct light facing to the right  viewed through sort of a bluish medium completely different meanings 
 giving rise to the exact same retinal information  and yet it 's only the retinal information that we get 
 so how on earth do we even see  
 so if you remember anything in this next eighteen minutes remember this that the light that falls onto your eye
  information is meaningless  because it could mean literally anything 
 and what 's true for sensory information is true for information generally there 's no inherent meaning in information it 's what we do with that information that matters
 so how do we see well we see by learning to see
 the brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns finding relationships in information and associating those
  relationships with a behavioral meaning 
 a significance by interacting with the world we
 're very aware of this in the form of more cognitive attributes like language  i 'm going to give you some letter strings and i want you to read them out for me if you can
  priori reason why an h has to go between that w and a but you put one there why  because in the statistics of your past experience it would have been useful to do so so you do so again  
 and yet you don 't put a letter after that first t why  because it wouldn 't have been useful in the past  so you don 't do it again  
 so let me show you how quickly our
 brains can redefine normality even at the simplest thing the brain does which is color so if i could have the lights down up here 
 i want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same one is simply the flipping of the other   
 now i want you to look at that dot between the green and the red   
 and i want you to stare at that dot don 't look anywhere else we 're going to look at it for about thirty seconds which is a bit of a killer in an
  you to learn and i 'll tell you don 't look anywhere else 
 i 'll tell you what 's happening in your head your brain is learning and it 's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination the left side of its visual field is under green illumination that 's what it 's learning 
 okay now  when i tell you i want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes
  have the lights up again  i take it from your response they don 't look the same anymore right 
 why because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light and the left one is still under green light that 's your new normal 
 okay so what does this mean for context it means i can
  put them in light and dark surrounds and the one on the dark surround looks lighter than on the light surround  
 what 's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter it 's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past 
 so i 'll show you what i mean here we have that exact same illusion  
 we have two identical tiles on the left one in a dark surround one in a light surround  and the same thing over on the right
 now i 'll reveal those two scenes  but i 'm not going to change anything within those boxes except
  their meaning  and see what happens to your perception 
 notice that on the left the two tiles look nearly completely opposite one very white and one very dark 
 right  whereas on the right  the two tiles look nearly the same  
 and yet there is still one on a dark surround  and one on a light surround  why  because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow  and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye
  eye as the one outside the shadow it would have to be more reflective  so you see it that way  
 whereas on the right  the information is consistent with those two tiles being under the same light 
 if they 're under the same light reflecting the same amount of light to your eye  then they must be equally reflective so you see it that way  
 which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions this is one i made a few years
  ago and you 'll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top and a bright orange tile at the side 
 that is your perceptual reality the physical reality is that those two tiles are the same  
 here you see four gray tiles on your left seven gray tiles on the right i
 'm not going to change those tiles at all but i 'm going to reveal the rest of the scene  and see what happens to your perception
 the four blue tiles on the left are gray  the seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray 
 they are the same  okay  don 't believe me  let 's watch it again  
 what 's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion so here we
  turn this around a diamond  and what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to hold it here  and i 'm going to spin it 
 and for all of you you 'll see it probably spinning this direction  now i want you to keep looking at it 
 move your eyes around blink maybe close one eye  and suddenly it will flip and start spinning the opposite direction  yes raise your hand if
  keep blinking every time you blink it will switch  so i can ask you which direction is it rotating 
 how do you know 
 your brain doesn 't know because both are equally likely so depending on where it looks it flips between the two possibilities 
 are we the only ones that see illusions the answer to this question is no  even the beautiful
  with its mere one million brain cells which is two hundred and fifty times fewer cells than you have in one retina 
 sees illusions 
 does the most complicated things that even our most sophisticated computers can 't do so in my lab we work on bumblebees because we can completely control their experience and see how it alters the architecture of their brain we do this in what we call the bee matrix 
 here you have the hive you can see the queen bee the large bee in the middle those are her
  they go back and forth between this hive and the arena via this tube 
 you 'll see one of the bees come out here you see how she has a little number on her
 there 's another one coming out she also has a number on her 
 now they 're not born that way right  we pull them out put them in the fridge and they fall asleep then you can superglue little numbers on them 
  and now in this experiment they get a reward if they go to the blue flowers
 they land on the flower stick their tongue in there called a proboscis and drink sugar water she 's drinking a glass of water that 's about that big to you and i will do that about three times  then fly
 and sometimes they learn not to go to the blue but to go where the other bees go so they copy each other they can count to
  they can recognize faces and here she comes down the ladder and she 'll come into the hive find an empty honey pot and throw up and that 's honey  
 now remember 
 she 's supposed to be going to the blue flowers but what are these bees doing in the upper right corner it looks like they 're going to green flowers  
 now  are they getting it wrong  and the answer to the question is no those are actually blue
  but those are blue flowers under green light  so they 're using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle  which is exactly what we do 
 so  illusions are often used especially in art in the words of a more contemporary artist to demonstrate the fragility of our senses 
 okay this is complete rubbish
  the senses aren 't fragile and if they were we wouldn 't be here
  color tells us
 something completely different that the brain didn 't actually evolve to see the world the way it is 
 we can 't instead the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past  
 and how we see is by continually redefining normality  
 so how can we take this
 incredible capacity of of plasticity of the brain and get people to experience their world differently well one of the ways we do
  lab and studio is we translate the light into sound and we enable people to hear their visual world
  and they can navigate the world using their ears 
 here 's david on the right and he 's holding a camera on the left is what his camera sees and you 'll see there 's a faint line going across that
  each square we calculate the average color and then we just simply translate that into sound  and now he 's going to
 turn around close his eyes and find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed
  investigate how people literally make sense of the world  but we can also do something else  we can also make music with color  
 so working with kids they created images  thinking about
  what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them  and then we translated these images  and this is one of those images  and this is a six year old child composing a
  all this mean  
 what this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature  okay  we 're not defined by our central properties by the bits that make us up we
 're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment by our ecology 
 and that ecology is necessarily relative  historical and empirical
  so what i 'd like to finish with
 is this over here because what i 've been trying to do is really
  celebrate uncertainty because i think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding  
 so if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain i 'd like to do this one  so if we have the lights down 
 and
 what we have
 here
 can everyone see
  call it yellowish surfaces on your right  so now what i want to do i 'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here
 under yellow illumination by simply putting a filter behind them
  now you can see that changes the light that 's coming through there right because now the light is going through a
 yellowish filter and then a purplish filter i 'm going to do the opposite on the left
  here  i 'm going to put the middle nine
 under a purplish light  now  some of you will have noticed
 that the consequence is that the light coming through those middle nine on the right  or your left is exactly the same as the light coming through the middle nine on
  so they are physically the same let 's pull the covers off  
 now remember
 you know that the middle nine are exactly the same do they look the same  
 no the question is is that an illusion and i 'll leave you with that so thank you very much
