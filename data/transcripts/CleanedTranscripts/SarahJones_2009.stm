  i should tell you that when i was asked to be here  i thought to myself that well  it 's ted  and these tedsters are you know  
 as innocent as that name sounds these are the
 philanthropists
  scientists who sort of shape our world and what could i possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that and so i thought perhaps a really
 civilized sounding british accent might help things a bit and then i thought no no i should just get up there and be myself and and just talk the way i really talk because after all this
  and so i thought i 'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you  although many of you already know that i do speak the queen 's english because i am from queens new york 
 but the theme of this session of course is invention and while
 i don 't have any patents that i 'm aware of 
 you will be meeting a few of my inventions today 
  i suppose it 's fair to say that i am interested in the invention
 of self or selves
  we 're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits unique developmental experiences geographical and historical contexts  but then what 
 to what extent do we 
 how do we
  and how mutable is that identity like what if one could be anyone at any
  time  well my characters  like the ones in my shows  allow me to play with the spaces between those questions and so i 've brought a couple of them with me 
 and
 well  they 're very excited  what i should tell you
 what i should tell you is that they 've each prepared their own little ted
  good evening everybody thank you so very much for having me here today ah thank you very much my name is lorraine levine
  i am here because of a young girl sarah jones she 's a very nice young black girl
  well you know she calls herself black she 's really more like a caramel color if you look at her  but anyway 
 she has me here because she she puts me in her show what she calls her one woman
  and you know what that means of course  that means
 she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work  
 but i don 't mind  frankly i 'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this you know  
 really  it 's amazing not only of course the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities 
 there are so
  many celebrities running around here i saw
 glenn close i saw earlier i love her  and she was getting a yogurt in the google cafe isn 't that adorable 
 so many others you see they 're just wonderful it 's lovely to know they 're concerned you know  and oh i saw
 goldie hawn oh goldie hawn i love her too she 's wonderful yeah you know  she 's only half jewish did you know that about
  but even so a wonderful talent and i you know when i saw her such a wonderful feeling  yeah she 's lovely  
 but anyway i should have started by saying just how lucky i feel it 's such an eye opening experience to be here 
 you 're all so responsible for this world that we live in today you know i couldn 't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl
 made these advancements happen in such a short time you 're all so young you know your parents must be very proud  but
 i i also appreciate the diversity that you have here i noticed it 's very multicultural you know 
 when you 're standing up here you can see all the different people it 's like a rainbow
  it 's okay to say rainbow  
 yeah  i just i can 't keep up with whether you can say you know  the different things what are you allowed to say or not say i just i don 't want to offend anybody you
 but anyway  you know i just think that
 to be here with all of you accomplished young people
 literally some of you the architects building our
  's heartening to me  even though quite frankly some of your presentations are horrifying  absolutely horrifying
 it 's true  it 's true  you know between the environmental degradation and the
 the crashing of the world markets you 're talking about and of course we know it 's all because of the all the well i don 't know how else to
  just say it my way the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the you know the bankers and the wall street you know it anyway 
 the point is i 'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess so i salute each of you and your stellar achievements 
 thank you for all that you do and congratulations on
 being such big makhers that you 've become ted meisters
 continued success congratulations mazel tov hi 
 thank you everybody sorry
 this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything to be here right now my name is noraida  and i 'm just i 'm so thrilled to be part of like your ted conference that you 're doing and everything like that
 dominican american actually you could say i grew up in the capital of dominican republic otherwise known as washington heights in new york city  but i don 't know if there 's any other dominican people here but i know that
 juan enriquez he was here yesterday and i think he 's mexican so that 's honestly that 's close enough for me right now so 
 i just i 'm sorry i 'm just trying not to be nervous because this is a very wonderful experience for me and everything and i just
  used to doing the public speaking and
 whenever i get nervous i start to talk really fast nobody can understand nothing i 'm saying which is very frustrating for me as you can imagine  i usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath but then on top of that you know sarah jones told me we only have eighteen minutes so then i 'm like should i be nervous you know because maybe it 's better and i 'm just trying not to panic and freak out so i like  
 take a deep breath 
 okay sorry so
 anyway  what i was trying to say is that i really love ted like i love everything about this
  over this right now and like people would not believe seriously where i 'm from that this even exists  you know like even i mean i love like the name the ted  i mean i know it 's a real person and everything but i 'm just saying that like  
 you know  i think it 's very cool how it 's also an acronym you know which is like you know is like very high concept and everything like that i like that  and
 actually i can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything because actually i 'm a sophomore at college right
  now  at my school actually i was part of co founding an organization which is like a leadership thing you know like you guys you would really like it and everything  and
 the organization is called da bomb a \ and
 da bomb not like what you guys can build and everything it 's like da bomb it means like dominican it 's an acronym
  benevolent organization for mothers and babies
  know see like the name is like a little bit long but with the war on terror and everything the dean of student activities has asked us to stop saying da bomb and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea whatever  so  basically like
 da bomb what dominican american benevolent organization for mothers and babies does
 is  basically we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise
  and who also happen to be mothers like me
  i am a working mother and i also go to school full time and 
 you know it 's like it 's so important to have like role models out there i mean i know sometimes our lifestyles are very different whatever  but like even at my job like i just got promoted 
 right now it 's very exciting actually for me because i 'm the junior assistant to the associate director under the senior vice president for business development that 's my new title
  but i think whether you own your own company or you 're just starting out like me like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning  and if everybody like all people 
  really had access to that it would be a very different world out there as i know you know so i think all people we need that but especially i look at people like me  
  two weeks so we deserve just as much
 to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else so i 'm very happy that you 're you know  doing this kind of thing making the talks available online that 's very good i love that  and i just 
  i love you guys i love ted and if you don 't mind  privately now in the future i 'm going to think of ted as an acronym for
  that was noraida and just like lorraine and everybody else you 're meeting today  these are folks who are based on real people from my real life
  friends  neighbors family members i come from a multicultural
 family in
  the older lady you just met very very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother 's side it 's a long story believe me  but
 on top of my family background my parents also sent me to the united nations school where i encountered
 a plethora of new characters including alexandre my french teacher  okay well you know
 it was beginner
  it was like  you know she was there in the class you know she was kind of typically french you know she was very chic but she was very filled with ennui  you know and
 she would be there you know kind of talking with the class  you know  talking about the  you know the existential
  i took german for three years [ german ] and
 it was quite the experience because i was the only black girl in the class  even in the un school
  although you know it was wonderful the teacher herr schtopf he never discriminated never he always always treated each of us you know equally
  unbearably
 during the class  so there were the teachers and then there were my friends classmates from everywhere 
 many of whom are still dear friends to this day  and they 've inspired many characters as well
  for example a friend of mine 
 well i just wanted to quickly say good evening my name is praveen manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity of course
 ted the reputation precedes itself all over the world but you know i am originally from india and i wanted to start by telling you
 that once sarah jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to ted in california
 originally i was very pleased and frankly  relieved because you know i am a human rights advocate  and usually my work it takes me to washington
 d c and there i must attend these meetings mingling with some tiresome politicians trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in georgetown 
 so you can just imagine
 right so but i 'm thrilled to to be joining all of you here i wish we had more time together but that 's for another time okay
  i don 't think we 'll have time for you to meet everybody i brought but
 i
 i 'm trying to behave myself it 's my first time here  but i do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize if
  my name is pauline ning and
 first i i want to tell you  that i 'm of course i am a member of the chinese community in new york  but
 when sarah jones asked me to please come to ted
  you know first i don 't know
 that you know before two years ago  you would not find me in front of an audience of people much less like this
 because i did not like to give speeches because i feel that as an immigrant  i do not have
 good english skills for speaking  but then i decided just like
  my daughter my daughter wrote that she told me always start your speech with humor but my background
 i want to tell you story only briefly  my husband and i we brought our son and daughter here 
 to have the freedom we cannot have
  in china at that time
 and we tried to teach our kids
 to be proud of their tradition but it 's very hard you know
 as immigrant i would speak chinese to them  and they would always answer me back in english 
 they love rock music  pop culture american culture
  but when they got older when the time comes for them to start think about getting married 
 that 's when we expect them to realize a little bit more their own culture
  but that 's where we had some problems 
 my son he says he is not ready to get married  and he has a sweetheart  but she is american woman not chinese it
 's not that it 's bad but i told him what 's wrong with a chinese woman 
 but i think he will change his mind soon so then i decide instead  i will
  concentrate on my daughter the daughter 's marriage is very special to the mom
 but first  she said she 's not interested she only wants to spend time with her friends  and then
 at college it 's like she never came home  and she doesn 't want me to come and visit  so i said what 's wrong in this picture
  daughter to have like a secret boyfriend  but she told me mom  you don 't have to worry about boys because i don 't like them 
 and i said 
 yes  men can be difficult but all women have to get used to that 
 she said no mom  i mean i don 't like boys i like girls i am lesbian
 i always teach my kids to respect american ideas  but i told my daughter that this is one exception 
 that she is not gay she is just confused
 by this american problem  but she
  it 's not american she said she is in love
 in love with a nice chinese girl 
 laughter so  these are the words i am waiting to hear but from my son not my daughter 
 laughter but at first i did not know what to do  but then over time i have come to understand that this
 this is who she is so even though
  though sometimes it 's still hard  i will share with you that it helps me to realize
 society is more tolerant 
 usually because of places like this because of ideas like this and people like you with an open mind
 so i think maybe
  my name is habbi belahal and i would like to first of all thank sarah jones for putting all of the pressure on the only arab
 who she brought with her to be last today
  i am originally from jordan  and i teach comparative literature at queens college  it is not harvard
  but
 i feel a bit like a fish out of water but
 i am very proud of my students and
 i see that a few of them did make it here to the conference so you will get the extra credit i promised you 
 but while i know that i may not look like the typical
  ted izen as you would say i do like to make the point that
 we in global society we are never as different as the appearances may suggest
  so if you will indulge me  i will share quickly with you a
 bit of verse  which i memorized as a young girl at sixteen years of age  so  back in the ancient times
  me hold your hand  i want to hold your hand  i want to hold your hand  and when i touch you i
  it 's such a feeling that my love i can 't hide  i can 't hide  i can 't hide well  so
 okay  but
 please  please
   but please  if it is sounding familiar 
 it is because i was at the same time in my life listening to the beatles 
 on the radio
  say that
 i like to believe that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another 
 there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme  
 and i pray that this is the way that we will
  you very much for the opportunity okay
  for having me here
