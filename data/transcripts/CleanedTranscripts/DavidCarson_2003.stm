  up till the pretty much last few days but was denied access to a slide projector 
  and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work unlike powerpoint and some other programs 
 now i agree that
 you have to
  there are certain concessions and you know 
 if you use a slide projector you 're not able to have the the bad type swing in from the back or the side or up or down
 but maybe that 's an o k trade off to trade that off for a focus it 's a thought just a
 thought and there 's something nice about slides getting stuck
  the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up  which we won 't see tonight  so  
 with that let 's get the first slide up here this as many of you have probably guessed is a
 recently emptied beer can in portugal 
 this i had just arrived in barcelona for the first time  and i thought you know  fly all night
  i looked up and
 i thought wow how clean you come into this major airport and they simply have a b 
 i mean how nice is that everything 's gotten simpler in design and here 's this
 mega airport and god i just i took a picture i thought god that is the coolest thing i 've ever seen at an airport  
  till a couple months later  i went back to the same airport same plane i think and
 looked up and it said c 
 it was only then that i realized it was simply a gate that i was coming into i 'm
 a big believer in the
  the message that 's sent before somebody begins to read before they get the rest of the information what is the emotional response they get to the product to the story to the painting whatever it is 
 that area of design interests me the most and i think this for me is a real clear 
 very simplified
 version
 of what i 'm talking about these are a couple of garage doors painted identical  situated next to each other so here 's the first door
  you get the message  you know it 's pretty clear  take a look at the second door
 and see if there 's any different message o k which one would you park in front of 
 same color same message same words the only thing that 's different is the expression that the individual door owner here put into the piece
  yet it doesn 't say that it doesn 't need to say that i would probably park in front of the other one 
 i 'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last
 five years or so it 's gotten so simple that it 's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive but i was in milan and saw this street sign and was very happy to
  see that apparently this idea of minimalism has even been translated by the graffiti artist laughter
 and this graffiti artist has come along made this sign a little bit better  and then moved on 
 he didn 't overpower it like they have a tendency to do
  i took some photos and this is
 a billboard in florida and either they hadn 't paid their rent or they didn 't want to pay their rent again on the sign and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down so they just teared out sections of it  
 and i would argue that it 's possibly more effective than the original billboard
 in terms of getting your attention getting you to look over that way and hopefully you don 't stop and buy those awful pecan things
 stuckey 's this is from my
 second book the first book is called the end of print and it was done
 along with a film  working with william burroughs and 
 the end of print is now in its fifth printing 
 when i first contacted william burroughs about being part of it he said no he said he didn 't believe it was the end of
  print  and i said well that 's fine i just would love to have your input on this film and and this book and he finally agreed to it and
 at the end of the film he  says in this great voice that i can 't mimic but i 'll kind of try but not really
  apparently when photography was perfected there were people
 going around saying that 's it you 've just ruined painting people are just going to take pictures now
  and of course  that wasn 't the case so this is from 2nd sight a book i did on intuition i think it 's
 not the only ingredient in design but possibly
  the most important it 's something everybody has it 's not a matter of teaching it in fact most of the schools tend to discount
 intuition as an ingredient of your working process
 because they can 't quantify it it 's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card
 or a newsletter so it tends to get discounted this is a quote
  the intellect has little to do on the road to discovery there comes a leap in consciousness call it intuition or what you will
 and the solution just comes to you and you don 't know from where or why 
 so it 's kind of like when somebody says who did that song and the more you try to think about it  the further the answer gets from you and the minute you stop thinking about it your intuition gives you that answer in a sense
  like this for a couple of reasons if you 've had any design courses they would teach you you can 't read this 
 i think you eventually can and more importantly i think it 's true don 't mistake legibility for communication just because something 's legible doesn 't means it communicates more importantly it doesn 't mean it communicates the right thing so what is the message sent before
  and i think that 's
 sometimes an overlooked area  this is working with marshall mcluhan i stayed and worked with his
 wife and son eric  and we we came up with
 close to six hundred quotes from marshall that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times predicting so much of what has happened in the
 advertising television media world  and so this book is called
  another word for quotes  and it 's a lot of them are never
 have never been published before and basically i 've interpreted
 the different quotes 
 so this was the contents page originally when i got done it was five hundred and forty pages  and then the the publisher gingko press  ended up
 cutting it down considerably it 's just under four hundred pages now but i decided i liked this contents page i liked the way it looks
  so i kept it 
 it now has no relevance to the book whatsoever but it 's a nice spread  i think in there 
 so a couple spreads from the book here mcluhan says the new media are not bridges between man and nature  they are nature
  invention of printing did away with anonymity  fostering ideas of literary fame and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property 
 which had never been done before printing 
 when new technologies impose themselves on societies long habituated to older technologies anxieties of all kinds result 
 while people are engaged in creating a totally different world they always
  form vivid images of the preceding world 
 i hate this stuff it 's hard to read
  except the globe and no possible occupation except information gathering 
 that was it that 's all he saw as the options and not too far off so  
 this is a project for nine inch nails and i only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden and it was done right after nine eleven  
 and i had recently discovered
 a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house i
  bought in la that the real estate person hadn 't pointed out there was
 some bomb shelter built apparently in the ' 60s cuban missile crisis and i asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by and he goes it 's something to do with the sewage system i was o k that 's
 i finally went down there and it was this old rusted
 circular thing and two beds and very kind of creepy and weird and
 also surprisingly it was done in kind of a cheap metal and it had completely rusted through and water everywhere and spiders and i thought you know 
 what were they thinking you 'd think maybe cement possibly or something but
 anyway i
 used this for a cover for the nine inch nails dvd  and i 've also now fixed
  trying to use print as a medium to get people to the web so this is a six shot sequence 
 i 've taken one shot i cropped it a few different ways  and then the tiny line of copy says if you want to see this
  entire sequence how this whole ride was go to the website and
 my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site to to get this entire picture  
 got no way of tracking it so i could be totally wrong 
 i don 't have the site it 's just the piece itself this is a group in new york called the coalition for a smoke free environment asked me to do these posters
  were wild posted around new york city you can 't really well you can 't see it at all but the second line is really the more kind of payoff in a sense it says 
 if the cigarette companies can lie then so can we
  grunge type or something it looked like they might be real anyway 
 poster for atlantic center for the arts a school in florida  this amazes me this is a product i just found out i was in the
  caribbean at christmas and i 'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell not that they will sell that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin  this was either an old product with new packaging 
  i just thought yikes how 's that still happening  
 i do a lot of workshops all over the world really and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors
  i felt this was one of the more successful
 just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom 
 i did some work for microsoft a few years back it was a worldwide branding campaign and it was interesting to me my background is in 
  sociology i had no design training and sometimes people say well that explains it
  of microsoft they were trying to improve  they thought some people didn 't like them 
 i found out that 's very true
  working on this campaign worldwide and our goal was to try to humanize them a bit and what i did was add
 type and
 people to the ad which the previous campaign had not had and nobody remembered them and nobody referenced them and we were trying to say that 
 hey some of these guys that work there are actually ok some of them actually have friends and family and they 're
 not all awful people  and the umbrella campaign was
 thank god it 's monday so we tried to take this what was perceived as a negative 
  know  long
 working hours and turn it into a positive and not run from it
 you know thank god it 's monday i get to go back to that little cubicle those fake gray walls  and
 hear everybody else 's conversations f or ten hours and then go home  but anyway this is one of the ads i was
 most pleased with 
 because they were all elaborately art directed and this one i thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer it says wonder around and then it 's a piece of the software  and this is how the ad ran around the world
 in germany they made one small change
  without checking with me nor did they have to because it was done through agencies but see if you can tell the difference this is how the ad ran throughout the world germany made one slight change in the ad now there
 's kind of two issues here if you 're going to put a kid in the ad pick one that looks
  just have a feeling this kid 's been there for a week you know he 's just really hoping that boots up and you know 
 and then
 as the agency explained to me they said look we don 't have little green people in our country why would we put little green people in our
  i understand their logic i totally disagree with it i think it 's a very small minded approach the world is certainly much more global and i certainly think the people of
 germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer though
 we 'll never know this is some work from ray gun  and the point of this magazine was to read the articles  listen to the music and try to interpret it there 's no grid there 's no system there 's nothing set up in
  this is an opener for brian eno  and it 's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music this is
 rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in in school there
 's a lot of great writing in ray gun 
 and i was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books 
 article on bryan ferry just really boring article so i set the whole article in dingbat
 you could you could highlight it  you could make it helvetica or something it is the actual article 
 i suppose you could eventually decode it but
 it 's really not very well written it really wouldn 't be worthwhile having done a lot of magazines
  very curious how big magazines handle
 big stories and i was very curious to see how time and newsweek would handle nine eleven and i was basically pretty disappointed to see that they had
 chosen to show the photo we 'd already seen a million times which was basically the moment of impact and people magazine i thought got probably the best shot it 's
 kind of horsey type but
 the texture the second plane not quite hitting there was something more enticing
  the right it 's not the right word but in this cover than time or newsweek but when i got into this magazine there 's something kind of disturbing  
 and this continued on the left we see people dying we see people running for their lives  and on the right we learn that there 's a new way to support your breast 
 the coveted right hand page was not given up to the whole issue look at the image of this lady who knows what she 's going through
  and the copy says he knows just how to give me goosebumps yeah he jumps out of buildings it 's
 unfortunately this one works kind of as a spread  and this continued through the entire magazine it did not let up  
 this says one clean fits all there were a lot of orphans made this day 
 and here 's a dead body being
  just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more
 appropriate  and this one i think is possibly the worst two ladies  both facing the same way both wearing jeans 
 one who knows what she 's going through the other one is worried about model behavior and milk  and
 i gave a talk in new york a couple months after this and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that they actually emailed me and they said
 that they appreciated the talk and when they got back to their car  
 they found a note on their car that made them think maybe new york was getting back to being new york again after this event it had been a few months this was what they found on their car
  very few times you 'd be happy to find this on your car but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back this is my
 desktop somebody told me today there was this thing called folders but i don 't know what
  my notes for the talk there might be a correlation here we are wrapping up this i saw on the plane flying in for hot new products i 'm not sure this is an improvement
 or a good idea because like if you don 't spend quite enough time in front of your computer you can now get a plate in the keyboard 
 so there 's no more faking it that you don 't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway now there 's a plate and it would be really really convenient to get a piece of pizza then type a little bit
 just not sure this is improvement  if you ever doubt the power of graphic design this is a very generic sign that literally says vote for hitler it says nothing 
 else  and this to me is an extreme case of the power of emotion of graphic design even though in fact was a very generic poster at the time  
  the importance of people becomes more than it 's ever been before 
 you have to utilize who you are in your work nobody else can do that nobody else can pull from your background from your parents your upbringing your whole life experience if you allow that to happen 
 it 's really the only way you can do some unique work 
 and you 're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well  this is i like found art hand lettering 's coming back in a big way and i thought this was a great example of both this lady
  's advertising for her lost pit bull it 's friendly she 's underlined friendly
 that 's probably why she calls it hercules or hercles she can 't spell 
 but more importantly she 's willing to give you twenty bucks to go find this lost pit bull  
 and i 'm thinking yeah right i 'll go look for a lost pit bill for twenty bucks i have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for hercles
 and you get charged by this thing and you go oh please be hercles please be the friendly one 
 i 'm sure she never found the dog because i took the sign but i
 was asked to give a talk at a conference in sacramento a few years back and the theme was courage and they asked me to talk about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer  
 and i remembered seeing this photograph
  my father who was a test pilot and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot  they told you that there was a forty to fifty percent chance of death on the job 
 that 's pretty high for most occupations but you know the
 government would make a plane they 'd say go see if that one flies would you some of them did some of them
