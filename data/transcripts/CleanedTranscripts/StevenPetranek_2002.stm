  the advances that have taken place in astronomy  cosmology
 and biology in the last ten years  are really extraordinary
 to the point where we know more about our universe
  and how it works than
 many of you might imagine  but there was something else that i 've noticed
 as those changes were taking place as people were starting to find out that hmm yeah there really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy the
 science writers and editors i shouldn 't say science writers i should say people who write about science
  and editors would sit down over a couple of beers  
 after a hard day of work and start talking about some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works  and
 they would inevitably end up in what i thought was a very bizarre place which is ways the world could end very suddenly  
  at first it all seemed a little fantastical to me but
 after challenging a lot of these ideas  i began to take a lot of them seriously and then september eleven happened
  and i thought ah god i can 't go to the ted conference and talk about how the world is going to end 
 nobody wants to hear that not after this  and that got me into a discussion with some other people other scientists about
 maybe some other subjects and one of the guys i talked to who was a neuroscientist said you know i think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up
  michael 's talk yesterday and his mother saying you can 't have a solution if you don 't have a
 problem so we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow  and lo and behold  we found them 
 which leads me to a
 videotape of a president bush
 press
  to defend our security  
 and whatever it costs to defend our freedom  
 we must pay it sp i agree with the president he wants two trillion dollars to
 protect us from terrorists next year a two trillion dollar federal budget which will land us back into deficit spending real fast
  the only threat we face there are
 really serious calamities staring us in the eye that we 're in the same kind of denial about that we were about
 terrorism and what could 've happened on september eleven
  i would propose therefore  that if we took ten billion dollars from that two point one three
  of that budget
 and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems i 'm going to talk to you about the vast majority could be solved
  and the rest we could deal with  so  i hope you find this
 both fascinating
 i 'm fascinated by this kind of stuff i gotta admit
 to me these are richard 's cockroaches
  but i also hope  because i think the people in this room can literally change the world  
 i hope you take some of this stuff away with you and when you have an opportunity to be influential
  that you try to get some heavy duty money spent on some of these ideas  so let 's start
  number ten we lose the will
 we live in an incredible age of modern medicine we are all much healthier than we were twenty years ago  
 people around the world are getting better medicine
 but mentally  we 're falling apart the world health organization now estimates
 that one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed
  and the world health organization also says that depression is the
 biggest epidemic that humankind has ever faced  
 soon genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine are going to
 allow us to think of one hundred as a normal lifespan
  a female child born tomorrow on average median will live to age eighty three our life
 longevity is going up almost a year for every year that passes 
 now the problem with all of this getting older is that people over sixty five are the most likely people to commit suicide  
 so what are the solutions  we don 't really have mental health insurance in this
  often a combination of talk therapy and pills pills alone don 't do it  especially in clinically depressed people 
 you ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist
 or a psychologist and put down your  10 dollar copay  and get treated just like you do when you got a cut on your arm it 's ridiculous  secondly  
 drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated psychoactive drugs  we know that most
 mental illnesses have a biological component that can be dealt with and we know just an amazing amount more about the
  now than we did ten years ago  we need a pump push from the federal government  through nih and national science nsf
 and places like that to start helping the drug companies develop some advanced psychoactive drugs  moving on number nine
 don 't laugh
  aliens invade earth  ten years ago you couldn 't have found an astronomer well very few astronomers
 in the world who would 've told you that there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system one thousand nine hundred and ninety five we found three 
 the count now is up to eighty we 're finding about two or three a month 
 all of the ones we 've found by the way are in this little teeny tiny corner where we live in the milky way  
 there must be millions of planets in the milky way  and as carl sagan insisted
  for many years and was laughed at for it  there must be billions and billions in the universe 
 in a few years nasa is going to launch four or five telescopes out to jupiter where there 's less dust and start looking for earth like planets 
 which we cannot see with present technology nor detect  
 it 's becoming obvious that the chance that
 life does not exist elsewhere in
  the universe and probably fairly close to us is a fairly remote idea  
 and the chance that some of it isn 't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea
  remember we 've only been an advanced civilization an industrial civilization if you would for two hundred years although every time i go to pompeii i 'm amazed that
 they had the
  a mcdonald 's on every street corner too so i don 't know how much civilization really has progressed since ad seventy nine but
 there 's a great likelihood i really believe this  and i don 't believe in aliens  and i don 't believe there are any aliens on the earth or anything like that but
 there 's a likelihood that we will confront a civilization that is more intelligent than our own now what will happen  
 what if they come to you know  suck up our oceans for the hydrogen and swat us away like flies
  we swat away flies when we go into the rainforest and start logging it we can look at our own history the late physicist gerard o 'neill said 
 advanced western civilization has had a destructive effect on all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with 
 even in those cases where every attempt was made
 to protect and guard the primitive civilization if the aliens come visiting
 're the primitive civilization  so what are the solutions to this 
 thank god
 you can all read it may seem ridiculous but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this and actually being prepared for them how much energy and money
  does it take to actually have a plan to negotiate with an advanced species  
 secondly  and you 're going to hear more from me about this we have to become an 
  nation we have got to develop the idea that the earth doesn 't last forever our sun doesn 't last forever  if we want humanity to last forever  
 we have to colonize the milky way
 and that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point it 'll
 also help us a lot if we meet an advanced civilization along the way  if we 're trying to be an advanced civilization
  number eight the ecosystem collapses last july in science  the journal science
  nineteen oceanographers published a very very unusual article it wasn 't really a research report it was a screed  they said  we 've been looking at the oceans for a long time now  and we want to tell you they 're not in trouble they 're near collapse 
 many other ecosystems
 on earth are in real real
  danger  we 're living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record by a factor of ten thousand  
 we have lost twenty five percent of the unique species in hawaii in the last twenty years  california is expected to lose twenty five percent of its species in the next forty years  
 somewhere in the amazon forest is the marginal tree  you cut down that tree  the rain forest collapses
  as an ecosystem  there 's really a tree like that out there that 's really what it comes to  
 and when that ecosystem collapses it could take a major ecosystem with it  like our atmosphere  
 so what do we do about this what are the solutions  
 there is some modeling of ecosystems going on now  the problem with
 with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly that we don 't know they 're really in trouble until it 's almost too late
  we need to know earlier
 that they 're getting in trouble  and we need to
 be able to pump possible solutions into models  and with the kind of computing power we have now there is as i say some of this going on but it needs money national science foundation needs to say
  all the money that 's spent on science in this country comes from the federal government one way or another  
 and they get to prioritize  you know there are people at the national science foundation who get to say this is the most important thing  this is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about  secondly we need to create huge 
  biodiversity reserves on the planet and start moving them around there 's been an experiment for the last four or five years on the georges bank 
  and an amazing thing has happened almost all the fish have come back  and they 're reproducing like crazy  
 we 're going to have to start doing this around the globe we 're going to have to have no take zones we 're going to have to say no more logging in the amazon for twenty years  let it recover 
  you all remember ted kaczynski the unabomber one of the things he raved about
 was that a particle accelerator experiment could go haywire
 and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world 
 a lot of very sober minded physicists believe it or not have had exactly the same thought this spring there 's a collider at brookhaven on long island
  it 's going to
 have an experiment in which it creates black holes they are expecting
 to create little tiny black holes  they expect them to evaporate 
 i hope they 're right 
 other collider experiments there 's one that 's going to take place next summer at cern
 have the possibility of creating something called strangelets which are kind of like antimatter whenever they hit other matter they destroy it
  and obliterate it  
 most physicists say that the accelerators we have now are not really powerful enough to create black holes and strangelets that we need to worry about  and they 're probably right but all around the world  in japan in canada
  there 's talk about this of reviving this in the united states we shut one down that was going to be big  but there 's talk of building very
  what can we do about this  what are the solutions  we 've got the fox watching the henhouse here  we need to
 we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics and what should be done in particle physics but
 we need some
 outside thinking and watchdogging of what 's going on with these experiments  secondly we have a natural laboratory surrounding the earth we have
 an electromagnetic field around the earth  and it 's constantly bombarded
  by high energy particles like protons  and in my opinion we don 't spend enough time
 looking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first what 's safe to do on earth  
 number six biotech disaster it 's one of my favorite ones because we 've done several stories on bt corn bt corn is a corn
 that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer
 you may of heard of it heard it called starlink  especially when all those taco shells were taken 
  out of the supermarkets about a year and a half ago  this stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the united states and it got into the human food supply  and
 somebody should 've figured out that it would get in the human food supply very easily but the thing that 's alarming is a couple of months ago in mexico
  where bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal  
 they found bt corn genes in wild corn plants now  corn originated we think  in mexico
 this is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn  this brings back a skepticism that has gone
  superweeds and superpests could spread around the world from biotechnology  that literally could destroy the world 's food supply in very short order so what
 do we do about that 
 we treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants  
 it 's that simple  this is an amazingly unregulated field when the starlink disaster happened there was a battle between
  who really had authority and over what parts of this  and they didn 't get it straightened out for months that 's kind of crazy  
 number five one of my favorites reversal of the earth 's magnetic field  believe it or not this happens every few hundred thousand years  and has happened many times in our history  north pole goes to the south south pole goes to the north and vice
  as this occurs is that we lose our magnetic field around the earth
 over the period of about one hundred years  and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are to come streaming at us from the sun that this
 field protects us from are well basically  we 're gonna fry
  can we do about this  oh by the way we 're overdue it 's
 been seven hundred and eighty thousand years since this happened so it should have happened about four hundred and eighty thousand
 years ago oh and here 's one other thing scientists think now our magnetic field may be
 diminished by about five
  maybe we 're in the throes of it one of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the earth is is that we
 have you know we don 't have good weather data from sixty years ago much less data on things like the ozone layer  so  
 there 's a fairly simple solution to this  there 's going to be a lot of cheap rocketry that 's going to come online in about six or seven years
 that gets us into the low atmosphere very
  cheaply  you know  we can make ozone from car tailpipes  it 's not hard it 's just three oxygen atoms  
 if you brought the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the earth it would be the thickness of two pennies at fourteen pounds per square inch you don 't need that much up there  
 we need to learn how to repair and replenish
 the earth 's ozone
  giant solar flares 
 solar flares are enormous magnetic outbursts from the sun that bombard the earth with high speed subatomic particles 
 so far our atmosphere has done and our magnetic field has done pretty well protecting us from this  occasionally  we get a flare from the sun that
 causes havoc with
 communications and so forth  and electricity  
 but the alarming thing is that astronomers recently have been studying stars that are similar to our sun and they 've found that a number of them 
 when they 're about the age of our sun brighten by a factor of as much as twenty 
 doesn 't last for very long  and they think these are super flares millions of times more powerful than any flares we 've had from our sun so far
  side to it in studying stars like our sun we 've found that they go through periods of diminishment when their
 total amount of energy that 's expelled from them goes down by maybe one percent one percent doesn 't sound like a lot but it would cause one hell of an ice age here so
 what can we do about this 
 start terraforming mars
  this is one of my favorite subjects i wrote a story about this in life magazine in
  rocket science but it 's not hard rocket science
  everything that we need to make an atmosphere on mars and to make a livable planet on mars  is probably there and
 you just literally have to
 send little nuclear factories up there that gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of mars
 and spit out the oxygen the problem is it takes three hundred years to terraform mars
 really more like five hundred years to do it right  there 's no reason why we shouldn 't start now number three
 isn 't this stuff cool 
 a new global epidemic people have been at war with germs ever since there have been people and from time to time the
  we had a flu epidemic in the united states that killed twenty million people that was back when the population
 was around one hundred million people  the bubonic plague in europe in the middle ages killed one out of
 four europeans  aids is coming back
 ebola seems to be rearing its head with much too much frequency
  and old diseases like cholera are becoming resistant to antibiotics  we 've all
  learned what the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease rears its head like anthrax  
 the worst possibility
 is that
 a very simple germ like staph for which we have one antibiotic that still works mutates and we know staph can do
  a staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it when antibiotics come and change and mutate  
 the danger is that some germ like staph will be will mutate into something that 's really virulent very contagious  and will sweep
 through
 populations before we can do anything about it that 's happened before  about twelve thousand years ago  there was a massive
  massive wave of mammal extinctions in the americas  and that is thought to have been a virulent disease  so what can we do about
 it it is nuts we give antibiotics 
 every cow every lamb every chicken they get antibiotics every day all you know you go to a restaurant you eat fish i got news for you it 's all farmed you know 
 you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if it 's a wild fish cause they 're not going to tell
  we 're giving away the code this is like being at war and giving somebody your secret code  we 're telling
 the germs out there
 how to fight us
  we gotta fix that we gotta outlaw that right away  secondly our public health system as we saw with anthrax  is a real disaster we have a real major
 outbreak of disease in the united states  we are not prepared to cope with it now  there is money
  in the federal budget next year to build up the public health service but i don 't think to any extent that it really needs to be done  number two my favorite
 we meet a rogue black hole  you know  ten years ago or fifteen years ago really you walk into an astronomy convention 
 and you say you know there 's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy and they 're going to hoot you off the stage  
 and now if you went into one of those conventions and you said well i don 't think
  our comprehension of the way the universe works is really has just gained
 unbelievably in recent years  
 we think that there are about ten million dead stars in the milky way alone our galaxy  
 and these stars have compressed down to maybe something like twelve fifteen miles wide  and they are black holes and they are gobbling up everything around them
  which is why we can 't see them  most of them should be in orbit around something but
 galaxies are very violent places and things can be spun out of orbit  and also space is incredibly vast so even if you
 flung a million of these things out of orbit the chances that one would actually hit us is fairly remote  but
 it only it only has to get close about a billion miles away one of these things
 about a billion miles away here 's what happens to earth 's orbit  it becomes elliptical instead of circular  
 and for three months out of the year the surface temperatures go up to one hundred and fifty to one hundred and eighty for three months out of the year they go to fifty below zero 
 that won 't work too well  what can we do about this and this is my scariest
  gotta think about being a colonizing race  and finally number one 
 biggest danger to life as we know it i think a really big asteroid heads for earth  
 the important thing to remember here this is
  piece of a comet
 exploded over siberia and flattened forests for maybe one hundred miles it had the effect of about one thousand hiroshima bombs 
 astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years in
  miles away from earth  nothing to worry about right  
 it passed directly through earth 's orbit  we were in that that spot six hours earlier 
 a small asteroid say a half mile wide would touch off firestorms followed by severe global cooling from the debris kicked up carl sagan 's nuclear winter
 thing an asteroid five miles wide
  causes major extinctions we think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles wide  where are they 
 there 's something called the kuiper belt  which some people think pluto 's not a planet  that 's where pluto is it 's in the kuiper belt
 there 's also something a little farther out called the oort cloud  there are about one hundred thousand
 balls of ice and rock comets really out there
  there that are fifty miles in diameter or more  and they regularly take a little spin in towards the sun and
 pass reasonably close to us 
 of more concern i think is
 the asteroids that exist between mars and jupiter
  the folks at the sloan digital sky survey told us last fall they 're making the first map of the universe
 three dimensional map of the universe that there are probably seven hundred thousand asteroids between mars and jupiter
 that are a half a mile big or bigger so you say yeah well
  what are really the chances of this happening  andrew can you put that chart up
  this is a chart that dr clark chapman at the southwest research institute presented to congress a few years ago  you 'll notice that the chance of an 
  impact killing you is about one in twenty thousand  according to the work they 've done  now look at the one right below that passenger aircraft
 crash one in twenty thousand  we spend an awful lot of money
 trying to be sure that we don 't die in airplane accidents  and we 're not spending hardly anything
 on this  and yet  this is completely preventable we finally have just in the last year  the technology to stop this cold could we have the solutions  
 nasa 's spending three million dollars a year three million bucks that is like pocket change
 to search for asteroids because we can actually figure out every asteroid that 's out there  and if it might hit earth  and when
  hit earth  and they 're trying to do that but it 's going to take them ten years  at spending three million dollars a year and even then they claim they 'll only have about eighty percent of them catalogued 
 comets are a tougher act we don 't really have the technology to predict
 comet trajectories or when one with our name on it might arrive  but we would have lots of time
  if we see it coming we really need a dedicated observatory  you 'll notice that a lot of comets are named after people you never heard of amateur
 astronomers that 's because nobody 's looking for them except amateurs  we need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets  
 part two of the solutions
  we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid or alter its trajectory now  a year ago we did an amazing thing we sent a probe out to this
  they pulled one of those sneaky nasa things where they had extra batteries and extra gas aboard and everything and then at the last minute they landed when the mission was over they actually landed on the thing  
 we have landed
 a rocket ship on an asteroid it 's not a big deal now the trouble with just sending a bomb out
  for this thing is that you don 't have anything to push against in space because there 's no air  a nuclear explosion is just as hot  but
 we don 't really have anything big enough
 to melt a 22 mile long asteroid or vaporize it would be more like it  but we can learn to land on these asteroids that have our name on them
 and put something like a small ion propulsion
 motor on it
  slowly after a period of time push it into a different trajectory which if we 've done our math right 
 would keep it from hitting earth  this is just a matter of finding ' em going there and doing something about it 
 i know your head is spinning from all this stuff
