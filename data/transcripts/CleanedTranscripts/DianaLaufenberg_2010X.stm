 been teaching for a long time and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that i really wish more people
 would understand about the potential of students
  my grandmother bottom
 left for you guys over here graduated from the eighth grade she went to school to get the information because that 's where the information lived  it was in the books it was inside the teacher 's head and she needed to go there to get the information because that 's how you learned 
 fast forward a generation this is the one room schoolhouse oak grove where my father went to a one room schoolhouse and he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher stored it in the only portable memory he has
  which is inside his own head  and take it with him  because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world 
 when i was a kid we had a set of encyclopedias at my house 
 it was purchased the year i was born  and it was extraordinary  because i did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information the information was inside my house and it was awesome
 different than either generation had experienced before  and it changed the way i interacted with information even at just a small level but the information was closer to me i could get access to it 
 in the time that passes between when i was a kid in high school and when i started teaching we really see the advent of the internet 
 right about the time that the internet gets going as an educational tool i take off from wisconsin and move
 to kansas small town kansas where i had an opportunity to teach in a lovely 
 rural kansas school district where i was teaching my favorite subject american government 
 my first year super gung ho going to teach american government  loved the political system 
 kids in the 12th grade not exactly all that enthusiastic about the american government system year two learned a few things
  had to change my tactic and i put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves  i didn 't tell them what to do or how to do it  i posed a problem in front 
  of them which was to put on an election forum for their own community  they produced flyers they called offices they checked schedules they were meeting with secretaries they produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates they invited everyone into the school for an evening of
  conversation about government and politics and
 whether or not the streets were done well and really had this robust experiential learning 
 the older teachers more experienced looked at me and went oh there she is that 's so cute she 's trying to get that done 
 she doesn 't know what she 's in for but i knew that
  and i believed it  and i told them every week what i expected out of them 
 and that night all ninety kids dressed appropriately doing their job owning it i had to just sit and watch  
 it was theirs  it was experiential it was authentic it meant something to them and they will step up 
 from kansas  i moved on to lovely arizona where i taught in flagstaff for a number of years this time with middle school students luckily i didn 't have to teach them american government could teach them the more exciting
  topic of geography  again thrilled to learn  but what was interesting about
 this position i found myself in in arizona was i had this really
 extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities and one opportunity was
 we got to go and meet paul rusesabagina
  is the gentleman that the movie hotel rwanda is based after  
 and he was going to speak at the high school next door to us we could walk there we didn 't even have to pay for the buses there was no expense cost  
 perfect field trip the problem then becomes how do you take seventh and eighth graders to a talk about genocide
 and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful and
 they know what to do with it and so we chose to look at paul rusesabagina as an example of
  gentleman who
 singularly used his life to do something positive 
 i then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life or in their own story or in their own world that they could identify that had done a similar thing i asked them to produce a little movie about it it 's the first time we 'd done this nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer
 but they were into it  and i asked them to put their own voice over it
  the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice
 and ask them to speak for themselves 
 what they 're willing to share the last question of the assignment is how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people 
 the things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen
  to pennsylvania where i find myself today i teach at the science leadership academy  which is a partnership school between the franklin institute and the school district of philadelphia 
 we are a nine through twelve public school but we do school quite differently  
 i moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that i knew that kids learned and that really
 wanted to investigate what was possible
 when you are willing to let go of some
  of the paradigms of the past 
 of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when i was in school and to a moment when we have information surplus
 so what do you do when the information is all around you why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information 
 in philadelphia we
  laptop program so the kids are bringing in
 laptops with them everyday taking them home getting access to information and here 's the thing
 that you need to get comfortable with when you 've given the tool to acquire information to students 
 is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process 
 we deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test
  and i am here to share with you it is not learning 
 that is the absolute wrong thing to ask to tell kids to never be wrong 
 to ask them to always have the right answer doesn 't allow them to learn 
 so we did this project  and this is one of the artifacts of the project i almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure my students produced these
  result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill  i asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info graphics that existed
 in a lot of mass media and take a look at what were the interesting components of it  and produce one for themselves of a different
 man made disaster from american history and they had certain
 criteria to
  they were a little uncomfortable with it because we 'd never done this before and they didn 't know exactly how to do it they can talk they 're
 very smooth and they can write very very well but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them  
 but i gave them the room to just do the thing go create go figure it out let 's see what we can do 
 and the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not
 disappoint this was done in like two or three days and this is the work of
  student that consistently did it and when i sat the students down i said who 's got the best one and they immediately went there it is didn
 't read anything there it is 
 and i said well what makes it great and they 're like oh the design 's good and he 's using good color and there 's some and they went through all that we processed out loud and i said 
 go read it and they 're like oh that one wasn
  and then we went to another one it didn 't have great visuals but it had great information and spent an hour talking about the learning process  
 because it wasn 't about whether or not it was perfect or whether or not it was what i could create it asked them to create for themselves  
 and it allowed them to fail process  learn from and when we do another round of this in my class this year they will do better this time 
 because learning
 has to include an amount
  in the process  there are a million pictures that i could click through here and had to choose carefully this is one of my favorites
 of students learning of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea
 that kids have to come to school to get the information but instead ask them what they can do with it ask them really interesting questions they will not disappoint ask them to go
  to places to see things for themselves to actually experience the learning to play 
 to inquire 
 this is one of my favorite photos because this was taken on tuesday when i asked the students to go to the polls 
 this is robbie  and this was his first day of voting  and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that but this is learning too because we asked them to go out into real spaces
 the main point is that if we continue
 to look at education as if
 it 's about coming to school to get the information
 and not about experiential learning  empowering student voice and embracing failure we 're missing the mark  and everything that everybody is talking about today isn 't possible if we keep having an educational system
  that does not value these qualities  because we won 't get there with a standardized test  and we won 't get there with a culture of one right answer we know how to do this better and it 's time to do better
