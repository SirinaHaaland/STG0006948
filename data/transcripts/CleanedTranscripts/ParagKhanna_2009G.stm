  do we live in a borderless world  
 before you answer that have a look at this map contemporary political map shows that we have over two hundred countries in the world today  that 's probably more than at any time
  many of you will object for you this would be a more appropriate map you could call it tedistan 
 in tedistan there are no borders just connected spaces and unconnected spaces most of you probably reside in one of the forty dots on this screen of the many more that represent ninety percent of the world economy  
 but let 's talk about the ninety percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born  for them
  nations countries boundaries borders still matter a great deal and often violently  
 now here at ted we 're solving some of the great riddles of science and mysteries of the universe  well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved our basic political geography how do we distribute ourselves around the world  
 now this is important because border conflicts
 justify so much of
 border conflicts can derail so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here so i think we need a deeper understanding of how people money power  
 religion culture technology interact to change the map of the world  and we can try to anticipate those changes and shape them in a more constructive direction 
 so we 're going to look at some maps of the past  the present and some maps you haven 't seen
 in order to get a sense of
  where things are going let 's start with the world of 
  there were just one hundred countries in the world  
 after world war ii europe was devastated  but still held large overseas colonies  french west africa  british east africa  south asia and so forth  
 then over the late
  new countries were born you can see that africa has been fragmented india  pakistan bangladesh south east asian nations created  
 then came the end of the cold war 
 the end of the cold war and the disintegration of the soviet union  you had the creation of new states in eastern europe  the former yugoslav republics and the balkans  and the ' stans of central asia 
 today we have two hundred countries in the world
 the entire planet is covered by sovereign  independent
 does that mean that someone 's gain has to be someone else 's loss  
 let 's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world  eastern eurasia as you can see on this map 
 russia is still the largest country in the world  and as you know china is the most populous and they share a lengthy land border what you don 't see on this map
 is that most of russia 's one hundred and fifty million people are concentrated in its western provinces and areas that are close to europe  
 and only thirty million people are in its eastern areas 
 in fact the world bank predicts
 that russia 's population is declining towards about one hundred and twenty million people
 and there is another thing that you don 't see on this
  khrushchev and other soviet leaders forced russians out to the far east to be in gulags labor camps nuclear cities whatever the case was 
 but as oil prices rose 
 russian governments have invested in infrastructure to unite the country east and west but nothing has more perversely impacted russia 's demographic distribution  because the people in the east 
 who never wanted to be there anyway have gotten on those trains and roads and gone back to the west 
  east today  which is twice the size of india you have exactly six million russians  
 so let 's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world  we can start with mongolia or as some call it mine golia why do they call it that  because in 
 chinese firms operate and own most of the mines copper zinc gold and they truck the resources south and east into mainland china china
  isn 't conquering mongolia  it 's buying it  
 colonies were once conquered today countries are bought  
 so let 's apply this principle to siberia siberia most of you probably think of as a cold desolate unlivable place  
 but in fact with global warming and rising temperatures all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields and agribusiness and grain being produced in siberia
  but who is it going to feed  
 well just on the other side of the amo river in the heilongjiang and harbin provinces of china you have over one hundred million people  that 's larger than the entire population of russia 
 every single year for at least a decade or more [ sixty thousand ] of them have been voting with their feet  crossing
  moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain 
 they set up their own bazaars and medical clinics they 've taken over the timber industry and been shipping the lumber east back into china  
 again like mongolia  china isn 't
 conquering russia  it 's just leasing it 
 that 's what i call globalization chinese style  now maybe this is what the map of the region might look like in ten to twenty
  but hold on this map is seven hundred years old 
 this is the map of the yuan dynasty led by kublai khan  the grandson of genghis khan  
 so history doesn 't necessarily repeat itself  but it does rhyme 
 this is just to give you a taste of what 's happening in this part of the world  
 again globalization chinese style  because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography 
 so the history
  of east asia in fact people don 't think about nations and borders they think more in terms of empires and hierarchies usually chinese or japanese  well it 's china 's turn again  so let 
  's look at how china is re establishing that hierarchy in the far east it starts with the global hubs remember the forty dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global
  east asia today has more of those global hubs than any other region in the world  
 tokyo seoul beijing shanghai  hong kong  singapore and sidney these are the filters and funnels of global capital  trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region so much of it being invested into china  
 then there is trade these vectors and arrows represent ever stronger trade relationships that china has with every country in the region specifically it targets
 japan and korea
  korea and australia countries that are strong allies of the united states australia for example is heavily dependent on exporting
 iron ore and natural gas to china 
 for poorer countries china reduces tariffs so that laos and cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply and become dependent on exporting to china as well  and now many of you have been reading in the news how
 people are looking to china to lead the rebound the economic rebound not
  just in asia but potentially for the world  the asian free trade zone  almost free trade zone that 's emerging now has a greater trade volume than trade across the pacific  
 so china is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy china has signed military agreements with many countries in the
  has become the hub of diplomatic institutions such as the east asian community 
 some of these organizations don 't even have the united states as a member 
 there is a treaty of nonaggression between countries such that if there were a conflict between china and the united states most countries vow to just sit it out including american allies like korea and australia  
 another pillar of the strategy like russia is demographic
  china exports business people nannies students  teachers to teach chinese around the region to intermarry and to occupy ever greater commanding heights of the economies already ethnic chinese people in
 malaysia  thailand and indonesia
 are the real key factors and drivers in the economies there chinese pride is resurgent in the region
 as a result  singapore for example used to ban chinese language education  now it encourages it
  if you add it all up what do you get 
 well  if you remember before world war ii japan had a vision for a greater japanese co prosperity sphere 
 what 's emerging today is what you might call a greater chinese co prosperity sphere 
 so no matter what the lines on the map tell you in terms of nations and borders what you really have emerging in the far east
 are national cultures but in a much more fluid imperial zone
 all of this is happening without firing a shot  
 that 's most certainly not the case in the middle east where countries are still very uncomfortable in the borders left behind by european colonialists  
 so what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world what lines on the map should we focus on what i want to present to you is what i call state building day by day 
 let 's start with iraq
  six years after the u s invasion of iraq the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality 
 oil used to be one of the forces holding iraq together  now it is the most significant cause of the country 's disintegration 
 the reason is kurdistan the kurds for three thousand years have been waging a struggle for independence and now is their chance to finally have it these are pipeline routes which emerge from kurdistan which is
  and today if you go to kurdistan you 'll see that kurdish peshmerga guerillas are squaring off against the sunni iraqi army
 but what are they guarding is it really a border on the map  no it 's the pipelines 
 if the kurds can control their pipelines they can set the terms of their own statehood  now should we be upset about this about the potential disintegration of
  i don 't believe we should iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world behind saudi arabia 
 and we 'll have a chance to solve a three thousand year old dispute  now remember kurdistan is landlocked  it has no choice but to behave 
 in order to profit from its oil it has to export it through turkey or syria and other countries and iraq itself and therefore it has to have amicable relations with them  
 now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region that is of course in palestine
  is something of a cartographic anomaly because it 's two parts palestinian one part israel  
 thirty years of rose garden diplomacy have not delivered us peace in this conflict what might 
 i believe that what might solve the problem is infrastructure today donors are spending billions of dollars on this these two arrows are an arc an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure that link the west
  bank and gaza if gaza can have a functioning port and be linked to the west bank you can have a viable palestinian state palestinian economy 
 that i believe is going to bring peace to this particular conflict the lesson from kurdistan and from palestine is that independence alone  without infrastructure
  now what might this entire region look like if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders when the insecurities might abate  
 the last time that was the case was actually a century ago during the ottoman empire 
 this is the hejaz railway the hejaz railway ran from istanbul to medina via damascus  it even had an offshoot running to haifa in what is today israel  on the mediterranean sea
  but today the hejaz railway lies in tatters  ruins 
 if we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map  infrastructure that cross the straight lines the borders 
 i believe the middle east would be a far more peaceful region  
 now let 's look at another part of the world  
 the former soviet republics of central asia the ' stans these countries ' borders originate from stalin 's decrees he purposely did not want these countries to make sense 
 he wanted ethnicities to mingle in ways that would allow him to divide and rule
 fortunately for them most of their oil and gas resources were discovered after the soviet union collapsed  
 now i know some of you may be thinking oil oil oil why is it all he 's talking about is oil 
 well there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil and the way we 're talking about it now before it was how do we control their oil  
 now it 's their
  oil for their own purposes and i assure you it 's every bit as important to them as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists 
 here are just some of the pipeline projections and possibilities and scenarios and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades a great deal of them 
 for a number of countries in this part of the world having pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy and for having some meaning besides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves
  just take azerbaijan azerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the caucuses but now with the 
  pipeline into turkey it has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west  then there is turkmenistan  which most people think of as a frozen basket case 
 but now it 's contributing gas across the caspian sea to provide for europe  and even a potentially
 which didn 't even have a name before it was more considered south siberia during the soviet union today most people recognize kazakhstan as an emerging geopolitical player  why  
 because it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the caspian 
 north through russia  and even east to china 
 more pipelines means more silk roads instead of the great game the great game connotes dominance of one over the other
  road connotes independence
 and mutual trust  the more pipelines we have the more silk roads we 'll have and the less of a dominant great game
 competition we 'll have in the 21st century 
 now let 's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders  and how that has enhanced its strength  and that is of course europe 
 the european union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries 
 and their main purpose was really to
  keep the rehabilitation of germany to happen in a in a peaceful way  
 but then eventually it grew into twelve countries and those are the twelve stars on the european flag the e u also became a currency block  and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world 
 on average the e u has grown by one country per year since the end of the cold war 
 in fact most of that happened on just one day in two thousand and four
  new countries joined the e u and now you have what most people consider a zone of peace spanning twenty seven countries and four hundred and fifty million people  
 so what is next what is the future of the european union  
 well in light blue you see the zones or the regions that are at least two thirds or more dependent on the european union for trade
  trade and investment what does that tell us trade and investment tell us that europe is putting its money where its mouth is 
 even if these regions aren 't part of the e u they are becoming part of its sphere of influence just take the balkans  
 croatia  serbia bosnia they 're not members of the e u yet  but you can get on a german ice train and make it almost to albania 
 in bosnia you use the euro currency already and that 's the only currency they 're probably ever going to have 
 so looking at other parts of europe 's periphery
 such as north africa on average  every year or two a new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the mediterranean connecting north africa to europe  
 that not only helps europe diminish its reliance on russia for energy but if you travel to north africa today you 'll hear more and more people saying that they don 't really think of their region as the middle east 
 so in other words i believe that president sarkozy of france is right when he talks about a mediterranean union
 now let 's look at turkey and the caucasus i mentioned azerbaijan before 
 that corridor of turkey and the caucasus has become the conduit for twenty percent of europe 's energy supply  so does turkey really have to be a member of the european union  i don 't think it does i think it 's already part of a euro turkish superpower  
 so what 's next where are we going to see borders change and new countries born
  well south central asia  south west asia is a very good place to start 
 eight years after the u s invaded afghanistan there is still a tremendous amount of instability  
 pakistan and afghanistan are still so fragile that neither of them have dealt constructively with the problem of pashtun nationalism 
 this is the flag that flies in the minds of twenty million pashtuns who live on both sides of the afghan and pakistan border 
 let 's not neglect the
  insurgency just to the south balochistan two weeks ago balochi rebels attacked a pakistani military garrison and this was the flag that they raised over it 
 the post colonial entropy that is happening around the world is accelerating  and i expect more such changes to occur in the map as the states fragment
 of course we can 't forget africa
  and by far the most number of suspiciously straight lines on the map  
 if we were to look at all of africa we could most certainly acknowledge far more tribal divisions
 and so forth  but let 's just look at sudan the second largest country in africa it has three ongoing civil wars  the genocide in darfur  which you all know about 
 the civil war in the east of the country and south sudan south sudan is going to be having a referendum in two thousand and eleven
 in which it is very likely to
  vote itself independence  now let 's go up to the arctic circle 
 there is a great race on for energy resources under the arctic seabed who will win canada russia the united states actually greenland 
 several weeks ago greenland 's [ sixty thousand ] people voted themselves self governance rights from denmark so denmark
  is about to get a whole lot smaller
 what is the lesson from all of this geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline it 's constantly morphing and changing the world  
 like climate change and like our relationship with the ecosystem we 're always searching for equilibrium in how we divide ourselves across the planet  
 now we fear changes on the map we fear civil wars death tolls having to learn the names of new countries but i believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today
  today is far worse and far more violent
