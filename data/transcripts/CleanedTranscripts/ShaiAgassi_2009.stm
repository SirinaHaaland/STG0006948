  so how would you run a whole country without oil  that 's the question that
 sort of hit me in the middle of a davos afternoon about four years ago  it never left my brain  and i started playing with it more like
  original thought i had this must be ethanol so i went out and researched ethanol and found out you need the amazon in your backyard in every country 
 about six months later i figured out it must be hydrogen  until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth which is you actually
 use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside
 a car if you use hydrogen so that is not going to be the path to go and then sort of through a process of wandering around i got to the thought that actually if you
  could convert an entire country to electric cars in a way that is
 convenient and affordable you could
 get to a solution  now i started this from a point of view that it has to be something that scales en masse not how do you build one car  but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by  ninety nine percent
 of the population the thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good
  good as any car that you would have today so one it has to be more convenient than a car and two it has be more affordable than today 's cars affordable is not a forty thousand dollar sedan 
 right alright that 's not something that we can finance or buy today and convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight  
 so we 're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics and so the thought that
  that i started with was how do you do this still within the boundary of the science we know today no time for science fair no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show 
  up how do you do it within the economics that we have today how do you do it from the power of the consumer up and not from the power of an edict down
  the car ownership
 and the battery ownership in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic batteries not included 
 now if you separate between the two you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network by creating a
 network before the cars show up the network has two components in them first component is you charge the car whenever you
  stop ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours and park for about twenty two hours
 if you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute  
 and so the first thought that came to mind is everywhere we park
 we have electric power now it sounds crazy but in some places around
  you already have that if you park your car and didn 't plug in the heater when you come back you don 't have a car it just doesn 't work  
 now that last mile last foot  in a sense is the first step of the infrastructure the second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension 
 see we 're bound by today 's technology on batteries which is about one hundred and twenty miles if you want to stay within reasonable
  hundred and twenty miles is a good enough range for a lot of people but you never want to get stuck  so what we added is a second element to our network which is a battery swap system 
 you drive you take your depleted battery out a full battery comes on and you drive on you don 't do it as a human being you do it as a machine it looks like a car wash  you come into your 
 car wash  and a plate comes up holds your battery takes it out puts it back in and within two minutes you 're back on the road and you can go again
 if you had charge spots everywhere  and you had battery swap stations everywhere how often would you do it and it ends up
 that you 'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station as a matter of fact we added to the contract  
 we said that if you stop to swap your battery more than fifty times a year we start paying you money
 because it 's an inconvenience then we looked at the question of the affordability we looked at the question what
  when the battery is disconnected from the car  what is the cost of that battery everybody tells us batteries are so expensive what we found out when you move from molecules to electrons something interesting happens we can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again  
 the battery is not the gas tank in a sense  remember in in your car you have a gas tank  you have the crude oil and you have refining and delivery of that crude oil as what we call petrol or gasoline
 the battery
 in this sense is the crude oil  we have a battery bay it costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank  
 but the crude oil is replaced with a battery just it doesn 't burn  it consumes itself step after step after step it has two thousand life cycles these days  
 and so it 's sort of a mini well we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well for the life of the car
  wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car in a sense what we 've done is we 've created a new
 consumable 
 you today buy gasoline miles and we created electric miles and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number 
 today two thousand and ten in volume when we come to market  it is eight cents a mile
  have a hard time calculating what that means
 in the average consumer environment we 're in in the u s twenty miles per gallon that 's a buck fifty a buck sixty a gallon that 's cheaper than today 's gasoline even in the u s 
 in europe where taxes are in place  that 's the equivalent to a minus sixty dollar barrel  
 but e miles follow moore 's law they go from eight cents a mile
  four cents a mile in two thousand and fifteen to two cents a mile by two thousand and twenty 
 why because batteries life cycle improve a bit of improvement on energy density which reduces the price 
 and these prices are actually with clean electrons we do not use any electrons that come from coal 
 so in a sense this is
 an absolute
  mile at two cents a mile by two thousand and twenty now even if we get to forty miles per gallon by two thousand and twenty which is our desire imagine only forty miles per gallon cars would be on the road  that is an eighty cent gallon an
 eighty cent gallon means if the entire pacific would convert to crude oil and we 'd let any oil company bring it out and refine it they still can 't compete with two cents a mile  
 that 's a new economic factor
  which is fascinating to most people now this would have been a wonderful paper that 's how i solved it in my head it was a white paper i handed out to governments and some governments told me that it 's fascinating that the younger generation actually thinks about these things 
 laughter until i got to the true young global leader shimon peres president of israel  and he ran a beautiful manipulation
  first he let me go to the prime minister of the country who told me if you can find the money you need for this network two hundred million dollars  and if you can find a car company
 that will build that car in mass volume in two million cars that 's what we needed in israel i 'll give you country to invest the two hundred million into 
 peres thought that was a great idea so we went out and we we looked at all the car companies we sent letters to all the car companies three of them never showed up one of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount
 but one of them carlos ghosn ceo of renault and nissan when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating he said hybrids are like mermaids 
 when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish 
 and ghosn came up and said i have the car mr peres i will build you the cars and actually true to form renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars
  cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume mass volume being the first year one hundred thousand cars it
 's the first mass volume electric car zero emission electric car
 in the market
 i was running as chris said to be the ceo of a large software company called sap and then peres said well won 't you run this project
  no no no no 
 you 've got to explain to me what is more important than saving your country and saving the world that you would go and do and i had to quit and come and do this thing called a
 better place we then decided to scale it up we went to other countries as i said we went to denmark  
 and denmark set this beautiful policy it 's called the iq test it 's inversely proportional to taxes 
 they put one hundred and eighty percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on
  cars  
 so if you want to buy a gasoline car in denmark it costs you about sixty thousand euros if you buy our car it 's about twenty thousand euros  if you fail the iq test they ask you to leave the country 
 we then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small islands i know most people don 't think of israel as a small island but israel is an island it 's a
  thinking about it in terms of islands  we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find and that was australia  the third country we announced was australia it 's got three centers
 in brisbane in melbourne in sydney and one freeway one electric freeway that connects them the next island was not too hard to find and that was hawaii
  we decided to come into the u s and pick the two best places the one where you didn 't need any range extension hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery and if you really have a long day you can switch and keep on driving around the island
 the second one was the san francisco bay area where gavin newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors he decided that he 's going to take over the state unofficially and then officially and then created this beautiful region one policy
 in the san francisco bay area not only do you have the highest concentration of priuses
  but you also have the perfect range extender it 's called the other car
 as we stared scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the u s why is this a big issue and the most fascinating thing we 've learned 
  is that when you have small problems on the individual level like the price of gasoline to drive every morning  
  of oil much like
 lots of other curves that we 've seen goes along a depletion curve the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground and we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground it becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out
 you think well it 's been up it 's been down its been up it 's going to keep on going up and down  here is the problem
  at one hundred and forty seven dollars a barrel which we were in six months ago the u s spent a ton of money to get
 oil  then we lost our economy and we went back down to forty seven sometimes it 's forty sometimes it 's fifty  
 now we 're running a stimulus package it 's called the trillion dollar stimulus package we 're going to revive the economy hopefully it happens between now and two thousand and fifteen  somewhere in that space what happens when the economy recovers
  by two thousand and fifteen we would have had at least two hundred and fifty million new cars even at the pace we 're going at right now that 's another thirty percent demand on oil  that is another twenty five million barrels a day that 's all the u s usage
 today  
 in other words at some point when we 've recovered we go up to the peak and then we do the opec stimulus package also known as two hundred dollars a barrel  
 we take our money and we give it away you know what happens at that point we go back down  it 's going to go up
  and down and the downs are going to be much longer and the ups are going to be much shorter  
 and that 's the difference between problems that are additive like co2 which we go slowly up and then we tip  and problems that are depletive in
 which we lose what we have  which oscillate  and they oscillate until we lose everything we 've got  now
 we actually looked at what the answer would be right remember in the campaign one million hybrid
  cars by two thousand and fifteen  that is zero point five percent of the u s oil consumption 
 that is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world 
 that won 't do much difference we looked at an mit study ten million electric cars on the global roads ten million out of
 five hundred million we will add between now and then that is the most pessimistic number you can have it 's also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry
 from one hundred thousand cars is two thousand and eleven to ten million cars by two thousand and sixteen
 one hundred x growth
 in less than five years  
 you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars we have ten million cars by region that 's an enormous amount of cars
  adding those cars india 
 russia brazil  we have all these regions europe has solved it they just put a tax on gasoline they 'll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high  
 china solves it by an edict at some point they 'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city and that will be it  
 the indians don 't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in india fill two or three gallons every time for them to get a battery that goes one hundred and twenty
  miles is an extension on range not a reduction in range we
 're the only ones who don 't have the price set right we don 't have the industry set right we don 't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the u s 
 now where is the car industry on that very interesting the car industry has been focused just on themselves they basically looked at it and said
  miles if you want
  like cellphones you 'll pay for the miles  
 and some of it will go back to the car maker some of it will go back to your own pocket  but our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars you 're looking at a world where cars are matched
 with windmills in denmark we will drive all the cars in denmark
 from windmills not from oil  in israel we 've asked to put a solar farm in the south of israel
  and people said oh that 's a very very large space that you 're asking for and we said what if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years 
 and they said we tried there isn 't any 
 we said no no but what if we prove it and they said well you can dig and we decided to dig up  instead of digging down  
 these are perfect matches
 to one another  now
 all you need is about ten percent of the electricity generated
 think of it as a project that spans over about ten years  that 's one percent a year  
 now when we 're looking at solving big problems we need to start thinking in two numbers and those are not twenty percent by two thousand and twenty 
 the two numbers are zero as in zero footprint or zero oil
 and scale it infinity and
  at the end of this year we can 't stop thinking of padding co2 we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale 
 one car emits four tons and actually seven hundred and change million cars today emit two point eight billion tons of co2 that 's 
 in the additive about twenty five percent of our problem cars and trucks add up to about twenty five percent of the world 's co2 emissions  
 we have to come and attack this problem with a focus with an effort that actually says we 're going to go to zero before
 the world ends  i actually shared that with some legislators here in the u s i shared it with
 with a gentleman called bobby kennedy jr who is one of my idols  i told him one of the reasons that
 his uncle was remembered is because he said we 're going to send a man to the moon and we 'll do it by the end of the decade we didn 't say we 're going to send a man twenty percent to the moon and there will be about a twenty percent chance we 'll recover him
 he actually shared with me another story which is from about two hundred years ago 
 two hundred years ago  in parliament in great britain  there was a long argument
 over economy versus morality twenty five percent just like twenty five percent emissions today comes from cars twenty five percent
 of their energy for the entire industrial world in in the u k came from a source
  of energy that was immoral 
 human slaves  
 and there was an argument 
 should we stop using slaves  and what would it do to our economy and people said well we need to take time to do it 
 let 's not do it immediately  maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves  
 and after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery  and the industrial
  revolution started within less than one year  and the u k had one hundred years of economic
 growth  we have to make the right moral decision we have to make it
 immediately  we need to have presidential leadership just like we had in israel that said we will end oil and we need to do it
 not within twenty years or fifty years but within this presidential term because if we don 't we will lose our economy
 right after we 'd lost our morality
