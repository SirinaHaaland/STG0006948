  i 'd like to apologize first of all to all of you because i have no form of powerpoint presentation
  so what i 'm going to do is every now and again i will make this gesture  and in a moment of powerpoint democracy  you can imagine what you 'd like to
 i do a radio show the radio show is called the infinite monkey cage it 's about science it 's about rationalism so therefore we get a lot of complaints every single week
 complaints including one we get very often  which is to say the very title infinite monkey cage celebrates the idea of
  we have made it quite clear to these people that an infinite monkey cage is roomy 
 laughter we also had someone else who said ' the infinite monkey cage ' idea is ridiculous an infinite number of monkeys could never write the works of shakespeare  
 we know this because they did an experiment 
 yes they gave twelve monkeys a typewriter for a week and after a week they
  the main element though the main complaint we get and one that i find most worrying is that people say oh  why do you insist on ruining the magic  
 you bring in science and it ruins the magic now i 'm an arts graduate i love myth and magic and existentialism and 
  self loathing that 's what i do  
 but i also don 't understand how it does ruin the magic all of the magic i think that may well be taken away by science
 is then replaced by something as wonderful astrology for instance like many rationalists i 'm a pisces now
 astrology we remove the banal idea that your life could be predicted that you 'll perhaps today  meet a lucky man who 's wearing a hat
  that is gone  but if we want to look at the sky and see predictions we still can we can see predictions of galaxies forming of galaxies colliding into each other 
 of new solar systems this is a wonderful thing if the sun could one day and indeed the earth in fact if the earth
  that to me as well that if you think i 'm worried about losing worlds well many worlds theory one of the most beautiful fascinating sometimes terrifying ideas from the quantum interpretation is a wonderful thing 
 that every person here every decision that you 've made today every decision you 've made in your life you 've not really made that decision but in fact
  every single permutation of those decisions is made each one going off into a new universe  that is a wonderful idea 
 if you ever think that your life is rubbish  
 always remember there 's another you that 's made much worse decisions than that 
 if you ever think ah i want to end it all don 't end it all remember that in the majority of universes you don 't even exist in the first place
  this to me in its own strange way
  is very very comforting now reincarnation that 's another thing gone the afterlife but it 's not gone science actually says
 we will live forever
  well there is one proviso
  we won 't actually live forever you won 't live forever your consciousness the you ness of you the me ness of me that that gets this one go  
 but every single thing that makes us
  every atom in us  
 has already created a myriad of different things and will go on to create a myriad of new things we have been mountains and apples and pulsars 
 and other people 's knees who knows maybe one of your atoms was once napoleon 's knee  that is a good thing  unlike the occupants of the universe the universe itself is not wasteful we are
  all totally recyclable  and when we die we don 't even have to be placed in different refuse sacs this is a wonderful thing  
 understanding to me does not remove the wonder and the joy 
 for instance my wife could turn to me and she may say why do you love me 
 and i can with all honesty look her in the eye and say
 matched our olfactory receptors 
 though i 'll probably also say something about her hair and personality as well and
 that that is a wonderful thing there love does not die because of that thing
  pain doesn 't go away either this is a terrible thing  even though i understand pain if someone punches me and because of my personality this is recently a regular occurrence
 i
  understand where the pain comes from it is basically momentum to energy where the four vector is constant that that 's what it is but at no point can i react and go ha 
 is that the best 
  fourth vector constant you 've got no i just spit out a tooth and that is all of these different things the love for my child
 i have a son his name is archie  i 'm very lucky because he 's better than all the other children  
 now i know you don 't think that you may well have your own children and think oh no my child 's best that 's the wonderful thing about evolution the predilection to believe 
 that our child is best  now in many ways that 's just a survival thing the fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes 
  unconditionally love that is a wonderful thing  though i should say that my son is best and is better than your children  i 've
 done some tests  and
 all of these things to me give such joy and excitement and wonder even quantum mechanics can give you an excuse for bad housework for instance  perhaps you
 been at home for a week on your own you house is in a terrible state your partner is about to return you think what should i do do nothing 
 all you have to do is when she walks in using a quantum interpretation say i 'm so sorry  i stopped observing the house for a moment and when i started observing again  
 everything had happened 
 that 's
 the strong
  principle of vacuuming 
 for me it 's a very very important thing  even on my journey up here the joy that i have on my journey up here every single time if you actually think  you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful i 'm sitting on a train every time i breathe in i 'm breathing in a 
 atoms of oxygen  i 'm sitting on a chair even though i know the chair is made of atoms and therefore actually in many ways
  empty space i find it comfortable i look out the window  and i realize that every single time we stop and i look out that window  framed in that window  wherever we are 
 i am observing more life than there is in the rest of the known universe beyond the planet earth  
 if you go to the safari parks on saturn or jupiter  you will be disappointed
 i realize i 'm observing this with the brain the human brain the most complex thing in the known universe that to me is an incredible thing and do you know what that might be enough 
 steven weinberg the nobel laureate 
 once said the more the universe seems comprehensible  the more it seems pointless now for some people that seems to lead to an idea of nihilism  
 but for me it doesn 't that is a wonderful
  i 'm glad the universe is pointless it means if i get to the end of my life the universe can 't turn to me and go what have you been doing you idiot  that 's not the point 
 i can make my own purpose you can make your own purpose we have the individual power to go this is what i want to do and in a pointless universe that to me is a wonderful 
  thing  i have chosen to make silly jokes about quantum mechanics and the copenhagen interpretation you i imagine can do much better things with your time thank you very much goodbye
