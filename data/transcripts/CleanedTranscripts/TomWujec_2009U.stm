  last year at ted we
 aimed to try to clarify the overwhelming complexity and richness that we experience at the conference in a project called big viz and the big viz is 
  a collection of six hundred and fifty sketches that were made by two visual artists david sibbet from the grove
 and kevin richards from autodesk made six hundred and fifty sketches that strive to capture the essence of each presenter 's ideas  
 and the consensus was it really worked these sketches brought to life the key ideas the portraits the magic moments that we all experienced last year 
 this year we were thinking why does it work what is it about animation graphics
  illustrations that create meaning  and this is an important question to ask and answer because
 the more we understand how the brain creates meaning  the better we can communicate and i also think  the better we can think and collaborate together  so this year we 're going to visualize how the brain visualizes  cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain doesn 't actually
 see the world as it is but instead creates a series of mental models through a collection of ah ha
 moments or moments of discovery through various processes the processing of course begins with the eyes light enters hits the back of the retina and is circulated  most of which is 
  streamed to the very back of the brain at the primary visual cortex and primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry just the simplest of shapes but it also acts like a kind of relay station that
  information to many other parts of the brain as many as thirty other parts that selectively make more sense create more meaning through the kind of ah ha experiences we 're only going 
  to talk about three of them  so the first one is called the ventral stream it 's on this side of the brain  and this is the part of the brain that will
  look at a hand look at a
 remote control  chair  book so that 's the part of the brain that is activated when you give a word to something 
 a second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream  and what it does is locates the object in physical body space 
 so if you look around the stage here you 'll create a kind of mental map of the stage
  you closed your eyes you 'd be able to mentally navigate it you 'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that 
 the third part that i 'd like to talk about is the limbic system  and this is deep inside of the brain it 's very old evolutionarily  and it 's the part that feels it 's the kind of
 gut center where you see an image and you go oh i have a strong or
 emotional reaction to whatever i 'm seeing so the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways
  so what can we learn about this how can we apply this insight  
 well again the schematic view is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at the brain processes this in parallel the figments of information asking a whole bunch of questions to create 
 a unified mental model so for example when you look at this image a good graphic invites the eye to
  to selectively create a visual logic so the act of engaging and looking at the image creates the meaning it 's the selective logic 
 now we 've augmented this and spatialized this information many of you may remember the the magic wall that we built in conjunction with perceptive pixel where we quite literally create an infinite 
  wall  and so we can compare and contrast the big ideas  so the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery enriches meaning it activates a different part of the
  brain  
 and then the limbic system is activated when we see motion when we see color and there are primary shapes and pattern detectors that we 've heard about before 
 so the point of this is what we make meaning by seeing by an act of visual interrogation  the lessons for us are
  images to clarify what we 're trying to communicate  secondly make those images interactive so that we engage much more fully  and the third is to augment memory 
  by creating a visual persistence these are techniques that can be used to be that can be applied in a wide range of
  and some of our divisions what we literally do is have the teams draw out the entire strategic plan on one giant wall  and it 's very powerful because everyone gets 
  to see everything else there 's always a room always a place to be able to
  that out 
 so the act of collectively and collaboratively building
 the image transforms
 the collaboration  no powerpoint is used in two days  but instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on 
 and this can be enhanced
  and augmented with
 some emerging digital technology and this is our great unveiling for today  
 and this is an emerging set of technologies that use large screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible 
 here what we can do is look at sustainability quite
  a team can actually look at all the key components that heat the structure and make choices and then see the end result that is visualized on this screen  
 so making images meaningful has three components  the first again is making ideas clear by visualizing them  secondly making them interactive and then thirdly making 
  them persistent and i believe that these three principles can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems that we face in the world today
