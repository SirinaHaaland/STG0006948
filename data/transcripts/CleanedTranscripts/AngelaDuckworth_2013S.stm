  years old i left a very demanding job in management consulting
 for a job that was even more demanding teaching 
 i went to teach seventh graders math in the new york city public schools  and like any teacher  i made
  quizzes and tests i gave out homework assignments when the work came back  i calculated grades 
 what struck me was that iq was not the only difference between my best and my worst students  
 some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric iq scores  some of my smartest kids
 weren 't doing so well  and that got me
  thinking the
 kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math sure they 're hard  ratios decimals the area of a parallelogram  
 but these concepts are not impossible 
 and i was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material
 if they worked hard and
  after several more years of teaching  
 i came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective  from a psychological perspective 
 in education the one thing we know how to measure best is iq 
 but what if doing well in school and in life
 depends on much more than your ability
  to learn quickly and easily  
 so i left the classroom and i went to graduate school to become a psychologist  
 i started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings 
 and in every study my question was who is successful here and why 
 my research
  team and i went to west point military academy we tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out 
 we went to the national spelling bee
 and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition 
 we studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods  asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year 
 and of those who will be the most effective at improving
  learning outcomes for their students we partnered with private companies asking which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs  and who 's going to earn the most money 
 in all those very different contexts one characteristic emerged
 as a significant predictor of success  and it wasn 't social intelligence it wasn 't
  it was grit 
 grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals grit is having stamina 
 grit is sticking with your future day in day out not just for the week not just for the month  but for years 
 and working really hard to make that future a reality 
 grit is living life like it 's a
  marathon not a sprint 
 a few years ago  i started studying grit in the chicago public schools  
 i asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires  and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate  
 turns out that grittier kids were significantly
  more likely to graduate 
 even when i matched them on every characteristic i could measure things like family income  standardized achievement test scores  
 even how safe kids felt when they were at school 
 so it 's not just at west point or the national spelling bee that grit matters 
 it 's also in school especially for kids at risk for dropping out 
 to me the most shocking thing about grit
 is how little we know how little science
  knows about building it 
 every day parents and teachers ask me how do i build grit in kids what do i do to teach kids a solid work ethic 
 how do i keep them motivated for the long run 
 the honest answer is i don 't know 
 laughter what i do know is that talent doesn 't make you gritty
  our data show very clearly
 that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments 
 in fact in our data grit is usually unrelated
 or even inversely related to measures of talent  so far the best idea i 've heard about building grit in kids
 is something called growth mindset this is an idea developed at stanford university by carol dweck  and it is the belief
 that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with your effort dr 
 dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge 
 they 're much more likely to persevere when they fail  because they don 't believe that failure is a permanent condition 
 so growth mindset
  is a great idea for building grit  but we need more 
 and that 's where i 'm going to end my remarks because that 's where we are that 's the work that stands before us we need to take our best ideas our strongest intuitions and we need to test them 
 we need to measure whether we 've been successful and we have to be willing to fail to be wrong to start over again with lessons
  learned in other words  we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier  thank you
