  in the news every day but what is it some places in the world it 's too little food  maybe too much other places gmo is saving the world  
 maybe gmo is the problem 
 too much agricultural runoff creating bad oceans
  toxic oceans attenuation of nutrition  they go on and on 
 and i find the current climate of this discussion incredibly disempowering  so how do we bring that
 to something that we understand  how is this apple food crisis you 've all eaten an apple in the last week
  how old do you think it was from when it was picked  two weeks two months 
 eleven months the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the united states and i don 't expect it to be much different in europe or anywhere else in the world  
 we pick them 
 we put them in cold storage we gas the cold storage there 's actually documented proof of workers trying to go into these environments to retrieve an apple 
 and dying
  the atmosphere that they slow down the process of the apple with is also toxic to humans  
 how is it that none of you knew this why didn 't i know this 
 ninety percent of the quality of that apple all of the antioxidants are gone by the time we get it 
 it 's basically a little ball of sugar  
 how did we get so information poor
 and how can we do better  i think what 's missing
  is a platform 
 i know platforms i know computers they put me on the internet when i was young i did very weird things 
 on this platform  
 but i met people and i could express myself how do you express yourself in food  if we had a platform we might feel empowered
 to question what if for me i questioned
 what if
 climate was democratic  
 so this is a map of climate in the world the most productive areas in green the least productive in red  
 they shift and they change and californian farmers now become mexican farmers  china picks up land in brazil to grow better food and we 're a slave to climate  
 what if each country had its own productive climate what would that change about how we live  what would that change about quality of life and nutrition
 last generation 's problem was we need more food and we need it cheap  
 welcome to your global farm  we built a huge analog farm all these traces these are cars planes trains and automobiles  
 it 's a miracle that we feed seven billion people with just a few of us involved in the production of food  
 what if 
  built a digital farm a digital world farm  what if
 you could take this apple digitize it somehow send it through particles in the air
 and reconstitute it on the other side  what if 
 going through some of these quotes you know they inspire me to do what i do first one [ japanese farming has no youth  no water no land and no future
  what i landed to the day that i went to minamisanriku one stop south of fukushima after the disaster 
 the kids have headed to sendai and tokyo  the land is contaminated they already import seventy percent of their own food but it 's not unique
 to japan  two percent of the american population is involved in farming what good answer comes from two percent of any population
  go around the world  fifty percent of the african population is under eighteen  
 eighty percent don 't want to be farmers farming is hard the life of a small shareholder farmer
 is miserable  they go into the city in india  
 farmers ' families not being able to have basic access to utilities more farmer suicides this year and the previous ten
  before that it 's uncomfortable to talk about where are they going into the city  
 no young people and everyone 's headed in so how do we build this platform that inspires the youth  
 welcome to the new tractor  this is my combine a
 number of years ago now i went to bed bath and beyond and home depot and i started hacking and i built silly things and i made plants dance and i attached them
  my computer and i killed them all a lot laughter
 i eventually got them to survive and i created one of the most intimate relationships i 've ever had in my life because i was learning
 the language of plants  i wanted to make it bigger they said knock yourself out kid  here 's an old electronics room that
  what can you do with my team we built a farm inside of the media lab a place historically known
 not for anything about biology but everything about digital life 
 inside of these sixty square feet  we produced enough food to feed about three hundred people once a month not a lot of food and there 's a lot of interesting technology in there 
 but the most interesting thing 
 beautiful
  and a monthly harvest is this a new cafeteria is this a new
 retail experience is this a new grocery store i can tell you one thing for sure  
 this is the first time anybody in the media lab ripped the roots off of anything 
 we get our salad in bags
  there 's nothing wrong with that  but what happens when you have an image based processing expert a data scientist 
 a roboticist  
 ripping roots off and thinking huh 
 i know something about i could make this happen i want to try 
 in that process we would bring the plants out and we would take some back to the lab because if you grew it you don 't throw it away it 's kind of precious to you 
 i have this weird tongue now because i 'm afraid to let anybody eat anything until i 've eaten it first
  i want it to be good so i eat lettuce every day and i can tell the ph of a lettuce within 1 i 'm
 like no that 's six point one no no you can 't eat it today 
 this lettuce that day was hyper sweet 
 it was hyper sweet because the plant had been stressed and it created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself i 'm not going to die and the plants
 not going to die taste sweet to me  
 technologists falling backwards into plant physiology  so we thought other people needed to be able to try this we want to see what people can create so we conceived of a lab that could be shipped anywhere 
 and then we built it 
 so on the facade of the media lab is my lab that has about thirty points of sensing per plant  if you know about the genome or
  genetics  this is the phenome 
 right the phenomena when you say i like the strawberries from mexico you really like the strawberries from the climate that produced the expression
 that you like  so if you 're coding climate
 this much co2 this much o2 creates a recipe you 're coding the expression of that plant the nutrition of that plant the size of that plant the shape the color
  we need data  so we put a bunch of sensors in there to tell us what 's going on if you think of your houseplants and you look at your houseplant and you 're super sad because you 're like why are you dying won
 't you talk to me 
 farmers develop the most beautiful fortune telling eyes by the time they 're in their late 60s and 70s they can tell you when you see that plant dying that it 's a nitrogen deficiency a calcium deficiency or it needs more humidity
  beautiful eyes are not being passed down 
 these are eyes in the cloud of a farmer we trend those data points over time 
 we correlate those data points to individual plants these are all the broccoli in my lab that day by ip address
  if that 's not weird enough you can click one
 and you get a plant profile and what this tells you is downloadable progress on that plant but not like you 'd think it 's not just when it 's ready  
 when does it achieve the nutrition that i need when does it achieve the taste that i desire 
 is it getting too much water is it getting too much sun  alerts it can talk to me  it 's conversant we have a language
 i think of that as the first user on the plant facebook  
 right that 's a plant profile and that plant will start making friends 
 and i mean it it will make friends with other plants that use less nitrogen more phosphorus
  we 're going to learn about a complexity that we can only guess at now and they may not friend us back i don 't know they might friend us back it depends on how we act so
 this is my lab now  it 's a little bit more systematized my background is designing data centers in hospitals of all things so
 i know a little bit about creating a controlled environment  and so
 inside of this environment  we 're experimenting with all kinds of things
  for mir space station for reducing the amount of water they send into space what it really does is give the plant exactly what it wants water  minerals and oxygen roots are not that complicated so when you give them that 
 you get this amazing expression  
 it 's like the plant has two hearts  and because it has two hearts  
  grows four or five times faster
 it 's a perfect world we 've gone a long way into technology and seed for an adverse world and we 're going to continue to do that but we 're going to have a new tool too 
 which is perfect world  
 so we 've grown all kinds of things these tomatoes hadn 't been in commercial production for one hundred and fifty years 
 do you know that we have rare and ancient seed banks 
 banks of seed  it 's amazing 
  alive and things that you 've never eaten i am the only person in this room that 's eaten that kind of tomato 
 problem is it was a sauce tomato and we don 't know how to cook so we ate a sauce tomato which is not that great but
 we 've done things with protein we 've grown all kinds of things  we 've grown humans 
 well maybe you could but we didn 't 
 but what we realized is the tool was too big it was too expensive i was starting to put them around the world and they were about one hundred thousand dollars finding somebody with one hundred grand in their back
  isn 't easy so we wanted to make a small one
 this project was actually one of my student 's mechanical engineering undergraduate  camille 
 so camille and i and my team  we iterated all summer how to make it cheaper how to make it work better how to make it so other people can make it
 then we dropped them off in schools seventh through eleventh grade and if you want
  don 't trust me actually don 't trust me right  set it to one hundred he sets it to one hundred and what happens it starts to condense make a fog and eventually drip  
 and he says oh 
 humidity is rain  why didn 't you just tell me that
 we 've created an interface for this that 's much like a game  they have a 3d environment they can log into it anywhere in the world on their smartphone on their tablet 
  they have different parts of the bots the physical the sensors they select recipes that have been created by other kids anywhere in the world  
  plant does very well harvest plant and you 've created a new digital recipe  
 it 's an iterative design and development and exploration process  they can download then all of the data about that new plant that they developed or the new digital recipe and what did it do was it was it better or was it worse imagine these as little cores of
 we 're going to learn so much here 's one of the
 food computers as we call them in a school in three weeks ' time this is three weeks of growth but more importantly it was the first time
 that this kid ever thought he could be a farmer
 or that he would want to be a
  go home try to build your first food computer it 's going to be difficult i 'm just telling you we 're in the beginning  but it 's all there  
 it 's very important to me that this is easily accessible we 're going to keep making it more so 
 these are farmers  
 electrical engineer mechanical engineer environmental engineer  computer scientist plant scientist economist  urban planners 
 on one platform doing what they 're good at but we got a little too big
  this is my new facility that i 'm just starting this warehouse could be anywhere 
 that 's why i chose it 
 and inside of this warehouse we 're going to build something kind of like this these exist right now take a look at it 
 these exist too one grows greens one grows ebola vaccine  
 pretty amazing that plants and this darpa grand challenge winner
 is one of the reasons we 're getting ahead of ebola the plants are producing the protein
 that 's ebola resistant  so pharmaceuticals nutraceuticals all they way down to lettuce 
 but these two things look nothing alike and that 's where i am with my field everything is different we
 're in that weird we 're alright
  no i 've got intellectual property that 's totally valuable don 't buy his buy mine and the reality is we 're just at the beginning 
 in a time when society is shifting too when we ask for more cheaper food we 're now asking for
 better  environmentally friendly food and when you have mcdonald 's
 advertising what 's in the chicken mcnugget the most mysterious food item of all time they are now basing their marketing plan on that everything is changing
 so into the world now  personal food computers food servers and food data centers
 run on
 the open phenome think open genome  but we 're going to put little climate recipes like wikipedia that you can pull down  actuate
 and grow 
 what does this look like in a world you remember
  the world connected by strings  we start having beacons  
 we start sending information about food  rather than sending food  this is not just my fantasy  this is where we 're already deploying 
 food computers food servers soon to be food data centers connecting people together to share information  
 the future of food is not about fighting over what 's wrong with this
 we know what 's wrong with this  the future of food is about networking the next one billion farmers
 and empowering them with a platform to ask and answer the question
