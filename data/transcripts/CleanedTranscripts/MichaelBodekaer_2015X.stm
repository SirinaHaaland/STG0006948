  i am going to show you how this tablet and this
  headset that i 'm wearing are going to completely revolutionize science education  
 and i 'm also going to show you how it can make any science teacher more than twice as
  effective  
 but before i show you how all of this is possible let 's talk briefly about why improving the quality of science education is so vitally important 
 if you think about it the world is growing incredibly fast  and with that growth comes a whole list of growing challenges 
 challenges such as dealing with global warming
  starvation and water shortages and curing diseases to name just a few  
 and who exactly is going to help us solve all of these great challenges  
 well to a very last degree it is these young students this is the next generation of young bright scientists and in many
  we all rely on them for coming up with new great innovations to help us solve all these challenges ahead of us  
 and so a couple of years back my cofounder and i were teaching university students just like these only the students we were teaching looked a little bit more like this here 
 and yes this is really the reality out there in way too many universities around the world students that are bored
  disengaged and sometimes not even sure why they 're learning about a topic
 in the first place 
 so we started looking around for new  innovative teaching methods  but what we found was quite disappointing we saw that books were being turned into e books 
 blackboards were being turned into youtube videos and lecture hall monologues were being turned into moocs massive
 online open courses  
 and if you think about it all we 're really doing here is taking the same content and the same format  and bringing it out to more students
 which is great don 't get me wrong that is really great but the teaching method is still more or less the same no
  what we found was that flight simulators had been proven over and over again to be far more effective when used in combination with real in flight training to train the pilots  
 and so we thought to ourselves  
 why not just apply that to science why not build a virtual laboratory simulator  
  we did it we basically set out to create a fully simulated one to one virtual reality laboratory simulator  where the students could perform experiments 
  with mathematical equations that would simulate what would happen in a real world lab  but not just simple simulations we would also create advanced simulations with top universities 
  like mit to bring out cutting edge cancer research to these students 
  dollars by letting the students perform virtual experiments before they go into the real laboratory 
 and not only that now they could also understand even on a molecular level inside the machine what is happening to the machines and then they could suddenly perform
  dangerous experiments in the labs as well for instance also here learning about salmonella bacteria which is an important topic that
  many schools cannot teach for good safety reasons 
 and we of course quiz the students and then give the teachers a full dashboard  so they fully understand where the students are at 
 but we didn 't stop there because we had seen just how important meaning is for the students  ' engagement in the class  so we brought in game designers to create fun and engaging stories for instance here in this case
  students have to solve a mysterious csi murder case using their core science skills  
 and the feedback we got when we launched all of this was quite overwhelmingly positive here we have three hundred students all passionately solving csi murder cases while learning core science skills and
 what i love the most about this is really when when the students come up to
  afterwards  all surprised and a little confused and say i just spent two hours in this virtual lab 
 and and i didn 't check facebook 
 that 's how engaging and immersive this really is for the students and so to investigate whether this really worked a
 learning psychologist did a study with one hundred and sixty students that was from
  university and technical university of denmark  and what they did is split the students into two groups 
 one group would only use the virtual laboratory simulations the other group would only use traditional teaching methods  and they had the same amount of time
  then interestingly they gave the students a
  they could clearly measure the learning impact of the students and what they found was a surprisingly high
 increase in the learning effectiveness when using virtual laboratories over traditional teaching methods  
 but even more interestingly the second part of this study investigated what the teacher 's impact was on the learning and what they found was that when you combined the virtual
  laboratories with teacher led coaching and mentoring  then we saw a total one hundred and one percent increase in the learning effectiveness which
 effectively doubles the science teacher 's impact with the same amount of time spent 
 so a couple of months back we started asking ourselves we have a wonderful team now of learning
  psychologists and teachers and scientists and and game developers and we started asking ourselves how can we keep ourselves to our promise
 of constantly reimagining education  and today  i am really excited to be presenting
 what we came up with and have been working incredibly hard to create i will
 explain briefly what this is basically i take my
  phone most students already have these smartphones and i plug it into this virtual reality headset a low cost headset  
 and now what i can effectively do is i can literally step into this virtual world we 'll have some of you in the audience also get to try this because it is really something that you have to try to fully
 feel how immersive it really is it literally feels like i just stepped inside this virtual lab do you see me up on the screen audience yes 
 michael bodekaer great awesome so basically i have just turned my mobile phone into a fully simulated million dollar ivy league laboratory with all this amazing 
  equipment that i can interact with i can for instance pick up the pipette and do experiments with it i have my e ggel my pcr and oh  look there i have my
  electron microscope i mean who 's carrying around an electron microscope in their pocket
 and here here i have my machine i can do different experiments on the machine and over here i have the door i can go into other experiments
 i can perform in the laboratories and here i have my learning tablet this is an intelligent tablet that allows me to read
  as you can see i can interact with it i can watch videos and
 see content that is relevant to the experiment that i 'm performing right now
 then over here i have marie she is my teacher my lab
 assistant and what she does is guides me through this whole laboratory  and very soon the teachers will be able to literally teleport themselves into this virtual world that i 'm in right now
 and help me guide me through this whole experiment
  before i finalize this i want to show you
 an even cooler thing i think something you cannot even do in real laboratories this is a pcr machine i 'm now going to start this experiment  and what i just did 
 is literally shrunk myself a million times into the size of a molecule and it really feels like it you have to try this  so now it
 feels like i 'm standing inside the machine and i 'm seeing all the dna and i see the molecules i see 
 the polymerase and the enzymes and so forth  and i can see how in this case dna is being replicated millions of times just like it 's happening inside your body right now and i can really feel and understand how all of this works 
 now i hope that gives you a little bit of a sense of the possibilities in these new teaching methods
  and i want to also emphasize that everything you just saw also works on ipads and laptops without the headsets  i say that for a very important reason 
 in order for us to really empower and inspire the next generation of scientists we really need teachers to drive the adoption of new technologies in the classroom  
 and so in many ways
  i believe that the next big quantum leap in science education lies no longer with the technology 
 but rather with the teachers ' decision to push forward and adopt these technologies
 inside the classrooms  and so it is our hope that more universities and schools and teachers will collaborate with technology companies to realize this full potential
  and so 
 lastly  i 'd like to leave you with a little story that really inspires me  and that is the story of jack andraka 
 some of you might already know him  jack invented a new  groundbreaking 
 test for pancreatic cancer
 at the age fifteen  and when jack shares his story of how he did this huge breakthrough he also
  explains that one thing almost prevented him from making this breakthrough  
 and that was that he did not have access to real laboratories  because he was too inexperienced
 to be allowed in now imagine if we could bring ivy league 
 virtual laboratories out to all these students just like jack all over the world
  and give them the latest greatest most fancy machines you can imagine that would quite literally make any scientist in here jump up and down out of pure excitement  and then imagine how
  that would empower and inspire a whole new generation of young and bright scientists  ready to innovate and change the world
