  bill lange i 'm dave gallo and we 're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video  we 've got some of the most incredible video of titanic
 that 's ever been seen and we 're not going to show you any of it
  truth of the matter is that the titanic even though it 's breaking all sorts of box office records it 's not the most exciting
 story from the sea and the problem i think is that
 we take the ocean for granted when you think about it the oceans are seventy five percent of the planet most of the planet is ocean water  
 the average depth is about two miles part of the problem i think is we stand at the beach or we see images like this of the ocean  
 and you look out at this great big blue expanse and
  it 's shimmering and it 's moving and there 's waves and there 's surf and there 's tides but you have no idea for what lies in there and in the oceans there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet most of the animals are in the oceans 
 most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea at the bottom of the sea  the biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher in places than it  is in the rainforests  it 's mostly unexplored and yet there
  beautiful sights like this that captivate us and make make us become familiar with it but when you 're standing at the beach i want you to think that you 're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world  we have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world  we use the submarine alvin and we use cameras  
 and the cameras are something that bill lange has
 developed with the help of sony marcel proust said the true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having
  people that have partnered with us have given us new eyes not only on what exists the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea
 but also how we think about life on the planet itself here 's a jelly it 's one of my favorites because it 's got all sorts of working parts this turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans  it gets up to about one hundred and fifty feet long 
 but see all those different working things i love that kind of stuff it 's got these fishing lures on the bottom they 're going up and down it 's got tentacles dangling swirling
  around like that it 's a colonial animal these are all individual animals banding together to make this one creature and it 's got these jet thrusters up in front
 that it 'll use in a moment and a little light 
 if you take all the big fish and and schooling fish and all that put them on one side of the scale put all the jelly type of animals on the other side those guys win hands down 
 most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this here 's the
  use the lights for attracting mates and attracting prey and communicating we couldn 't begin to show you our archival
 stuff from the jellies they come in all different sizes and shapes bill lange we tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average and that we 're real familiar with the animals that are in the first two hundred or three hundred feet
  but we 're not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom and these are the types of animals that live in that three dimensional space that micro gravity environment that we really haven 't explored 
 you hear about giant squid and things like that but some of these animals get up to be approximately one hundred and forty one hundred and sixty feet long they 're very little understood dg this is one of them another 
  one of our favorites because it 's a little octopod you can actually see through his head and here he is flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up we see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths
 they go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet  they come right up to the submarine they 'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub  this is really a world within a world and we 're going to show you two in this case we 're passing down through the  mid ocean and we see creatures like this this is
 kind of like an undersea rooster  this guy that looks incredibly formal in a way  
 and then one of my favorites  what a face
  this is basically scientific data that you 're looking at it 's footage that we 've collected for scientific purposes and that 's one of the things that bill 's been doing is providing scientists with this first view
 of animals like this in the world where they belong they don 't catch them in a net they 're actually looking at them down in that
 world we 're going to take a joystick sit in front of our computer on the earth and press the joystick forward 
 and fly around the planet we 're going to look at the mid ocean ridge 
  long mountain range  
 the average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half and we 're over the atlantic that 's the ridge right there but we 're going to go across the caribbean central america  and end up against the pacific  nine degrees north we make 
  maps of these mountain ranges with sound with sonar and this is one of those mountain ranges we 're coming around a cliff here on the right
  out there that haven 't been mapped yet  this is a volcanic ridge we 're getting down further and further in scale and eventually we can come up with something like this this is an icon of our robot  
 jason it 's called  
 and you can sit in a room like this with a joystick and a headset and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time 
 one of the things we 're trying to do at woods hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world this world this unexplored region
 back to the laboratory because we see it in bits and pieces right now we see it either as sound or we see it as video
  we see it as photographs or we see it as chemical sensors  but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture  here 's where bill 's cameras really do shine  
 this is what 's called a hydrothermal vent and what you 're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed 
  water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor gets up to six hundred seven
  somewhere in that range so that 's all water under the sea a mile and a half two miles three miles down  and we knew it was volcanic back in the 
 and then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it because if you 've got volcanism water 's going to get down
 from the sea into cracks in the sea floor come in contact with magma and come shooting out hot 
 we weren 't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides hydrogen sulfides we didn 't have any idea
 about these things which we call chimneys this
  one of these hydrothermal vents six hundred degree f water coming out of the earth 
 on either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the alps so the setting here is very dramatic bl the white material is is a type of bacteria that thrives at one hundred and eighty degrees c dg 
 i think that 's one of the greatest stories right now that we 're seeing from the bottom of the sea is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria  
 and we started to wonder for
  long time how did it all get down there what we find out now is that it 's probably coming from inside the earth not only is it coming out of the earth so biogenesis made from volcanic activity
 but that bacteria supports these colonies of life
  the pressure here is four thousand pounds per square inch a mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles no sun has ever gotten down here
  all the energy to support these life forms is coming from inside the earth
 so chemosynthesis 
 and you can see how dense the population is these are called tube worms bl these worms have no digestive system they have no mouth 
 but they have two types of gill structures one for extracting oxygen out of the deep sea water  another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria 
 which takes the
 hydrothermal fluid that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom and converts that
  into simple sugars that the tube worm can
 digest dg you can see here 's a crab that lives down there he 's managed to grab a tip of these worms now they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them oh good going
  so as soon as a crab touches them they retract down into their shells just like your fingernails there 's a whole story being played out here that we 're just now beginning to have some idea of because of this
  these worms live in a real temperature extreme 
 their foot is at about two hundred degrees c and their head is out at three degrees c so it 's like having having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water that 's how they like to live 
 dg this is a
 female of this kind of worm and here 's a male  you watch it doesn 't take long before two guys here this one and one that will show up over here start to fight
  see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea there are never any lights there except the lights that we bring  here they go
  on one of the last dive series we counted two hundred species in these areas one hundred and ninety eight were new new species bl one of the big problems is that for the biologists working at these sites 
 it 's rather difficult to collect these animals and they disintegrate on the way up so the imagery is is critical for the science dg two octopods at about
 two miles depth this pressure thing really amazes me that these animals can exist there at a depth with pressure enough to crush the titanic like an empty pepsi can 
 what we saw up till now was from the pacific this is from the atlantic even greater depth you
 can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here and he 'll bat it away with his claw whack 
 and the same thing 's going on over here  what they 're getting at is that on the back of this crab the foodstuff here
  very strange bacteria that lives on the backs of all these animals and what these shrimp are trying to do is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals and the crabs don 't like it at all 
 these long filaments that you see on the back of the crab are actually created by the product of that bacteria so the bacteria grows hair on the crab on the back you see this again the red dot is the laser light of the submarine alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are
 from the vents
  those are all shrimp  you see the hot water over here  here and here coming out they 're clinging to a rock face
 and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face  
 here 's a tiny little vent that 's come out of the side of
 that pillar those pillars get up to several stories  so here you 've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes inhabited by these
  very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground they don 't need the sun
 at all bl you see this white  v shaped mark on the back of the shrimp it
 's actually a light sensing organ it 's how they find the hydrothermal vents the vents are emitting a black body radiation an ir signature and so they 're able to to find these vents at considerable
  all this stuff is happening along that 40 000 mile long mountain range that we 're calling the ribbon of life because just even today as we speak there 's life being generated there from volcanic activity 
 this is the first time we 've ever tried this any place we 're going to try to show you high definition from the pacific  
 we 're moving up one of these pillars this one 's several stories tall  in it you 'll see that it 's a habitat for a lot of different animals there 's a funny kind of hot plate here with
 vent water coming out of it so all of these are individual homes for worms
  a closer view of that community  
 here 's crabs here worms here  there are smaller animals crawling around here 's pagoda structures  i think this is the neatest looking thing i just can 't get over this that you 've got these little chimneys
 sitting here smoking away this stuff is toxic as hell by the way you could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean and it 's coming out all from
  it 's unbelievable it 's basically sulfuric acid and it 's being just dumped out at incredible rates  
 and animals are thriving and we probably came from here that 's probably where we evolved from bl this bacteria that we 've been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found
 there are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites  although the vent sites
  an individual site may last only ten years or so
 as an ecosystem they 've been stable for for millions well billions of years dg 
 it works too well  you see there 're some fish inside here as well there 's a fish sitting here here 's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm waiting for that worm to stick his head out bl 
 the biologists right now cannot explain why these animals are so active the worms are growing inches per week
  perspective is toxic as hell  not only that but on top the lifeblood that plumbing system turns off every year or so their plumbing system turns off so the sites have to move  and 
  then there 's earthquakes and then volcanic eruptions on the order of one every five years that completely wipes the area out
