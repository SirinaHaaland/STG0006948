  to make a challenge to people i know there have been many challenges made to people the one i 'm going to make is that it is time for us to reclaim what peace
  is not
 the dove and the rainbow as lovely as they are  
 when i see the symbols of the rainbow and the dove  i think of personal serenity  
 i think of meditation  
 i do not think
 about what i consider to be peace which is sustainable peace with justice and equality
  it is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet
 have access to enough resources to live dignified lives 
 where these people have enough access to education
 and health care so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear
 this is called human security  
 and i am not a complete pacifist like some of my really really 
  non violent friends like mairead mcguire  i understand that humans are so messed up to use
  i 'm trying harder and harder mom i 'm really trying  
 we need a little bit of police we need a little bit of military but for defense  
 we need to redefine what makes us secure in this world  it is not arming our country to
  other countries to arm themselves to the teeth with the weapons that we produce and we sell them  
 it is using that money more rationally to make the countries of the world secure to make the people of the world secure  
 i was thinking about
  the recent ongoings in congress where
 the president is offering eight point four billion dollars to try to get the start vote  i certainly support the start vote 
 but he 's offering eighty four billion dollars for the for the modernizing
 of nuclear weapons do
 you know the figure that the u n talks about for fulfilling the millennium development goals is eighty
 billion
  dollars 
 just that little bit of money which to me i wish it was in my bank account it 's not 
 but in global terms it 's a little bit of money  
 but it 's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime unless we get up off our 
 and take action to make it happen
  unless we begin to believe that all of the things that we 've been hearing about in these last two days
 are elements of what come together to make human security  it is saving the tigers  it is
 stopping the tar sands  it is
 having access to medical equipment that can actually tell who does have
  cancer  it is all of those things  it is using our money for all of those things  it is about action  
 i was in hiroshima a couple of weeks ago and his holiness
 we 're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city and there were about eight of us nobel laureates and
 he 's a bad guy he 's like a bad kid in church we 're staring at everybody waiting our turn to speak and he leans over to
  me and he says jody i 'm a buddhist monk 
 i said yes  your holiness  your robe gives it away 
 he said you know that i kind of like meditation and i pray i said 
 that 's good that 's good  we need that in the world  i don 't follow that but that 's cool
 but i have become skeptical  i do not believe
 that meditation
 and prayer will change this world  
 i think what we need is action his holiness in his robes is my new action hero  
 i spoke with aung sun suu kyi a couple of days ago as most of you know
  's a hero for democracy in her country burma you probably also know that she has spent fifteen of the last twenty years imprisoned
 for her efforts to bring about democracy  
 she was just released a couple of weeks ago and we 're very concerned to see how long she will be free because she is already out in the streets in rangoon agitating for change  she is already out in the streets working
  with the party to try to rebuild it but i talked to her for a range of issues but one thing that i want to say because it 's
 similar to what his holiness said  
 she said you know we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country  but i don 't believe in hope
  i don 't believe in the hope of change  unless we take action to make it so 
 here 's another woman hero of mine she 's my friend
 dr shirin ebadi the first muslim woman to receive the nobel peace prize  she has been in exile for the last year and a half you ask her 
 where she lives where does she live in exile she says the airports of the world  
  traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections  
 and instead of going home she conferred with all the other women that she works with who said to her stay out we need you out we need to be able to talk to you out there so that you can give the message of what 's happening here 
 a year and a half she 's out speaking on behalf of the other women in her country
  wangari maathai
 two thousand and four peace laureate they call her the tree lady but she 's more than the tree lady  
 working for peace is very creative 
 it 's hard work every day  when she was planting those trees i don 't think most people understand that at the same
  she was using the action of getting people together to plant those trees to talk about how to overcome the authoritarian government in her country 
 people could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail  but if they were together planting trees for the environment 
 it was okay
 creativity  
 but it 's not just iconic women like shirin
 like aung sun suu kyi like wangari maathai it is other women in the world who are also struggling together
 to change this world the women 's league of burma  eleven individual organizations of burmese women came together because there 's strength in numbers working together 
 is what changes our world the million signatures campaign of women inside burma
  working together to change human rights to bring democracy to that country  when one is arrested and taken to prison another one comes out and joins the movement  
 recognizing that if they work together they will ultimately bring change in their own country  
 mairead mcguire in the middle betty
  the quick story 
 an ira driver was shot and his car plowed into people on the side of the street 
 there was a mother and three children the children were killed on the spot it was mairead 's sister 
 instead of giving in to grief depression defeat
 in the face of that violence
  hooked up with betty
 a staunch protestant and a staunch catholic
 and they took to the streets to say no more violence 
 and they were able to get tens of thousands of primarily women some men in the streets
 to bring about change  
 and they have been part of what brought peace to northern ireland and they 're still working on it because there 's still a lot more to do 
 this is rigoberta
  menchu tum she also received the peace prize  she is now running for president she is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be
 a democracy about how you bring democracy to the country about educating about how to vote but that democracy is not just about voting it 's about being an active citizen 
 one of the things that made this campaign work is because we grew from two ngos
 to thousands in ninety countries around the world working together in common cause to ban landmines  
 some of the people who worked in our campaign could only work maybe an hour a month they could maybe volunteer that much there were others like myself who were
  actions together of all of us that brought about that change 
 in my view what we need today is people getting up and taking action to reclaim the meaning of peace it 's not a dirty word  it 
  's hard work every single day  and if each of us who cares about the different things we care about
  time as we could  we would change this world  we would save this world and we can 't wait for the other guy we have to do it ourselves thank you
