  probably america 's most widely read children 's author in fact and
 i always tell people that i don 't want to show up looking like a scientist you can have me as a farmer or in leathers and no one has ever chose farmer
  farmer  
 i 'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies 
 and you know an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace you 've just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany 
 that 's a painting of a circle a friend of mine did that richard bollingbroke it 's
 the kind of complicated circle that i 'm going to tell you about my circle began back in the
  high school in stow ohio
 where i was the class queer i was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys ' room until one teacher
 saved my life  she saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers ' lounge she did it in secret  she did it for three years and i had to get out of town  
  thumb i had eighty five dollars and i ended up in san francisco california
 met a lover
 and back in the ' 80s found it necessary to begin work on aids organizations about
 three or four years ago i got a phone call in the middle of the night from that
  i need to see you i 'm disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults  could you please come to ohio 
 and please bring that man that i know you have found by now  
 and i should mention
 that i have pancreatic cancer  and i 'd like you to please
 be quick about this well the next day we were in cleveland
  we took a look at her we laughed we cried and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice we found her one we got her there  
 and we took care of her and watched over her family because it was necessary it 's something we knew how to do 
 and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult
  got to know me she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands and what had happened
 was the circle had closed it had become a circle
 and that epiphany i talked about presented itself the
 epiphany is that death is a part of life she saved my life 
 i and my partner saved hers  
 and you know that
  of life needs everything that the rest of life does it needs truth and beauty and i 'm so happy it 's been mentioned so much here today 
 it also needs
 it needs dignity love and pleasure and it 's our job to hand those things out thank you
