  let 's talk dirty 
 a few years ago  oddly enough i needed the bathroom  and i found one a public
  went into the stall and i prepared to do what i 'd done most of my life  use the toilet  flush the toilet  forget about the toilet  
 and for some reason that day  instead i asked myself a question  and it was where does this stuff go 
 and with that question  i found myself plunged
 into the world
 of
  and i have yet to emerge  
 and that 's because it 's such an enraging  yet engaging place to be to go back to that toilet it
 wasn 't a particularly fancy toilet it wasn 't as nice as this one from the world
  but it had a lockable door it had privacy it had water it had soap so i could wash my hands  and i did because i 'm a woman  and we do that 
 but that day  when i asked that question i learned something and that was that i 'd grown up thinking that a toilet like that was my right 
 when in fact it 's a privilege
  privilege  two point five billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet  
 they don 't have a bucket or a box forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet  
 and they have to do what this little boy is doing by the side of the mumbai airport expressway  
  and he does that every day  and every day probably that guy in the picture walks on by  because he sees that little boy but he doesn 't see him  
 but he should  because the problem with all that poop lying around
 is that poop carries passengers fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit all those things the eggs
  cysts the bacteria the viruses all those can travel in one gram of human feces 
 how well that little boy will not have washed his hands he 's barefoot he 'll run back into his house  
 and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying
 by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet
  in what i call the 
  world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in the most common symptoms associated with those diseases diarrhea is now a bit of a joke  it 's
 the runs  the hershey squirts  the squits where i come from we call it delhi belly as a legacy of empire  
 but if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a in a leading photo
  photo image agency this is the picture that you come up with 
 still not sure about the bikini  
 and here 's another image of diarrhea this is marie saylee nine months old 
 you can 't see her  because she 's buried under that green grass in a little village in
  because she died in three days from diarrhea
 the hershey squirts  the runs a joke  and that 's her dad 
 but she wasn 't alone that day because four thousand other children died of diarrhea and they do every day  
 diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide  
 and you 've probably been asked to care about things like hiv aids or t b or measles
  diarrhea kills more children than all those three things put together it 's a very potent weapon of mass destruction  
 and the cost to the world is immense  two hundred and sixty billion dollars lost every year on the on the losses to poor sanitation 
 these are cholera beds in haiti you 'll have heard of
  we don 't hear about diarrhea it gets a fraction of the attention and funding given to any of those other diseases  
 but we know how to fix this 
 we know because in the mid 19th century
  wonderful victorian engineers installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment and the flush toilet  
 and disease dropped dramatically  child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history the flush toilet was
  voted the best medical advance of the last two hundred years by the readers of the british medical journal  and they were choosing over the pill  anesthesia and surgery  
 it 's a wonderful waste disposal device  but i think that it 's so good it doesn 't smell we can put it in our house we can lock it behind a door
 and i think we 've locked it out of conversation
  have a neutral word for it poop 's not particularly adequate shit offends people feces is too medical 
 because i can 't explain otherwise when i look at the figures what 's going on 
 we know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation  but if you look at the budgets of countries developing and developed 
 you 'll think there 's something wrong with the math  because
 you 'll expect absurdities like pakistan spending forty seven times more on its
  military than it does on water and sanitation  even though one hundred and fifty thousand children die of diarrhea in pakistan every year  
 but then you look at that already minuscule water and sanitation budget 
 and seventy five to ninety percent of it will go on clean water supply  which is great  we all need water no one 's going to refuse clean water  but the humble
  or flush toilet  reduces disease by twice as much as just putting in clean water 
 think about it that little boy who 's running back into his house  he may have a nice clean fresh water supply but he 's got dirty hands that he 's going to contaminate his water supply with  
 and i think that the real waste of human waste is that we are wasting it as a resource and as an incredible trigger
 for development 
 because these are a few things that toilets and poop itself can do for us 
 so a toilet can put a girl back in school twenty five percent of girls in india drop out of school because they have no adequate sanitation  
 they 've been used to sitting through lessons for years and years holding it in we 've all done that but they do it every day  
 and when they hit puberty and they start menstruating it just gets too much  and i understand that who can
  blame them 
 so if you met an educationalist and said i can improve education attendance rates by twenty five percent with just one simple thing you 'd
 make a lot of friends in education that
 's not the only thing it can do for you poop can cook your dinner  
 it 's got nutrients in it  we ingest nutrients we excrete nutrients as well we don 't keep them all in rwanda
  now getting seventy five percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system
 from the contents of prisoners ' bowels 
 so these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in butare  
 they 're genocidal inmates most of them and they 're stirring the contents of their own latrines because if you put poop in a sealed environment in a tank
  pretty much like a stomach then pretty much like a stomach  it gives off gas  and you can cook with it  
 and you might think it 's just good karma to see these guys stirring shit  but
 it 's also good economic sense because they 're saving a million dollars a year they 're cutting down on deforestation  and they 've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible infinite and free at the point of production
  it 's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives here 's a woman who 's about to get a dose of the brown stuff in those syringes which is what you think it is 
 except not quite because it 's actually donated there is now a new career path called stool donor it 's like the new sperm donor  
 because she has been suffering from a superbug called c diff  and it 's resistant to antibiotics in many cases she 's been suffering for years 
 she gets a dose of healthy human feces 
 and the cure rate
  this procedure is ninety four percent it 's astonishing  but hardly anyone is still doing it  
 maybe it 's the ick factor 
 that 's okay because there 's a team of research scientists in canada who have now created a stool sample a fake stool sample which is called repoopulate 
 so you 'd be thinking by now okay the solution 's simple
  we give everyone a toilet and this is where it gets really interesting  because it 's not that simple because we are not simple  so
 the really interesting exciting work this is the engaging bit in sanitation is that we need to understand human psychology we need to understand software as well as just giving someone hardware  
 they 've found in many developing countries that governments have gone in and given out free latrines and gone back a few years later and found that they 've got lots of new goat sheds or temples
 or spare rooms
 with their owners happily walking past them and going over to the open defecating ground  
 so the idea is to manipulate human emotion it 's been done for decades the soap companies did it in the early 20th century  
 they tried selling soap as healthy no one bought it they tried selling selling it as sexy
  everyone bought it in india now there 's a campaign which persuades
 young brides not to marry into families that don 't have a toilet  it 's called no loo  no i do 
 and in case you think that poster 's just propaganda here 's priyanka twenty three years old i met her last october in india  
 and she grew up in a conservative environment she grew up in a rural village in a poor area of india  and she was engaged at fourteen and then at
 twenty one or so she moved into her in law 's house  and she was horrified to get there and find that they didn 't have a toilet  she 'd grown up with a latrine it was no big deal but it was a latrine  
 and the first night she was there she was told that at four o 'clock in the morning her mother in law got her up told her to go outside and go and do it in the dark in the open  
 and she was scared she was scared of drunks
  she was scared of snakes she was scared of rape  after three days she did an unthinkable thing  she left 
 and if you know anything about rural india you 'll know that 's an unspeakably courageous thing to do 
 but not just that she got her toilet  
 and now she goes around all the other villages in india persuading other women to do the same thing it 's what i call social contagion and it 's really powerful and really exciting 
 another version of this another village in india near where priyanka lives
  this village called lakara and about
 a year ago it had no toilets whatsoever kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera 
 some visitors came using various behavioral change tricks like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit and watching the flies go one to the other
  somehow people who 'd been thinking that what they were doing was not disgusting at all
  not only that but they were ingesting their neighbors ' shit that 's what really made them change their behavior  so this woman  this boy 's mother
 installed this latrine in a few hours her entire life she 'd been using the banana field behind but she installed the latrine in a few hours it cost nothing it 's going to save that boy 's life  
 so when i get despondent about the state of sanitation  even though these are pretty exciting times because we 've got the bill and melinda gates foundation reinventing the toilet which is great
 we 've got matt damon going on bathroom strike  which is great for humanity very bad for his colon
 but there are things to worry about it 's the most  off track millennium development goal  it 's about fifty or so years off track we 're not going to meet targets  providing people with sanitation at this rate 
 so when i get sad about
  i think of japan  because japan seventy years ago was a nation of people who used pit latrines and wiped with sticks
  and now it 's a nation of what are called woshurettos washlet toilets 
 they have in built bidet nozzles for a lovely hands free cleaning experience
  and they have various other features like a heated seat and an automatic lid raising device which is known as the
  japan which i find so inspirational is they 've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door they 've made it conversational people go out and upgrade their toilet
  they talk about it they 've sanitized it 
 i hope that we can do that it 's not a difficult thing to do all we really need to do
 is look at this issue as the urgent
 issue that it is and don 't think that it 's just in the poor world that things are wrong our sewers are crumbling things are going wrong here too  
 the solution to all of this is pretty easy i 'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon and just ask you to do one thing  and that 's to go out 
 protest  speak about the unspeakable and talk shit  thank you
