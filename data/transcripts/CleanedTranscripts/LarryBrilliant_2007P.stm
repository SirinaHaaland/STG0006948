  i 'm going to try to give you
 a view of the world as i see it  the problems and the opportunities that we face  and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or
  let you in on a secret which is why i am an incurable optimist  let me start off
 showing you an al gore movie that you may have seen before now you 've all seen inconvenient
 truth this is a little more inconvenient man 
 extremely dangerous questions because with our present
  we have no idea what would happen 
 even now  man may be unwittingly changing the world 's climate through the waste products of his civilization 
 due to our release through factories and automobiles every year of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide which helps air absorb heat from the sun
 our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer  this is bad well
 it 's been calculated a few degrees ' rise in the earth 's temperature would melt the polar ice caps
 and if this happens an inland sea would fill a good portion of the mississippi valley  
 tourists in glass bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of miami through one hundred and fifty feet of tropical
  not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety than even the atomic physicist encounters  
 but with life itself larry brilliant should we feel good or should we feel bad
 that fifty years of foreknowledge accomplished so little well it depends really on
 what your goals are  and i think  as my goals i always go back to gandhi 's talisman
  mahatma gandhi was asked how do you know if the next act that you are about to do
 is the right one or the wrong one 
 he said consider the face of the poorest most vulnerable human being
 that you ever chanced upon  and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that
  person  and if it will be it 's the right thing to do and if not rethink it 
 for those of us in this room it 's not just the poorest
 and the most vulnerable individual  it 's the community  it 's the culture  it 's the world itself and the trends
 the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society who are the poorest and the most vulnerable
 the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism  
 but there 's also a wonderful case for optimism let 's review them both  
 first of all the megatrends 
 there 's two degrees or three degrees of climate change baked into the system  
 it will cause rising seas  it will cause
 saline
 deposited into wells and into lands  it will disproportionately harm the poorest
 and the most vulnerable as will the increasing
 rise of population even though we 've dodged paul ehrlich 's population bomb and we will not see twenty billion people
  in this decade as he had forecast we eat as if we were twenty billion  and we consume so much
 that again a rise of six point five billion to nine point five billion in our grandchildren 's lifetime
 will disproportionately hurt the poorest
 and the most vulnerable that 's why they migrate to cities that 's why in june of this year we passed as a species
 fifty one percent of us
 living in cities and bustees and slums  and shantytowns  
 the rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did the green revolution never reached africa 
 and with desertification  sandstorms the gobi desert the
  we are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare
 to produce as many calories as it did even fifteen years ago  
 so humans are turning more towards animal consumption in africa last year africans ate
 six hundred million wild animals and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat and every kilogram of bush meat
 contained hundreds
  of thousands of novel viruses that have never been charted  the genomic sequences of which we don 't know their fitness
 for creating pandemics
 we are unaware of but we are ripe for
 most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth  but it has a dark side
  one percent of us own forty percent of all the goods and services  what will happen
 if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day
  rise to three billion in the next thirty years 
 the one percent will own even more than forty percent of all the world 's goods and services not because they 've grown richer  
 but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer 
 last week bill clinton
  's lots of reason for pessimism  darfur is at its origin a resource war 
 last year there were eighty five thousand
 riots in china two hundred and thirty a day that required police or military intervention most of them were about resources
  we are facing an unprecedented number scale of disasters some are 
 related epidemics  and the newly emerging diseases may make
  and bird flu a quaint forerunner of things to come  it 's a destabilized world
  and unlike destabilized world in the past it will be broadcast to you on youtube 
 you will see it on digital television and on your cell phones
  what will that lead to for some it will lead to anger  religious and sectarian violence
 and terrorism for others
  where does it take us as social activists and entrepreneurs  as we look at these trends do we become despondent 
 or will we become energized let 's look at one case the case of bangladesh
  carbon dioxide emissions stopped today global warming would continue  and even with global warming
 if you can see these blue lines  the dotted line shows that even if
 emissions
 of greenhouse gasses stopped today  the next decades will see rising sea levels a minimum
 of twenty to thirty inches
 of increase in sea levels
 is the best case that we can hope for and it could be ten times that 
 what will that do to bangladesh let 's take a look 
 so here 's bangladesh  seventy percent of bangladesh
 is at less than five feet above sea level
  's go up and take a look at the himalayas and we 'll watch as
 global warming makes them melt more water comes down the deforested areas here in the tarai 
 will be unable to absorb the effluent because trees are like straws
 that suck up the extra seasonal water  now we 're looking down south through the kali gandaki many of you i think have probably trekked here
  and we 're going to cruise down and take a look
 at bangladesh and see what the impact will be of twin
 increases in water coming from the north  and in the seas rising
 from the south  looking at the five major rivers
 that feed bangladesh and now let 's look from the south  looking up and let 's see this in
  relief a
 minimum of twenty to forty inches of
 increase in seas  coupled with increasing flows
 from the himalayas  and take a look at this 
 as many as one hundred million refugees from bangladesh could be expected to migrate
 into india and into china this is
 the difficulty that one country faces  but if you look at the globe all around
 the earth  wherever there is low lying area  populated areas near the
  you will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life sub saharan africa  and even our own san francisco
 bay area  we 're all in this together 
 this is not something that happens far away to people that we don 't know global warming is something
 that happens to all of us all at once 
  as are these newly emerging communicable diseases  
 names that you hadn 't heard twenty years ago ebola lhasa fever monkey pox with the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans  
 we live in each other 's viral environment 
 do you remember twenty years ago no one had ever heard of west nile fever and then we watched as
 one case arrived on the east coast of the united states and it marched every year  westwardly do you remember
  one had heard of ebola until we heard of hundreds of people dying in central africa from it  
 it 's just the beginning unfortunately there have been thirty novel
 emerging communicable diseases
 that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last thirty years it 's more than enough reason for pessimism
 but now let 's look at the case for optimism 
 enough of the bad news  
 human beings have always risen to the challenge you just need to look at the list of nobel laureates to remind ourselves 
 we 've been here before  paralyzed by fear  
  when some probably one of you in this room
 jumped into the breach and created an organization like physicians for social responsibility  which fought against
 the nuclear threat 
 medicins sans frontieres 
 that renewed our commitment to disaster relief  mohamed elbaradei  and the tremendous hope and optimism that he brought all of us and our own
 muhammad yunus
  we 've seen the eradication of smallpox  
 we may see the eradication of polio this year  last year there were only two thousand cases in the world  
 we may see the eradication of guinea worm
 next year
 there are only thirty five thousand cases left in the world  twenty years ago  there were three and a half
  we 've seen a new disease not like
 the thirty novel
 emerging communicable diseases this disease is called sudden wealth syndrome 
 it 's an amazing phenomenon 
 all throughout the technology world we 're seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome  
 but they 're using their wealth
 in a way that their forefathers never did
  they 're not waiting until they die to create foundations 
 they 're actively guiding their money their resources their hearts their commitments to make the world a better place  
 certainly nothing can give you more optimism
 than that more reasons to be optimistic in the ' 60s and i am a creature of the
  there was a movement  we all felt that we were part of it that a better world was right around the corner that we were watching the birth
 of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice 
 today there 's another kind of movement  it 's a movement to save the earth  it 's just beginning 
 five weeks ago a group of activists from the business community
 gathered together to stop a texas utility
  from building nine coal fired electrical plants
 that would have contributed to destroying the environment  six months ago  a group of business activists
 gathered together to join with the republican governor in california to pass ab thirty two the most far reaching legislation
 in environmental history al gore
 made presentations in the house and the senate
 as an expert witness can you imagine we 're seeing an entente cordiale
 between science and religion that five years ago i would not have believed as the evangelical community
 has understood the desperate situation of
  warming  and now four thousand churches have joined the environmental movement it is something to be greatly optimistic about 
 the european 
  plan is an amazing breakthrough something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon
  there will be step up day  where there will be a thousand individual mobilized social activist movements in the united states on protest
 against legislation
 pushing for legislation to stop global warming and on july 7th around the world i learned only yesterday there will be global live
  and you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air now that doesn 't mean that people understand
 that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most 
 that means that people are beginning the first step which is acting out of their own self interest 
 but i am seeing in the major funders in care rockefeller rockefeller brothers
 fund  hewlett mercy corps you guys
  so many other organizations 
 a beginning of understanding that we need to work not just on primary prevention of global warming  
 but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming
 on the poorest and the most vulnerable  but for me i have another reason
 to be an incurable optimist  and you 've heard so many inspiring
  stories here  and i heard so many last night
 that i thought i would share a little bit of mine 
 my background is not exactly conventional medical training  
 and i lived in a himalayan monastery  and i studied with a very wise teacher  who kicked me out of the
 monastery one day and told me
  it was my destiny it felt like yoda it is your destiny
 to go to work for  who and to help eradicate smallpox  at a time when there was no smallpox program  
 it should make you optimistic
 that smallpox no longer exists because it was the worst disease in history  in the last century
 that 's the one that was seven years ago
 half a billion people died from smallpox  more than all the
  wars in history  more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world in the summer of love 
 two million people children died of smallpox  it 's not ancient history  when you read the biblical plague
  of boils that was smallpox  
 pharaoh ramses the fifth whose picture is here  died of smallpox to eradicate smallpox  
 we had to gather the largest united nations army in history  we visited every house in india searching for smallpox
 one hundred and twenty million houses  once every month for nearly two years 
 in a cruel reversal after we had almost conquered smallpox and this is what you must learn
 as a social entrepreneur the realm of the final inch when we had almost eradicated smallpox  it came back again  
 because the company town of tatanagar drew laborers  who could come there and get employment  
 and they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox 
  they went home to die and when they did they took smallpox to ten other countries
 and reignited the epidemic and we had to start all over again  
 but in the end  we succeeded and the last case of smallpox  
 this little girl rahima banu
 barisal  in bangladesh when she coughed or breathed and the last
  virus of smallpox left her lungs and fell on the dirt and the sun
 killed that last virus  thus ended a chain of transmission
 of history 's greatest horror
