  two years ago i was invited as an artist to participate in an exhibition commemorating one hundred years of islamic art in europe 
 the curator had only one condition i had to use the arabic script for my artwork  
 now as an artist a woman an arab
 or a human being living in the world in two thousand and ten  i only had one thing to say  i wanted to say no  
 and in arabic to say no we say no  and a thousand times no 
 so i decided to look for a thousand different noes 
 on everything ever produced under islamic or arab patronage in the past one thousand four hundred years from spain
  spain to the borders of china  
 i collected my findings in a book placed them chronologically  stating the name the patron the medium and the date  
 now the book sat on a small shelf next to the installation which stood three by seven meters in munich germany in september of two thousand and ten
  two thousand and eleven the revolution started and life stopped for eighteen days 
 and on the 12th of february we naively celebrated on the streets of cairo  believing
 that the revolution had succeeded  nine months later i found myself spraying messages in tahrir square 
 the reason for this act was this image
 that i saw in my
  newsfeed  i did not feel that i could live in a city
 where people were being killed and thrown like garbage on the street  
 so i took one no off a tombstone from the islamic museum in cairo  and i added a message to it 
 no to military rule and i started spraying that on the streets in cairo  but that led to a series of no coming out of the book like ammunition 
 and adding
  messages to them and i started spraying them on the walls  
 so i 'll be sharing some of these noes with you  no to a new pharaoh because whoever comes next should understand that we will never be ruled by another dictator  
 no to violence  ramy essam came
 to tahrir on the second day of the revolution and he sat there with this
  one month after mubarak stepped down this was his reward  no to blinding heroes
 ahmed harara lost his right eye on the 28th of january  
 and he lost his left eye on the 19th of november by two different snipers  
 no to killing in this case no to killing men of religion because sheikh ahmed adina refaat
 was shot on december
  behind
 three orphans and a widow  
 no to burning books the institute of egypt was burned on december 17th a huge cultural loss  no
 to stripping the people  and the blue bra is to remind us of our shame
 as a nation when we allow a veiled woman to be stripped and beaten on the street  and the footprint reads
  long live a peaceful revolution because we will never retaliate with violence  no to barrier walls  on february 5th 
 concrete
 roadblocks were set up in cairo to
 protect the ministry of defense from protesters  now speaking of walls
 i want to share with you the story of one wall in cairo a group of artists decided
 to paint a life size tank on a wall it 's one to one 
 in front of this tank there 's a man on a bicycle with a breadbasket on his head 
 to any passerby there 's no problem with this visual  
 after acts of violence  another artist came painted blood protesters being run over by the tank
  message that read starting tomorrow i wear the new face the face of every martyr  i exist 
 authority comes 
 paints the wall white  leaves the tank and adds a message army and people one hand egypt for egyptians 
 another
  the head of the military as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood in front of the tank  
 authority comes  paints the wall white  leaves the tank  leaves the suit  and throws a bucket of black paint just to hide the face of the monster 
 so i come with my stencils  and i spray them on the suit on the tank and on the whole wall  and this is how it stands
  with a final no  i found neruda scribbled on a piece of paper in a field hospital in tahrir 
 and i decided to take a no of mamluk mausoleum in cairo  the message reads
  you can crush the flowers but you can 't delay spring
