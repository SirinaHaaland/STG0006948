  might think there are many things that i can 't do because i cannot
  i just needed to have a bit of help to come up to the stage  but there is also a lot that i can do this is me
 rock climbing for the first time 
 actually  i love sports and i can play many sports like swimming skiing skating scuba diving running and so on 
 but there is one limitation 
 somebody needs to help me i
  be independent  
 i lost my sight at the age of fourteen in a swimming pool accident  
 i was an active independent teenager and suddenly i became blind 
 the hardest thing for me was losing my independence things that until then
  one of my challenges was textbooks  
 back then there were no personal computers no internet no smartphones 
 so i had to ask one of my two brothers to read me textbooks and i had to create my own books in braille 
 can you imagine 
 of course my brothers were not happy about it and later i
 they were not there whenever i needed them i think they tried to stay away from me  i don 't blame them  
 i really wanted to be freed from relying on someone 
 that became my strong desire to ignite innovation  
 jump ahead to
  to myself  how come there is no computer technology to
 create books in braille  these amazing technologies
 must be able to also help people with limitations like myself  that 's the moment my innovation journey began 
  such as a digital braille editor digital braille dictionary and a digital braille library network  
 today  every student who is visually impaired can read textbooks by using personal computers and mobile devices in braille or in voice  
 this may not surprise you since everyone now has digital books in their tablets in two
  fifteen but braille went digital many years before digital books already in the late 
 almost thirty years ago strong and specific needs of the blind people made this opportunity
 to create digital books way back then  and this is actually
 not the first time this happened  because history shows us
 accessibility ignites innovation 
 the telephone was invented while developing a communication tool for hearing impaired people 
 some keyboards were also invented to help people with disabilities 
 now i 'm going to give
  you another example from my own life in the ' 90s people around me started talking about the internet and web browsing 
 i remember the first time i went on the web i was astonished  
 i could access newspapers at any time and every day  i could even search
  desperately wanted to help the blind people have access to the internet and i found ways
 to render the web into synthesized voice  which dramatically simplified the user interface 
 this led me to develop the home page reader in
  i developed the home page reader  i got many comments from users one that i strongly remember said 
 for me the internet is
 a small window to the world it was a revolutionary moment for the blind the cyber world
  and this technology that we created for the blind has many uses  way beyond what i imagined 
 it can help drivers listen to
 their emails or it can help you listen to a recipe while cooking  
 today  i am more independent  but it is still not enough 
 for example  when i approached the stage just now i needed assistance
  my goal is to come up here independently  and not just here 
 my goal is to be able to travel and do things that are simple to you  
 ok now let me show you the latest technologies this is a smartphone app that we are working on
 ev take the two doors to go out the door is on your right 
 nick is approaching  looks so happy
  he is not talking to you
  dark chocolate with almonds ev you gained five pounds since yesterday
  app navigates me by analyzing beacon signals and smartphone sensors
 and permits me to move around indoor and outdoor environments all by myself  but the computer vision part
 that showed who is approaching  in which mood we are still working on that part and recognizing facial expressions
 is very important for me to be social  
 so now the fusions of technologies are ready to help me see the real world  
 we call this
 cognitive assistance it understands our surrounding world
 and whispers to me in voice or sends a vibration
  to my fingers cognitive assistance will augment missing or weakened abilities
 in other words our five senses 
 this technology is only in an early stage  but eventually i 'll be able to find a classroom on campus  
 enjoy window shopping or find a nice restaurant while walking along a street
 it will be amazing if i can find you on the street before you notice me 
 it will become my best buddy  and yours 
 so this really is a great challenge it is a challenge
 that needs collaboration which is
  fundamental technologies you just saw in the video the frontier is the real world the blind community is exploring
 this technical frontier and the pathfinder  
 i hope to work with you to explore the new era and the next time that i 'm on this stage
  through technology and innovation i will be able to walk up here all by myself  thank you so much
