  i want to talk about penguins today but first i want to start by saying that we need a new operating system for the oceans and for the earth 
 when i came to the galapagos forty years ago  there were three thousand people that lived in the galapagos  now there are over thirty
  thousand there were two jeeps on santa cruz now there are around a thousand trucks and buses and cars there  
 so the fundamental problems that we face are overconsumption and too many people 
 it 's the same problems in the galapagos  except obviously 
 it 's worse here
  some ways than other places because we 've only doubled the population of the earth since the 
  little more than doubled
 but we have six point seven billion people in the world 
 and we all like to consume and one of the major problems that we have is our operating system is not giving us the proper feedback we 're not paying the true environmental costs of our actions  
 and when i came
  to live on fernandina let me just say that i had
 never camped before
  i had never lived alone for any period of time and i 'd never slept with sea lions snoring next to me all night  
 but moreover i 'd never lived on an uninhabited island punta espinosa is where i lived for over a year  
 and we call it uninhabited because there are no people there  but it 's alive with life it 's hardly uninhabited 
 so a lot has
  happened in the last forty years and what i learned when i came to the galapagos is the importance of wild places wild things 
 certainly wildlife and the amazing qualities that penguins have penguins are real athletes  
 they can swim one hundred and seventy three kilometers in a day they can swim at the same speed day and night
  that 's faster than any olympic swimmer i mean they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it 
 but what is really amazing because of this deepness here  emperor penguins can go down more than five hundred meters and they can hold their breath for twenty three minutes magellanic 
  penguins the ones that i work on they can dive to about ninety meters and they can stay down for about four point six minutes  humans without fins
  ninety meters three point five minutes and i doubt anybody in this room could really hold their breath for three point five minutes you have to train to be able to do that so penguins are amazing 
 athletes  the other thing is i 've never met anybody that really doesn 't say that they like penguins  
 so they have all the criteria that people normally like but scientifically
  tell us about
 our world in a lot of different ways and particularly the ocean 
 this is a picture of a galapagos penguin that 's on the front of a little zodiac here in the galapagos and that 's what i came to study 
 i thought i was going to study the social behavior of galapagos penguins but you already know
 penguins are rare these are the rarest penguins in the world why i thought i was going to be able to do that i don 't know but the population
  has changed dramatically since i was first here  when i counted penguins for the first time and tried to do a census we just counted all the individual beaks that we could around all these islands  
 we counted around two thousand so i don 't know how many penguins there really are but i know i can count two thousand 
 if you go and do it now the national parks count about five hundred  
 so we have a quarter of the penguins that we did forty years
 and this is true of most of our living systems 
 we have less than we had before and most of them are in fairly steep decline  and i want to just show you a little bit about why 
 that 's a penguin braying to tell you that it 's important to pay attention to penguins  
 most important of all i didn 't know what
  that was the first time i heard it  and you can imagine sleeping on fernandina your first night there and you hear
 this lonesome plaintful call i fell in love with penguins and it certainly has changed the rest of my life 
 what i found out i was studying is really the difference in how the galapagos changes the most extreme
  you 've heard about these el ninos but this is the extreme that penguins all over the world have to adapt to 
 this is a cold water event called la nina where it 's blue and it 's green it means the water is really cold and so you can see this current coming up 
 in this case the humboldt current that comes all the way out to the galapagos islands  and this deep undersea current the cromwell current that upwells around the
  that brings all the nutrients when this is cold in the galapagos  it 's rich and there 's plenty of food for everyone 
 when we have extreme el nino events you see all this red  
 and you see no green out here around the galapagos that means that there 's no upwelling and there 's basically no food  
 so it 's a real desert for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas things die when there 's no food but we
 we didn 't even know that that affected the galapagos when i went to study penguins and you can imagine being on an island hoping you 're going to see penguins and you 're in the middle of an el nino
 event and there are no penguins they 're not breeding they 're not even around i studied marine iguanas at that point  
 but this is a global phenomenon we know that and if you look along the coast
  where i work now at a place called punta tombo the largest magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about forty four degrees south latitude
 you see that there 's great variation here some years the cold water goes all the way up to brazil  and other years in these la nina years it doesn 't 
  so the oceans don 't always act together they act differently  but that is the kind of variation that penguins have to live with and it 's not easy 
  didn 't have any problems there were plenty of them
 this is a picture at punta tombo in february showing all the penguins along the beach i went there because the japanese wanted to start harvesting them and turning them into high fashion golf gloves  protein and oil  
 fortunately  nobody has harvested any penguins and we 're getting over one hundred thousand tourists a year to see them 
 but the population is declining and it 's declined fairly
  substantially about 
  when i started these surveys in terms of number of active nests here you can see where punta tombo is and they breed in incredibly dense colonies  we know this because of long term science
  because we have long term studies there and science is important in informing decision makers  and also in
  changing how we do and knowing the direction of change that we 're going in 
 and so we have this penguin project the wildlife conservation society has funded me along with a lot of individuals over the last twenty seven years to be able to produce these kinds of 
  maps and also  we know that it 's not only galapagos penguins that are in trouble but magellanics and many other species of penguins and so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins
 penguins don 't like oil and they don 't like to swim through oil  the nice thing is if you look down here in argentina there 's no surface oil pollution from this composite map 
 but in fact when we went to argentina penguins were often found totally covered in oil  
 so they were just minding their own business they ended up swimming through ballast
 water that had oil in it because when tankers carry oil they have to have ballast at some point so when they 're empty they have the ballast water in there when they come back they actually dump this oily 
  ballast water into the ocean why do they do that because it 's cheaper because they don 't pay the real environmental costs we usually don 't and we want to start getting the accounting system right so we can pay the real cost 
  against the law 
 so we ended up spending nine years convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins in some years 
 like this year we found more than eighty percent of the adult penguins dead on the beach were covered in oil 
 these little blue dots are the fledglings we do this survey every march which means that they 're only in the environment from january until march so maybe
  three months at the most that they could get covered in oil and you can see in some years over sixty percent of the fledglings were oiled eventually the government listened
 and amazingly they changed their laws  they moved the tanker lanes forty kilometers farther off shore 
 and people are not doing as much illegal dumping 
  seeing now is very few
 penguins are oiled why are there even these penguins oiled because we 've solved the problem in chubut province which is
 like a state in argentina where punta tombo is so that 's about one thousand kilometers of coastline but we haven 't solved the problem in northern argentina uruguay and brazil  
 so now i want to show you that penguins are affected  i 'm just going to talk about two things  this is climate change now this has really been a fun study because i put
  satellite tags on the back of these magellanic penguins  try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars to glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins but we 've been doing this now for more 
  than a decade to learn where they go we thought we needed a marine protected area of about thirty kilometers and then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin 
  and these are all the little dots from where the penguins ' positions were for penguins in incubation in two thousand and three and what you see is some of these individuals are going
 eight hundred kilometers away from their nests so that means as their mate is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs the other one is out there foraging 
 and the longer they have to stay gone 
 the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back and of
  all of this then leads to a vicious cycle and you can 't raise a lot of chicks here you see in two thousand and three
 these are all the dots of where the penguins are they were raising a little over a half
 of a chick 
 here you can see in two thousand and six they raised almost three quarters of a chick per nest  and you can see that they 're closer to punta tombo they 're not going as far away 
  this past year in two thousand and nine you can see that they 're now raising about a fourth of a chick and some of these individuals are going more than nine hundred kilometers away from 
  their nests  so it 's kind of like you having a job in chicago  and then you get transferred to
 a decade ago  we need to be able to get information out to the general public and so we started a publication with the society for conservation
 that we think presents cutting edge science in a new novel way because we have reporters that are good writers that actually can distill the information and make it accessible to the
  so if you 're interested in cutting edge science and smarter conservation you should join with our eleven partners
 some of them here in this room like the nature conservancy
 and look at this magazine because we need to get information out about conservation to the general public 
  lastly i want to say that all of you probably have had some relationship at some time in your life with a
  a cat some sort of pet and you recognized that those are individuals and some of you consider them almost part of your family  
 if you had a relationship with a penguin you 'd see it in the same sort of way  they 're amazing creatures that really change how you view the world because they 're not that 
  different from us they 're trying to make a living they 're trying to raise their offspring they 're trying to get on and survive in the world
  this is turbo the penguin
  turbo 's never been fed he met us and got his name because he started standing under my diesel truck a turbo truck  so we named him turbo 
 turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak we let him in and he comes in here  and i just wanted to show you
 what happened one day when turbo brought in a friend  
 so this is turbo he 's coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting  which he would do to a female
 and you can see he 's not trying to bite this guy has never been in before and he 's trying to figure out what is going on 
 what is this guy doing this is really pretty weird 
 and you 'll see soon that my graduate student   and you see turbo 's pretty intent on his flipper patting
  and now he 's looking at the other guy saying you are really weird and now look at this
  not friendly  so penguins really differ in their personalities just like our dogs and our cats we
 're also trying to collect our information and become more technologically literate so we 're trying to put that
 in computers in the field and penguins are always involved in helping us or not helping us in one way or another this is a radio frequency id
  system you put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin that has a barcode so it tells you who it is it walks over the pad  and you know who it is okay so
 here are a few penguins coming in see this one 's coming back to its nest they 're all coming in at this time 
 walking across there just kind of leisurely coming in here 's a female that 's in a hurry she 's got food she 's really rushing back because it 's hot to try to feed her chicks
  there 's another fellow that will leisurely come by look how fat he is he 's walking back to feed his chicks  then i realize that they 're playing king of the box  this is my box 
 up here and this is the system that works you can see this penguin he goes over he looks at those wires  
  most important thing is only you can change yourself and only you can change the world and make it better for people
 as well as penguins
