  in developing world cities is a very peculiar challenge  because different from health or education or housing 
 it tends to get worse as societies become richer 
  most other developing country problems  more than a matter of money or technology is a matter of
 equality equity 
 the great inequality in developing countries makes it difficult to see  for example  that
 in terms of transport
  an advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars  but rather one where even the rich use public transport 
 or bicycles  for example  in amsterdam more than thirty percent of the population uses bicycles  
 despite the fact that the netherlands has a higher income per capita than the united states 
 there is
 a conflict in developing world cities for money for government investment if more money is invested
  highways of course there is less money for housing for schools for hospitals  and also there is a conflict for space 
 there is a conflict for space between
 those with cars and those without them most of us accept today that private property and a market economy is the best way to manage
  most of society 's resources however there is a problem with that that market economy needs
 inequality of income
 in order to work some people must make more money  some others less 
 some companies succeed others fail  then what kind of equality can we hope for today with a market economy 
 i would propose two kinds which both have much to do with cities the first one is equality of quality of life
 especially for children
  that all children should have beyond the obvious health and education access to green spaces to sports facilities 
 to swimming pools to music lessons  and the second kind of equality is one which we could call democratic equality 
 the first article in every constitution states that all citizens are equal before the law that
  is not just
 poetry it 's a very powerful principle for example  if that is true 
 a bus with eighty passengers has a right to eighty times more road space than a car with one
  we have been so used to
 inequality sometimes that it 's before our noses and we do not see it less than one hundred years ago
  could not vote  and it seemed normal in the same way that it seems normal today
 to see a bus in traffic  in fact  when i became mayor  applying that democratic principle
 that public good prevails over private interest that a bus with one hundred people has a right to one hundred times more road space than a car  we implemented a mass
  transit system
 based on buses in exclusive lanes we called it transmilenio in order to make buses sexier  
 and
 one thing is that it is also a very beautiful democratic symbol because as buses zoom by 
 expensive cars stuck in traffic
  it clearly is almost a picture
 of democracy at work
 in fact it 's not just a matter of equity  
 it doesn 't take ph d ' s 
 a committee of 12 year old children would find out in twenty minutes that the most efficient way to use scarce road space is with exclusive lanes for buses 
 in fact  
  but they are the only possible means to bring mass transit to all areas of fast growing developing cities 
 they also have great capacity for example  this system in guangzhou
 is moving more passengers our direction than all subway lines in china  except for one line
  at a fraction of the cost  we fought not just for space for buses but we fought for space
 for people and that was even more difficult cities are human habitats  and we
 humans are pedestrians 
 just as fish need to swim or birds need to fly or deer need to run  we need to walk there is a really
 enormous conflict when we are talking
  country cities between pedestrians and cars here what you see is a picture that shows
 insufficient democracy what this shows
 is that people who walk
 are  third class citizens while those who go in cars are first class citizens 
 in terms of transport infrastructure  what really makes a difference between advanced and backward cities
 is not highways or subways
 but quality sidewalks here they made a flyover probably very useless  and they forgot to make a sidewalk 
 this is prevailing all over the world not even schoolchildren are more important than cars 
 in my city of bogot we
 fought a very difficult battle
 in order to take space from cars which had been parking on
  sidewalks for decades  in order to make space for people that should reflect
 dignity of human beings and to make space for protected bikeways first of all i had black hair before that 
 and i was almost impeached in the process  it is a very difficult battle  however
  after very difficult battles to make a city that would reflect some respect for human dignity that would show that those who walk are equally important to those who have cars  
 indeed a very important ideological and political issue anywhere is how to distribute that most valuable resource of a city 
 which is road space a city could find oil or diamonds underground and it would not be so valuable as road space how to distribute it between pedestrians
 bicycles  public transport and cars  
 this is not a technological issue  and we should remember that in no constitution parking is a constitutional right
 when we make that distribution  
 we also built  
 and this was fifteen years ago before there were  bikeways in new york or in paris or in london it was a very difficult battle as well  
 more than three hundred
  fifty kilometers of protected bicycle ways  
 i don 't think protected bicycle ways are a cute architectural feature 
 they are a right just as sidewalks are unless we believe that only those with access to a motor vehicle
 have a right to safe mobility without the risk of getting killed 
  also are a powerful symbol of democracy because they show that a citizen on a $ thirty bicycle
 is equally important
 to one in a $ thirty thousand car  
 and we are living in a unique moment in history in the next fifty years 
 more than half of those cities which will exist in the year two thousand and sixty will be built
  in many developing country cities more than eighty and ninety percent of the city which will exist
 in two thousand and and sixty will be built over the next four or five decades but this is not just a matter for developing country cities 
 in the united states for example more than seventy million new homes must be built over the next forty or fifty years that 's more than all the homes that today exist
 in britain france
 and canada put together  
 and i believe that our cities today have severe flaws  and that different better ones could be built  
 what is wrong with our cities today  well  
 for example if we tell any  three year old child who is barely learning to speak in any city in the world
 the child will jump in fright  
 and with a very good reason because there are more than ten thousand children who are killed by cars every year in the world  
 we have had cities for eight thousand years  and children could walk out of home and play  in fact only very recently
  nine hundred there were no cars cars have been here for
 really less than one hundred years they completely changed cities in one thousand nine hundred for example nobody was killed by cars
 in the united states only twenty years later between one thousand nine hundred and twenty and one thousand nine hundred and thirty 
 almost two hundred thousand people were killed by cars in the united states only
  almost seven thousand children were killed by cars in the united states  so we could make
 different cities cities that will give more priority to human beings than to cars that will give more public space to human beings than to cars  
 cities which show great respect for those most vulnerable citizens such as children or
  the elderly i will propose to you
 a couple of ingredients which i think would make cities
 much better and it would be very simple to implement them in the new cities which are only being created  
 hundreds of kilometers of greenways criss crossing cities in all directions 
 children will walk out of homes into safe spaces they could go for dozens of kilometers safely without any risk in wonderful greenways  sort of bicycle highways
 and i would invite you to imagine the following a city in which every other street
 would be a street only for pedestrians
 and bicycles in new cities which are going to be built this would not be particularly difficult  when
 i was mayor of bogot in only three years  we were able to create seventy kilometers
  in one of the most dense cities in the world of these bicycle highways  
 and this changes the way people live  
 move  enjoy the city 
 in this picture you see in one of the very poor neighborhoods  we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street  and the cars still in the mud 
 of course
  i would love to pave this street for cars but what do we do first ninety nine percent of the people in those neighborhoods don 't have cars  
 but you see when a city is only being created it 's very easy to incorporate this kind of infrastructure  
 then the city grows around it  
 and of course this is just a glimpse
 of something which could be much better
 if we just create it and it changes the way of life and the second ingredient  which would solve mobility
  that very difficult challenge in developing countries in a very  low cost and simple way would be to have
 hundreds of kilometers of streets only for buses buses and
 bicycles and pedestrians  this would be again a very  low cost solution if implemented from the start
  not as good as my dreams  because of private property of land
 and high land prices 
 all developing country cities have a large problem of slums in my country of colombia almost half the homes in cities initially
 were illegal developments
 and of course it 's very difficult
 to have mass transit or to use bicycles in such environments  
 but even legal developments have also been located in the wrong places very far from the city centers where it 's impossible to provide
  recently organized region in the world  i would recommend respectfully  passionately to those
 countries which are yet to urbanize latin america went from forty percent urban in one thousand nine hundred and fifty to
 eighty percent urban in two thousand and ten
 i would recommend asian
  and african countries
 which are yet to urbanize such as india which is only thirty three percent urban now
 that governments should acquire all land around cities in this way their cities could grow in the right places with the right spaces with the parks with the greenways with the busways 
 the cities we are going to build over the next fifty years will determine quality of life and even happiness for billions of people towards the
  future  what a fantastic opportunity for leaders
 and many young leaders to come  especially in the developing countries  
 they can create a much happier life for billions towards the future  i am sure i am optimistic that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams
