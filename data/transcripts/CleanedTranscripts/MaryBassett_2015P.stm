  social justice was at the core of zimbabwe 's national health policy the new government
 emerged from a long war of independence and immediately proclaimed a socialist agenda health care services primary education
  education became essentially free a massive expansion
 of rural health centers placed roughly eighty percent of the population less than a two hour walk
 from these facilities a truly remarkable accomplishment in one thousand nine hundred and eighty the year of independence twenty five percent of zimbabwean
  a mere decade later this proportion stood at eighty percent 
 i felt tremendously privileged to be part of this transformation a revolution 
 the excitement  the camaraderie was palpable 
 working side by side with brilliant zimbabweans scientists doctors
  i felt connected not only to an african independence movement but
 to a global progressive public health movement  
 but there were daunting challenges zimbabwe reported its first aids case in one thousand nine
 hundred and eighty five the year i arrived i had taken care of a few patients with aids in the early 1980s when i
  did my medical training at harlem hospital but
 we had no idea
 what lay in store for africa  infection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there these would soar
 to one out of every four adults by the time i left harare seventeen years later by the 
 i 'd told hundreds of people in the prime of life that they were
 i saw
 colleagues and friends die my students hospital patients die 
 in response my colleagues and i set up a clinic we did condom demonstrations we launched
 school education and workplace interventions
 we did research we counseled the partners of
 infected men about how to protect themselves we worked hard and at the time i believed
 that i was doing my best i was providing excellent treatment such as it was  but i was not talking
 about structural change  former un secretary kofi annan has spoken candidly
  he was head of the un peacekeeping department 
 at a 10 year memorial for the genocide he reflected i believed at the time i was doing my best but i realized after the genocide that there was more i could
 and should have done
 to sound the alarm and rally
  the aids epidemic caught the health community unprepared 
 and today when the world health organization estimates that thirty nine million people
 have lost their lives to this disease i 'm not alone
 in feeling remorse and regret at not having done more earlier  but while living in
  i didn 't see my role as an advocacy or a political one i was there for my technical skills both my clinical and my research epidemiology skills and
 in my mind my job was to take care of patients
 and to do research to better understand the population patterns of transmission and i hoped that we 'd slow the spread
  of the virus i was aware
 that socially marginalized populations were at disproportionate risk of getting and dying of aids and on the sugar plantations which
 really more closely resembled feudal fiefdoms than any modern enterprise sixty percent
 of pregnant women tested hiv positive 
 i worked to show how getting infected was not a moral failure but instead related to a culture of
 male superiority
  to forced migrant labor and to colonialism  whites were largely unscathed 
 as health professionals our tools were pitifully weak  
 imploring people to change their individual behaviors use condoms reduce number of partners infection
  became available in the west treatment that remains our most potent weapon against this virus it was unaffordable to the public sector
 across africa i didn 't speak out
 about the unequal access to these life saving drugs or about the underlying economic and political systems that
  rates in such huge swaths
 of the population i rationalized my silence
 by reminding myself that i was a guest in the country that sounding the alarm could even get me kicked out keep me from doing good work  taking care of my patients doing
 much needed research  
 so i didn 't speak out about the government 's early stance on aids  
 i didn 't voice my
  concerns loudly enough many doctors health professionals may think i did nothing wrong 
 our pact with our patients  the hippocratic oath and its variants is about the sanctity of the
  but i knew
 that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society reflecting not only biology but more importantly patterns of marginalization 
 exclusion discrimination related to race gender sexuality class and more 
 it was true of aids it was true
  just recently of ebola 
 medical anthropologists such as paul farmer who worked on aids in haiti call this structural violence 
 structural because inequities are embedded
 in the political and economic organization of our social
  in ways that are invisible
 to those with privilege and power  and violence because its impact premature deaths 
 suffering  illness
 is violent 
 we do little for our patients if we fail to recognize these social injustices sounding the alarm
 is the first step towards doing public health
  right and it 's how we may rally support
 to break through and create real change together  
 so these days  i 'm not staying quiet  i 'm speaking up about a lot of things 
 even when it makes listeners uncomfortable  even when it makes me
  and a lot of this is about racial disparities and institutionalized racism 
 things that we 're not supposed to have in this country anymore  certainly not in the practice of medicine
 or public health  but we have them  and we pay for them
 in lives cut short  that 's why sounding the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the united states
  the ongoing institutional and interpersonal violence that people of color face compounded by
 our tragic legacy
 of two hundred and fifty years of slavery ninety years of jim crow and sixty years of imperfect
  the alarm about this
 is central to doing my job right
 as new york city 's health commissioner in new york city premature mortality that 's death before the 
 is fifty percent higher for black men than white ones  a black woman in two thousand and twelve faced more than ten times the risk of dying
 dying related to childbirth
 as a white woman 
 and though we 've made enormous strides in reducing infant mortality rates a black baby still faces
 nearly three times the risk of death in its first year of life
 as compared to a white baby new york city 's not exceptional these statistics
 are paralleled by statistics found across the
  united states a recent new york times analysis
 reported that there are one point five million missing black men across the country 
 they noted that more than one out of every six black men who today should
  from daily life lost either to prison
 or premature death 
 there is great injustice in the daily and disproportionate violence faced by young black men the focus of recent protests under the banner
 but we have to remember that enduring and disparate rates
 and the occurrence and outcome of common medical conditions heart disease cancer diabetes hiv diseases that may kill slowly
 and quietly and take even more black lives prematurely as
  community has been reluctant to even use the word racism 
 in our research and our work  you 've probably felt something every time i 've said it 
 our medical students held  die ins in their white coats  but the medical community has largely stood by passively
 as ongoing discrimination continues to affect the disease profile and mortality
  and i worry
 that the trend towards personalized and precision medicine 
 looking for biological or genetic targets to better tailor treatment may inadvertently cause us to lose sight
 of the big picture that it is the daily context
  that most importantly determines population health and for too many of us poor health 
 as health professionals in our daily work  
 whether in the clinic or doing research we are witness to great injustice 
 the homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice because he has more
  pressing priorities the transgender youth who
 is contemplating suicide because our society is just so harsh the single mother who has been made to feel that she is responsible
 for the poor health of her child our role as health professionals is not just to treat our patients
 but to sound the alarm
 and advocate
 for change  
 rightfully or not our societal position gives our voices great credibility and we shouldn 't waste that 
 i regret
 not speaking up in zimbabwe  
 and i 've promised myself that as new york city 's health commissioner  i will use every opportunity
  opportunity i have to sound the alarm
 and rally support for health equity i will speak out against racism  and i hope you will join me  and i will join you
 when you speak out against sexism or any other form of inequality  it 's time for us to rise up
 and collectively speak up about structural
 inequality  we don 't have to have all the answers
 to call for change we just need courage 
 the health of our patients  the health of us all depends on
