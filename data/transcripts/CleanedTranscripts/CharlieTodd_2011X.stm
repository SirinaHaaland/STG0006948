  i started improv everywhere about ten years ago when i moved to new york city with an interest in acting and comedy  because i was new to the city i didn 't have access to a stage so i decided to create my own in public places  
 so the first project we 're going to take a look at is the very first no pants subway ride  now this took place
  january of two thousand and two and this woman is the star of the video she doesn 't know she 's being filmed she 's being filmed with a hidden camera  
 this is on the six train in new york city and this is the first stop along the line these are two danish guys who come out and sit down next to the hidden camera  
 and that 's me right there in a brown coat it 's about thirty degrees outside i 'm wearing a hat i 'm wearing a scarf and the girl 's going to notice me right here
 and as you 'll see now i 'm not wearing pants so
 at this point at
 this point she 's noticed me but in new york there 's weirdos on any given train car one person 's not that unusual she goes back to reading her book which is unfortunately titled
 so she 's noticed the unusual thing but she 's gone back to her normal life now in the meantime i have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well 
 they 're going to be entering this car one by one we 'll act as though we don 't know each other and we 'll act as if it 's just an unfortunate mistake we 've
  forgetting our pants on this cold january day
  point she decides to put the rape book away and
 she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings
 now in the meantime the two danish guys to the left of the camera they 're cracking up they think this is the funniest thing they 've ever seen before and watch her make eye contact with them right about now
  i love that moment in this video because before it became a shared experience it was something that was maybe a little bit scary or something that was at least confusing to her  and then once it became a shared experience it was funny and something that she could laugh at 
 so the train is now pulling into the third stop
  so the video won 't show everything this goes on for another four stops a total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear at the eighth stop a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar
 like you might sell batteries or
  on the train  we all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants put them on and said thank you that 's exactly what i needed today and then
 exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions thank you so that 's
 a still from the video there and i
 i love that girl 's reaction so much and watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what i do and really one of the points of improv everywhere is to cause a scene in a public 
  place that is a positive experience for other people it 's a prank but it 's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell and her reaction inspired me to do a second annual no pants subway ride and we 've continued to do it every year this january we did the 10th annual no pants subway ride where a diverse group of
  five hundred people rode the train in their underwear in new york almost every single train line in the city and also in fifty other cities around the world people participated 
 as i started taking improv class at the upright citizens brigade theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians i started amassing a mailing list 
  of people who wanted to do these types of projects so i could do more large scale projects well one day i was walking through union square and i saw this building  which had just been built
 and there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing and it was very peculiar because it was dark out  but she was back lit with florescent lighting  and she was very much onstage and i couldn 't figure out why she was doing 
  it after about fifteen seconds her friend appeared she had been hiding behind a display and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away  so it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this so i got inspired by that looking at the entire facade there were seventy total windows and i knew what i had to do
 so this project is called look up more  we had seventy actors dress in black this was completely unauthorized we didn 't let the stores know we were coming  and i stood in the park giving signals 
 the first signal was for everybody to hold up these four foot tall letters that spelled out look up more 
 and then we had dancing we had everyone dance and then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them 
 so then i gave a new hand signal which signaled the next soloist down below in forever twenty one
  and he danced 
 there were several other activities we had people jumping up and down people dropping to the ground  
 and i was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt putting my hand on and off of a trashcan
 to signal the advancement and because it was in union square park right by a subway station there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing 
 there 's a better photo of it so that particular event was inspired by a moment that i happened
  to stumble upon 
 the next project i want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger 
 a high school kid in texas wrote me in two thousand and six and said you should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a best buy and stand around
  so here 's the video  so again this is two thousand and five this is the best buy in new york city  we had about eighty people show up to participate entering
  also don 't shop just stand around and don 't face products 
 now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt everybody else is one of our actors 
 the lower level employees thought it was very funny and in fact  several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us a lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers 
  managers and the security guards on the other hand did not find it particularly funny  
 you can see them in this footage they 're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt and we were there probably ten minutes before the managers decided to dial nine hundred and eleven 
 so they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming watch out the cops were
  you can see the cops in this footage right here that 's a cop wearing black right there being filmed with a hidden camera  ultimately the police had to inform best buy management that it was not in fact illegal to wear a blue polo 
 so we had been there for twenty minutes
 we were happy to exit the store one thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras 
 and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags  
 but the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the best buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to
 so i like that concept of using their own technology against them 
 i think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason  and one morning
  i was riding the subway i had to make a transfer at the 53rd st stop where there are these two giant escalators and it 's a very depressing place to be in the morning it 's very crowded  so i decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning
  so this was in the winter of two thousand and nine eight thirty in the morning it 's morning rush hour it 's very
  people are coming in from queens transferring from the e train to the six train and they 're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs
  a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better he gave two thousand high fives that day  and he washed his hands
 before and afterward and
 did not get sick and that was done also without permission  although no one seemed to care
  so i 'd say over the years one of the most common criticisms i see of improv everywhere left anonymously on youtube comments is these people have too much time on their hands 
 and you know not everybody 's going to like everything you do and i 've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to internet comments but that one 's always bothered me because we don 't have too much time on our hands  the participants at improv everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other
  new yorkers they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way you know
 every saturday and sunday hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games and i 've never seen anybody comment  looking at a football game saying all those people in the stands they have too much time on their hands 
 and of course they don 't it 's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a
  watching a football game in a stadium  
 but i think it 's also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with two hundred people in the grand central terminal or
 dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the new york public library 
 or listening to the same mp3 as three thousand other people and dancing silently in a park  or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical or diving into the ocean in coney island wearing
  formal attire you know
 as kids we 're taught to play and we 're never given a reason why we should play it 's just acceptable that play is a good thing  and i think that 's sort of the point of improv everywhere it 's that 
  there is no point and that there doesn 't have to be a point we don 't need a reason as long as it 's fun and it seems like it 's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time then that 's enough for us and
  think as adults we need to learn that there 's no right or wrong way to play  thank you very much
