  war has been a part of my life since i can remember  i was born in afghanistan just six months after the soviets invaded  
 and even though i was too young to understand what was happening i had a deep sense of the suffering and the fear around me 
  experiences had a major impact on how i now think about war and conflict 
 i learned that when people have a fundamental issue at stake for most of them  giving in is not an option 
 for these types conflicts when people 's rights are violated when their countries are occupied when they 're oppressed and humiliated
 they need a powerful way to resist and to fight back which means that no matter how
  destructive and terrible violence is if people see it as their only choice  they will use it 
 most of us are concerned with the level of violence in the world  
 but we 're not going to end war by telling people that violence is morally wrong  
 instead we must offer them a tool that 's at least as powerful and as effective as violence 
 this is the work i do for the
  past thirteen years  i 've been teaching people in some of the most difficult situations around the world
 how they can use nonviolent struggle to conduct conflict  
 most people associate this type of action with gandhi and martin luther king  
 but people have been using nonviolent action for thousands of years in
  most of the rights that we have today in this country as women as minorities as workers 
 as people of different sexual orientations and citizens concerned with the environment
 these rights weren 't handed to us 
 they were won by people who fought for them and who sacrificed for them  
 but because we haven 't learned from this history nonviolent struggle as a technique is widely misunderstood
  i met recently with a group of ethiopian activists and they told me something that i hear a lot they said they 'd already tried nonviolent action and it hadn 't worked 
 years ago they held a protest the government arrested everyone and that was the end of that 
 the idea that nonviolent struggle is equivalent to street protests is a real problem because although
 protests can be a great way to show that people want change on their own they don 't actually create change
 at least change that is fundamental 
 powerful opponents are not going to give people what they want just because they asked nicely  or even not so nicely 
 nonviolent struggle works by destroying an opponent 
 not physically  but by identifying the institutions that an opponent needs to survive  and then denying them those sources of power
 nonviolent activists can neutralize the military by causing soldiers to defect  they can disrupt the economy through strikes and boycotts  
 and they can challenge government propaganda by creating alternative media 
 there are a variety of methods that can be used to do this my colleague and mentor gene sharp has identified one hundred
 and protest is only one  let me give you a recent example 
 until a few months ago guatemala was ruled by corrupt former military officials with ties to organized crime 
 people were generally aware of this but most of them felt powerless to do anything about it
 until one
  group of citizens just twelve regular people put out a call on facebook to their friends
 to meet in the central plaza holding signs with a message renuncia ya resign already 
 to their surprise  thirty thousand people showed up  they stayed there for months as protests spread throughout the country 
 at one point the organizers delivered hundreds of
  to various government buildings with a message 
 if you don 't have the huevos the balls to stop corrupt candidates from running for office 
 you can borrow ours 
 president molina responded by vowing that he would never step down 
 and the activists realized that they couldn 't just keep protesting and ask the president to resign they needed to leave him no choice
 so they organized a general strike in which people throughout the country refused to work in guatemala city alone over four hundred businesses and schools shut their doors  
 meanwhile  farmers throughout the country blocked major roads  within five days  the president  along with dozens of other government officials  
  i 've been greatly inspired by the creativity and bravery of people using nonviolent action in nearly every country in the world 
 for example recently a group of activists in uganda released a crate of pigs in the streets you can see here that the police are confused about what to do with them 
 the pigs were painted the color of the ruling party one pig was even wearing a hat
  hat that people recognized 
 activists around the world are getting better at grabbing headlines  but these isolated actions do very little if they 're not part of a larger strategy 
 a general wouldn 't march his troops into battle unless he had a plan to win the war  yet this is how most of the world 's nonviolent movements
  nonviolent struggle is just as complex as military warfare if not more its participants must be well trained
 and have clear objectives  and its leaders must have a strategy of how to achieve those objectives  
 the technique of war has been developed over thousands of years with massive resources and some of our best minds dedicated to understanding and improving how it works  
 meanwhile nonviolent struggle is rarely systematically studied
 and even though the number is growing  there are still only a few dozen people in the world who are teaching it 
 this is dangerous  because we now know that our old approaches of dealing with conflict are not adequate for the new challenges that we 're facing 
 the us government recently admitted that it 's in a stalemate in its war against
  but what most people don 't know is that people have stood up to isis using nonviolent action 
 when isis captured mosul in june two thousand and fourteen 
 they announced that they were putting in place a new public school curriculum  based on their own extremist ideology  
 but on the first day of school not a single child showed up 
 parents simply refused to send them they told journalists they would rather homeschool their children than to have them brainwashed
 this is an example of just one act of defiance in just one city  
 but what if it was coordinated with the dozens of other acts of nonviolent resistance that have taken place against isis 
 what if the parents ' boycott was part of a larger strategy
 to identify and cut off the resources that isis needs to function  the skilled labor needed to produce food  the engineers needed to extract and refine
  oil  the media infrastructure and communications networks and transportation systems and the local businesses that isis relies on 
 it may be difficult to imagine defeating isis with action that is nonviolent 
 but it 's time we challenge the way we think about conflict and the choices we have in facing it 
 here 's an idea worth spreading  let 's learn more about where
  nonviolent action has worked and how we can make it more powerful 
 just like we do with other systems and technologies that are constantly being refined to better meet human needs 
 it may be that we can improve nonviolent action
 to a point where it is increasingly used in place of war violence as a tool of conflict could then be abandoned
 in the same way that bows and arrows were
 because we have replaced them with weapons that are more effective 
 with human innovation we can make nonviolent struggle more powerful than the newest and latest technologies of war 
 the greatest hope for humanity lies not in condemning violence
 but in making violence obsolete  thank you
