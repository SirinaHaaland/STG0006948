  i have a story a story that i would like to share with you and it 's an african story  
 it is a story of hope resilience and glamour 
 there was hollywood
  film industry in the world in two thousand and six alone  almost two thousand films
 were made in nigeria now try to imagine
 forty  fifty films wrapped distributed every week in the streets of lagos nigeria and
  west africa some estimates put
 the value of this industry at two hundred and fifty million dollars  it has created
 thousands if not tens of thousands of jobs  and it 's expanding  but
 keep in mind that this
 was a grassroots movement this is something
 that happened without foreign investment 
 without government aid  and actually it happened against all odds 
 in one of the 
 most difficult moments in nigerian economy the industry is fifteen years old 
  you 're thinking now why how an italian filmmaker based in boston
 is so interested in this story  and so i think i have to tell you just a few words a few things about my personal
 life  because i think there is a connection 
 my grandfather lived most of his life and
 is buried in zambia my father
 also lived most of his adult life in east africa  and i was born in zambia  
 even though i left when i was only three years old  i really felt that africa was this big part of my life 
 and it really was a place a place where i learned to
  uttered the first words and my family bought their first home  so
 when we came back to italy  and one of the things that i remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories 
 it seemed that for our neighbors and friends africa was either this exotic place this
  and so we were always caught in this stereotype  and
 i remember really this desire to talk about africa as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives and have dreams like we all have 
 so when i
 read in a newspaper in the business page the
  story of nollywood  i really felt
 this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these preconceived notions here i can
 tell a story of africans making movies like i do and actually i felt this was an inspiration for me
  have the good fortune of being a filmmaker in residence at the center of digital imaging arts at boston university  and we really look
 how digital technology is changing and how young  independent filmmakers can make movies at a fraction of the cost so when i
 proposed the story i really had all the support to make this film 
  i found two wonderful partners in crime
 in this adventure aimee corrigan a very talented and young photographer  and robert caputo a friend and a mentor who
 is a veteran of national geographic and told me you know  franco in twenty five years of covering africa i don 't know if i have come across a story
 that is so full of hope
  we went to lagos in october two thousand and five  
 and we went to lagos to meet bond emeruwa  a wonderful talented film director who is with us tonight  
 the plan was to give you a portrait of nollywood of this incredible film industry 
 following bond in his quest to make an action movie
 that deals with the issue of
  corruption called checkpoint police corruption  and he had nine days to make it we thought this was a good
 story  in the meantime  we had to cover nollywood and we talked to a lot of
 filmmakers  but i don 't want to create too many expectations i would like to show you six minutes
  and these are six minutes they really prepared for the ted audience  
 there are several themes from the documentary  but they are re edited and made for you ok  so i guess it 's a world premier
  for those who work in it is a kind of subsistence filmmaking what they do to make a living
  fancy filmmaking where you say oh you want to put all the razzmatazz of hollywood and where you have big budgets here is that you make these films  it sells  you jump onto the
 location again to make another film  because if you don 't make the next film you 're not going to feed
  we should be able to educate
 i believe in the power of
 audiovisuals  
 i mean ninety percent of the population will watch nollywood  i think it 's the most viable vehicle right now to pass information across a dedicated cable
  so if you 're making a movie no matter what your topic is put in
 a message in
  keep trying to explain to people it 's not about
 the quality at the moment the quality is coming i mean there are those films that people are making for quality
 but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that africa still has people that live on one dollar a day 
 and these are the people that really watch
  that has just been born in this part of the world 
 because nobody believed that nollywood can come out of africa
  our people for our people
  we have been so deep into the foreign movies it 's all about the foreign movies but we can do something
  you can now walk the street and see a role model  its not just what you see in picture  you see the person live you see how he talks you see how he lives 
 he influences you really good  you know  its not just what you see in the picture  it is not what you
  i was so fascinated you know  with those cowboy movies but then
 when i discovered the situation in my country at that time there was so much corruption
  for a young man to really make it out here you got to think of some negative things
  and all that or some kind of vices and i didn 't want that you know and i discovered that i could
 be successful in life as an actor without doing crime without cheating nobody without telling no lies
 just me and
  they have all these things in place but here we
  just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it won 't affect my face the explosion you know  but she 's a professional she knows what shes doing i 'm trying to protect my
  face too this ain 't going to be my last movie you know this
 is nollywood where the magic lives 
 so now you 're about to see how we do our own movies here  with or without any assistance from anybody
  so many things to say so little time  so many themes in this story  i just can 't tell you
 theres one thing i want to tell you i spent  you know several weeks with all these actors producers  and the problems they have
  a filmmaker who works in america or in europe  but always with a smile always with an enthusiasm that is incredible
  werner herzog the german filmmaker said i need
 to make movies like you need oxygen and i think theyre breathing the nigerian filmmakers really really are doing what they like
  a very very important thing for them and for their audiences a woman told me when i see a nollywood film i can relax  i really i can breathe better
 there is also another very important thing that i hope will resonate with this audience its technology im very interested in it and
 i really think that the digital non linear editing has slashed
  the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be 
 incredible cameras cost under five thousand dollars and this has unleashed tremendous energy and guess what we didnt have to tell to the nigerian filmmakers they understood it they embraced the technology
 and they run with it and theyre successful i hope that 
 the nollywood phenomenon will go both ways  i hope it will inspire other african nations to embrace the technology look at the nigerian
  model make their films create jobs create a narrative for the population something to identify something positive  something that really is psychological relief and it 's part of the culture  
 but i really think this is a
 a phenomenon that can inspire us i really think it goes both ways filmmakers friends of mine
  they look at nollywood and they say wow they are doing what we really want to do and make a buck and live with this
 job so i really think its a lesson that we 're actually learning from them  and there 's one thing one small challenge that i have for you and
 should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling  and i think this is really the theme of this session try
 to imagine a world where the only
  and a shelter but no stories no stories around the campfire  no legends no fairytales  
 nothing no novels 
 difficult eh 
 it 's meaningless  so this is what i really think i think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers and i think
  that the nigerian filmmakers really have proved this
 i would like you to hear their voices just a few moments its not
 an added sequence just some voices from
 nollywood toyin alousa nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them if you have an industry that puts a smile on people 's face  thats nollywood
  i believe very soon were not only going to have better movies
  i don 't see us exhausting the stories we have fs my job ends here  and the nollywood filmmakers really have now to
 work and i really hope that there will be many many collaborations where we teach each other things and i really hope
  you described this as the world 's third largest film industry what does that translate to in terms of numbers of films really fs oh yes  i think i mentioned briefly it 's
 close to two thousand films there is scientific data on
  two thousand and five or six the
 censor board has censored one thousand 
 six hundred films alone and we know that there are more so its safe to say that there are two thousand films so imagine forty five films per week
  there are challenges there are challenges there is a glut of film the quality has to be raised  they need to go to the next level but im optimistic 
 ca and these arent films that are primarily seen in cinemas
  of course this is very important  maybe  you know  for you to try to imagine this this these are films that are distributed
 directly in markets  they are bought in video shops they can be rented for pennies ca 
 on what format fs oh the format thank you for the question yes  it 's
 vcds it 's a cd it 's a little bit
  can be in a lagos traffic jam
  and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water
