  this game is very simple all you have to do is read what you see  right  so i 'm going to count to you so we don 't all do it
  are you reading there are no words there  i said read what you 're seeing  right  it literally says
 's because perception is grounded in our experience  right  
 the brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it which means we never see what 's there we never see information we only ever see what was useful to see in the past all
 right which means when it comes to perception we 're all like this frog
  when things don 't go our way we get a little bit annoyed right  but we 're talking about perception here right  
 and perception underpins everything we think we know we believe our hopes our dreams the clothes we wear falling in love everything begins with perception 
 now if perception is grounded in our history it means we 're only ever responding according to what we 've done before but actually it 's a tremendous problem
  because how can we ever see differently  
 now  
 i want to tell you a story about seeing differently  and all new perceptions begin in the same way they begin with a question 
 the problem with questions is they create uncertainty now uncertainty is a very bad thing it 's evolutionarily a bad thing if you 're not sure that 's a predator it 's too late 
  even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty right
 if you go down below on a boat  your inner ears are you telling you you 're moving your eyes because it 's moving in register with the boat say i 'm standing still your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information and it gets ill 
 the question why is one of the most dangerous things you can do because it takes you
  and yet the irony is the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space  so how can we ever do anything new well fortunately  
 evolution has given us an answer  right  and it enables us to address even the most difficult
 of questions the best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty they 're the ones that question the things we
  easy to ask questions about how did life begin or what extends beyond the universe  but to question what you think to be true already
 is really stepping into that space  so what is evolution 's answer
 to the problem of uncertainty  it 's play  
 now play is not simply a process experts in play will tell you that actually it 's a way of being 
 play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated 
 uncertainty is what makes
  play fun  right  it 's adaptable to change  right it opens possibility  
 and it 's cooperative it 's actually how we do our social bonding and it 's intrinsically motivated what that means is that we play to play play is its own reward 
 now if you look at these five ways of being these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist
  is not defined by the method section of a paper it 's actually a way of being which is here and this is true for anything that is creative so
 if you add rules to play you have a game that 's actually what an experiment is 
 so armed with these two ideas that science is a way of being
  because they 're experts in play  
 so i took my bee arena down to a small school in devon  and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently  
 but through the process of science to see themselves differently
  right  
 the first step was to ask a question  now  i should say that we didn 't get
  funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn 't make a useful contribution to science and the teachers said kids couldn 't do it 
 so we did it anyway right 
 of course  so here are some of the questions i put them in small print so you wouldn 't bother reading it point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with
 were actually the basis of science publication the last five to fifteen years  right  so they were asking
  questions that were significant to expert scientists 
 now here  i want to share the stage with someone quite special  right  she was one of the young people who was involved in this study and she 's now one of the youngest published scientists in the world  
 right  she will now once she comes onto stage will be the youngest person to ever speak at ted 
  and asking questions is about courage  now she is the personification of courage because she 's going to stand up here and talk to you all so amy would you please come up 
 so amy 's going to help me tell the story of what we call the blackawton bees project  and first she 's going to
  easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think  because we look alike  but we wondered if there 's a possible link
 with other animals it 'd be amazing if humans and bees thought similar  since they seem so different from us  
 so we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way really we wanted to know if bees
 can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions  so
 what if bees can think like us well it
 'd be amazing since we 're talking about an insect with only one million brain cells  
 but it actually makes a lot of sense they should because bees like us can recognize a good flower
  was to design an experiment  which is a game  so the kids went off and they designed this experiment and so well game and so amy can you tell us what the game was and the puzzle that you set the bees ao the
 puzzle we came up with was
  to a certain color flower only when it 's in a certain pattern 
 they were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow  
 now there 's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle  the interesting question is which what
 was really exciting about this project was we and beau had no idea whether it would work
  completely new and no one had done it before including adults bl 
 including the teachers  
 and that was really hard for the teachers it 's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he 's doing because that 's what we do in the lab but for a teacher not to know what 's going to happen at the end of the day so much of the credit goes to dave strudwick who was the collaborator on
  i 'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read read about it but the next step is observation  so here are some of the students
 doing the observations they 're recording the data of where the bees fly
  so we 've got our observations we 've got our data they do the simple
 mathematics averaging etc etc  and now we want to share that 's the next step so we 're going to write this up and try to submit this for publication  
 right  so we have to write it up so we go of course to the pub
  the one on the left is mine  okay 
 now i tell them a paper has four different sections an introduction a methods a results a discussion the introduction says  what 's the question and why methods what did you do results what was the 
  observation  and the discussion is who cares  right  that 's a science paper basically 
  i put it into a narrative  which means that this paper is written in kidspeak it 's not written by me it 's written by amy
 and the other students in the class 
 as a consequence this science paper begins once upon a time 
 the results section it says training phase the puzzle duh duh duuuuuhhh right and the methods it says then we put the bees
  this is a science paper we 're going to try to get it published  
 so here 's the title page  we have a number of authors there all the ones in bold are eight to ten years old 
 the first author is blackawton primary school because if it were ever referenced it would be blackawton et al 
 and not one individual so we submit it to a public access journal  and it says this it said many things but it said this i 'm afraid the
  get it reviewed  
 so i sent it to dale purves who is at the national academy of science one of the leading neuroscientists in the world  and he says this is the most original science paper i have ever read 
 and it certainly deserves wide exposure larry maloney expert in vision says the paper is magnificent the work would be publishable if done by adults 
  do we send it back to the editor they say no  
 so we asked larry and natalie hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists right  putting in the references 
 and we submit it to biology letters  
 and there  it was reviewed by five independent referees  and it was published
  it took four months to do the science  two years to get it published 
 typical science actually  right  
 so this makes amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world what was the feedback like 
 well  it was published two days before
  thirty thousand times in the first day  right
  it was the editors ' choice in science which is a top science magazine  
 it 's forever freely accessible by biology letters it 's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal 
 last year it was the second most downloaded paper by biology letters  
 and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well  and i 'll just read
  i have read ' blackawton bees ' recently i don 't have words to explain exactly how i am feeling right now what you guys have done is real true and amazing  curiosity interest innocence and zeal are the most basic and most 
  important things to do science who else can have these qualities more than children please congratulate your children 's team from my side 
  about taking risks so this is an incredible risk right for me not for him  right because we 've only done this once before
  we 're going to do a little demonstration  right  you have to close your eyes  and you have to point where you hear me clapping
  one more time everyone over there shout where 's the sound coming from
  science does for us right  we normally walk through life responding but if we ever want to do anything different we have to step into uncertainty  
 when he opened his eyes  he was able to see the world in a new way that 's what science offers us  it offers the possibility to step on uncertainty
 through the process of play right now  true science education i think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice so i 've asked amy
 to be the last voice in this short story so amy ao 
 this project was really exciting for me because it brought the process of discovery to life and it
 showed me that anyone and i mean anyone has the potential to discover something new and that
 a small question can lead into a big
  changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy
 or hard it all depends on the way the person feels about change  but changing the way i thought about science was
 surprisingly easy once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle  i then realized that science isn 't just a boring subject  
 and that anyone can discover something new 
 you just need an opportunity
