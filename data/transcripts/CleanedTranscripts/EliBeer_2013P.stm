  is an ambucycle
 this is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency
 it has everything an ambulance has except for a bed you
  see the defibrillator you see the equipment
 we all saw the tragedy that happened in boston
 when i was looking at these pictures it brought me back many years to my past when i was a child
 i grew up in a small neighborhood in jerusalem
 when i was six years old i was walking back from school on a friday afternoon
 with my older brother we were passing by a bus stop we saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes
 the bus was on fire and many people were hurt and killed
 i remembered an old man
 yelling to us and crying to help us get him up he just needed someone helping him
 we were so scared and we just ran away
 growing up i decided i wanted to become a doctor and save lives maybe that was because of what i saw when i was a child when i was fifteen
 i took an emt course and i went to volunteer on an ambulance for two years i volunteered on an ambulance in jerusalem
 i helped many people
 but whenever someone really needed help i never got there in time we never got there the traffic is so bad the distance and everything we never got there when somebody really needed us
 one day we received a call about a seven year old child choking from a hot dog
 traffic was horrific and we were coming from the other side of town in the north part of jerusalem
 when we got there twenty minutes later we started cpr on the kid
 a doctor comes in from a block away
 stop us checks the kid and tells us to stop cpr that second he declared this child dead
 at that moment i
  understood that this child died for nothing
 if this doctor who lived one block away from there would have come twenty minutes earlier not have to wait until that siren he heard before coming from the ambulance if he would have heard about it
 way before he would have saved this child he could have run from a block away he could have saved this child i said to myself there must be a better way
  together with fifteen of my friends we were all emts we decided let 's protect our neighborhood so when something like that happens again
 we will be there running to the scene a lot before the ambulance
 so i went over to the manager of the ambulance company and i told him please whenever you have a call coming into our neighborhood we have fifteen great guys who are willing to stop everything they 're doing and run and save lives just alert us by beeper we 'll buy these
  beepers just tell your dispatch to send us the beeper and we will run and save lives well
 he was laughing
 i was seventeen years old i was a kid and he said to me i remember this like yesterday he was a great guy but he said to me
 kid go to school or go open
  really interested in these kinds of new adventures we 're not interested in your help and he threw me out of the room
 i don 't need your help he said i was a very stubborn kid
 as you see now i 'm walking around like crazy meshugenah laughter applause
 so i decided to use the israeli very famous technique you 've probably all heard
  of chutzpah laughter
 and the next day
 i went and i bought two police scanners and i said the hell with you if you don 't want to give me information i 'll get the information myself
 and we did turns who 's going to listen to the radio scanners
 the next day while i was listening to the scanners i heard about a call coming in of a seventy
  year old man hurt by a car only one block away from me on the main street of my neighborhood
 i ran there by foot i had no medical equipment when i got there the seventy year old man was lying on the floor blood blood was gushing out of his neck he was on coumadin
 i knew i had to stop his bleeding or else he would die
 i took off my yarmulke because i had no medical equipment and with a lot of pressure i stopped his bleeding he was bleeding from his neck when the ambulance
  arrived fifteen minutes later i gave them over a patient who was alive applause
 when i went to visit him two days later he gave me a hug
 and was crying and thanking me for saving his life
 at that moment when i realized this is the first person i ever saved in my life
  after two years volunteering in an ambulance i knew this is my life 's mission
 so today twenty two years later we have united hatzalah applause
 hatzalah means rescue for all of you who don 't know hebrew i forgot i 'm not in israel
  we have thousands of volunteers who are
 passionate about saving lives and they 're spread all around so whenever a call comes in they just stop everything and go and run and save a life
 our average response time today went down to less than three minutes in israel applause i 'm
 talking about heart attacks i 'm talking about car accidents god forbid bomb attacks shootings whatever it is even a
  woman three o 'clock in the morning falling in her home and needs someone to help her three minutes we 'll have a guy with his pajamas running to her house and helping her get up
 the reasons why we 're so successful are because of three things thousands of passionate volunteers who will leave everything they do and run to help people they don 't even know
 we 're not there to replace ambulances we 're just there to get the gap
  between the ambulance call until they arrive and we save people that otherwise would not be saved
 the second reason is because of our technology you know israelis are good in technology every one of us has on his phone no matter what kind of phone
 a gps technology done by nowforce and whenever a call comes in the closest five volunteers get the call and they
  actually get there really quick and navigated by a traffic navigator to get there and not waste time and this is a great technology we use all over the country and reduce the response time
  and the third thing are these ambucycles these ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels we don 't transfer people but we stabilize them and we save their lives they never get stuck in traffic they could even go on a sidewalk
  get there so fast a few years after i started this organization in a jewish community two muslims from east jerusalem called me up
 they ask me to meet they wanted to meet with me muhammad
 asli and murad alyan when muhammad told me his personal story how his father fifty five years old collapsed at home
 had a cardiac arrest and it took over an hour for an ambulance arrive and he saw his father die in front of his eyes he asked me please start
  this in east jerusalem i said to myself i saw so much tragedy so much hate
 and it 's not about saving jews it 's not about saving muslims it 's not about saving
 christians it 's about saving people so i went ahead full force applause
 and i started united hatzalah in east jerusalem and that 's why the names united
 and hatzalah match so well we started hand in hand
 saving jews and arabs arabs were saving jews jews were saving arabs something special happened
 arabs and jews they don 't always get along together but here in this situation the communities literally it 's an unbelievable situation that happened
 the diversities all of a sudden they had a common interest let 's save lives together
 settlers were saving arabs and arabs were saving settlers
  it 's an unbelievable concept that could work only when you have such a great cause
 and these are all volunteers no one is getting money they 're all doing it for the purpose of saving lives
 when my own father collapsed a few years ago from a cardiac arrest one of the first volunteers to arrive to save my father
 was one of these muslim volunteers from east jerusalem who
 was in the first course to join hatzalah
 and he saved
  my father could you imagine how i felt in that moment
 when i started this organization i was seventeen years old i never imagined that one day i 'd be speaking at tedmed
 i never even knew what tedmed was then i don 't think it existed but i never imagined
 i never imagined that it 's going to go all around it 's going to spread around and
  this last year we we started in panama and brazil
 all i need
 is a partner who is a little meshugenah like me passionate about saving lives and willing to do it and
 i 'm actually starting it in india very soon with a friend who i met in harvard just a while back
 hatzalah actually started in brooklyn by a hasidic jew years before us in williamsburg and now it 's all over the jewish community in new york
 even australia and mexico and many other jewish communities
 but it could spread
  everywhere it 's very easy to adopt you even saw these volunteers in new york saving lives in the world trade center
 last year alone we treated in israel two hundred and seven thousand people forty two thousand of them were life threatening situations
 and we made a difference i guess you could call this a lifesaving flash mob and it works when i look all
  around here
 i see lots of people who would go an extra mile run an extra mile to save other people
 no matter who they are no matter what religion no matter who where they come from
 we all want to be heroes we just need a good idea motivation and lots of chutzpah
 and we could save millions of people that otherwise would not be saved thank you very much
