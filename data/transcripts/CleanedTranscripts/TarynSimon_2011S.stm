  this is shivdutt yadav and he 's from uttar pradesh india  
 now shivdutt was visiting the local land registry office in uttar pradesh  and he discovered that official records were listing him as dead his land was no longer registered in
  his name his brothers chandrabhan and phoolchand were also listed as dead 
 family members had bribed officials to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land
 by having the brothers declared dead  allowing them to inherit their father 's share of the ancestral farmland 
 because of this all three brothers and their families had to vacate their home
  according to the yadav family the local court has been scheduling a case review since two thousand and one but a judge has never appeared 
 there are several instances in uttar pradesh of people dying before their case is given a proper review 
 shivdutt 's father 's death and a want for his property led to this
  he was laid to rest in the ganges river  where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water 
 photographing these brothers was a disorienting exchange because on paper they don 't exist and a photograph is so often used as an evidence of life yet these men remain dead  
 this quandary led to the title of the project which considers in many ways that we are all the living dead
 and that we in some ways
  represent ghosts of the past and the future  
 so this story is the first of eighteen chapters in my new body of work titled a living man declared dead and other chapters 
 and for this work i traveled around the world over a  four year period
 researching and recording bloodlines and their related
  i was interested in ideas surrounding fate and whether our fate is determined by blood  chance or circumstance 
 the subjects i documented ranged from feuding families in brazil to victims of genocide in bosnia to the first woman to hijack an airplane and the living dead in india  
 in each chapter you can see the external forces of governance power and territory or religion colliding with the
  internal forces of psychological and physical inheritance 
 each work that i make is comprised of three segments on the left are one or more portrait panels in which i systematically order the members of a given bloodline  
 this is followed by a text panel  it 's designed in scroll form in which i construct the narrative at stake  
 and then on the right is what i refer to as a
  footnote panel it 's a space that 's more intuitive in which i present fragments of the story beginnings of other stories photographic evidence  
 and it 's meant to kind of
 reflect how we engage with histories or stories on the internet in a less linear form so it 's more disordered  
 and this disorder is in direct contrast to the unalterable order of a bloodline 
  past projects i 've often worked in serial form  documenting things that have the appearance of being comprehensive through a determined title and a determined presentation but in fact are fairly abstract 
 in this project i wanted to work in the opposite direction and find an absolute catalog  something that i couldn 't interrupt curate or edit by choice  
 this led me to blood a bloodline is determined
 and ordered 
 but the project centers on the collision of order and disorder the order of blood butting up against the disorder represented in the often chaotic and violent stories that are the subjects of my chapters 
 in chapter two i photograph the descendants of arthur ruppin he was sent in one thousand nine
  seven to palestine
 by the zionist organization to look at areas for jewish settlement and acquire land for jewish settlement  
 he oversaw land acquisition on behalf of the palestine land development company whose work led to the establishment of a jewish state 
 through my research at the zionist archives in jerusalem i wanted to look at the early paperwork of the establishment of the jewish state and i found these maps which you see here
  are studies commissioned by the zionist organization for alternative areas for jewish settlement in this i was interested in the consequences of geography
 and imagining how the world would be different if israel were in uganda  which is what these maps demonstrate 
 these archives in jerusalem  they maintain a card index file of the earliest immigrants and applicants for immigration to palestine
 chapter three joseph nyamwanda jura ondijo treated patients outside of kisumu kenya for aids tuberculosis  infertility mental illness  evil spirits  
 he 's most often paid for his services
 in cash cows or goats
  sometimes when his female patients can 't afford his services their families give the women to jura in exchange for medical treatment 
 as a result of these transactions jura has nine wives thirty two children and sixty three grandchildren 
 in his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here 
 two of his wives were brought to him suffering from
  infertility and he cured them 
 three for evil spirits one for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain and two wives ondijo claims he took for love paying their families a total of sixteen cows 
 one wife deserted him and another passed away during treatment for evil spirits  
 polygamy is widely practiced in kenya  it 's common among a
  privileged class capable of paying numerous dowries and keeping multiple homes  instances of prominent
 social and political figures in polygamous relationships has led to the perception of polygamy as a symbol of wealth status and power 
 you may notice in several of the chapters that i photographed there are empty portraits these empty portraits represent
  living individuals who couldn 't be present and the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel 
 they include dengue fever imprisonment  army service women not allowed to be photographed for religious and cultural reasons 
 and in this particular chapter it 's children whose mothers wouldn 't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot for fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it
 european rabbits were brought to australia in 
  by a british settler for sporting purposes for hunting  and within a hundred years that population of twenty four had exploded to half a billion 
 the european rabbit has no natural predators in australia  and it competes with native wildlife and damages native plants and degrades the land
 since the 1950s australia has been introducing lethal diseases into the wild rabbit population to control growth 
 these rabbits were bred at a government facility  biosecurity queensland where they bred three bloodlines of rabbits and have infected them with a lethal disease 
 and are monitoring their progress to see if it will effectively kill them  so they 're testing its virulence
 during the course of this trial all of the rabbits died except for a few  which were euthanized  
 haigh 's chocolate in collaboration with the foundation for rabbit free australia  
 stopped all production of the easter bunny in chocolate and has replaced it with the easter bilby  
  now this was done to counter the annual celebration of rabbits and presumably make the public more comfortable with the killing of rabbits and promote an animal that 's native to australia and actually an animal that is threatened by the european rabbit  
 in chapter seven i focus on the effects of a genocidal act on one bloodline  so over a two day period six individuals from this bloodline
  were killed in the srebrenica massacre  
 this is the only work in which i visually represent the dead  but i only represent those that were killed in the srebrenica massacre  which is recorded as the largest mass murder in europe since the second world war  
 and during this massacre  eight thousand bosnian muslim men and boys were systematically executed so when you look at a
 detail of this work you can see the man on the upper left is the father of the woman sitting next to him her name is zumra  
 she is followed by her four children all of whom were killed in the srebrenica massacre  following those four children is zumra 's younger sister who is then followed by her children who were killed as well 
 during the time i was in bosnia the mortal remains of zumra 's eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave and i was therefore able to photograph the fully
  assembled remains  
 however the other individuals are represented by these blue slides which show tooth and bone samples that were matched to dna evidence collected from family members to prove 
  they were the identities of those individuals they 've all been given a proper burial so what remains are these blue slides at the international commission for missing persons 
 these are personal
  effects dug up from a mass grave that are awaiting identification from family members
 and graffiti at the potochari battery factory  which was where the dutch u n soldiers were staying and also the serbian soldiers later during the times of the executions  
 this is video footage used at the milosevic
  which from top to bottom shows a serbian scorpion unit being blessed by an orthodox priest before rounding up the boys and men and killing them 
 chapter fifteen is more of a performance piece i solicited china 's state council information office in two thousand and nine to select a 
  bloodline to represent china for this project they chose a large family from beijing for its size
  and they declined to give me any further reasoning for their choice  
 this is one of the rare situations where i have no empty portraits  everyone showed up 
 you can also see the evolution of the one child only policy as it travels through the bloodline  
 previously known as the department of foreign propaganda the state council information office is responsible for all of china 's external
  publicity operations  
 it controls all foreign media and image production outside of china from foreign media working within china it also monitors the internet and instructs 
  local media on how to handle any potentially controversial issues  including tibet ethnic minorities human rights  religion
  democracy movements and terrorism 
 for the footnote panel in this work this office instructed me to photograph their central television tower in beijing  and i also photographed the gift bag they gave me when i left
 these are the descendants of hans frank who was hitler 's personal legal advisor and governor general of occupied poland  
 now this bloodline includes numerous
  empty portraits highlighting a complex relationship to one 's family history 
 the reasons for these absences include people who declined participation there 's also parents who participated who wouldn 't let their children participate because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves  
 another section of the family presented their clothing as opposed to their physical presence because they didn 't want to be identified
  with the past that i was highlighting  
 and finally another individual sat for me from behind and later rescinded his participation so i had to pixelate him out so he 's unrecognizable 
 in the footnote panel that accompanies this work i photographed an official adolph hitler postage stamp and an imitation of that stamp produced by british intelligence
  with hans frank 's image on it it was released in poland to create friction between frank and hitler so that hitler would imagine frank was trying to usurp his power  
 again talking about fate i was interested in the stories and fate of particular works of art 
 these paintings were taken by hans frank during the time of the third reich  
 and i 'm interested in the impact of their absence
  and presence through time they are leonardo da vinci 's lady with an ermine rembrandt 's landscape with good samaritan and raphael 's portrait of a youth which has never been found 
 chapter twelve highlights people being born into a battle that is not of their making but becomes their own
  so this is the ferraz family and the novaes family and they are in an active blood feud this feud has been going on since one thousand nine hundred
 and ninety one in northeast brazil in pernambuco  and it involved the deaths of twenty members of the families and forty others associated with the feud including hired hit men innocent bystanders and friends  
  over local political power  but it got violent in the last two decades and includes decapitation
 and the death of two mayors  
 installed into a protective wall surrounding the suburban home of louis novaes who 's the head of the novaes family are these turret holes  which were used for shooting and looking 
 brazil 's northeast state of pernambuco is one of the nation 's most violent
  regions  it 's rooted in a principle of retributive justice or an eye for an eye  so retaliatory killings have led to several deaths in the area 
 this story like many of the stories in my chapters  reads almost as an archetypal episode like something out of shakespeare that 's happening now and will happen again in the future  
 i 'm interested in these ideas of repetition
 so after i returned home i received word that one member of the family had been shot thirty times in the face 
 chapter seventeen is an exploration of the absence of a bloodline and the absence of a history  
 children at this ukrainian orphanage are
 between the ages of six and sixteen this piece is ordered by age because it can 't be ordered by blood  
 in a  12 month period when i was at the orphanage only one child had been adopted 
 children have to leave the orphanage at age sixteen despite the fact that there 's often nowhere for them to go  
 it 's commonly reported in ukraine that children when leaving the orphanage are targeted for human trafficking child pornography and prostitution
  many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival  and high rates of suicide are recorded  
 this is a boys ' bedroom  there 's an insufficient supply of beds at the orphanage and not enough warm clothing children bathe infrequently because the hot water isn 't turned on until october  
 this is a girls
  and the director listed the orphanage 's most urgent needs as an industrial size washing machine and dryer four vacuum cleaners two computers a video projector a copy machine winter shoes and a dentist 's drill 
 this photograph which i took at the orphanage of one of the classrooms  
 shows a sign which i had translated when i got home and it reads those who do not know their past are not worthy of their future
  many more chapters in this project this is just an abridged rendering of over a thousand images and this mass pile of images and stories forms an archive  
 and within this accumulation of images and texts i 'm struggling to find patterns and imagine that the narratives that surround the lives we lead are just as coded as blood itself  
 but archives
  exist because there 's something that can 't necessarily be articulated something is said in the gaps between all the information that 's collected 
 and there 's this relentless persistence of birth and death and an unending collection of stories in between 
 it 's almost machine like the way people are born and people
  the stories keep coming and coming 
 and in this i 'm considering is this actual accumulation leading to some sort of evolution 
 or are we on repeat over and over again
