  vivid representation of several riverine communities across nigeria  communities whose waterways have been infested by an invasive
 aquatic weed communities where economic livelihoods have been hampered fishing  
 marine transportation and trading 
 communities where fish yields have diminished communities where schoolchildren are unable to go to
  sometimes weeks on end 
 who would have thought that this plant with round leaves  inflated stems  and showy  lavender flowers
 would cause such havoc in these communities the plant is known as water hyacinth and its botanical name 
  in nigeria the plant is also known by other names names associated with historical events as well as myths 
 in some places  the plant is called babangida  when you hear babangida  you remember the military
 and military coups and you think fear  restraint in parts of nigeria in the niger delta the plant is also known
  when you hear abiola  you remember annulled elections and you think  dashed hopes 
 in the southwestern part of nigeria  the plant is known as
  when you hear that you think of death it literally translates to death to mother and child 
 i personally had my encounter with this plant in the year two thousand and nine  
 it was shortly after i had relocated from the us to nigeria i 'd quit my job in corporate america
 and decided to take this big leap of faith a leap
  of faith that came out of a deep sense of conviction that there was a lot of work to do in nigeria in the area of sustainable development  
 and so here i was in the year two thousand and nine actually at the end of two thousand and nine in lagos on the third mainland bridge  and i looked to my left and saw this very arresting
  it was an image of fishing boats that had been hemmed in by dense mats of water hyacinth 
 and i was really pained by what i saw because i thought to myself 
 these poor fisherfolk how are they going to go about their daily activities with these restrictions 
 and then i thought there 's got to be a better way a win win solution whereby the environment is taken care of by the
  cleared out of the way and then this being turned into an economic benefit for the communities whose lives are impacted the most by the infestation of the weed 
 that i would say was my spark moment  
 and so i did further research to find out more about the beneficial uses of this weed
  out of the several one struck me the most it was the use of the plant for handicrafts  and i thought what a great idea 
 personally i love handicrafts  especially handicrafts that are woven around a story  
 and so i thought this could be easily deployed within the communities without the requirement of technical skills 
 and i thought to myself three simple steps to a mega solution
  first step 
 get out into the waterways and harvest the water hyacinth that way you create access  secondly you dry the water hyacinth stems  and thirdly you weave
 the water hyacinth into products the third step was a challenge see i
  a computer scientist by background and not someone in the creative arts  and so i began my quest to find out how i can learn how to weave 
 and this quest took me to a community in ibadan where i lived called sabo sabo translates to strangers ' quarters 
 and the community is predominantly made up of people from the northern part of the country so i literally took my dried weeds in hand there were several more of them and went knocking from door to door
 to find out who could teach me how to weave these water hyacinth stems into ropes  and i was directed to the shed of malam yahaya 
 the problem though is that malam yahaya doesn 't speak english and neither did i speak hausa  
 but some little kids came to the rescue and helped translate and that began my journey of learning how to weave
 and transform
 these dried water
  hyacinth stems
 into
 long ropes 
 with my long ropes in hand  
 i was now equipped to make products  and that was the beginning of partnerships working with rattan basket makers to come up with products so with this in hand  i felt confident
  be able to take this knowledge back into the riverine communities
 and help them to transform their adversity into prosperity so taking these weeds and actually weaving them into products that can be sold 
 so we have pens we have tableware  we have purses  we have tissue boxes  
 thereby  helping the communities to see water hyacinth in a different light seeing water hyacinth
  as being valuable being aesthetic being durable
 for mother and child and i 'd like to end with a quote by michael margolis  he said if you want to learn about a culture  
 listen to the stories  and if you want to change a culture  change the stories and so from makoko community to
