  how does the news shape the way we see the world 
 here 's the world based on the way it looks based on landmass  
 and here 's how news shapes what americans see
  this map 
 this map shows the number of seconds that american network and cable news organizations 
 dedicated to news stories by country in february of two thousand and seven just one year ago
  this was a month when north korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities  
 there was massive flooding in indonesia  and in paris the ipcc released its study confirming man 's impact
 on global warming 
 the u s accounted for seventy nine percent of total news coverage and when we take out the u s and look at the remaining
 twenty one percent we see a lot of iraq that 's that big green thing there
 and little else 
 the combined coverage of russia  china and india for example  reached just one percent 
 when we analyzed all the news stories
 and removed just one story  here 's how the world looked
  what was that story the death of anna nicole smith  
 this story eclipsed every country except iraq and received ten times the coverage of the ipcc report  
 and the cycle continues as we all know britney has loomed pretty large lately 
  why don 't we hear more about the world one reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half  
 aside from
  is that covering britney
 is cheaper  and this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news 
 local tv news looms large  and unfortunately only dedicates twelve percent of its coverage to international news 
 and what about the web
 the most popular news sites don 't do much better  
 last year pew and the colombia j school analyzed the fourteen thousand stories that appeared on google news ' front page  
 and they in fact covered the same twenty four news events  
 similarly  a study in e content showed that much of global news from u s news creators
 is recycled stories from the ap wire services and reuters and don 't put things
  into a context that people can understand their connection to it 
 so  if you put it all together  this could help explain why today 's college graduates as well as less educated americans know less about the world than their counterparts did twenty years ago  
 and if you think it 's simply because we are not interested you would be wrong  
 in recent years americans who say they closely follow global
  news most of the time grew to over fifty percent
