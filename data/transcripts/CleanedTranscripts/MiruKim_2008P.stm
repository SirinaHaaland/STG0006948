  i was raised in seoul korea  and moved to new york city in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine to attend college  i was pre med at the time 
 and i thought i would become a surgeon because i was interested in anatomy and
 dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity
 at the same time
 i fell in love with new york city 
 i started to realize that i could look at the whole city as a living organism  
 i wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers  
 and the way to it for me was through artistic means  
 so eventually i
 decided to pursue an
  instead of an m d and in grad school i became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city 
 in new york city rats are part of commuters ' daily lives
 most people ignore them or are frightened of them but i took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society and even though they 're used in labs to promote
  human lives they 're also considered pests  i also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them 
 one day in the subway i was snapping pictures of the tracks hoping to catch a rat or two 
 and a man came up to me
 and said you can 't take photographs
  i was quite shocked by that and
 thought to myself well  ok then i 'll
 follow the rats 
 then i started going into the tunnels which made me realize that there 's a whole new dimension to the city that i never saw before and most people don 't get to see 
 around the same time i met like minded individuals who
 call themselves
  urban explorers  adventurers spelunkers  guerrilla historians etc  
 i was welcomed into this loose internet based network of people who regularly explore
 urban ruins such as abandoned subway stations tunnels sewers
  when i took photographs in these locations  i felt there was something missing in the pictures  simply documenting these
 structures wasn 't enough for me so i wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these
  and the simplest way
 to do it at the time was to model myself 
 i decided against clothing because i wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications or time specific elements  
 i wanted a simple way to represent a living body inhabiting these decaying derelict
 spaces  this was taken in the riviera sugar factory in red hook brooklyn
  it 's now an empty
 lot waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new ikea  
 i was very fond of this space because it 's the first massive industrial complex i found on my own
 that is abandoned when i first went in i was scared because i heard dogs barking and i thought they were guard dogs but they happened to be wild dogs living there and it was right by the water
 there were swans and ducks swimming around and
 trees growing everywhere and bees nesting in the sugar barrels  the nature had really reclaimed the whole complex 
 and in a way i wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature 
 when i got comfortable in the space it also felt like a big playground i would climb up the tanks and
  hop across exposed beams as if i went back in time and became a child again
  this was taken in the old croton aqueduct which supplied fresh water to new york city for the first time  the construction began in
  when you go into spaces like this you 're directly accessing the past because they sit untouched for decades  
 i love feeling the aura of
 a space that has so much history  instead of looking at reproductions of it at home you 're actually feeling the hand laid bricks
 and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and
  muddy and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight  
 this is a tunnel underneath riverside park it was built in the 1930s by robert moses  
 the murals were done by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people that got relocated from the tunnel in one thousand nine
  when the tunnel reopened for trains walking in this tunnel is very peaceful there 's nobody around you and
 you hear the kids playing in the park above you completely unaware of what 's underneath when i was going out a lot to these places  i was feeling a lot of
 anxiety and isolation because i was in a solitary phase in my life  
 and i decided to title my series naked city spleen
  references charles baudelaire naked city is a nickname for new york and spleen embodies the melancholia and inertia
 that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment  
 this is the same tunnel you see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching
  is a tunnel that 's abandoned in hell 's kitchen  
 i was there alone setting up and a homeless man approached  i was basically intruding in his living space  
 i was really frightened at first but i calmly explained to him that i was working on an art project and
 he didn 't seem to mind and so i went ahead and put my camera on
  was done he actually offered me his shirt to wipe off my feet
 and kindly walked me out 
 it must have been a very unusual day for him 
 one thing that struck me after this incident was that a space like that
 holds so many deleted memories of the city
 that homeless man to me really represented
 an element of the unconscious of the city he told me that he was abused
 above ground and was once in riker 's island and
 at last he found peace and quiet in that space 
 the tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city  but is now a sanctuary for
 outcasts  who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller 's everyday life  
 this is underneath my alma mater columbia university  
 the tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the manhattan project 
 this particular tunnel is interesting because it shows the
  original foundations of bloomingdale insane asylum which was demolished in one thousand eight hundred and ninety when columbia moved in 
 this is the new york city farm colony which was a poorhouse in staten island from
  in places that have been abandoned for decades but this is an exception  this children 's hospital was closed in
 it 's located in newark  when i was there three years ago  the windows were broken and the walls were peeling but everything was left there as it was you see the autopsy table  morgue
  machines and even used utensils  which you see on the autopsy table  
 after exploring
  buildings  i felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast  your home your office a shopping mall 
 a church any man made structures around you  
 i was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is and how vulnerable people truly
  are 
 i love to travel and berlin has become one of my favorite cities  
 it 's full of history and also full of underground bunkers and ruins from the war  
 this was taken under a homeless asylum built in
  i was on the train and i got off at the next station and met people there that gave me access to their catacomb like basement which was used for ammunition storage 
 during the war and also at some point to hide groups of jewish refugees  
  and fell in love right away there are more than one hundred and eighty five miles of tunnels  and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum 
 the first tunnels date back to sixty b c they were consistently dug as
 limestone quarries and by the  18th century
  of some of these quarries posed safety threats so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries
 and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place 
 as you can see the system is very complex and vast  it 's very dangerous to get lost in there  
 and at the same time there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries so
 the bones
  were moved from the
 cemeteries into the quarries making them into the catacombs  
 the remains of over six million people are housed in there some over one thousand three hundred years old  
 this was taken
 under the montparnasse cemetery where most of the
  are located 
 there are also phone cables that were used in the ' 50s
 and many bunkers from the world war ii era  this is a german bunker
 nearby there 's a french bunker  and the whole tunnel system is so complex that
 the two parties never met  the tunnels are famous for having been used by the resistance  which victor hugo wrote about in les miserables
  and i saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s like this one
 after exploring the underground of paris i decided to climb up and
 i climbed
 a gothic monument that 's right in the middle of paris
  this is the tower of saint jacques  it was built in the early 
 i don 't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of january naked 
 it was not very comfortable and all this time  i never saw a single rat in any of these places
  i was in the london sewers  this was probably the toughest place to explore i had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes
 i guess  except for in this picture  
 and when the tides of waste matter come in it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you  
 this is a still from a film i worked on recently
  film gave a different feel to it 
 and this is the first theater project i worked on  
 i adapted and produced a dream play by august
  it was performed last september one time only in the atlantic avenue tunnel in brooklyn  which is considered to be the oldest
 underground train tunnel in the world built in 
  been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these lately  but whenever i get a chance i still work on my series  
 the last place i visited was the mayan ruins of copan
  honduras  this was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple
