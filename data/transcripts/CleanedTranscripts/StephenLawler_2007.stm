  what i want to talk to you about today is
 virtual worlds digital globes the 3 d web 
 the metaverse what does this all mean for us what it means is the web is going to become an exciting
  place again it 's going to become super exciting as we transform to this highly immersive and interactive world 
 with graphics computing power  low latencies 
 these types of applications and possibilities are going to stream rich data into your lives  
 so the virtual earth initiative and other
 types of these initiatives are all
  about extending
 our current search metaphor when you think about it we 're so constrained by browsing the web remembering urls  saving favorites 
 as we move to search  we rely on the relevance rankings the web matching the index crawling but we want to use our brain  we want to navigate 
  discover information in order to do that we have to put you as a user back in the driver 's seat we need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer  
 so what better way
 to put you back in the driver 's seat than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day why not leverage the learnings
 that you 've been learning your entire life  so virtual earth is about
 starting off creating the first digital representation comprehensive of the entire
  world what we want to do is mix in all types of data 
 tag it attribute it metadata get the community to add local depth  global perspective local knowledge 
 so when you think about this problem  what an enormous undertaking  where do you begin  well  we collect data from satellites
  an engineering problem a mechanical problem  a logistical problem  an operational problem 
 here is an example of our aerial camera this is panchromatic it 's actually four color cones in addition 
 we collect four gigabits per second of data if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down that 's equivalent to to a constellation of twelve satellites
  at highest res capacity  
 we fly these airplanes at five thousand feet in the air you can see the camera on the front  we collect multiple viewpoints vantage points  angles textures 
 we bring all that data back in 
 we sit here you know think about the ground vehicles the human scale what do you see in person  we need to capture that up close to establish that what it 's
 i bet many of you have seen the
 apple commercials kind of poking at the pc for their brilliance and simplicity 
 so a little unknown secret is did you see the one with the
 the guy he 's got the web cam the poor pc guy they 're duct taping his head they 're just wrapping it on him well a little unknown secret is his brother
 actually works on the virtual earth team
  so they 've got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here but let me tell you
 it doesn 't affect his day job 
 we think a lot of good can come from this technology this was after katrina  we were the first commercial fleet of airplanes to be cleared into the disaster impact zone we flew the area we imaged it we sent in people we took
  disaster areas we helped with the first responders the search and rescue often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house
 was on virtual earth we made it all freely available on the web just to it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause when we think about
 how all this
 comes together it 's all about software algorithms and math you know we capture this imagery but to build the 3 d models we need to do
  the images we have to bundle adjust them  find tie points  extract geometry from the images 
 this process is a very calculated process in fact it was always done manual  hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor for a movie because they 'd have to do it manually 
 they 'd drive the streets with lasers called lidar
  collected information with photos they 'd manually build each building  we do this all through software algorithms and math a highly automated pipeline creating these cities  we took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities 
 and that 's how we 're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream 
 we think about the user interface what does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives
  how do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintaining the fluidity of the model
  'll wrap up by showing you the
 this is a  brand new peek i haven 't really shown into the lab area of virtual earth what we 're doing is people like this a lot this bird 's eye imagery we work with it 's this high resolution data but what we 've found is they like the fluidity of the 3 d model 
 a child can navigate with an xbox controller or a game controller so here what we 're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the
  space you can see all types of resolution from here i can slowly pan the image
 over i can get the next image i can blend and transition by doing this i don 't lose the original detail in fact i might be recording history the freshness the capacity  i can turn this image i can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles
  what we 're trying to do is
