  have the feeling
 that we can all agree that we 're moving towards a new model of the state and society  but we 're absolutely clueless
 as to what this is or what it should be  it seems like we need to have a conversation
 about democracy in our day and age  let 's think about it this way we 
  citizens doing our very very best to interact with
  institutions that are based on an information technology
  let 's have a look at some of the characteristics of this system 
 first of all  it 's designed for an information technology that 's over five hundred years old  
 and the best possible system that could be designed for it is one where the few make daily decisions in the name of the many  
 and the many get to vote once
  every couple of years 
 in the second place the costs of participating in this system are incredibly high  
 you either have to have a fair bit of money and influence or you have to
 devote your entire life to politics you have to become a party member and slowly start working up the ranks until maybe 
 one day you 'll get to sit at a table where a decision is being made  
  least the language of the system it 's incredibly cryptic it
 's done for lawyers by lawyers  and no one else can understand  
 so it 's a system where we can choose our authorities  but we are completely left out on how those authorities reach their
  in a day where a new information technology allows us to participate globally in any conversation
 our barriers of information are completely lowered and we can more than ever before express our desires and our concerns 
 our political system remains the same for the past two hundred years
 and expects us to be contented
 with being simply passive recipients of a monologue  
 so it 's really not surprising that this kind of system is only able to produce two kinds of results  silence
 or noise  silence in terms of citizens not
  simply not wanting to participate 
 there 's this commonplace [ idea ] that i truly truly dislike 
 and it 's this idea that we citizens are naturally apathetic that we shun commitment 
 but can you really blame us for not jumping at the opportunity of going to the middle of the city in the middle of a working day to attend physically a public hearing that has no impact whatsoever
 is bound to happen between a system that no longer represents  nor has any dialogue capacity  
 and citizens that are increasingly used to representing themselves and then we find noise
 their citizens have access to the ballot boxes  but they still feel the need they need to take to the streets
 in order to be heard to me  it seems like
 slogan that was the basis for the formation of our modern democracies
  representation can now be updated to no representation without a conversation 
 we want
 our seat at the table 
 and rightly so  but in order to be part of this conversation we need to know what we want to do next
  because political action is being able to move from agitation
 to construction 
 my generation has been incredibly good at using new networks and technologies to organize protests 
 protests that were able to successfully impose agendas  
 roll back extremely pernicious legislation
  authoritarian governments and we should be immensely proud of this 
 but we also must admit that we haven 't been good at using those same networks and technologies
 to successfully articulate an alternative to what we 're seeing
 and find the consensus and build the alliances that are needed to make it happen  and so the risk that we face is that we
  can create these huge power vacuums that will very quickly get filled up by de facto powers like the military
 or highly motivated and already organized groups that generally lie on the extremes  but our 
 is neither just a matter of voting once every couple of years  but it 's not either the
  ability to bring millions onto the streets 
 so the question i 'd like to raise here and i do believe it 's the most important question we need to answer 
 is this one if internet is the new printing press  then what is democracy for the internet era 
 what institutions do we want to build for
 i don 't have the answer  
 just in case i don 't think anyone does  
 but i truly believe we can 't afford to ignore this question anymore so i 'd like to share our experience and what we 've learned so far and hopefully contribute two cents to this conversation 
 two years ago with a group of friends from argentina  we started thinking
  can we get our representatives our elected representatives to represent us 
 marshall mcluhan once said that politics is solving today 's problems with yesterday 's tools 
 so the question that motivated us was can we try and solve some of today 's problems with the tools that we
  use every single day of our lives our first approach was to design and develop a piece of software called 
  is an  open source web application that is designed to become a bridge between citizens and their elected representatives to make it easier for
  from our everyday lives  so first of all you can get informed
 so every new project that gets introduced in congress gets immediately translated and explained in plain language on this platform  
 but we all know that social change is not going to come from just knowing more information but from doing
 something with it so better access to information should lead to a conversation about what we 're going to do next and democracyos allows for that 
 because we believe that democracy is not just a matter of stacking up preferences one on top of each other 
 but that our healthy and robust public debate should be once again one of its fundamental values 
  is about persuading
 and being persuaded  it 's about reaching a consensus as much as finding a proper way of channeling our disagreement 
 and finally you can vote
 how you would like your elected representative to vote 
 and if you do not feel comfortable voting on a certain issue you can always delegate your vote to someone else allowing for a
 dynamic and emerging social leadership
 it suddenly became very easy for us to simply compare these results with how our representatives were voting in congress  but it also became very evident that technology was not going to do the trick 
 what we needed to do to was to find actors that were able to grab this
 distributed knowledge in society and use it
  make better and more fair decisions  
 so we reached out to traditional political parties and we offered them democracyos 
 we said look here you have a platform that you can use to build
  like little kids
  amongst other things we were called naive  and i must be honest i think in hindsight  we were  
 because the challenges that we face they 're not technological  they 're cultural 
 political parties were never willing to change the way they make their decisions  
 so it suddenly became a bit obvious that if we wanted to move forward with this idea
 we needed to do it ourselves  
 and so we took quite a leap of faith  and in august last year we founded our own political party  el partido de la red or the net party in the city of buenos aires  
 and taking an even bigger leap of faith  we ran for elections in october last year with this idea
  if we want a seat in congress  our candidate  our representatives were always going to vote according to what citizens decided on democracyos 
 every single project that got introduced in congress  we were going vote according to what citizens decided on an online platform  
 it was our way of hacking the political system
  understood that if we wanted to become part of the conversation to have a seat at the table  
 we needed to become valid stakeholders  and the only way of doing it is to play by the system rules  
 but we were hacking it in the sense that we were radically changing the way a political party makes its decisions 
 for the first time  we were making our decisions
 together with those who we were affecting directly
 by those decisions it
 was a very very bold move for a two month old party in the city of buenos aires 
 but it got attention  we got twenty two thousand votes that 's one point two percent of the votes  and we came
  in second for the local options  
 so even if that wasn 't enough to win a seat in congress  it was enough for us to become part of the conversation 
 to the extent that next month congress  as an institution is launching for the first time in argentina 's history
 to discuss with the citizens  three pieces of
  on urban transportation and one on the use of public space of course 
 our elected representatives are not saying yes we 're going to vote according to what citizens decide but they 're willing to try they 're willing to open 
  up a new space for citizen engagement and hopefully they 'll be willing to listen as well 
  it by destroying it but by rewiring it with the tools that internet affords us now but
 a real challenge is to find to design to create to empower those connectors that are able to innovate to transform
  and silence into signal and finally bring our democracies
