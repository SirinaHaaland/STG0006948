  former governor of michigan  but actually i 'm a scientist all
 right a political scientist it doesn 't really count  but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy that is michigan and like any good
  scientist  i was experimenting with policy about what would achieve the greatest good for the greatest number  
 but there were three problems three enigmas that i
 could not solve  and i want to share with you those problems but most importantly
  think i figured out a proposal for a solution the first problem
 that not just michigan but every state faces is how do you create good jobs in america in a global economy so let me share with you some empirical data from my lab  
 i was elected in two thousand and two and at the end of my first year in office in two thousand and three i got a call from one of my staff members who said gov we have a big
  we have a little tiny community called greenville michigan  population eight thousand 
 and they are about to lose their major employer which is a refrigerator factory that 's operated by electrolux and i said well how many people work at electrolux 
 and he said three thousand of the eight thousand people in greenville
  so i said forget that i 'm the new governor we can fix this we 're going to go to greenville with my whole cabinet and we will just make electrolux an offer they can 't refuse 
 so i brought my whole cabinet and we met with all of the  pooh bahs of little greenville the mayor the city manager the head of the community college and we basically
 emptied our pockets and put all of our
  chips on the table incentives you name it to convince electrolux to stay  and as we made our pile of chips we slid them across the table to 
  the management of electrolux and in the pile were things like zero taxes for twenty years or that we 'd help to build a new factory for the
  who represented the workers said they would offer unprecedented concessions sacrifices to just keep those jobs in greenville  
 so the management of electrolux took our pile our list of incentives and they went outside the room for
 seventeen minutes  
 and they came back in and they said wow this is the most generous any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here 
 there 's nothing you can do to compensate for the fact that we can pay $ one point five seven an hour in juarez mexico  so we 're leaving 
 and they did  
 and when they did it was like a nuclear bomb went off in little greenville in fact they did implode the factory 
 that 's a guy that is walking on his last day of work 
 and on the month that the last refrigerator
  rolled off the assembly line the employees of electrolux in greenville michigan had a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper 
 it was in a big pavilion in greenville an indoor pavilion  and
 i went to it because i was so frustrated as governor that i couldn 't stop the outflow of these jobs  and i wanted to grieve with them  and as i went into the
  into the room there 's thousands of people there it was a just big thing people were eating boxed lunches on roundtop on roundtop tables and there was a sad band playing music or a band playing sad music probably both 
 and this guy comes up to me and he 's 's got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on and he had his two daughters with him  and he said
 two daughters he said i 'm forty eight years old  and i have worked at this factory for thirty years
 i went from high school to factory my father worked at this factory he said my grandfather worked at this factory
  all i know is how to make refrigerators and he looked at his daughters  and he puts his hand on his chest  and he says so gov  tell me  
 who
 is ever going to hire me  who is ever going to hire me and that was asked
 not just by that guy
 but by everyone in the pavilion  and frankly by every worker at one of the fifty thousand factories that
  closed in the first decade
 of this century  
 enigma number one how do you create jobs in america in a global economy 
 number two very quickly how do you solve global climate change when we don 't even have a national energy policy in this country
 and when
  gridlock in congress seems to be the norm in fact there was a poll that was done recently and
 the pollster compared congress 's approval ratings to a number of other unpleasant things 
 and it was found in fact that congress 's approval rating is worse than cockroaches  lice  nickelback the band  
 root canals and donald trump
  's at least better than meth labs and gonorrhea 
 we got a problem folks  
 so it got me thinking what is it what in the laboratory that i that i see out there the laboratories of democracy what has happened what policy prescriptions
 have happened that actually cause changes to occur and that have been accepted in a bipartisan way
 so if i asked you for example what was the obama administration policy that caused massive changes across the country  what would you say  you might say obamacare 
  except for those were not voluntary changes as we know only half the states have opted in we might say the recovery act but those didn 't require policy changes  the thing that caused massive policy changes to occur
 why  the government put a $ four point five billion pot and said to the governors across the country compete for it
 governors competed convincing forty eight state legislatures to essentially raise standards for high schoolers so that they all take a college prep curriculum forty eight states opted
  from the bottom up so i thought well why can 't we do something like that and create a clean energy jobs race to the top  because after all if you look at the context 
 one point six trillion dollars has been invested in the past eight years from the private sector globally  and every dollar represents a job and where are those jobs going well they 're going to places that have policy like china in fact
 i was in china to see what they were doing and they were putting on a dog and pony show for the group that i was with and i was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations and standing next to one of the chinese officials and we were watching and he says so gov  
 when do you think the u s is going to get national energy policy 
 and i said oh my god congress gridlock who knows and this is what he did he goes  
 he says take your time
  because they see our passivity
 as their opportunity so what if we decided to create a challenge to the governors of the country 
 and the price to entry into this competition used the same amount that the bipartisan group approved in congress for the race to the top for education  four point five billion which sounds like a lot  but actually it 's less than one tenth of one percent of
  a rounding error on the federal side  but price to entry into that competition would be you could just say use the president 's
 goal he wants congress to adopt a clean energy standard of eighty percent
 by two thousand and thirty in other words that you 'd have to get eighty percent of your energy from clean sources by the year two thousand and thirty  why not ask all of the states to do that instead and imagine 
  what might happen because every region has something to offer you might take states like iowa
  and ohio two very important political states by the way those two governors  and they would say we 're going to lead the nation in producing the wind turbines and the wind energy you might 
  say the solar states the sun belt we 're going to be the states that produce solar energy for the country and maybe jerry brown says well i 'm going to create an industry cluster
  in california to be able to produce the solar panels so that we 're not buying them from china but we 're buying them from the u s in fact every region of the country could do this you see you 've 
  got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation in fact if you look just at the upper and northern states in the west they could do geothermal or 
  you could look at texas and say we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid in the middle eastern states which have access to forests
  and to agricultural waste they might say  we 're going to lead the nation in biofuels in the upper northeast we 're going to lead the nation in in energy efficiency solutions 
 along the eastern seaboard we 're going to lead the nation in offshore wind you might look at michigan and say we 're going to lead the nation in producing the guts for the electric vehicle like the lithium ion battery every region
 and if you created a competition 
 it respects the states and it respects federalism 
 it 's opt in you might even get texas and south carolina who didn 't opt into the education race to the top  you might even get them to opt in  why  because republican and democratic governors love to cut ribbons  
  and it fosters innovation at the state level in these laboratories of democracy now any of you who are
 watching anything about politics lately might say okay great idea but really congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table they can 't agree to anything 
 so you could wait
 and go through congress although you should be very impatient or
  renegades  we could go around congress go around congress 
 what if we created a private sector challenge to the governors what if several of the
 high net worth companies and individuals who are here at ted
 decided that they would create band together just a couple of
  them and create a national competition to the governors to have a race to the top
 and see how the governors respond  what if it all started here at ted  what if
 you were here when we figured out how to crack the code to create good paying jobs in america
 and get national energy policy
 and we created a national energy strategy from the bottom up  
 because dear tedsters  if you are impatient like i am  
 you know that our
  our other nations are in the game and are eating us for lunch and we can
 get in the game or not we can be at the table
 or we can be on the table  and i don 't know about you but i prefer to dine
