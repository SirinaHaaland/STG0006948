  that 's johnny depp of course 
 and that 's johnny depp 's shoulder
  and that 's johnny depp 's famous shoulder tattoo 
 some of you might know that in one thousand nine hundred and ninety depp got engaged to winona ryder  and he had tattooed on his right shoulder
  winona forever and then three years later which in fairness kind of is forever by hollywood standards
 they broke up and johnny went and got a little bit of repair work done  and now his shoulder says 
 wino forever 
 laughter so like johnny depp 
  percent of americans between the ages of sixteen and fifty i have a tattoo  
 i first started thinking about getting it in my mid 20s but i deliberately waited a really long time  
 because we all know people who have gotten tattoos when they were seventeen or nineteen or twenty three
 and regretted it by the time they were thirty 
 that didn 't happen to me i got my tattoo when i was
 and i regretted it instantly and by
 regretted it i mean that i stepped outside of the tattoo place this is just a couple miles from here down on the lower east side
 and i had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight on the corner of east broadway and canal street which is a great place to do it because nobody cares
  i went home that night and i had an even larger emotional meltdown which i 'll say more about in a minute  
 and this was all actually quite shocking to me because prior to this moment i had prided myself on having absolutely no regrets
 i made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions of course i do that hourly  but i had always
  i made the best choice i could make given who i was then given the information i had on hand i learned a lesson from it 
 it somehow got me to where i am in life right now and okay  
 i wouldn 't change it 
 in other words i had drunk our great cultural kool aid about regret  
 which is that lamenting things that occurred in the past is an absolute waste of time that we should always look forward and not backward  and that one of the
  noblest and best things we can do is strive to live a life free of regrets this idea is nicely captured by this quote 
 things without all remedy
 should be without regard what 's done is done and it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first something we might all
 agree to sign onto until i tell you who said it 
 so this is lady macbeth basically telling her husband to stop being such a wuss for feeling bad about murdering people 
 and as it happens shakespeare was onto something here as he generally was because
 the inability to experience regret is actually one of the diagnostic characteristics of sociopaths 
 it 's also by the way a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage so people who have
  damage to their orbital frontal cortex
 seem to be unable to feel regret in the face of even obviously very poor decisions  
 so if in fact you want to live a life free of regret there is an option open to you it
 's called a lobotomy  
 but if you want to be fully functional
 and fully human and fully humane  i think you need to learn to live not
  without regret but with it  so let 's start off by defining some terms what is regret 
 regret is the emotion we experience when we think that our present situation could be better or happier if we had done something different in the past  
 so in other words regret requires two things it requires first of all agency we had to make a decision in the first place 
 and second of all it requires
  we need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice  and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward and imagine how things would be playing out in our present 
 and in fact the more we have of either of these things the more agency and the more imagination with respect to a given regret  
 the more acute that regret will be 
 so let 's say for instance that
 you 're on your way to your best friend 's wedding and you 're trying to get to the airport and you 're stuck in terrible traffic and you finally arrive at your
  and you 've missed your flight you 're going to experience more regret in that situation if you missed your flight by three minutes than if you missed it by twenty 
 why  
 well because if you miss your flight by three minutes it is painfully easy to imagine that you could have made different decisions that would have led to a better outcome 
 i should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel i should have gone through that yellow light 
  classic conditions that create regret we feel regret when we think we are responsible for a decision that came out badly  
 but almost came out well 
 now within that framework we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things 
 this session today is about behavioral economics and most of what we know about regret comes to us out of that domain  we have a vast body of
  literature
 on consumer and financial decisions and the regrets associated with them
 buyer 's remorse basically but then finally it occurred to some researchers to step back and say well okay but overall what do we regret most in life here
 's what the answers turn out to look like  so
 top six regrets the things we regret most in life number one by far education thirty three percent of all
  of our regrets pertain to decisions we made about education  we wish we 'd gotten more of it we wish we 'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have 
 we wish we 'd chosen to study a different topic 
 others very high on our list of regrets include career romance parenting  various decisions and choices about our sense of self
 and how we spend our leisure time
 or actually more specifically how we fail to spend our leisure time
  the remaining regrets
 pertain to these things finance  family issues unrelated to romance or parenting health friends  spirituality and community  
 so in other words  we know most of what we know about regret by the study of finance but it turns out when you look overall at what people regret in life you know what our financial decisions don 't even rank 
 they account for less than three percent of our total regrets
 so if you 're sitting there stressing about
 large cap versus small cap or company a versus company b or should you buy the subaru or the prius you know what
 let it go odds are you 're not going to care in five years 
 but for these things that we actually do really care about and do experience profound regret around what does that experience feel like
 we all know the short answer
 it feels terrible regret feels awful  but it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways  
 so the first consistent component of regret is basically denial 
 when i went home that night after getting my tattoo  
 i basically stayed up all night and for for the first several hours there was exactly one thought in my head and the thought was 
 make it go away
 this is an unbelievably primitive emotional response  i mean it 's right up there with i want my mommy 
 we 're not trying to solve the problem we 're not trying to understand how the problem came about we just want it to vanish  
 the second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment
  so the other thing i thought about there in my bedroom that night was how could i have done that 
 what was i thinking 
 this real sense of alienation from the part of us that made a decision we regret  we can 't identify with that part we don 't understand that part 
 and we certainly don 't have any empathy for that part which explains the third consistent component of regret  which is an intense desire to punish ourselves that 's why in the face of our regret the thing we consistently say is i could have kicked myself
  the fourth component here is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative to perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly on the exact same thing 
 now the effect of perseveration is to basically take these first three components of regret and put them on an infinite loop  
 so it 's not that i sat there in my bedroom that night 
  make it go away it 's that i sat there and i thought make it go away  make it go away  make it go away  make it go away 
 so if you look at the psychological literature these are the four consistent defining components of regret  
 but i want to suggest that there 's also a fifth one 
 and i think of this as a kind of
 existential wake up call that night in my
  after i got done kicking myself and so forth  i lay in bed for a long time  and i thought about
 skin grafts  
 and then i thought about how much as travel insurance doesn 't cover acts of god  probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy in point
 of fact no insurance covers acts of idiocy  
 the whole point of acts of idiocy is that they leave you totally uninsured they leave you exposed to the world and exposed to your own
 vulnerability and fallibility in face of frankly a fairly indifferent universe 
 this is obviously an incredibly painful experience 
 and i think it 's particularly painful for us now in the west in the grips of what i sometimes think of as a control z culture
 control z like the computer command undo
  incredibly used to not having to face life 's hard realities in a certain sense we think we can throw money at the problem or throw technology at the problem we can
 undo and unfriend and unfollow  
 and the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we desperately want to change
 and we cannot sometimes instead of control z we actually
  and for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists and i know where of i speak
 this is really hard  because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right 
 now there is a case to be made that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos
  and i 'm going to return to that point in a few minutes  but first i want to say that
 the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret
  is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we 're feeling regretful about 
 so for instance here 's one of my favorite automatic generators of regret in modern life text relpy to all
 and the amazing thing about this really insidious technological innovation
 is that even just with this one thing we can experience a huge range of regret
  can accidentally hit reply all to an email and torpedo a relationship or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work 
 or you can have your last day at work  
 and this doesn 't even touch on the really profound regrets of a life 
 because of course sometimes we do make decisions that have irrevocable and terrible consequences either for our
  own or for other people 's health and happiness and livelihoods  and
 in the very worst case scenario even their lives 
 now obviously those kinds of regrets are incredibly piercing and enduring  
 i mean even the stupid reply all regrets can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days  
 so how are we supposed to live with this
 i want to suggest that there 's three things that help us to make our peace with regret  and the first of these
 is to take some comfort in its universality if you google regret
 and tattoo  
 you will get eleven point five million hits the fda estimates that of all the americans who have tattoos seventeen percent of us
  getting them that is johnny depp and me and our seven million friends  and that 's just regret about tattoos  
 we are all in this together  
 the second way that we can help make our peace with regret is to laugh at ourselves now in my case this really wasn 't a problem because
 it 's actually very easy to laugh at yourself when you 're twenty nine years old and you want your mommy because you don 't like your
  new tattoo  but it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion
 when it comes to these more profound regrets 
 i don 't think that 's the case though all of us who 've experienced regret that contains real pain
 and real grief
 understand that humor and even black humor plays a crucial role in helping us survive
 it connects the poles of our lives back together the positive and the negative and it sends a little
 current of life back into us the third way that i think we can help make our peace
 with regret is through the passage of time  which as we know heals all wounds
 except for tattoos which are permanent  
 so it 's been several years since i got my own tattoo and
 just want to see it all
 right actually you know what i should warn you you
 're going to be disappointed  
 because it 's actually not that hideous  i didn 't tattoo marilyn manson 's face on some indiscreet part of myself or something 
 when other people see my tattoo for the most part they like how it looks it
  that i don 't like how it looks  and as i said earlier i 'm a perfectionist  but i 'll let you see it anyway 
 this is my tattoo  
 i can guess what some of you are thinking  so let me reassure you about
  some of your own regrets are also not as ugly as you think they are 
 i got this tattoo because i spent most of my 20s living outside the country and traveling 
 and when i came and settled in new york afterward i was worried that i would forget some of the most important lessons that i learned during that time  
 specifically the two things i learned about myself that i most didn 't want to forget
 was how important it felt to keep exploring
 and simultaneously
  how important it is to somehow keep an eye on your own true north 
 and what i loved about this image of the compass was that i felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image 
 and i thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device  
 well it did but it turns out it doesn 't remind me
  of the thing i thought it would it reminds me constantly of something else instead 
 it actually reminds me of the most important lesson regret can teach us which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us 
 and ironically i think it 's probably the single most important thing i possibly could have tattooed onto my body
 partly as a writer but also just as a human being 
 here 's the thing 
 if we have goals and dreams
 and we want to do our best 
 and if we love people and we don 't want to hurt them or lose them  we should feel pain when things go wrong  
 the point isn 't to live without any regrets the point is to not hate ourselves for having them  
 the lesson that i ultimately learned from my tattoo and that i want to leave you with today
  is this we need to learn to love the flawed imperfect things that we create
 and to forgive ourselves for creating them 
 regret doesn 't remind us that we did badly  it reminds us that we know we can do better thank you
