  for over a decade as a doctor  i 've cared for homeless veterans for working class families  
 i 've cared for people who live and work in conditions
 that can be hard if
  where we live and where we work
  lives 
 so what does this different approach to healthcare look like an approach that can improve health where it begins 
 to illustrate this i 'll tell you about veronica  
 veronica was the 17th patient out of my  26 patient day
 at that clinic in south central los angeles  she came into our clinic with a chronic headache
  this headache had been going on for a number of years and this particular episode was
 very very troubling  
 in fact three weeks before she came to visit us for the first time  she went to an emergency room in los angeles  
 the emergency room doctors said we 've run some tests veronica  the results are normal so here 's some pain medication 
 and follow up with a primary care doctor  but if the pain persists or if it worsens then come on back 
 veronica followed those standard instructions
 and she went back
  she went back not just once  but twice more 
 in the three weeks before veronica met us she went to the emergency room three times  
 she went back and forth in and out of hospitals and clinics just like she had done in years past trying to seek relief but still coming up short  
 veronica came to our clinic and despite all these encounters with healthcare professionals veronica was still sick
  when she came to our clinic though we tried a different approach our approach started with our medical assistant  someone who had a ged level training
 but knew the community our medical assistant asked some routine questions  she asked what 's your chief complaint headache 
 let 's get your vital signs measure your blood pressure and your heart rate but let 's also ask something equally as vital to veronica and a lot of patients like her in south los angeles
 veronica can you tell me about where you live  specifically about your housing conditions do you have mold do you have water leaks do you have roaches in your home 
 turns out veronica said yes to three of those things  roaches water leaks mold  i received that chart in hand  reviewed it and
 i turned the handle on the door and i entered the room 
 you should understand that veronica like a lot of patients that i have the privilege of caring for is
  dignified person a formidable presence  a personality that 's larger than life  but here she was
 doubled over in pain sitting on my exam table 
 her head clearly throbbing was resting in her hands  she lifted her head up and i saw her face said hello  
 and then i immediately noticed something across the bridge of her nose  a crease in her skin in medicine we call that crease the allergic salute
 's usually seen among children who have chronic allergies it comes from chronically rubbing one 's nose up and down trying to get rid of those allergy symptoms  and yet here was veronica a grown woman with the same telltale sign of allergies  
 a few minutes later in asking veronica some questions  and examining her and listening to her i said veronica i think i
  have chronic allergies and i think you have migraine headaches and some sinus congestion and
 i think all of those are related to where you live 
 she looked a little bit relieved because for the first time she had a diagnosis  but i said veronica now let 's talk about your treatment we
 're going to order some medications for your symptoms  but i also want to refer you to a specialist if that 's okay 
 now specialists are a little hard to find in south
  the specialist i 'm talking about is someone i call a community health worker  someone who if it 's okay with you can come to your home and
 try to understand what 's going on with those water leaks and that mold trying to help you manage those conditions in your housing that i think are causing your symptoms 
 and if required that specialist might refer you to another specialist that we call a public interest lawyer  because it might be that your landlord isn 't making the fixes he 's required to make 
 veronica came back in a few months later
  agreed to all of those treatment plans  
 she told us that her symptoms had improved by ninety percent 
 she was spending more time at work and with her family and less time shuttling back and forth between the emergency rooms of los angeles  
 veronica had improved remarkably 
 her sons one of whom had asthma  were no longer as sick as they used to be she had gotten better and not coincidentally veronica 's home was better too
 what was it about this different approach we tried that led to
 better care 
 fewer visits to the e r better health well quite simply it started with that question veronica where do you live 
 but more importantly it was that we put in place a system that allowed us to routinely ask questions to veronica and hundreds more like her about the conditions that mattered in her community
 about where health and unfortunately sometimes illness do begin in places like south l a 
 in that community  substandard housing and food insecurity are the major conditions that we as a clinic had to be aware of but in other communities it could be transportation barriers obesity access to parks  
 gun violence the
 important thing is we put in place a system
 that worked and it 's an approach that i call an upstream approach
  a term many of you are familiar with  it comes from a parable that 's very common in the public health community 
 this is a parable of three friends imagine that you 're one of these three friends who come to a river it
 's a beautiful scene  but it 's shattered by the cries of a child 
 and actually several children in need of rescue in the water so you do hopefully what everybody would do you jump right in along with your friends the first friend says i 'm going to rescue those who are about to drown
  those at most risk of falling over the waterfall the second friends says i 'm going to build a raft i 'm going to make sure that fewer people need to end up at the waterfall 's edge  let 's usher more people to safety by building this raft coordinating those branches together  
 over time they 're successful but not really as much as they want to be more people slip through  and they finally look up and they see that their third friend is nowhere to be seen 
 they finally spot her she 's in the water she 's swimming away from them upstream  rescuing children
  as she goes  and they shout to her where are you going there are children here to save and she says back i 'm going to find out
 who or what is throwing these children in the water 
 in healthcare
  we have that first friend we have the specialist  we have the trauma surgeon the icu nurse the e r doctors we have those people that are vital
  people you want to be there when you 're in dire straits  we also know that we have the second friend
 we have that raft builder that
 's the primary care clinician 
 people on the care team who are there to manage your chronic conditions your diabetes your hypertension there to give you your annual checkups there to make sure your vaccines are up to date  
 but also there to make sure that you have a raft to sit on
 and usher yourself to safety but while that 's also vital and very necessary what we 're missing is that third friend we don 't have enough of that
 are the health care professionals who know that health does begin
 where we live and work and play but beyond that awareness is able to mobilize the resources to create the system
 in their clinics and in their hospitals that really does
 start to approach that to connect people to the resources they need outside the four walls of the clinic 
  a very obvious question that a lot of colleagues in medicine ask doctors and nurses thinking about transportation and housing 
 shouldn 't we just provide pills and procedures and just make sure we focus on the task at hand certainly  rescuing people
 at the water 's edge
 is important enough work who
 has the time  i would argue though that if we were to use science as our guide that we would find an upstream approach is absolutely necessary  scientists now know that
 the living and working conditions that we all are part of
  have more than twice the impact on our health than does our genetic code  
 and living and working conditions  the structures of our environments the ways in which our social fabric is woven together and the impact those have on our behaviors all together those 
  have more than five times the impact on our health than do all the pills and procedures administered by doctors and hospitals combined
  all together living and working conditions account for sixty percent of preventable death let
 me give you an example of what this feels like let 's say there was a company a tech startup
 that came to you and said we have a great product it 's going to lower your risk of death from heart disease 
 now you might be likely to invest if that product was a drug or a device  
 but what if that product was a park 
  a landmark study that reviewed the records of over forty million residents in the u k looked at several variables  controlled for a lot of factors and found that
 when trying to adjust the risk of heart disease 
 one 's exposure to green space was a powerful influence 
 the closer you were to green space to parks and trees the lower your chance of heart disease  and that stayed true for rich and for poor
  that study illustrates what my friends in public health often say these days that one 's zip code matters more than your genetic code we
 're also learning that zip code is actually shaping our genetic code  
 the science of epigenetics looks at looks at those molecular mechanisms those intricate ways in which our dna is literally shaped  genes turned on and off based on the exposures to the environment to where we live and to where we work 
 so it 's clear
  upstream issues do matter 
 they matter to our health and therefore our healthcare professionals should do something about it and yet veronica asked me perhaps the most compelling question i 've been asked in a long time  
 in that follow up visit she said 
 why did none of my doctors
 ask about my home before 
 in those visits to the emergency room  
 i had two cat scans  i had a needle placed in the lower part of my back to collect spinal fluid  i had nearly a dozen blood tests i went back and forth i saw all sorts of people
  healthcare  and no one asked about my home 
 the honest answer is that in healthcare we often treat symptoms without addressing the conditions that make you sick in the first place and
 there are many reasons for that but the big three
 are first  we don 't pay for that 
 in healthcare we often pay for volume and not value we pay doctors and hospitals usually for the number of services they provide
  not necessarily on how healthy they make you 
 that leads to a second phenomenon that i call the don 't ask don 't tell approach to upstream issues in healthcare  
 we don 't ask about where you live and where you work because if there 's a problem there  we don 't know what to tell you it
 's not that doctors don 't know these are important issues in a recent survey done in the u s among physicians
  thousand physicians eighty percent of them actually said that they know that their patients ' upstream problems are as important as their health issues as their medical problems 
 and yet despite that widespread awareness of the importance of upstream issues  only one in five doctors said they had any sense of confidence to address those issues 
 to improve health where it begins  
 there 's this gap between knowing that patients ' lives  the context of where they live and work  matters
  the ability to do something about it in the systems in which we work this is a huge problem right now
 because it leads them to this next question which is whose responsibility is it and that brings me to that third point that third answer to veronica 's compelling question 
 part of the reason that we have this conundrum is because there are not nearly enough upstreamists in the healthcare system 
 there are not nearly enough of that third friend that person who is going to find out who or what is throwing those kids in the water  
 now there are many
 upstreamists and i 've had the privilege of meeting many of them in los angeles and in other parts of the country and around the world and
 it 's important to note that upstreamists sometimes are doctors but they need not be 
 they can be nurses other clinicians care managers  social workers it 's not so important what specific degree upstreamists have at the end of their name
  what 's more important is that they all seem to share
 the same ability to implement a process that transforms their assistance transforms the way they practice medicine
 that process is a quite simple process it 's one two and three 
 first they sit down and they say  let 's identify the clinical problem among a certain set of patients let 's say for instance  let 's try to help
 children who are bouncing in and out of the hospital
  that second step and they say let 's identify the root cause 
 now  a root cause analysis in healthcare  usually says well let 's look at your genes let 's look at how you 're
 behaving maybe you 're not eating healthy enough eat healthier it 's a
 pretty simplistic approach to root cause analyses it turns out it doesn 't really work when we just limit ourselves that worldview  
 the root cause analysis that an upstreamist brings to the table is to say let 's look at the living and the working
  conditions
 in your life  
 perhaps for children with asthma  it 's what 's happening in their home or perhaps they live close to a freeway with major air pollution that triggers their asthma  
 and perhaps that 's what we should mobilize our resources to address because that third element that third part of the process is that next critical part of what upstreamists do 
 they mobilize the resources to create a solution both within the clinical system 
 and then by bringing in people from public health
  from other sectors lawyers whoever is willing to play ball  let 's bring in to create a solution that makes sense to take those patients who actually have clinical problems
 and address their root causes together by linking them to the resources you need it
 's clear to me that there are so many stories of upstreamists who are doing remarkable things  the problem is that there 's just not nearly enough of them out there 
  for every twenty to thirty clinicians in the healthcare system in the u s for instance that would mean that we need twenty five thousand upstreamists by the year two thousand and twenty 
 but we only have a few thousand upstreamists out there right now by all accounts  
 and that 's why a few years ago my colleagues and i said you know what we need to train and make more upstreamists 
 so we decided to start an organization called health begins  and health begins simply does that we train
  that we use for our success but the main thing that we 're interested in is making sure that we 're changing
 the sense of confidence that don 't ask don 't tell metric among clinicians  we 're trying to make sure that clinicians and therefore their systems that they work in
 have the ability  the confidence to address
 the problems in the living and working conditions in our lives  we 're seeing nearly a tripling of that confidence in our work  it 's remarkable
 'll tell you the most compelling part of what it means to be working with upstreamists to gather them together 
 what is most compelling is that every day every week  i hear stories just like veronica 's 
 there are stories out there of veronica and many more like her people who are coming to the healthcare system and getting a glimpse of what it feels like to be part of something that works
  system that stops bouncing you back and forth but actually improves your health listens to you who you are addresses the context of your life  
 whether you 're rich or poor or middle class 
 these stories are compelling because not only do they tell us that we 're this close to getting the healthcare system that we want  but that there 's something that we can all do to get there
  doctors and nurses can get better at asking about the context of patients ' lives not simply because it 's better bedside manner  but frankly because it 's a better standard of care 
 healthcare systems and payers
 can start to
 bring in public health agencies and departments and say  let 's look at our data together  let 's see if we can discover some patterns in our data
 about our patients ' lives and see if we can identify an upstream cause  and then as importantly  can we align the resources to be able to address them medical schools nursing schools
  all sorts of health professional education programs
 can help by training the next generation of upstreamists 
 we can also make sure that these schools certify a backbone of the upstream approach and that 's the community health worker  
 we need many more of them in the healthcare system if we 're truly going to have it be effective to move from a sickcare system to a healthcare system 
 but finally and perhaps most importantly  what do we do what do we do as patients
 we can start by simply going to our doctors and our nurses to our clinics 
 and asking is there something in where i live and where i work that i should be aware of are there barriers to health that i 'm just not aware of 
 and more importantly if there are barriers that i 'm surfacing if i 'm coming to you and i 'm saying i think have a problem with my apartment or at my workplace or i don 't have
  to transportation or there 's a park that 's way too far so sorry doctor i can 't take your advice to
 go and jog  if those problems exist then doctor are you willing to listen 
 and what can we do together to improve my health where it begins if we 're all able to
 do this work doctors and healthcare systems payers and all of us together we 'll realize something about health 
 health is not just a personal responsibility or phenomenon 
 health is a common good
 it comes from our personal investment in knowing that our lives matter  the context of where we live and where we work  eat and sleep matter  
 and that what we do for ourselves we also should do for those
 whose living and working conditions again can be hard if not harsh  we can all invest in making sure that we
  the allocation of resources upstream  but at the same time work together and show that we can move healthcare
 upstream we can improve health
 where it begins
