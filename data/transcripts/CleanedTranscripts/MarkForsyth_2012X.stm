  one of my favorite words in the whole of the oxford english dictionary is snollygoster 
 just because it sounds so good  and what snollygoster means is a dishonest politician 
 although there was a
  newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said a snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office regardless of party  platform or principle 
 and who when he wins  gets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumnancy 
 now i have no idea what talknophical is  something to do with words i assume but
 it 's very important that words are at the center of politics and all politicians know they have to try and control language it wasn 't until
 that the british parliament allowed
 newspapers to report the exact words that were said in the debating chamber  
 and this was actually all down to the bravery of a guy with the extraordinary name of brass crosby 
 who took on parliament and he was thrown into the tower of london and imprisoned
  but he was brave enough 
 he was brave enough to take them on and in the end he had such popular support in london that he won and it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase as bold as brass 
 most people think that 's down to the metal it 's not it 's down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press  
 but to really show you how
 words and politics interact i want to take you back to the united states of america just after they 'd achieved independence 
 and they had to face the question of what to call george washington  their leader they didn 't know  what do you call the leader of a republican country 
 and this was debated in congress for ages and ages and there were all sorts of suggestions on the table which might have made it i mean some people wanted him to be called
  protector of the liberties of the people of the united states of america washington not that catchy  
 some people just wanted to call him king it was tried and tested they weren 't even being monarchical they had the idea that you could be elected king for a fixed term 
 and you know it could have worked
  and everybody got insanely bored because this debate went on for three weeks i read a diary of this poor senator
  who just keeps coming back still on this subject and the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the house of representatives were against the senate the
 house of representatives didn 't want washington to get drunk on power they didn 't want to call him king in case that gave him ideas or his successor ideas  
 so they wanted to give him the humblest 
  they didn 't invent the title i mean it existed before but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting it was like the foreman of the jury and it didn 't have much more grandeur than the term foreman or overseer there were occasional presidents of little colonial councils and bits of
  it was really a nothing title  and that 's why the senate objected to it they said that 's ridiculous you can 't call him ' president '
 this guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries  who 's going to take him seriously if he 's got a silly little title like ' president of the united states of america ' 
 laughter and after three weeks of debate in the end 
 the senate did not cave in instead they agreed to
  use the title president for now  but they also wanted it
 absolutely set down that they didn 't agree with it 
 from a a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations whether under republican or monarchical forms of government  whose custom it is to annex
  the office of the chief magistrate titles of respectability
 not bloody president and that in the intercourse with foreign nations the majesty
 of the people of the united states may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity i e we
 don 't want to look like bloody weirdos now 
 you can learn three interesting things from this first of all and this is my favorite is that so far as i 've ever been able to find out the
  has never formally endorsed the title of president  barack obama president obama is there on borrowed time just waiting
 for the senate to spring into action the
 second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure 
 you can still be waiting two hundred and
  the third thing you can learn and this is the really important one the point i want to leave you on
 is that
 the title president of the united states of america doesn 't sound that humble at all these days does it 
 something to do with the slightly over five thousand nuclear warheads he has at his disposal and the
 largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff reality
 and history have endowed
 that title with grandeur  and so the senate won in the end they got their title of respectability 
 and also the senate 's other worry the appearance of singularity well it was a singularity back then  but now do you know how many nations have a president a hundred and
  all because they want to sound like the guy who 's got the five thousand nuclear warheads etc  
 and so in the end  the senate won and the house of representatives lost 
 because nobody 's going to feel that humble when they 're told that they are now the president of the united states of america  
 and that 's the important lesson i think you can take away and the one i want to leave you with politicians try to pick and use words to shape
  and control reality  but in fact reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality
