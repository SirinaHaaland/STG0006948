  we humans have always been very concerned about the health of our bodies  but we haven 't always been that good at figuring out what 's important 
 take the ancient egyptians for example  very concerned about the body parts they thought they 'd need in the afterlife  
 but they left some parts out
  part for example  
 although they very carefully preserved the stomach the lungs the liver and so forth  they just mushed up the brain drained it out through the nose  and threw it away  
 which makes sense really because what does a brain do for us anyway  
 but imagine if there were a kind of neglected organ in our bodies that weighed just as much as the brain and in some ways was just as important to who we are but we knew so little about
  and treated with such disregard  and imagine if through new scientific advances we were just beginning to understand its importance
 to how we think of ourselves wouldn 't you want to know more about it  well  it turns out that we do have something just like that 
 our gut or rather its microbes 
  but it 's not just the microbes in our gut that are important microbes all over our body turn out to be really critical to a whole range of differences that make different people who we are 
 so
 for example  have you ever noticed how some people get bitten by mosquitos way more often than others 
 it turns out that everyone 's anecdotal experience out camping is actually true  
 for example i seldom get bitten by mosquitos but my partner amanda
  and the reason why is that we have different microbes on our skin that produce different chemicals that the mosquitos detect 
 now microbes are also really important in the field of medicine so for example what microbes you have in your gut
 determine whether particular painkillers are toxic to your liver  they also determine whether or not other drugs will work for your heart condition 
 and if you 're a fruit fly at least
  your microbes determine who you want to have sex with we haven 't demonstrated this in humans yet but maybe it 's just a matter of time before we find out 
 so microbes are performing a huge range of functions they help us digest our food  
 they help educate our immune system  they help us resist disease  and they may even be affecting our behavior  
 so what would a map of all these microbial communities look like well it wouldn 't look exactly like this but it 's a helpful guide for understanding biodiversity
  different parts of the world have different landscapes of organisms that are immediately characteristic of one place or another
 or another 
 with microbiology it 's kind of the same although i 've got to be honest with you all the microbes essentially look the same under a microscope  so instead of trying to identify them visually 
 we do is we look at their dna sequences and in a project called the human microbiome project
 nih funded this $ one hundred and seventy three million project where hundreds of researchers came together
 to map out all the a 's t 's g 's and c 's and all of these microbes in the human body  so when we take them together they look like this 
 it 's a bit more difficult to tell who lives where now isn 't it 
 what my lab does
  computational techniques that allow us to take all these terabytes of sequence data
 and turn them into something that 's a bit more useful as a map  
 and so when we do that with the human microbiome data from two hundred and fifty healthy volunteers it looks like this 
 each point here represents all the complex microbes in an entire microbial community see i told you they basically all look the same 
 so what we 're looking at is each point represents one microbial community from one body site of one healthy volunteer and
  you can see that there 's different parts of the map in different colors 
 almost like separate continents  and what it turns out to be is that those as the different regions of the body have very different microbes in them 
 so what we have is we have the oral community up there in green over on the other side we have the skin community in blue the vaginal community
 in purple  and then right
  we have the fecal community in brown  
 and we 've just over the last few years found out that the microbes in different parts of the body are amazingly different from one another  
 so if i look at just one person 's microbes in the mouth and in the gut 
 it turns out that the difference between those two microbial communities is enormous it 's bigger than the difference between the microbes
 in this reef
 and the microbes in this prairie
  so this is incredible when you think about it what it means is that a few feet of difference in the human body makes more of a difference to your microbial ecology than hundreds of miles on earth  
 and this is not to say that two people look basically the same in the same body habitat either  so
 you probably heard that we 're pretty much all the same in terms of our human dna you 're ninety nine point nine nine percent identical in terms of your human dna to the person sitting next to you 
 but that 's not true of your gut microbes you might
  only share ten percent similarity with the person sitting next to you in terms of your gut microbes so that 's as different as the bacteria on this prairie
 and the bacteria in this forest  
 so these different microbes have all these different kinds of functions that i told you about everything from digesting food to
 involvement in different kinds of diseases metabolizing drugs and so forth  so how do they do all this stuff
 in part it 's because although there 's just three pounds of those microbes in our gut they really outnumber us  
 and so how much do they outnumber us well  it depends on what you think of as our bodies is it our cells  
 well each of us consists of about ten trillion human cells  but we harbor as many as one hundred trillion microbial cells  so they outnumber us ten to one 
 now  you might think well
  human because of our dna  
 but it turns out that each of us has about twenty thousand human genes depending on what you count exactly but as many as two million to twenty million microbial genes  
 so whichever way we look at it we 're vastly outnumbered by our microbial symbionts  
 and it turns out that in addition to traces of our human dna  we also leave traces of our microbial dna on everything we touch we showed in a study
  a few years ago that you can actually match the palm of someone 's hand up to the computer mouse that they use routinely with up to ninety five percent accuracy  
 so this came out in a scientific journal a few years ago  but more importantly  it was featured on csi miami so you really know it 's true 
 so where do our microbes come from in the first place well if as i do you have dogs or kids you probably have some dark suspicions about that
 all of which are true by the way so just like we can match you to your computer equipment by the microbes you share we can also match you up to your dog
  but it turns out that in adults microbial communities are relatively stable  so even if you live together with someone you
 'll maintain your separate microbial identity over a period of weeks months even
  it turns out that our first microbial communities depend a lot on how we 're born so babies that come out the regular way all of their microbes are basically like the vaginal community  whereas babies that are delivered by c section 
 all of their microbes instead look like skin  
 and this might be associated with some of the differences in health associated with cesarean birth 
 such as more asthma more allergies even more obesity  all of which have been linked to microbes now  
 and when you think about
  until recently every surviving mammal had been delivered by the birth canal
 and so the lack of those protective microbes that we 've co evolved with might be really important for a lot of these different conditions that we now know involve the microbiome 
 when my own daughter was born a
 couple of years ago by emergency c section we took matters into our own hands and made sure she was coated with those vaginal microbes that she would have gotten naturally
  now  it 's really difficult to tell whether this has had an effect on her health specifically right 
 with a sample size of just one child  no matter how much we love her you don 't really have enough of a sample size to figure out what happens on average  
 but at two years old she hasn 't had an ear infection yet so we 're keeping our fingers crossed on that one  
 and what 's more we 're starting to do clinical trials with more children to figure out whether this has a protective effect generally
 so how we 're born has a tremendous effect  on what microbes we have initially but where do we go after that 
 what i 'm showing you again here is this map of the human microbiome project data  so each point represents a sample from one body site from one of two hundred and fifty healthy adults  
 and you 've seen children
  you 've seen them develop mentally now for the first time you 're going to see one of my colleague 's children develop 
  to look at is we 're going to look at this one baby 's stool the fecal community  which represents the gut  sampled every week for almost two and a half years  
 and so we 're starting on day one what 's going to happen is that the infant is going to start off as this yellow dot  
 and you can see that he 's starting off basically in the vaginal community as we would expect from his delivery mode
  over these two and a half years is that he 's going to travel all the way down
 to resemble the adult fecal community from healthy volunteers down at the bottom  so i 'm just going to start this going and we 'll see how that happens  
 what you can see and
 remember each step in this is just one week what you can see is that week to week the change in the microbial community of the feces of this one child 
 the differences week to week are much greater than
  the differences between individual healthy adults in the human microbiome project cohort  
 which are those brown dots down at the bottom  
 and you can see he 's starting to approach the adult fecal community this is up to about two years  but something amazing is about to happen here so he 's getting antibiotics
 for an ear infection what you can see is this huge change in the community  followed by a relatively
  just rewind that for you  and
 what we can see is that just over these few weeks  we have a much more radical change a setback of many months of normal development  followed by a relatively rapid recovery  
 and by the time he reaches
 day eight hundred and thirty eight which is the end of this video  you can see that he has essentially reached the healthy adult stool community  despite
  so this is really interesting because it raises fundamental questions about what happens when we intervene at different ages in a child 's life   so does what we do early on where the microbiome is changing so 
  rapidly actually matter or is it like throwing a stone into a stormy sea where the ripples will just be lost  
  months of life they 're more likely to become obese later on than if they don 't get antibiotics then or only get them later  and so
 what we do early on may have profound impacts on the gut microbial community and on later health that we 're only beginning to understand
 so this is fascinating because one day in addition to the effects that antibiotics have on antibiotic resistant bacteria which are very important  they may also be degrading our gut microbial ecosystems  and so one day we may come to regard antibiotics with the same
  horror that we currently reserve for those metal tools that the egyptians used to use to mush up the brains before they drained them out for embalming
 so i mentioned that microbes have all these important functions and they 've also now just over the past few years been connected to a whole range of different diseases
 including inflammatory bowel disease  heart disease colon cancer and even
  obesity has a really large effect as it turns out  and today we can tell whether you 're lean or obese with ninety percent accuracy by looking at the microbes in your gut
  now although that might sound impressive in some ways it 's a little bit problematic as a medical test  because you can probably tell which of these people is obese without knowing anything about their gut microbes
  but it turns out that even if we sequence their complete genomes and had
  we could only predict which one was obese with about sixty percent accuracy  
 so that 's amazing right  what it means that the three pounds of microbes that you carry around with you may be more important for some health conditions than every single gene in your genome  
 and then in mice we can do a lot more so in mice microbes have been linked to all kinds of additional conditions including things
  but how can we tell whether these microbial differences that correlate with disease are cause or effect 
 well one thing we can do is we can raise some mice without any microbes of their own in a germ free bubble then we can add in some microbes that we think are important  and see what happens 
 when we take the microbes from an obese mouse and transplant them into a genetically normal mouse that 's been raised in a bubble with no microbes of its own
 it becomes fatter
  fatter than if it got them from a regular mouse 
 why this happens is absolutely amazing though sometimes what 's going on is that the microbes are helping them digest food more efficiently from the same diet  
 so they 're taking more energy from their food but other times the microbes are actually affecting their behavior  
 what they 're doing is they 're eating more than the normal mouse  so they only get fat if we let them eat as much as they want
  this is really remarkable  right the implication is that microbes can affect mammalian behavior  
 so you might be wondering whether we can also do this sort of thing across species  and it turns out that if you take microbes from an obese person and 
  transplant them into mice you 've raised germ free those mice will also become fatter than if they received the microbes from a lean person
  microbial community that we inoculate them with that prevents them from gaining this weight 
 we can also do this for malnutrition so in a project funded by the gates foundation 
 what we 're looking at is children in malawi who have kwashiorkor a profound form of malnutrition 
 and mice that get the kwashiorkor community transplanted into them lose thirty percent of their body mass in just three weeks  
 but we can restore their health by using the same peanut
 butter based supplement that is used for the children in the clinic  and the mice that receive the community from the healthy identical twins of the kwashiorkor children do fine 
 this is truly amazing because it suggests that we can pilot therapies by trying them out in a whole bunch of different mice with individual people 's gut communities and perhaps tailor those therapies all the way down to the
  so i think it 's really important that everyone has a chance to participate in this discovery  
 so a couple of years ago  we started this project called american gut which allows you to claim a place for yourself on this microbial map 
 this is now the largest crowd funded science project that we know of over eight thousand people have signed up at this point what happens is they send in their samples we sequence the dna of their microbes and then release the results back to them  we also release
  them de identified to scientists to educators to interested members of the general public  and so forth so anyone can have access to the data
  on the other hand when we do tours of our lab at the biofrontiers institute  and we explain that we use robots and lasers to look at poop  it turns out that not everyone wants to know 
 but i 'm guessing that many of you do and so i brought some kits here
 if you 're interested in trying this out for yourself  
 so why might we want to do this well it turns out that microbes are not just important for finding out
 where we are in terms of our health but they can actually cure disease this is one of the newest things we 've been able to visualize with colleagues at the university of minnesota 
  so here 's that map of the human microbiome again  what we 're looking at now i 'm going to add in the community of some people with c diff  
 so this is a terrible form of diarrhea where you have to go up to twenty times a day and these people have failed antibiotic therapy for two years before they 're eligible for this trial  
 so what would happen if we transplanted some of the stool
 from a healthy donor that star down at the bottom into these patients
  would the good microbes do battle with the bad microbes and help to restore their health 
 so let 's watch exactly what happens there 
 four of those patients are about to get a transplant from that healthy donor at the bottom  
 and what you can see is that immediately you have this radical change in the gut community so one day after you do that transplant 
 all those symptoms clear up the diarrhea vanishes  and they 're essentially healthy again  coming to resemble the donor 's community
  just at the beginning of this discovery we 're just finding out that microbes have implications for all these different kinds of diseases  ranging from inflammatory bowel disease to obesity  and perhaps even autism and depression
  what we need to do though is we need to develop a kind of microbial
  just know where we are currently but also
 where we want to go and what we need to do in order to get there  and we need to be able to make this simple enough that even a child can use it
