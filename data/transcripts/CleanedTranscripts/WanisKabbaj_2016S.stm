  some people are obsessed by french wines  others love playing golf or devouring literature 
 one of my greatest pleasures in life is i have to admit a bit special
  i cannot tell you how much i enjoy
 watching cities from the sky from an airplane window some cities are calmly industrious like dusseldorf
 or louisville  
 others project an energy that they can hardly contain like new york or hong kong  
 and then you have paris
 or
  and their patina full of history  
 i see cities as living beings  and when i discover them from far above  
 i like to find those main streets and highways that structure their space 
 especially at night when commuters make these arteries look dramatically red and golden 
 the city 's vascular system
 performing its vital function right before your eyes  but
 when i 'm sitting in my
  car
 after an hour and a half of commute every day  that reality looks very different nothing
 not public radio no podcast not even mindfulness meditation makes this time worth living 
 isn 't it absurd that we created cars that can reach one hundred and thirty miles per hour and we now drive them
  at the same speed as 19th century horse carriages 
 in the us alone  we spent  twenty nine point six billion hours commuting in two thousand and fourteen 
 with that amount of time  ancient egyptians could have built  twenty six pyramids of giza 
  we do that in one year a monumental waste of time  energy and human potential 
 for decades our remedy for congestion was simple  build new roads or enlarge existing ones  
 and it worked it worked admirably
 for paris when the city tore down hundreds of historical buildings to create
  more established urban centers  significant network expansions are almost impossible  habitat is just too dense  real estate  too expensive
 and public finances too fragile  
 our city 's vascular system is getting clogged it 's getting sick and we should pay attention our current way of thinking is not
  for our transportation to flow we need a new source of inspiration 
 so after sixteen years working in transportation my aha moment happened when speaking with a biotech customer  
 she was telling me how her treatment was leveraging specific properties of our vascular system wow i thought our vascular system
 all the veins and arteries in our body making
 miracles of logistics every day
  this is the moment i realized that biology has been in the transportation business for billions of years 
 it has been testing countless solutions to move nutrients  gases and proteins 
 it really is the world 's most sophisticated transportation laboratory 
 so what if
 the solution to our traffic challenges
 was inside us
  i wanted to know why is it that blood flows in our veins most of our lives when our big cities get clogged
 on a daily basis and the reality
 is that you 're looking at two very different networks
  i don 't know if you realize  but each of us has sixty thousand miles of blood vessels in our bodies sixty thousand miles that
  inside you 
 what it means is that blood vessels are everywhere inside us 
 not just under the surface of our skin  
 but if you look at our cities  
 yes we have some underground subway systems and some tunnels and bridges  and also some helicopters in the sky  
 but the vast majority of our traffic is focused on the ground on the surface 
 so in other words
  our vascular system
 uses the three dimensions inside us our urban transportation is mostly two dimensional 
 and so what we need is to embrace that verticality if our surface grid is saturated well let 's elevate our traffic 
 this chinese concept of a bus that can straddle traffic jams
  on new ways to think about space and movement inside our cities
 and we can go higher  and suspend our transportation like we did with our electrical grid 
 tel aviv and abu dhabi are talking about testing these futuristic networks of suspended magnetic pods 
 and we can keep climbing  and fly  
 the fact that a company like airbus is now seriously working on flying urban taxis
 is telling us something  flying cars are finally moving from science fiction dj vu
 to attractive  business case territory  and that 's an exciting moment 
 so building this 3 d transportation network is one of the ways we can mitigate and solve traffic jams
  but it 's not the only one  we have to question
 other fundamental choices that we made like the vehicles we use 
 just imagine a very familiar scene you 've been driving for for forty two minutes  the two kids behind you are getting restless 
 and you 're late  
 do you see that slow car in front of you  always comes when you 're late right 
 that driver
  is looking for parking there is no parking spot available in the area but how would he know 
 it is estimated that up to thirty percent of urban traffic
 is generated by drivers looking for parking 
 do you see the one hundred cars around you
 eighty five of them only have one passenger those eighty five drivers could all fit in one londonian red bus 
 so the question is why are we wasting so much space if it is what we need the most why are we doing this to ourselves
 biology would never do this space inside our arteries is fully utilized 
 at every heartbeat a higher blood pressure literally compacts millions of red blood cells
 into massive trains of oxygen that quickly flow throughout our body and the tiny space inside our red blood cells is not wasted
  percent of their oxygen capacity is utilized can you imagine if the vehicles we used in our cities were ninety five percent full 
 all the additional space you would have to walk to bike and to enjoy our cities  
 the reason blood is so incredibly efficient
 is that our red blood cells are not dedicated to specific organs or tissues  otherwise we would probably have traffic jams in our veins
  shared  they 're shared by all the cells of our body  
 and because our network is so extensive  each one of our thirty seven trillion cells gets its own deliveries of oxygen precisely when it needs them 
 blood is both a collective
 and and individual form of transportation but for our cities  we 've been stuck  we 've been stuck in an endless debate between creating
  a car centric society or extensive mass transit systems i think we should transcend this i think we can create
 vehicles that combine the convenience of cars
 and the efficiencies of trains and buses just imagine you 're comfortably sitting in a fast and smooth urban train  along with one thousand two
  the problem with urban trains is that
 sometimes you have to stop five  ten fifteen times before your final destination
  what if in this train you didn 't have to stop in this train  wagons can detach dynamically while you 're moving
 and become express driverless buses that move on a secondary road network 
 and so without a single stop  nor a lengthy transfer you are now sitting in a bus that is headed
  your suburb  and when you get close  the section you 're sitting in
 detaches and self drives you right to your doorstep 
 it is collective and individual at the same time this could be one of the shared  modular driverless vehicles of tomorrow 
 now
  as if walking in a city buzzing with drones flying taxis modular buses and suspended magnetic pods
 was not exotic enough  i think there is another force in action that will make urban traffic mesmerizing 
 if you think about it the current generation of driverless cars
 is just trying to earn its way into a traffic grid made by and for humans they 're trying to learn traffic rules which is relatively simple
 and coping with human unpredictability which is more challenging  
 but what would happen when whole cities become driverless 
 would we need traffic lights would we need lanes  how about speed limits 
 red blood cells are not flowing in lanes  they never stop at red lights in the first driverless cities you would have no red lights and no lanes  
 and when all the cars
  are driverless and connected  everything is predictable and reaction time minimum they can drive much faster
 and can take any rational initiative that can speed them up or the cars around them 
 so instead of rigid traffic rules  flow will be regulated by a mesh of dynamic
  the result a strange traffic that mixes the fast and smooth rigor of german autobahns
 and the creative vitality of the intersections of mumbai traffic
 will be functionally exuberant it will be liquid like our blood and by a strange paradox the more robotized our traffic grid will be 
 the more organic and alive its movement will feel
  so
 yes  biology has all the attributes of a transportation genius today  
 but this process has taken billions of years and went through all sorts of iterations and mutations 
 we can 't wait billions of years to evolve our transportation system 
 we now have the dreams  the concepts
 and the the technology to create
  vehicles and change the flow in our cities  let 's do it thank you
