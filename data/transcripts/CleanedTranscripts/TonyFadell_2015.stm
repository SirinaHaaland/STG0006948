  there 's a scene where john belushi
 goes to visit dan aykroyd in his apartment in chicago for the very first time  it 's a cramped tiny space
 and it 's just three feet away from the train tracks
  as john sits on dan 's bed a train goes rushing by  rattling everything in the room john asks how often does that train go by 
 dan replies so often you won 't even notice it and then something falls off the wall 
 we all know what he 's talking about as human beings we get used to everyday things really fast
 as a product designer it 's my job to see those everyday things to feel them  and try to improve upon them 
 for example see this piece of fruit  
 see this little sticker  that sticker wasn 't there when i was a kid 
 but somewhere as the years passed someone had the bright idea to put that sticker on the fruit
 so it could be easier for us to check out at the grocery counter  well that 's great we can get in and out of the store quickly but now there 's a new problem when
 we get home and we 're hungry and we see this ripe juicy piece of fruit on the counter  we just want to pick it up and eat it 
 except now  we have to look for this little sticker  and dig at it with our nails
  the flesh then rolling up that sticker you know what i mean  and then trying to flick it off your fingers it 's not
 fun not at all 
 but something interesting happened  see the first time you did it  you probably felt those feelings you just wanted to eat the piece of fruit
 by the 10th time you started to become less less upset and you just started peeling the label off 
 by the 100th time at least for me  i became numb to it  i simply picked up the piece of fruit  
 dug at it with my nails tried to flick it off  and then wondered
  was there another sticker 
 so why is that why do we get used to everyday things well
 as human beings  we have limited brain power  and so our brains encode the everyday things we do into habits
 so we can free up space to learn new things  it 's a process called habituation
 and it 's one of the most basic ways as humans we learn 
 now habituation isn 't always bad
 remember learning to drive i sure do  
 your hands clenched at ten and two on the wheel  
 looking at every single object out there the cars  the lights the pedestrians it 's a nerve wracking experience 
 so much so that i couldn 't even talk to anyone else in the car and i couldn 't even listen to music  but then something interesting happened  as the weeks
  went by  driving became easier and easier you habituated it 
 it started to become fun and second nature  
 and then you could talk to your friends again and listen to music  so there 's a good reason why our brains habituate things if we didn 't we 'd notice every little detail all the
  would be exhausting and we 'd have no time to learn about new things  
 but sometimes  habituation isn 't good 
 if it stops us from noticing the problems that are around us well that 's bad  
 and if it stops us from noticing and fixing those problems well then that 's really bad 
 comedians know all about this jerry seinfeld 's entire career was built on noticing those little details
  those idiotic things we do every day that we don 't even remember 
 he tells us about the time he visited his friends and he just wanted to take a comfortable shower  he 'd reach out and grab the handle and turn it slightly one way and it was one hundred degrees too hot  
 and then he 'd turn it the other way and it was one hundred degrees too cold he just wanted a comfortable shower  now we 've all been there
  we just don 't remember it  but jerry did  and that 's a comedian 's job  
 but designers innovators and entrepreneurs  it 's our job to not just notice those things  but to go one step further and try to fix them  
 see this this person this is mary anderson in one thousand nine hundred and two in new york
  she was visiting  it was a cold wet snowy day and she was warm inside a streetcar 
 as she was going to her destination she noticed
 the driver opening the window to clean off
 the the excess snow so he could drive safely when he opened the window though he let all this cold wet air inside making all the passengers miserable
  most of those passengers just thought it 's a fact of life he 's got to open the window to clean it  that 's just how it is 
 but mary didn 't mary thought what if the diver could actually clean the windshield from the inside
 so that he could stay safe and drive and the passengers could actually stay warm so she picked up her sketchbook
  right then and there and began drawing what would become the world 's first windshield wiper 
 now as a product designer  i try to learn from people like mary
 to try to see the world the way it really is not the way we think it is 
 why  because it 's easy to solve a problem that almost everyone sees  
 but it 's hard to solve a problem that almost no one sees  
 now some people think you 're born with this ability or you 're not
 as if mary anderson was hardwired at birth to see the world more clearly 
 that wasn 't the case for me  i had to work at it  
 during my years at apple  steve jobs challenged us
 to come into work every day to see our products through the eyes of the customer the new customer  the one that
  has fears and possible frustrations
 and hopeful exhilaration that their new technology product could work straightaway for them  
 he called it staying beginners  
 and wanted to make sure that we focused on those tiny little details to make them faster easier and seamless for the new customers 
 so i remember this clearly in the very earliest days of the ipod see back in the
 90s being a gadget freak like i am 
 i would rush out to the store for the very very latest gadget  
 i 'd take all the time to get to the store i 'd check out i 'd come back home i 'd start to unbox it  
 and then there was another little sticker  
 the one that said charge before use
  i can 't believe it  i just spent all this time buying this product and now i have to charge before use i have to wait what felt like an eternity to use that coveted new toy it
 was crazy  
 but you know what almost every product back then did that when it had batteries in it  you had to charge it
 before you used it  well steve
  not going to let that happen to our product 
 so what did we do  
 typically when you have a product that has a hard drive in it  you run it for about thirty minutes in the factory to make sure that hard drive 's going to be working years later for the customer after they pull it out of the box 
 what did we do instead  
 we ran that product for over two hours 
  we could make a higher quality product be easy
 to test and make sure it was great for the customer  
 but most importantly  the battery came fully charged right out of the box  ready to use so that customer 
 with all that that exhilaration could just start using the product it was great  and it worked  people liked it today almost
  every product that you get that 's battery powered comes out of the box fully charged even if it doesn 't have a hard drive  
 but back then  we noticed that that detail and we fixed it and now everyone else does that as well 
 no more charge before use 
 so why am i telling you this well it 's seeing the invisible problem  not just the obvious problem that 's important
  not just for product design  but for everything we do  you see there are invisible problems all around us ones we can solve 
 but first we need to see them  to feel them 
 so i 'm hesitant to give you any tips about neuroscience or psychology  there 's far too many experienced people in the ted community who would know much more about that than i ever will
  but let me leave you with a few tips that i do  that we all can do to fight habituation my first tip
 is to look broader  
 you see when you 're tackling a problem  sometimes there are a lot of steps that lead up to that problem  and sometimes a lot of steps after it 
 if you can take a step back
 and look broader  maybe you can change some of those boxes before the
  maybe you can combine them  maybe you can remove them altogether to make that better 
 take thermostats for instance 
 in the 1900s when they first came out they were really simple to use you could turn them up or turn them down  people understood them  
 the energy crisis struck and customers started thinking about how to save energy  
 so what happened  thermostat designers decided to add a new step instead of just turning up and down  you now
  had to program it  so you could tell it the temperature you wanted at a certain time now that seemed great every thermostat had started adding that feature 
 but it turned out
 that no one saved any energy now why is that well people couldn 't
 predict the future they just didn 't know how their weeks would change season to season year to year so no
  one was saving energy and what happened  thermostat designers went back to the drawing board and they focused on that programming step they made better u i s 
 they made better documentation but still years later people were not saving any energy
 because they just couldn 't predict the future  
  algorithm in instead of the programming
 that would simply watch when you turned it up and down  when you liked a certain temperature when you got up or when you went away and you know what it worked  
 people are saving energy without any programming 
 so it doesn 't matter what you 're doing if you take a step back and look at all the boxes maybe there 's a way to remove one or combine them
 so that you can make that process
  much simpler so that 's my first tip look broader for my second tip it 's to look closer 
 one of my greatest teachers was my grandfather 
 he taught me all about the world 
 he taught me how things were built and how they were repaired  the tools and techniques necessary to make a successful project
  remember one story he told me about screws  
 and about how you need to have the right screw for the right job there are many different screws  
 wood screws  metal screws  anchors  concrete screws  the list went on and on 
 our job is to make products that are easy to install for all of our customs themselves without professionals  so what
  did we do  
 i remembered that story that my grandfather told me  
 and so we thought how many different screws can we put in the box was it going to be two three four five  because there 's so many different wall types 
 so we thought about it  we optimized it  and we came up with three different screws to put in the box 
 we thought that was going to solve the problem  but it turned out it
 so we shipped the product and people weren 't having a great experience  
 so what did we do  we went back to the drawing board just instantly after we figured out we didn 't get it right 
 and we designed a special screw a custom screw 
 much to the chagrin of our investors they were like why are you spending so much time on a little screw get out there and sell more
  more if we get this right 
 and it turned out we did 
 with that custom little screw there was just one screw in the box that was easy to mount and put on the wall 
 so if we focus on those tiny details  the ones 
  we may not see and we look at
  or is that the way we 've always done it  maybe there 's a way to get rid of those 
 so my last piece of advice is to think younger 
 every day i 'm confronted with interesting questions from my three young kids they come up with questions like why can 't cars fly around traffic
  those questions are smart my son came to me the other day and i asked him go run out to the mailbox and check it he looked at me 
 puzzled and said why doesn 't the mailbox just check itself and tell us when it has mail
  sometimes we find out we just don 't have the right answers we say 
 son that 's just the way the world works so the more we 're exposed to something the more we get used to it  
 but kids haven 't been around long enough to get used to those things  
 and so when they run into problems they immediately try to solve them  and sometimes they find a better way
  and that way really is better  
 so my advice that we take to heart is to have young people on your team 
 or people with young minds  
 because if you have those young minds  they cause everyone in the room to think younger  picasso once said 
 every child is an artist
  is when he or she grows up is how to remain an artist 
 we all saw the world more clearly when we saw it for the first time before a lifetime of habits got in the way 
 our challenge is to get back there to feel that frustration to see those little details to look broader  look
  and to think younger
 so we can stay beginners  
 it 's not easy it requires us pushing back against one of the most basic ways we make sense of the world 
 but if we do  we could do some pretty amazing things 
 for me  hopefully that 's better product design  
 for you that could mean something else something powerful 
 our challenge is to wake up each
  day and say how can i experience the world better 
 and if we do  
 maybe just maybe we can get rid of these dumb little stickers  
 thank you very much
