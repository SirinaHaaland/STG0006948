  eighteen minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit so i 'm going to dive straight in right at the point where i get this thing to work here we
 go i 'm going to talk about five different things i 'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable  i 'm going to talk about why we have to get
  actually talk about this a bit more than we do i 'm going to talk about feasibility as well of course i 'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging and then i 'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about
 you know how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong namely by actually doing something about it  i 'm going to do that in two steps the first one i 'm going to talk about is
 how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension which i 'm going to define
  thirty years applied to people who are already in middle age when you start to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging namely essentially an elimination of the
 relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year or indeed to get sick in the first place  and of course the last thing i 'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step
  that point of maybe thirty years life extension so i 'm
 going to start with
  i want to ask a question hands up anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria 
 that was easy ok ok hands up anyone in the audience who 's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing  
 ok so we all think malaria is a bad thing that 's very good news because i thought that was what the answer would be now the thing is i would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because 
  of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging and here is that characteristic
  considerably more people than malaria does now i like in an audience in britain especially to talk about the comparison with foxhunting which is something that was banned after a long struggle
  by the government not very many months ago i mean i know i 'm with a
 sympathetic audience here but as we know a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic  and this is actually a rather good comparison it seems to me you know a lot of people said well you know
  city boys have no business telling us
 telling us rural types what to do with our time it 's a traditional part of the way of life and
 we should be allowed to carry on doing it it 's ecologically sound it stops the population explosion of foxes but ultimately the government prevailed in the end because the majority of the british public and certainly the majority of members of parliament 
  came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society  and i think that human aging shares
  of these characteristics in spades what part of this do people not understand  it 's not just about life of course 
 laughter it 's about healthy life  you know
 getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun whether or not dying may be fun  so really this is how i would like to describe it it 's a global trance 
 these are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging  and i mean 
 ok i 'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless there are some good points to be made here things that we ought
  to be thinking about forward planning so that nothing goes too well so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging  but these are completely crazy when you actually
 remember your sense of proportion  you know  these are arguments these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about but the question is are they
  the downside of doing the opposite  namely leaving aging as it is  are these so bad that they outweigh
 condemning one hundred thousand people a day to an unnecessarily early death you know
 if you haven 't got an argument that 's that strong then just don 't waste my time is what i say laughter
 now there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong and here it is people worry about overpopulation
  die to speak of or at least the
 death toll is going to be much lower only from crossing st giles carelessly
  and therefore we 're not going to be able to have many kids and kids are really important to most people and that 's true
  and you know  a lot of people try to fudge this question and give answers like this i don 't agree with those answers i think they basically don 't work  i think it 's true that we will face a dilemma in this respect  we will have to
 decide whether to have
  a low birth rate or a high death rate a high death rate will of course arise from simply rejecting these therapies in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids  
 and i say that that 's fine the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice 
 what 's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future if we vacillate
  and do not actually develop these therapies then we are condemning a whole cohort of people who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies  
 but will not be because we haven 't developed them as quickly as we could we 'll be denying those people an indefinite life span and i consider that that is immoral
  that 's my answer to the overpopulation question  
 right so the next thing is now why should we get a little bit more active on this and the fundamental answer is that the pro aging trance is not as dumb as it looks
  actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging  aging is ghastly  but it 's inevitable  so  you know we 've got to find some way to put it out of our minds and it 's rational to
 do anything that we might want to do to do that  like for example making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all 
 but of course that only works when we have both of these components and as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit
  unclear and we might be in range of doing something about aging this becomes part of the problem this pro aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things and that 's why we have to really
 talk about this a lot evangelize i will go so far as to say quite a lot in order to get people 's attention and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard 
  i 'm going to say about that i 'm now going to talk about
 feasibility  and the fundamental reason i think 
 why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that i 'm giving here a very simple definition aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place  which is to say  metabolism
 this is not a completely tautological statement it 's a reasonable statement aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars and it also happens to us despite the fact that we have a lot of clever
  because those self repair mechanisms are not perfect  so
 basically metabolism which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next 
 has side effects those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology that 's a fine definition  
 so we can put it this way we can say that you know we have this chain of events and there are really two games in town  according to most people with regard to postponing aging they 're what i 'm calling here the gerontology approach
  will intervene late in the day when pathology is becoming evident  and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time and stop the accumulation of side effects from 
 causing the pathology quite so soon of course it 's a very short term ist strategy it 's a losing battle  because the
  is better than cure  but unfortunately the thing is that we don 't understand metabolism very well  in fact we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work even cells we 're not really too good on yet  we 've discovered things like for example 
  interference only a few years ago and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work basically gerontology is a fine approach in the end but it is not an approach whose time has come when we 're talking about intervention 
 so then
  we do about that i mean that 's a fine logic that sounds pretty pretty convincing pretty ironclad doesn 't it  but it isn 't 
 before i tell you why it isn 't i 'm going to go a little bit into what i 'm calling step two 
 just suppose  as i said that we do acquire
 let 's say we do it today for the sake of argument the ability to confer thirty extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age let 's
  i 'm going to call that robust human rejuvenation ok  what would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today or equivalently of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive would actually live in
 order to answer that question you might think it 's simple but it 's not simple we can 't just say well  if they 're young enough to benefit from these therapies then they 'll live thirty years longer that 's the wrong answer  
 and the reason it 's the wrong answer is because of progress there are
  sorts of technological progress really for this purpose there are fundamental major breakthroughs  
 and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs  now  they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames 
 fundamental breakthroughs  very hard to predict how long it 's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough it was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun  and it took us until one thousand nine hundred and three to actually work out how to do it 
  after that things were pretty steady and pretty uniform  i think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight
  we can think really that each one is
 sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one if you like 
  the incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore this is the sort of thing you see after
  a fundamental breakthrough  and you see it in all sorts of technologies computers you can look at a more or less parallel time line happening of course a bit later  you can look at medical care i mean hygiene vaccines antibiotics 
  you know the same sort of time frame  so i think that actually step two that i called a step a moment ago isn 't a step at all 
  though those people are already middle aged when the therapies arrive 
 will be at some sort of cusp they will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further thirty or maybe fifty years  in other words  they will be staying ahead 
  of the game the therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us this is a very important point for me to get across
  people when they hear that i predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to one thousand or more they think that i 'm saying that we 're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so 
  thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to one thousand or more i 'm not saying that at all i 'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough they 'll never be perfect  but we 'll be able to fix the things that
  before we have any 200 year olds and the same for three hundred and four hundred and so on i decided to give this a little name which is longevity escape velocity 
 it seems to get the point across so these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to to live in terms of remaining life
  as measured by their health for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive if you 're already one hundred or even if you 're eighty and an average 80 year old we probably can 't do a lot for you with 
  these therapies because you 're too close to death 's door for the really initial experimental therapies to be good enough for you you won 't be able to withstand them but if you 're only fifty then there 's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and 
  and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense in terms of your youthfulness both physical and mental and in terms of your risk of death from age related causes and of course
 if you 're a bit younger than that then you 're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of  age related causes so this is a genuine
 conclusion that i come to that the first 150 year old we don 't know how old that person is today because we don 't know how long
  i 'm claiming that the first person to live to one thousand subject of course to you know global catastrophes
 is actually probably only about ten years younger than the first 150 year old and that 's quite a thought 
 alright so finally i 'm going to spend the rest of the talk my last seven and a half minutes on
 step one namely how do we actually get to
 this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to
  get to escape velocity  and in order to do that i need to talk about mice a little bit 
 i have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation i 'm calling it robust mouse rejuvenation not very imaginatively  and this is what it is i say we 're going to take a long lived strain of mouse which basically means mice that live about three years on average 
 we do exactly nothing to them until they 're already two years old and then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them and with those therapies
  get them to live on average to their fifth birthday  so in other words we add two years we treble their remaining lifespan  starting from the point that we started the therapies  
 the question then is what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone i talked about earlier for humans which we can now as i 've explained equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape
  what does it mean for the public 's perception of how long it 's going to take for us to get to those things starting from the time we get the mice  and thirdly the question is what will it do to actually how much people want it  
 and
 it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question  and it 's extremely hard to answer one has to be very speculative  and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation that we should simply
 keep our counsel until we know more i say that 's nonsense i say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this we need
  to give our best guess as to the time frame in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can
 assess their priorities  so i say that we have a fifty fifty chance of reaching this rhr milestone robust human rejuvenation within fifteen years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation 
 fifteen years from the robust mouse
  the public 's perception will probably be somewhat better than that the public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are so they 'll probably think it 's five years away they 'll be wrong but that actually won 't matter too much 
 and finally of course  i think it 's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance i spoke about earlier the coping strategy  that will be 
  history at this point because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans since it 's been
  's attitudes and of course that has enormous implications  so in order to tell you now how we 're going to get these mice
 i 'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging i 'm going to use this word damage to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that
 eventually cause pathology  because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes
  the damage itself is caused ongoing ly throughout life starting before we 're born  
 but it is not part of metabolism itself  and this turns out to be useful because we can re draw our original diagram this way we can say that fundamentally the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology 
  tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage  and i 'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment 
  try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology and the reason it 's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate 
 so there 's a third approach  if we look at it this way we can call it the engineering approach and i claim that the engineering approach is
 within range  
 the engineering approach does not intervene in any processes it does not intervene in this process or this one and that 's good because it means that it 's not a losing battle  and it 's something that we are within range of being able to do because it doesn 't involve improving on evolution
  engineering approach simply says let 's go and and periodically repair all of these various types of damage not necessarily repair them completely but repair them quite a lot so that we keep the level 
  of damage down below the threshold that must exist that causes it to be pathogenic we know that this threshold exists  because we don 't get age related diseases until we 're in middle age even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born 
 in range  well this is basically it the point about this slide is actually the bottom  
 if we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging  we will be here all night  because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another this list is just for illustration it is incomplete the
 list on the right is also incomplete it 's a list of types of pathology that are
  just an incomplete list but i would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete this is the list of
 types of thing that qualify as damage side effects of metabolism that cause
 pathology in the end or that might cause pathology  and there are only seven of them
 they 're categories of things of course  but there 's only seven of them cell loss  mutations in chromosomes mutations in the mitochondria and so on
  like to give you an argument for why that
 list is complete 
 of course one can make a biological argument one can say ok what are we made of we 're made of cells and stuff between cells  what can damage accumulate in the answer is long lived molecules 
  because if a short lived molecule undergoes damage but then the molecule is destroyed like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis then the damage is gone too it 's got to be long lived molecules  so these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty
  good news  because it means that you know we 've come a long way in biology in these twenty years  so the fact that we haven 't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there 's no extension to be done  
 however it 's better than that we actually know how to fix them all in mice  in principle and what i mean by in principle is  we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade  some of them are partially implemented already the ones at the top  
 i haven 't got time to go through them at all but
 my conclusion is that if we can actually get suitable funding for this then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only ten years  
 but we do need to get serious about it we do need to really start trying so of course  there are some biologists in the audience  and
 i want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have you may have been dissatisfied with this talk
 but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff i 've published a great deal on this i cite
 the experimental work on which my optimism is based  and there 's quite a lot of detail there the detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that i 'm predicting here so if you think that i 'm wrong you 'd better damn well go and find out why you think i 'm wrong  
 and of course the main thing is that you shouldn 't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field
  you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously  so you know you 've got to actually do your homework in order to understand whether this is true and we 'll just end with a few things 
 one thing is you know you 'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time and everyone said well it 's obviously impossible and
  we have various strategies there 's the methuselah mouse prize  which is basically an incentive to innovate and to do
 to do what you think is going to work and you get money for it if you win  there 's a proposal to actually
 put together an institute this is what 's going to take a bit of money  but i mean look how long does it take to spend that on the war in iraq not very long  ok 
 it 's got to be philanthropic because profits distract
 biotech but
  got a ninety percent chance i think of succeeding in this and i think we know how to do it and i 'll stop there
 because i am an old man  i am actually one hundred and fifty eight audience 
 species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate however as far as
  all the species have evolved to actually die  so when cells divide the telomerase get shorter and eventually
 species die so why does evolution has seems to have selected against
 immortality when it is so advantageous or is evolution just incomplete ag 
 brilliant  thank you for asking a question that i can answer with an uncontroversial answer  i 'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question which
  happen to agree with 
 which is that no aging is not a product of selection evolution [ aging ] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect  
 in other words we have aging because it 's hard work not to have aging you need more genetic pathways more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly  and that carries on being true
 the longer you push it out so to the extent that
 evolution doesn 't matter doesn 't care whether genes are passed on by individuals living a long time or by procreation
  amount of modulation of that which is why different species have different
 lifespans  but that 's why there are no immortal species ca the genes don 't care but we do ag that 's right audience 
 hello i read somewhere that in the last twenty years  the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by ten
  i project that that
 would make me think that i would live until one hundred and twenty if i don 't crash on my motorbike
  that means that i 'm one of your subjects to become a 1 000 year old ag if you 
 your numbers are a bit out the standard numbers are that lifespans
  been growing at between one and two years per decade  so  it 's not quite as good as you might think you might hope but i intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible audience 
 i was told that
 many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo  and that the brain cells last eighty years or so if that is indeed true biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation if there are cells in my body that live all eighty
  as opposed to a typical you know couple of months
