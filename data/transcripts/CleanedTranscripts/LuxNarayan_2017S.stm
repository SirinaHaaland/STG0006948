  joseph keller
 used to jog around the stanford campus and he was struck
 by all the women jogging there as well why did their ponytails swing from side to side like that 
 being a mathematician he set out to understand why
  professor keller was curious about many things why teapots dribble
 or how earthworms wriggle until a few months ago i hadn 't heard of joseph keller 
 i read about him in the new york times 
 in the obituaries 
 the times had half a page of editorial dedicated to him which you can imagine is premium space for a newspaper of their stature  
 i read the obituaries almost every
  day my wife understandably thinks i 'm rather morbid to begin my day with scrambled eggs and a let 's see who died today 
 but if you think about it the front page of the newspaper
 is usually bad news and cues man 's failures an instance where bad news cues accomplishment
  end of the paper in the obituaries 
 in my day job i run a company that focuses on future insights that marketers can derive from past data a kind of
  analysis  and we began to think what if we held a rearview mirror
 to obituaries from the new york times  were there lessons on how you could get your obituary featured
 even if you aren 't around to enjoy it would this go better with scrambled
  eggs 
 and so we looked at the data two thousand
 editorial non paid obituaries over a 20 month period between two thousand and fifteen and two thousand and sixteen 
 what did these two thousand deaths rather lives teach us 
 well first we looked at words this here is an obituary headline this one is of the amazing lee
  kuan yew if you remove the beginning and the end you 're left with a beautifully worded descriptor
 that tries to in just a few words capture an achievement or a lifetime 
 just looking at these is fascinating here are a few famous ones people who died in the last two years try and guess who they are
  so we took these descriptors and did what 's called natural language processing where you feed these into a program it throws out the superfluous words the and the kind of words you can mime easily in charades 
 and leaves you with the most significant
  and we did it not just for these four but for all two thousand descriptors and this is what it looks like 
 film  theatre  music dance and of course  art are huge 
 over forty percent 
 you have to wonder why in so many societies we insist that our kids pursue engineering or medicine or business or law to be construed as successful 
 and while we 're talking profession  let 's look at age the average age at which they achieved things
 that number is  thirty seven 
 what that means is you 've got to wait thirty seven years  
 before your first significant achievement that you 're remembered for on average forty four years later when you die at the age of eighty one on average 
 talk about having to be patient of course it varies by profession if you 're a sports star you 'll probably hit your stride in your
  you 're in your 40s like me 
 you can join the fun world of politics politicians do their first and sometimes only commendable act in their mid 40s 
 if you 're wondering what others are here are some examples  
 isn 't it fascinating the things people do and the things they 're remembered for 
 our curiosity was in overdrive and we desired
 to analyze more than just a descriptor
 so we ingested the entire first paragraph of all two thousand obituaries but we did this separately for two groups of people people that are famous
 and people that are not famous famous people prince ali zaha hadid people who are not famous
 are people
  reverend curry or lorna kelly i 'm willing to bet you haven 't heard
 of most of their names amazing people fantastic achievements but they 're not famous 
 so what if we analyze these two groups separately the famous and the non famous what might that tell us  
 take a look 
 two things leap out at me first
  named john should thank your parents and remind your kids to cut out your obituary when you 're gone and second 
 help 
 we uncovered many lessons from lives  well led and what those people immortalized in print could teach us the exercise
 was a fascinating testament to the kaleidoscope that is life and even
  more fascinating
 was the fact that the overwhelming majority of obituaries featured people famous and non famous who did seemingly extraordinary things 
 they made a positive dent in the fabric of life they helped  
 so ask yourselves as you go back to your daily lives how am i using my talents to help society  because the most powerful lesson here is
  if more people lived their lives trying to be famous in death the world would be a much better place
