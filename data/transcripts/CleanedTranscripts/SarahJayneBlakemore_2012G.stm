  it was widely assumed that the vast majority of brain development takes place in the first few years of life 
 back then fifteen years ago we didn 't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and track development across the lifespan
  in the past decade or so mainly due to advances in brain imaging technology such as magnetic resonance imaging or mri  
 neuroscientists have started to look inside the living human brain of all ages and to track changes in brain structure
 and brain function so we use structural mri
 if you 'd like to take a snapshot a photograph at really high resolution of the inside of the living human brain and we can ask
  questions like how much gray matter does the brain contain and how does that change with age  
 and we also use functional mri called fmri 
 to take a video a movie of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something 
 so many labs around the world are involved in this kind of research and we now have a really rich and detailed picture of how the living human
  brain develops  and this picture has radically changed the way we think about human brain development
 by revealing that it 's not all over in early childhood and instead the brain continues to develop right throughout adolescence and into the ' 20s and ' 30s 
 so adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological hormonal physical changes of puberty
 ends at the age at which an individual attains a stable independent role in society 
 it can go on a long time 
 one of the brain regions that changes most dramatically during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex  so this is
 this is a model of the human brain and this is prefrontal cortex right at the front prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain
  area it 's proportionally much bigger in humans than in any other species  and it 's involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions things like decision making planning planning what you 're going to do tomorrow or next week or next year  
 inhibiting inappropriate behavior so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid 
 it 's also involved in social interaction understanding other people and
 self awareness so mri studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development during the period
 of adolescence  
 so if you look at gray matter volume for example 
 gray matter volume across age from age four to twenty two years increases during childhood which is what you can see on this
  peaks in early adolescence the arrows indicate peak gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex 
 you can see that that peak happens a couple of years later in boys relative to girls and that 's probably because boys go through puberty a couple of years later than girls on average and then during 
  adolescence there 's a significant decline in gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex now that might sound bad but actually this is a really important developmental process  
  cell bodies and connections between cells the synapses  
 and this decline in gray matter volume during prefrontal cortex is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning the elimination of unwanted synapses this is a really 
  important process  it 's partly dependent on the environment that the animal or the human is in
  synapses that are being used are strengthened and synapses that aren 't being used in that particular environment are pruned away you can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush you prune away 
 the weaker branches so that the remaining important branches can grow stronger and this process which effectively 
 brain tissue according to the 
 environment is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions during the period of human adolescence so
  line of inquiry that we use to track changes in the adolescent brain is using functional mri to look at changes in brain activity across age  so i 'll just give you an example 
  from my lab so in my lab  we 're interested in the social brain that is the network of brain regions that we use to understand other people and to interact with other
  so i like to show
 a photograph of a soccer game to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work  so this is a soccer game michael owen has just missed a goal and 
  he 's lying on the ground and the first aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic and instinctive social emotional responses are so within a split 
  second of michael owen missing this goal everyone is doing the same thing with their arms and the same thing with their face even michael owen as he slides along the grass is doing the same
  with his arms and presumably has a similar facial expression and the only people who don 't are the guys in yellow at the back 
 and i think they 're on the wrong end of the stadium and they 're doing another social emotional response that we all instantly recognize and that 's the second aspect of the social brain that this picture really 
  nicely illustrates how good we are at reading other people 's behavior their actions their gestures their facial expressions
  in terms of their underlying emotions and mental states  so you don 't have to ask any of these guys you have a pretty good idea of what they 're feeling and thinking at this precise moment in time so that 's
 what we 're interested in looking at in my lab so in my lab we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people their minds their mental states their emotions 
 and one of the findings that
  we 've found several times now as have other labs around the world is part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex which is shown in blue on the slide and it 's
 right in the middle of prefrontal cortex in the midline of your head 
 this region is more active in adolescents when they make these social decisions and think about other people than it is in adults and this is actually a meta analysis of nine different studies in this area from
  labs around the world and they all show the same thing that activity in this medial prefrontal cortex area
 decreases during the period of adolescence 
 and we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach a different cognitive strategy to make social decisions 
 and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of behavioral task
  and i 'll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab so imagine that you 're the participant in one of our experiments you come into the lab  
 you see this computerized task 
 in this task you see a set of shelves  now there are objects on these shelves on some of them and
 you 'll notice there 's a guy standing behind the set of shelves  and there are some objects that he can 't see they 're occluded from his point of view
  kind of gray piece of wood 
 this is the same set of shelves from his point of view notice that there are only some objects that he can see  whereas there are many more objects that you can see 
 now your task is to move objects around the director standing behind the set of shelves is going to direct you to move objects around but remember he 's
  not going to ask you to move objects that he can 't see 
 this introduces a really interesting condition whereby there 's a kind of conflict between your perspective and the director 's perspective so imagine he tells you to move the top truck left 
 there are three trucks there you 're going to instinctively go for the white truck because that 's the top truck from your perspective but then you have to remember oh he can 't see that truck so he must mean me to move the blue truck which is the top
  from his perspective now believe it or not normal healthy intelligent adults like you make errors about fifty percent of the time on that kind of trial  
 they move the white truck instead of the blue truck  
 so we give this kind of task
 to adolescents and adults and we also have a control condition where there 's no director and instead we give people a rule we tell them okay we 're going to do exactly the same thing but this time there 's no director 
  instead you 've got to ignore objects with the dark gray background you 'll see that this is exactly the same condition only in the no director condition they just have to remember to apply 
  this somewhat arbitrary rule  whereas in the director condition they have to remember to take into account the
  to adulthood and what you 're going to see is the percentage errors in the adult group in both conditions so the gray is the director condition and you see that our intelligent adults are making errors about fifty percent 
  of the time  whereas they make far fewer errors when there 's no director present when they just have to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background  
  improvement in other words a reduction of errors 
 in both of these trials in both of these conditions but it 's when you compare the last two groups the mid adolescent group and the adult group where things get really interesting because there 
 there is no continued improvement in the no director condition in other words  everything you need to do in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid adolescence whereas in contrast if you look at the last two gray
  bars  there 's still a significant improvement in the director condition between 
  and adulthood and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else 's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior which is something by the way that we do in everyday life all the time 
 is still developing in mid to late adolescence  so if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you sometimes think they have problems taking
  people 's perspectives you 're right they do  and this is why  so we we sometimes
 laugh about teenagers they 're parodied sometimes even demonized in the media
 for their kind of typical teenage behavior they take risks they 're sometimes moody 
 i have a really nice anecdote from a friend of
  mine who said that
 the thing he noticed most about his teenage daughters before and after puberty was their level of embarrassment in front of him so he said before puberty if my two daughters were messing around 
  in a shop i 'd say ' hey stop messing around and i 'll sing your favorite song ' and instantly they 'd stop messing around and he 'd sing their favorite song after puberty that became the threat 
  is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon  is it something we 've invented recently in the west and actually the answer is probably not there are lots of descriptions of adolescence in in history
  that sound very similar to the descriptions we use today so there 's a famous quote by shakespeare from the winter 's tale where he describes adolescence as follows 
  or that youth would sleep out the rest for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child wronging the ancientry stealing fighting 
 he then goes on to say having said that 
 would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and two and twenty hunt in this weather 
 laughter so almost four hundred years ago shakespeare was portraying adolescents in a very similar light to the light that we portray them in today
  today  but today we try to understand their behavior in terms of the underlying changes that are going on in their brain  
 so for example take risk taking we know that adolescents
 have a tendency to take risks they do they take more risks than children or adults and they are particularly prone to taking risks when they 're with their friends there 's an important drive
 to become independent from one 's parents and to impress
  one 's friends in adolescence 
 but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system so i 'm going to show you the limbic system in red in the slide behind me and also on this brain so the limbic system is right deep inside the brain 
 and it 's involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing
  it gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things including taking risks it gives you the kick out of taking risks  
 and this region the regions within the limbic system have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk taking in adolescents compared with adults 
 and at the very same time the prefrontal cortex  which you can see in blue in the slide here  which stops us taking excessive risks is still very much in development in
  so brain research has shown that the adolescent brain undergoes really quite profound development and this has implications for education for rehabilitation 
 and intervention the environment  including teaching can and does shape the developing adolescent brain and yet it 's only relatively recently that we have been routinely educating teenagers in the west all four of my
  for example left school
 in their early adolescence they had no choice  and that 's still the case for many many teenagers around the world today forty percent of teenagers don 't have access to secondary school
 education  and yet this is a period of life where the brain is particularly
  changes in the adolescent brain
