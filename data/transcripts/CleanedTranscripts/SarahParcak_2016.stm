  as an archaeologist  i 'm most often asked what my favorite discovery is the answer 's easy my husband greg 
 we met in egypt on my first dig  it was my first lesson in finding unexpected
  things  this began an incredible archaeological partnership 
 years later  
 i proposed to him in front of our favorite pair statue of the prince and princess  rahotep and nofret in the cairo museum  dating to four thousand six hundred years ago  
 i thought if i was going to ask greg to spend the rest of this life with me then i should ask him
 in front of two people who had pledged to be together for eternity 
 these symbols endure because when we look at them we 're looking at mirrors  
 they are powerful reminders that our common humanity
 has not changed the thrill of archaeological discovery is as powerful as love because ancient history
 is the most seductive
  mistress imaginable many archaeologists have devoted their lives to unraveling the mysteries of the past under hot suns
 and arctic winds
 and in dense rainforests many seek  some discover all worship at the temple of possibility
 that one discovery might change history
  on my first day in egypt  i worked at a site in the northeast egyptian delta called mendes  dating to four thousand two hundred years ago in a cemetery that 's a picture of me i 'm just in my bliss 
 on the dig  surrounded by emerald green rice paddies  i discovered an intact pot  
 flipping it over  i discovered a human thumbprint left
 by whoever made the vessel for a moment time stood still 
 i didn 't know where i was it was because at that moment i realized when we dig we 're digging for people 
 not things  
 never are we so present
 as when we are in the midst of the great past i can 't tell you how many times i 've
  stood in front of the pyramids of giza and they leave me speechless  i feel like the luckiest person in the world 
 they 're a monument to our human brilliance and everything that is possible 
 many cannot process their brilliance as human they think aliens built them 
  this is ridiculous all you need to do is get up close and personal and see the hidden hand of man
 in the chisel marks left by the tools that built them 
 the great pyramid of giza was built one stone at a time with two point three million blocks with incredible bureaucratic efficiency  
 it is not the pyramids that stand the test of time it is human ingenuity that
 is our shared human brilliance history
 may be cyclical  but we are singular  
 i love what i do because i learn that we haven 't changed  
 i get to read about mother in law jokes from mesopotamia from three thousand five hundred years ago
  get to hear about neighbors cursing each other
 from four thousand six hundred years ago in egypt and my absolute favorite from three thousand three hundred years ago in luxor an inscription that describes schoolboys who cut class to go drinking 
 kids these days 
 i get to see the most incredible architecture
 see stunning sculptures i mean this is basically a selfie in stone
 and see that we 've always rocked serious bling  and also  we 've been posting on walls and obsessing about cats
  cultural memory preservers
 and the spokespeople
 for the billions of people and the thousands of cultures that came before us 
 good science  imagination and a leap of faith are the trifecta we use to raise the dead 
 in the last year  archaeologists have made incredible discoveries
  new human ancestors from south africa 
 tools from three point three million years ago these are the oldest tools ever discovered in kenya  
 and this from a series of medical implements found from blackbeard 's ship from one thousand seven hundred and eighteen 
 what you 're looking at is a medical tool used to treat syphilis
  thousands of other incredibly important discoveries made by my colleagues that do not make headlines  
 however  i believe that the most important thing we do as archaeologists
 is acknowledge that past people existed
 and lived lives worth learning about can you even imagine what the world would be like today if we acknowledged all human
  beings in this way 
 so on a dig  we have a challenge  
 it often looks like this you can 't see anything  where are we going to start digging  
 this is from a site south of cairo  let 's have a look from space 
 again you can 't really see much what you 're
  meter resolution that 's ten inches  this means that you can zoom in from four hundred miles in space and see your tablets 
 how do i know about this 
 it 's because i 'm a space archaeologist  let me repeat that i am a space archaeologist
  this means i use satellite images and process them using algorithms and look at subtle differences in the light spectrum that indicate buried things under the ground that i get to go excavate and survey
 by the way nasa has a space archaeology program  so it 's a real job 
 so let 's have a look
  're back at the site just south of cairo  you can 't see anything  
 keep your eye on the red rectangle 
 when we process the image using algorithms think like a space based cat scan
 this is what you see this rectilinear form
 is an ancient tomb that is previously unknown and unexcavated and you all are the first people to see it in thousands of years
 i believe we have barely scratched the surface in terms of what 's left to discover 
 in the egyptian delta alone  we 've excavated less than 
 of one percent of the total volume of egyptian sites  when you add to that
  the thousands of other sites my team and i have discovered what we thought we knew
 pales
 in comparison to what we have left to discover  
 when you look at the incredible work that my colleagues are doing all around the world and what they 're finding  i believe
 that there are millions of undiscovered archaeological sites left to find 
 discovering them will do nothing less than unlock the full potential
 of our existence
 but
 we have a challenge
 over the last year  
 we 've seen horrible headlines of incredible destruction going on to archaeological sites and massive looting by people like isil
 isil has destroyed temples at palmyra who blows up a temple they 've destroyed the tomb of jonah
  and
 we 've seen looting at sites so rampant it looks like craters of the moon  
 knowing isil 's desire to destroy modern human lives it
 's a natural extension for them to destroy cultural identity as well countless invading armies have done the same
  is profiting from the looting of sites  but we don 't know the scale  this means
 that any object purchased on the market today from the middle east could potentially be funding terrorism 
 when a site is looted  it 's as if a puzzle
 already missing ninety percent of it pieces has had the rest
  this is ancient identity theft writ large  we know that there are two kinds of looting going on looting by criminal elements like isil 
 and then more local looting by those that are desperate for money 
 we would all do the same to feed our families  i don 't blame the local looters  i blame
 the middlemen the unethical traffickers and an international art market that exploits often ambiguous or
  completely nonexistent laws 
 we know looting is going on on a global scale and it 's increasing but presently we don 't have any tools to stop it this
 is beginning to change 
 my team and i have just completed a study looking at looting in egypt we looked at
  and mapped the entirety of looting across egypt from two thousand and two to two thousand and thirteen  
 we found evidence of looting and site destruction at two hundred and sixty seven sites and mapped over two hundred thousand looting pits it
 's astonishing  and putting that data together you can see the looting pits marked here
 at one site the looting got bad from two thousand and nine two thousand and eleven two thousand and twelve hundreds and hundreds of pits
 putting all the data together what we found is that contrary to popular opinion 
 looting did not start to get worse in egypt in two thousand and eleven after the arab spring  
 but in two thousand and nine after the global recession  
 thus  we 've shown with big data that looting is fundamentally an economic
  if we do nothing to stop the problem 
 all of egypt 's sites will be affected by looting by two thousand and forty  
 thus  we are at a tipping point we are the generation with all the tools and all the technologies to stop looting  but we 're not working fast enough  
 sometimes an archaeological site can surprise you with its resilience  i am just back from the
  field  where i co led a joint mission with egypt 's ministry of antiquities at a site called lisht 
 this site dates to the middle kingdom of egypt between two thousand and one thousand seven hundred and fifty bc 
 the middle kingdom was ancient egypt 's renaissance period after a time of intense internal strife and environmental challenges egypt rebounded with an
  favorite period of time to study in egypt because it teaches us so much about how we can survive and thrive after great disasters  
 now at this site we had already mapped countless looting pits lisht is a royal site there would have been thousands of people buried there who lived and worked at the court of pharaoh 
 you can see this before and after you see dozens of
  this is in south lisht before
 and after 
 when we first visited the site we could see the tombs of many high ranking officials that had been looted  
 let me put into perspective for you what was taken  
 imagine a two meter by two meter area full of coffins  jewelry and incredible statuary  
 multiply that times over a thousand 
 that 's what was taken
  started work my egyptian co director mohamed youssef approached me and said we must work at this one particular tomb  
 it 's been attacked by looters  if we don 't do anything they 'll be back of course i agreed  but i didn 't think we 'd find anything i thought the looters had stolen everything 
 what we started to find were the most incredible reliefs look at this painting it 's just stunning we started finding engraved inscriptions  and even the
  titles of the tomb owner he had titles like overseer of the army overseer of the treasury i began to have hope 
 maybe just maybe we would find his name for the ancient egyptians  having their name last for eternity was their goal 
 and then one day this appeared  this is the
  can see it written out here in hieroglyphs  
 working together with my egyptian team  
 we had restored someone 's name from three thousand nine hundred years ago 
 working together with my egyptian colleagues 
  we celebrated this moment of shared discovery what we were doing together was right and true  
  mostly intact on it we read about intef and his inscriptions  you can actually even see him seated here  
 what i realized is that everything i had assumed about looted sites had been proven wrong  
 every day on site we worked together with seventy egyptians as colleagues and friends 
 in the face of so much hatred and ignorance against those in the middle east
  every moment on site felt like a protest for peace 
 when you work with those that don 't look like you or think like you or speak like you  your shared mission of archaeological discovery erases all superficial differences 
 what i learned this season
 is that archaeology isn 't about what you find it 's about what you can prove
 sometimes when you travel you end up finding long lost family not those with whom you share genes  but a shared entry in the book of life 
 this is omer farrouk my brother omer 's
 a gufti from a village just north of luxor  called guft guftis are part of a celebrated tradition in egyptology they help with
  i simply couldn 't do work without him 
 one day many years ago  when i was a young graduate student and omer was a young  gufti who couldn 't speak much english  
 we learned  completely randomly that we were born in the same year 
 the same month
 and the same day
  separated by an ocean but forever connected for ancient egypt is our mother  i knew then we 'd always work together
 not in my brain  but in the part of your soul that knows not everything can be explained
  i will always love you  
 so just before my first dig in egypt my mentor the very famous egyptologist professor william kelly simpson called me into his office 
 he handed me a check for $ two thousand and said this is to cover your expenses have a glorious adventure this summer  
 someday
 you will do this for someone else
  my ted prize wish is partial payback plus interest for a great human being 's generosity
 and kindness so my wish i wish for us to discover
 the millions of unknown archaeological sites around the world by creating a
  and protect the world 's hidden heritage  
 which contains clues to humankind 's collective resilience and creativity thank you 
 so how are we going to do this 
 we are going to build with the ted
  prize money
 an online  crowdsource citizen science platform to allow anyone in the world to engage with discovering archaeological sites 
 there are only a couple hundred of us space archaeologists around the world it is my dream to engage the world with helping to find sites and protect them
  note that this particular username is already taken you
 'll take a tutorial and you 'll start work i want to note at the outset that in no way will be sharing gps data or mapping data for sites we want to treat them like human patient data and not reveal their locations you
 'll then be dealt a card from a deck twenty x twenty meters or thirty x thirty meters and you 'll be looking for features my team and i
 large amounts of satellite data using algorithms in order for you to find things so you 'll be doing really good science you 'll then be starting to look what do you see do you see a temple do you see a tomb do you see a pyramid do
 you see any potential site damage or site looting you 'll then begin to mark what 's there and off to the side are always going to be rich examples of exactly what you 're seeing to help
 all the data that you help us collect will be shared with vetted authorities and will help create a new global alarm system to help protect sites  
 but it 's not just going to stop there 
 all the archaeologists with whom we share your discoveries will take you with them as they begin to excavate them 
 by using periscope  google plus and social
 hundred years ago  archaeology was for the rich 
 fifty years ago  it was for men  now it 's primarily for academics 
 our goal is to democratize the process of archaeological discovery  and allow anyone to participate
  howard carter discovered the tomb of king tut who is the next howard carter 
 it might be you  
 by creating this platform we will find the millions of places occupied by the billions of people that came before us 
 if we want to answer the big
 questions about who we are
 and where we 've come from the answers to those questions do not lie in pyramids or palaces  
 but in the cities and villages of those that came before us 
 if we want to learn about the past it 's time we inverted the pyramids 
 acknowledging that the past is worth saving
 means so much more it means
 that we 're worth saving
  and
 the greatest story ever told
 is the story of our shared human journey  but the only way we 're going to be able to write it
 is if we do it together come with me
