  of the human workforce is expected to be replaced by software and robots in the next twenty years  
 and many corporate leaders welcome that as a chance to increase profits 
 machines are more efficient
  manage  
 well i want our organizations to remain human in fact i want them to become beautiful 
 because as machines take our jobs and do them more efficiently  soon the only work left for us humans will be the kind of work
 that must be done beautifully
 rather than efficiently to maintain our
  in the this second machine age we may have no other choice than to create beauty 
 beauty is an elusive concept for the writer stendhal it was the promise of happiness 
 for me it 's a goal by lionel messi 
 so bear with me
 as i am proposing four admittedly very subjective principles that you can use to build a
  beautiful organization first do the unnecessary [ do the unnecessary ]
 a few months ago hamdi ulukaya the ceo and founder of the yogurt company chobani 
 made headlines when he decided to grant stock to all of his two thousand employees  
 some called it a pr stunt others a genuine act of giving back but there is something else that was remarkable about it 
 it came completely out of the blue
  there had been no market or stakeholder pressure  and employees were so surprised that they burst into tears when they heard the news  
 actions like ulukaya 's are beautiful because they catch us off guard  they create something out of nothing
 because they 're completely unnecessary  i once worked
  at a company that was the result of a merger of a large it outsourcing firm
 and a small design firm  we were merging nine thousand software engineers with one thousand creative types 
 and to unify these immensely different cultures we were going to launch a third new brand  and the new brand color was going to be
 orange  and as we were going through the budget for the rollouts  we decided last minute
 to cut the purchase of ten thousand orange balloons  which we had meant
  to distribute to all staff worldwide they just seemed unnecessary and cute in the end  i didn 't know back then
 that our decision marked the beginning of the end that these two organizations would never become one  
 and sure enough the merger eventually failed now was it because there weren 't any orange balloons 
  mentality permeated everything else 
 you might not always realize it but when you cut the unnecessary  you cut everything 
 leading with beauty means rising above what is merely necessary  
 so do not kill your orange balloons  the second principle
  studies show that how we feel about our workplace very much depends on the relationships with our coworkers and what are relationships other than a string of 
  are hundreds of these every day in our organizations
 that have the potential to distinguish a good life from a beautiful one the marriage researcher john gottman says that the secret of a healthy relationship
 is not the great gesture or the lofty promise it 's small
  moments of attachment in other words intimacy in our networked organizations we tout the strength of weak ties
 but we underestimate the strength of strong ones we forget the words of the writer richard bach who once said intimacy
 not connectedness intimacy is the opposite of loneliness so how do we design for organizational intimacy
  the humanitarian organization care wanted to launch a campaign on gender equality in villages in northern india  
 but it realized quickly that it had to have this conversation first with its own staff so it invited all  thirty six team members
 and their partners to one of the khajuraho temples known for their
 famous erotic sculptures and there they openly discussed their personal relationships their own experiences of gender equality
 with the coworkers and the partners it was eye opening for the participants not only did it allow them to relate to the communities they serve  
 it also broke down invisible barriers
 and created a lasting bond amongst themselves not a single team member quit in the next four years  so this is how you create intimacy
 no masks or lots of masks 
 when danone the food company wanted to translate its new company manifesto into product initiatives  
 it gathered the management team and one hundred employees from across different departments 
 seniority levels and regions for a three day strategy retreat 
 and it asked everybody to wear costumes for the entire meeting
 wigs crazy hats feather boas huge glasses and so on 
 and they left with concrete outcomes and full of enthusiasm and when i asked the woman
 who had designed this experience why it worked she simply said never underestimate the power of a ridiculous wig
  and hierarchy kills intimacy both ways for the ceo and the intern wigs allow us to use the disguise of the false
 to show something true about ourselves  and that 's not easy in our everyday work lives because the relationship with our organizations is often like that of a
  married couple
 that has grown apart suffered betrayals and disappointments  and is now desperate to be beautiful for one another once again 
 and for either of us the first step towards beauty involves a huge risk  the risk to be ugly [ be ugly ]
 so many organizations these days are keen on designing beautiful workplaces
 that look like anything but work vacation resorts
  coffee shops playgrounds or college campuses based on the promises of positive psychology we speak of play and 
 and one  start up even says that when someone gets fired they have graduated 
 that kind of beautiful language only goes skin deep  but ugly cuts clean to the bone 
 as the writer dorothy parker once put it to be authentic is
 to be ugly
 it doesn 't mean that you can 't have fun or must give in to the vulgar or cynical but it does mean that you speak the actual ugly truth 
 like this manufacturer that wanted to transform one of its struggling business units  
 it identified named and pinned on large boards all the issues and there were hundreds of them
 that had become obstacles to better performance they put them on boards moved them all into one room
 the ugly room the ugly became visible for everyone to see it was celebrated  
 and the ugly room served as a mix of mirror exhibition and operating room a biopsy on the living flesh to cut out all the bureaucracy 
 the ugliest part of our body
 is our brain  literally and neurologically our brain renders ugly what is unfamiliar
  modern art  atonal music  jazz maybe vr goggles for that matter
 strange objects sounds and people but we 've all been ugly once we were a weird looking baby a
 new kid on the block a foreigner and we will be ugly again
  when we don 't belong 
 the center for political beauty an activist collective in berlin recently staged an extreme artistic intervention 
 with the permission of relatives it exhumed the corpses of refugees who had drowned at europe 's borders  
 transported them all the way to berlin and then reburied them at the heart of the german capital 
 the idea was to allow them to reach their desired
  only after their death  
 such acts of beautification may not be pretty  
 but they are much needed because things tend to get ugly when there 's only one meaning one truth only answers and no questions 
 beautiful organizations keep asking questions  
 they remain incomplete  which is the fourth and the last of the principles [ remain incomplete ]
 recently i was in paris and a friend of mine took me to
  for up all night the self organized protest movement that had formed in response
 to the proposed labor laws in france 
 every night hundreds gathered at the place de la rpublique every night they set up a small temporary village to deliberate their own vision of the french republic  
 and at the core of this 
 was a general assembly where anybody could speak using a specially designed sign language
 like occupy wall street and other protest movements nuit debout was born in the face of crisis it was messy
 full of controversies and contradictions  
 but whether you agreed with the movement 's goals or not every gathering was a beautiful lesson in raw humanity 
 fitting that paris the city of ideals the city of beauty
 was it 's stage  it reminds us that like great cities the most beautiful organizations are ideas worth fighting for
 even and especially when their outcome is uncertain 
 they are movements  they are always imperfect never fully organized so they avoid ever becoming banal they have something but we don 't know what it is they remain mysterious we can 't take our eyes off them 
 we find them
 beautiful
 so to do the unnecessary  to create intimacy to be ugly to remain incomplete
 these are not only the qualities of beautiful organizations these are inherently human characteristics 
 and these are also the qualities of what we call home  
  and are disrupted the least we can do is to ensure that we still feel at home
 in our organizations and that we use our organizations to create that feeling for others 
 beauty can save the world when we embrace these principles and design for them 
 in the face of artificial intelligence and machine learning we need a new radical humanism  we must acquire and promote a new aesthetic and sentimental education 
 because if we
  don 't  we might end up feeling like aliens
 in organizations and societies that are full of smart machines that have no appreciation whatsoever
 for the unnecessary  the intimate the incomplete
 and definitely not for the ugly  thank you
