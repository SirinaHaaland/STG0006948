  every day we face issues like climate change or the safety of vaccines where we have to answer questions whose answers rely heavily on scientific information  
 scientists tell us that the world is warming  scientists tell us that vaccines are safe
  know if they are right  
 why should be believe the science  
 the fact is many of us actually don 't believe the science  public opinion polls consistently show that significant proportions of the american people
 don 't believe the climate is warming due to human activities 
 don 't think that there is evolution by natural selection and aren 't persuaded by the safety of vaccines  so why should we believe the
  science well
 scientists don 't like talking about science as a matter of belief in fact they would contrast science with faith and they would say belief is the domain of faith  
 and faith is a separate thing apart and distinct from science  indeed they would say religion is based on faith
 or maybe the calculus of pascal 's wager
  blaise pascal was a 17th century mathematician who tried to bring scientific reasoning to the question of whether or not he should believe in god  and his wager went like this 
 well  if god doesn 't exist but i decide to believe in him
 nothing much is really lost  maybe a few hours on sunday but if he does exist and i don 't believe in him then i 'm in deep trouble 
  and so pascal said we 'd better believe in god or as one of my college professors said he clutched for the handrail of faith he made that leap of faith leaving science and rationalism behind
  now the fact is though for most of us most scientific claims are a leap of faith  
 we can 't really judge scientific claims for ourselves in most cases  
 and indeed this is actually true for most scientists as well outside of their own specialties
  if you think about it a geologist can 't tell you whether a vaccine is safe  most chemists are not experts in evolutionary theory a physicist cannot tell you despite the claims of some of them whether or not tobacco causes cancer  
 so if even scientists themselves have to make a leap of faith outside their own fields  then why do they accept the claims of other scientists why do they believe each other
  's claims  and should we believe those claims  
 so what i 'd like to argue is yes we should but not for the reason that most of us think 
 most of us were taught in school that the reason we should believe in science is because of the scientific method  we were taught that scientists follow a method
 and that this method guarantees the truth of their claims the method that most of us were
  taught in school we can call it the textbook method is the hypothetical deductive method  according to the standard model the textbook model scientists develop hypotheses 
  they deduce the consequences of those hypotheses  and then they go out into the world and they say okay  well are those consequences true can we observe them taking place in the natural world and if they are true then the scientists say
  know the hypothesis is correct 
 so there are many famous examples in the history of science of scientists doing exactly this one of the most famous examples comes from the work of albert einstein 
 when einstein developed the theory of general relativity one of the consequences of his theory was that space time wasn 't just an empty void but that it actually had
  and that that fabric was bent in the presence of massive objects like the sun  
 so if this theory were true then it meant that light as it passed the sun should actually be bent around it 
 that was a pretty startling prediction and it took a few years before scientists were able to test it but they did test it in one thousand nine hundred and nineteen nineteen and lo and behold it turned out to be true  starlight actually does bend as it travels around the sun 
 this was a huge confirmation of the theory it was considered proof
  of the truth of this radical new idea  and it was written up in many newspapers around the globe now sometimes this theory or this model is referred to as the 
  model  mainly because academics like to make things complicated  but also because in the ideal case  it 's about
  having to do with laws  and in the ideal case the hypothesis isn 't just an idea  ideally it is a law of nature  
 why does it matter that it is a law of nature  because if it is a law  it can 't be broken if it 's a law then it will always be true in all times and all places no matter what the circumstances 
  are and all of you know of at least one example of a famous law einstein 's famous equation
  mass  and that relationship is true no matter what 
 now  it turns out though that there are several problems with this model  the main problem is that it 's wrong it 's just
 and i 'm going to talk about three reasons why it 's wrong  so the first reason is a logical
  it 's the problem of the fallacy of affirming the consequent  so that 's another fancy academic way of saying that false theories can make true predictions  so just because the prediction comes true doesn 't actually logically prove that the theory is correct  
 and i have a good example of that too again from the history of science 
 this is a picture of the ptolemaic universe with the earth at the center of the universe and the sun and the planets going
  the ptolemaic model was believed by many very smart people for many centuries  
 well  why 
 well the answer is because it made lots of predictions that came true  the ptolemaic system enabled astronomers to make accurate predictions of the motions of the planet in fact more accurate predictions 
  at first than the copernican theory which we we now would say is true  
  hypotheses  
 auxiliary hypotheses are assumptions that scientists are making that they may or may not even be aware that they 're making 
 so an important example of this comes from the copernican model  which ultimately replaced the ptolemaic system  
 so when nicolaus copernicus said actually the
  not the center of the universe the sun is the center of the solar system the earth moves around the sun scientists said well
 okay nicolaus  if that 's true we ought to be able to detect the motion of the earth around the sun and so this slide here illustrates a concept known as stellar parallax 
 and astronomers said  if the earth is moving
 and we look at a prominent star let 's say sirius well i know i 'm in manhattan so you guys
  see the stars but imagine you 're out in the country  imagine you chose that rural life
 and we look at a star in december we see that star against the backdrop of distant stars  
 if we now make the same observation six months later when the earth has moved to this position in june we look at that same star and we see it against a different backdrop 
 that difference that angular difference is the stellar parallax
  so this is a prediction that the copernican model makes astronomers looked for the stellar parallax and they found
 nothing 
 nothing at all  
 and many people argued that this proved that the copernican model was false  so what happened 
 well in hindsight we can say that astronomers were making two auxiliary hypotheses  both of which we would now say were incorrect the first was an
  about the size of the earth 's orbit 
 astronomers were assuming that the earth 's orbit was large relative to the distance to the stars  
 today we would draw the picture more like this this comes from nasa  and you see the earth 's orbit is actually quite small in fact it 's actually much smaller even than shown here 
 the stellar parallax therefore is very small and actually very hard to detect  
 and that leads to the second reason why the
  because scientists were also assuming that the telescopes they had were sensitive enough to detect the parallax and that turned out not to be true  
 it wasn 't until the 19th century that scientists were able to detect the stellar parallax  
 so there 's a third problem as well  the third problem is simply a factual problem that a lot of science doesn 't fit the textbook model 
 a lot of science isn 't deductive at all  it 's actually inductive and by that we mean that scientists
  't necessarily start with theories and hypotheses often they just start with observations of stuff going on in the world 
 and the most famous example of that is one of the most famous scientists who ever lived charles darwin 
 when darwin went out as a young man on the voyage of the beagle 
 he didn 't have a hypothesis he didn 't have a theory he just knew that he wanted to have a career as a scientist
 and he started to collect data
  he knew that he hated medicine
 because the sight of blood made him sick so he had to have an alternative career path 
 so he started collecting data 
 and he collected many things including his famous finches when he collected these finches he threw them in a bag and he had no idea what they meant 
 many years later back in london darwin looked at his data again and began to develop
 an explanation and that explanation was the theory of
  natural selection  
 besides inductive science  scientists also often participate in modeling 
 one of the things scientists want to do in life is to explain the causes of things  and how do we do that 
 well one way you can do it is to build a model that tests an idea  so this is a picture of henry cadell who was a scottish geologist
  you can tell he 's scottish because he 's wearing a deerstalker cap and wellington boots 
 and cadell wanted to answer the question how are mountains formed  and one of the things he had observed is that if you look at mountains like the appalachians you often find that the rocks in them are folded  
 and they 're folded in a particular way which suggested to him that they were actually being compressed from the side  
 and this idea would later play a major role in discussions of continental drift  
 so he built this model this
  crazy contraption with levers and wood and here 's his wheelbarrow buckets a big sledgehammer 
 i don 't know why he 's got the wellington boots maybe it 's going to rain  and he
 created this physical model in order to demonstrate that you could in fact create
 patterns in rocks or at least in this case in mud that looked a lot like mountains if you compressed them from the side so it was an argument about the cause of
  mountains 
 nowadays most scientists prefer to work inside so they don 't build physical models so much as to make computer simulations  but a computer simulation is a kind of a 
  model it 's a model that 's made with mathematics and like the physical models of the 19th century  it 's very important for thinking about causes 
  evidence that the earth is warming warming up 
 this slide here  the black line shows the measurements that scientists have taken for the last one hundred and fifty years showing that the earth 's temperature has steadily increased 
 and you can see in particular that in the last fifty years there 's been this dramatic increase of nearly one degree centigrade or almost two degrees
  so what though is driving that change how can we know what 's causing the observed warming 
 well scientists can model it using a computer simulation  
 so this diagram illustrates a computer simulation that has looked at all the different factors that we know can influence the earth 's climate 
 so sulfate particles from air pollution 
 volcanic dust from volcanic eruptions changes in solar radiation and of course greenhouse gases  and they
  asked the question what set of variables put into a model
 will reproduce what we actually see in real life so here is the real life in black here 's the model in this light gray and the answer is
 a model that includes  it 's the answer e on that sat all of the above 
  the only way you can reproduce the observed temperature measurements is with all of these things put together including greenhouse gases and in particular you can see that the increase in greenhouse 
  gases tracks this very dramatic increase in temperature over the last fifty years and so this is why climate scientists say it 's not just that we know that climate change is happening we know that greenhouse gases are a major part of the reason
  so now because there all these different things that scientists do the philosopher paul feyerabend famously said 
 the only principle in science that doesn 't inhibit progress is anything goes 
 now this quotation has often been taken out of context because feyerabend was not actually saying that in science anything goes  
 what he was saying was actually the full quotation is if you press me to say what is the method of science i would have to say
  say  anything goes what he was trying to say is that scientists do a lot of different things scientists are creative  
 but then this pushes the question back if scientists don 't use a single method 
 then how do they decide what 's right and what 's wrong  and who judges  
 and the answer is scientists judge and they judge by judging evidence scientists
  evidence in many different ways  but however they collect it they have to subject it to scrutiny  
 and this led the sociologist robert merton to focus on this question of how scientists scrutinize data and evidence and he said they do it in a way he called organized skepticism 
 and by that he meant it 's organized because they do it collectively they do it as a group  and skepticism because they do
  it from a position of distrust that is to say the burden of proof is on the person with a novel claim  
 and in this sense science is intrinsically conservative  it 's quite hard to persuade the scientific community to say yes  we know something this is true 
 so despite the popularity of the concept of paradigm shifts what we find is that actually really major changes in scientific thinking are relatively
  rare in the history of science  
 so finally that brings us to one more idea  
 if scientists judge evidence collectively  this has led historians to focus on the question of consensus 
 and to say that at the end of the day what science is what scientific knowledge is is the consensus of the scientific experts who through this process of organized
  scrutiny collective scrutiny  have judged the evidence and come to a conclusion about it either yea or nay  
 so we can think of scientific knowledge as a consensus of experts we can also think of science as being a kind of a jury  
 except it 's a very special kind of jury  it 's not a jury of your
  it 's a jury of geeks  it 's a jury of men and women with ph d s 
 and unlike a conventional jury  which has only two choices guilty
 or not guilty the scientific jury actually has a number of choices  scientists can say yes something 's true  
 scientists can say no it 's false  or they can say  well it might be true but we need to
 work more and collect more evidence or they can say it might be true but we don 't know how to answer the question and we 're going to put it aside and maybe we 'll come back to it later 
 that 's what scientists call intractable 
 but this leads us to one final problem
  if science is what scientists say it is then isn 't that just an appeal to authority  
 and weren 't we all taught in school that the appeal to authority is a logical fallacy  
 well here 's the paradox of modern science
  of the conclusion i think historians and philosophers and sociologists have come to that actually science is the appeal to authority  but
 it 's not the authority of the individual no matter how smart that individual is like plato or socrates
 or einstein  it 's the authority of the collective
  you can think of it is a kind of wisdom of the crowd  but a very special kind of crowd 
 science does appeal to authority  but it 's not based on any individual no matter how smart that individual may be 
 it 's based on the collective wisdom the collective knowledge the collective work of all of the scientists who have worked on a particular
 problem scientists have a kind of culture
  illustrated by this nice woman here showing her colleagues her evidence of
 course these people don 't really look like scientists because they 're much too happy 
 laughter okay  so that brings me to my final point  
 most of us get up in the morning most of us trust our cars
  i 'm in manhattan this is a bad analogy
 but most americans who don 't live in manhattan get up in the morning and get in their cars and turn on that ignition and their cars work and they work incredibly well the modern automobile hardly ever breaks down  
 so why is that why do cars work so well 
 it 's not because of the genius of henry ford or karl benz or even elon musk 
 it 's because the modern automobile is the product of more than one hundred years of work
  by hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of people the modern automobile is the product of the collected work and wisdom and experience of every man and woman who has ever worked on a car  
 and the reliability of the technology is the result of that accumulated effort  
 we benefit not just from the genius of benz and ford and musk
 but from the collective intelligence and hard work of all
  of the people who have worked on the modern car  and the same is true of science  only science is even older  
 our basis for trust in science is actually the same as our basis in trust in technology  
 and the same as our basis for trust in anything  namely experience  but it shouldn 't be blind trust any more than we would have blind trust in anything  
  science like science itself should be based on evidence 
 and that means that scientists have to become better communicators they have to explain to us not just what they know
 but how they know it and it means that we have to become better listeners  thank you very much
