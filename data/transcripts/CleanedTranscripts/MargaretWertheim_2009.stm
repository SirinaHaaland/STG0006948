  as june said to talk about a project that my twin sister and i have been doing for the past three and half years we 're crocheting a coral reef  
 and it 's a project
  that we 've actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world who are doing it with us  indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project in many of 
  its different aspects  it 's a project that now reaches across three continents  
  also a project
 that in a very beautiful way  the development of this has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth  
 which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying right here in february two thousand and nine
 which as one of our previous speakers told us is the 200th anniversary of the birth of charles darwin all of this i 'm going to get to in the next
 eighteen minutes i hope but let me first begin by showing you some pictures of what this thing looks like
  just to give you an idea of scale that installation there is about six feet across  and the tallest models are about two or three feet high this is some more images 
  of it that one on the right is about five feet high  the work involves hundreds of different crochet models 
  involves tens of thousands of hours of human labor ninety nine percent of it done by women on the right hand side that bit there is part of an installation that is about twelve feet 
  long my sister and i started this project in two thousand and five because in that year at least in the science press  there was a lot of talk about global warming and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs 
  by any rise in sea temperatures it causes these vast bleaching events that are the first signs of corals of being sick  and if the bleaching doesn 't go away if the temperatures don 't go down 
 reefs start to die  a great deal of this has been happening in the great barrier reef particularly in coral reefs all over the world this is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef  we have a new organization together called the institute for figuring which is
  little organization we started to promote to do projects about the aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics 
 and i went and put a little announcement up on our site asking for people to join us in this enterprise 
 to our surprise one of the first people who called was the andy warhol museum  and they said they were having an exhibition about artists ' response to global
  like our coral reef to be part of it  i laughed and said well we 've only just started it you can have a little bit of it 
 so in two thousand and seven we had an exhibition a small exhibition of this crochet reef  and then some people in chicago came along and they said in late two thousand and seven 
 the theme of the chicago humanities festival is global warming and we 've got this three thousand square foot gallery and we want you to fill it with your reef and i naively by this
  actually my profession is as a science writer what i do is i write books about the cultural history of physics i 've written books about the history of space the history of physics and religion  and i write articles 
  for people like the new york times and the l a times so i had no idea what it meant to fill a three thousand square foot gallery  
  colleges calarts  and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a three thousand square foot gallery she thought i 'd gone off my head  
 but she went into crochet overdrive and to cut a long story short  eight months later we did fill
 the chicago cultural center 's three thousand square foot gallery 
 by this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own which got completely beyond us the people in chicago decided that as well as
  exhibiting our reefs what they wanted to do was have the local people there make a reef  so we went and taught the techniques we did workshops and lectures  and the people in chicago made a reef of their own and it was exhibited alongside ours there were hundreds of people involved in that
 we got invited to do the whole thing in new york  and in london  and in
  in each of these cities the local citizens hundreds and hundreds of them have made a reef and more and more people get involved in this most of whom we 've never met  so the whole thing has sort 
  of morphed into this organic ever evolving creature that 's actually gone way beyond christine and  i 
  woolenness and wetness aren 't exactly two concepts that go together why not chisel a coral reef out of marble  cast it in bronze but it turns out there is a very good reason why we are crocheting it
 because many organisms in coral reefs have a very particular kind of structure the frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals and kelps and sponges and nudibranchs is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic
  and the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet  it happens to be a fact it 's almost impossible to model this structure any other way  and it 's almost impossible to do it on computers  
 so what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs
 embody  the next few minutes is we 're all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug 
 this sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics when it was first discovered in the 19th century
 but not until one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven did mathematicians actually understand how they could model it in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven a mathematician at cornell daina taimina made the discovery 
  that this structure could actually be done in knitting and crochet the first one she did was knitting  but you get too many stitches on the needle so she quickly realized crochet was the better thing 
  it was actually impossible to model  and indeed they thought that anything like this structure was impossible per se some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years trying to prove that this structure was impossible 
 so what is this impossible hyperbolic structure before hyperbolic geometry mathematicians knew about two kinds of space  euclidean space  and spherical
  and they have different properties
 mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist you all have a sense of what a flat space is euclidean space is but mathematicians formalize this in a particular 
  way  and what they do is they do it through the concept of parallel lines  so here we have a line and a point outside the line and euclid said how can i define parallel lines i ask the question how
  many lines can i draw through the point but never meet the original line and you all know the answer does someone want to shout it out 
 one  great okay that 's our definition of a parallel line it 's a definition really of euclidean space  but there is another possibility that you all know of spherical 
  space  think of the surface of a sphere just like a beach ball the surface of the earth i have a straight line on my spherical surface  and i have a point outside the line how many straight lines can i draw through the point but never meet the original line
 what do we mean to talk about a straight line on a curved surface  
 now mathematicians have answered that question   they 've understood there is a generalized concept of straightness it 's called a geodesic and on the surface of a sphere
 a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw  so it 's like the equator or the lines of
  so we ask the question again how many straight lines can i draw through the point but never meet the original line does someone want to guess 
 zero very good now
 mathematicians thought that was the only alternative  it 's a bit suspicious isn 't it there is two answers to the question so far zero and one 
 two answers there may possibly be a third alternative to a mathematician if there are two answers  and the first two are zero
  there is another number that immediately suggests itself as the third alternative does anyone want to guess what it is  
 infinity you all got it right exactly there
 is there 's a third alternative this is what it looks like there 's a straight line and there is an infinite number of lines that go through the point and never meet the original line this is the drawing 
 this nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because like you they 're sitting there
 feeling bamboozled thinking how can that be you 're cheating the lines are curved  but that 's only because i 'm projecting it onto a
 flat surface mathematicians for several hundred years had to really struggle with this how could they see this what did it mean
 to actually have a physical model that looked like this  it 's a bit like this imagine that we 'd only ever encountered euclidean space  then our mathematicians come along and said there 's this thing called a sphere  and the lines come together at the north and south pole but you don 't know what a sphere
  looks like and someone that comes along and says look here 's a ball and you go ah 
 i can see it i can feel it  i can touch it  i can play with it and that 's exactly what happened when daina taimina
 in one thousand nine 
 showed that you could crochet models in hyperbolic space  here is this diagram in
  i 've stitched euclid 's parallel postulate on to the surface and the lines look curved  but look i can prove to you that they 're straight
 because i can take any one of these lines and i can fold along it  and it 's a straight line  so here 
 in wool through a domestic feminine art is the proof that the most famous postulate in
  you can stitch all sorts of mathematical theorems onto these surfaces  
 the discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics that is called non euclidean geometry  and this is actually the field of mathematics that underlies general relativity and is actually ultimately going to show us about the shape of the universe 
 so there is this direct line between feminine handicraft
  euclid and general relativity 
 now i said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible here 's two creatures who 've never heard of euclid 's parallel postulate didn 't know it was impossible to violate  and they 're simply getting on with it  they 've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years 
 i once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it
  since the silurian age 
 their answer was interesting they said well i guess there aren 't that many mathematicians sitting around looking at sea slugs and that 's true  but it also goes deeper than that it also says a whole lot of things 
 about what mathematicians thought mathematics was what they thought it could and couldn 't do what they thought it could and couldn 't represent
  who in some sense are the freest of all thinkers literally couldn 't see not only the sea slugs around them  but the lettuce on their plate because lettuces and all those curly vegetables they also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry  
 and so in some sense they literally they had such a symbolic view of mathematics they couldn 't actually see what was going on on the lettuce in front of them  
 it turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders
  and so too we 've discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures we started out chrissy and i and our contributors doing the simple mathematically perfect models but we found that when we deviated from the specific
 setness of the mathematical code that underlies it the simple algorithm crochet three increase one
 when we deviated from that and made embellishments
  to the code the models immediately started to look more natural  
 and all of our contributors who are an amazing collection of people around the world  do their own embellishments as it were we have this 
  crochet taxonomic tree of life just as the morphology and the complexity of life on earth is never ending little embellishments and complexifications in the dna code lead to new things like giraffes
  or orchids so too do little embellishments in the crochet code lead to new and wondrous creatures in the evolutionary tree of crochet life 
 so this project really has taken on this inner organic life of its own there is the totality of all the people who have come to it  and their individual visions
  and their engagement with this mathematical mode  we have these technologies we use them  but why what 's at stake here what does it matter 
 for chrissy and i one of the things that 's important here is that these things suggest the importance and value of embodied knowledge  we live in a society that completely tends to valorize
 symbolic forms of representation algebraic representations equations
  we live in a society that 's obsessed with presenting information in this way  teaching information in this way  but through
 this sort of modality crochet other
 plastic forms of play people can be engaged with the most abstract high powered theoretical ideas the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go to university departments to study in higher
  which is where i first learned about hyperbolic space  but you can do it through playing with material objects
 one of the ways that we 've come to think about this is that what we 're trying to do with the institute for figuring and projects like this we 're trying to have kindergarten for grown ups 
 and kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education established by a man named friedrich froebel who was a crystallographer in the 19th century  he believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation
  radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play and he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right  the 
  value of education is something that froebel championed through plastic modes of play
  the institute for figuring
  can be engaged with
