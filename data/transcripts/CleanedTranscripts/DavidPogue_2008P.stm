  i 'm the weekly tech critic for the new york times i review gadgets and stuff 
 and mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year is nestling with their kids and decorating the christmas tree what i 'm mostly doing this year is going on cable tv and answering the same question 
 what are the tech trends for
  next year 
 and i 'm like didn 't we just go through this last year but i 'm going to pick the one that interests me most and that is the completed marriage of the cell phone and the internet you know i found that volcano on
 google images not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of dianetics 
  this all started a few years ago  when they started carrying your voice over the internet rather than over a phone line and we 've come a long way since that but that was interesting in itself this is companies 
  like vonage  basically you take an ordinary telephone you plug it into this little box that they give you and the box plugs into your cable modem now it works just like a regular phone so you can pick up the phone you hear a dial tone  
 file of a dial tone  just to reassure you that the the world hasn 't ended
  it could be anything it could be salsa music or a comedy routine it doesn 't matter
 the little box has your phone number so that 's really cool you can take it to london or siberia and your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring because it 's got everything in the box 
 they 've got every feature known to man in there  
 because adding a new feature is just
  and as a result of voice over ip i hate that term voice over internet
  service has gone down thirty percent in the last three years i mean 
 college kid has home phone service anymore this is what college kids are more likely to have it 's the most popular voip service in the world it 's skype it 's a free program you download for your mac or pc and you make free phone 
  calls anywhere in the world the downside is that you have to wear a headset like a nerd
  but nonetheless if you 're a college kid and you have no money  believe me this is better than trying to use your your cell phone  it 's really cute seeing
 middle aged people like me try out skype for the first time which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad
  it was when i did it laughter
 i think where voip is really going to get interesting is when they start putting it on cell phones imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone and any time you were in a wireless hotspot
 free calls anywhere in the world never pay the cellular company a nickel 
 it 'd be really really cool and yet even though the technology for this has been available for five years incredibly the number of standard cell
  phones offered by us carriers with free voip
 is zero i can 't figure out why 
 laughter actually i need to update that there 's one now  and it 's so interesting that i thought i would tell you about it
  it comes from t mobile and i am not paid
  the new york times has very rigid policies about that
 ever since that jayson blair jerk ruined it for all of us 
 basically  the reason you haven 't heard about this program is because it was introduced last year on june twenty nine 
 does anyone remember what else happened on june twenty nine last year it was the iphone the iphone came out that day i 'm like  can you imagine being the
  but it 's actually really really cool you have a choice of phones and we 're not talking smartphones ordinary phones including a blackberry that have wi fi the deal is any time you 're in a wi fi hotspot 
 all your calls are free and when you 're out of the hotspot you 're on the regular cellular network you 're thinking
  in a hotspot the answer is all the time because they give you a regular wireless router that works with the phone for your house which is really ingenious because we all know that t mobile is
 the most pathetic carrier  they have
 coverage like the size of my thumbnail 
 but it 's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers right
  they 're like a stealth tower installation program we 're putting it in our homes for them  anyway  they have wi fi phones in europe 
 but the thing that t mobile did that nobody 's done before is when you 're on a call an you move from wi fi into cellular range the call is handed off in 
  'll show you
 the advanced technologies we use at the new york times to test this gear  this is me with a camcorder on a phone going like this 
 laughter as i walk out of the house from my wi fi hotspot into the cellular network on a call with my wife look at the upper left that 's the
  why my wife says i never listen to her i don 't get that 
 the bottom line is
  that the boundaries because of the internet plus cell phone are melting the cool thing about the t mobile phones is that although switching technologies is very advanced 
 the billing technology has not caught up 
 so what i mean is that you can start a call in your house in the wi fi hotspot you can get in your car and talk until the battery 's dead which would be like ten minutes 
 and the call will
  not so fast it also works the other way  so if you start a call on your cellular network and you come home you keep being billed
 which is why most people with this service get into the habit of saying hey i just got home can i call you right back now you get it
   it 's also true that if you use one of these phones overseas 
 it doesn 't know what internet hotspot you 're in on the internet nobody knows you 're a dog right nobody knows you 're in pakistan
 you can make free unlimited calls home to the us with these phones so very very interesting
  this is another favorite of mine  does anyone here have a working cell phone that 's on with coverage  who can make a call right now without a lot of fussing  
 ok  would you call me please right now [ phone number given
  don 't you all call me at three  a m asking me to fix your printer laughter
 i have two cell phones so this going to be very odd if it works i should know not to do technology demos in front of an audience 
 this one is going off and oh i have the ringer off tsh great anyway  this one is also going off  so they 're both ringing at the same time
  you i was looking at this guy oh great yeah yeah you can all stop calling now 
 all right  we 've made the point all right  ringer off  everyone wants in on
  so this is grand central at work it 's a oh for gods sake 
 i have your numbers now 
 you will pay 
 grand central is this really brilliant idea where they give you a new phone number 
 and then at that point one phone number rings all your phones at once your home phone your work phone your cell phone your yacht phone
 this is the eg crowd
  the beauty of that is you never miss a call i know a lot of you are like ooh
 i don 't want to be reached at any hour 
 but the beauty is it 's all going through the internet so you get all of these really cool features like you can say i want these people to be able to call me only during these hours and i want these people to hear this greeting hi boss i 'm out making us both some money leave a message
  they 've been working on it for a year they 're supposed to come out with it very shortly in a public public method
  by the way this is something that really bothers me
  i don 't know if you realize this when you call four hundred and eleven on your cell phone  they charge you two bucks
 did you know that it 's an outrage  i actually got a photograph of the verizon employee right there  i 'm going to tell you how to avoid that now  what you 're going to use
 is google cellular it 's totally free there 's not even ads if you know how to send a text message you can get the same information for free i 'm about to change your life
 so here 's me doing it  you send a text message to the word
 they will send you back the two closest drugstores complete with name address and phone number here it comes and
 it 's already written down so like if you 're driving you don 't have to do one of these things uh huh uh huh uh huh 
 it works with weather too you can say weather and the name of the city you 're going to travel to and then in five seconds they send you back
 the complete weather forecast for that town shortly i 'll tell you why i was in
 here we go and those are just the beginning these are all the different things that you can text to google and they will yeah you 're all trying to write this down that 's cute
  i do have an email address you can just ask me
  it 's absolutely phenomenal the only downside is that it requires you to know how to text send a text message  nobody over forty knows how to do that so
 i 'm going to teach you something even better  this is called google info they 've just launched this
 voice activated version of the same thing it 's speech recognition like you 've never heard before  so lets say i 'm in monterey  and i want what i want to find what
  dorado street to select number one you can press one or say
  he 's connecting me he doesn 't even tell me the phone number he 's just connecting me directly it 's like having a personal valet
  you never even find out the number it 's just so amazing and it has incredible incredible accuracy  this is even more amazing put this in your speed dial this you can ask by voice any question  
 who won the one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight world
  the recipe for a certain cocktail  it 's absolutely amazing and they text you back the answer i tried this this morning just to make sure it 's still alive which actors have played james bond they text me back this sean 
  connery george lazenby roger moore timothy dalton pierce brosnan daniel craig right  and then i was trying to pretend i was like a valley girl i 'm like what 's the word that means you know like  when the sun the moon and the earth are like all in a line 
 which i knew because it 's the word that won me the ohio spelling bee in
  there 's a lot of people wondering how on earth are they going to make money doing this and the answer is look at the last line they put this teeny weeny little ad about ten characters long  and a lot of people also want to know how does it work how can it be so good it 's as though there is a human being on the other end of the line 
 because there is one  
 they have ten thousand people who are being paid twenty cents per answer as you can imagine it 's college kids and
  old people
 that 's who can afford to do that  but it 's a human being on the line and it 's gotten me out of so many tough positions like when 's the last flight out of chicago you know it 's just absolutely amazing
  another thing that really bothers me about cell phones today
 this is probably my my biggest pet peeve in all of technology when
  nobody has pagers anymore you may begin speaking at the tone  when you have finished recording
  and then it gets worse  when i call to retrieve my messages  first of all you have
 messages to listen to your messages why else am i calling 
 of course i want to listen to the messages
 oh you all have cell phones too  
 so last year i went to milan italy and i got to speak to an audience of cellular executives from two hundred countries around the world
  and i said as a joke as a joke i said i did the math verizon has seventy million customers if you check your voicemail twice a
  hundred million dollars a year i bet you guys are doing this just to run up our airtime
  now i 'm going to tell you how to get out of that  there are these services that transcribe your voicemail into text and they send it either to your email or as text messages to your phone it is a 
 and by the way  they don 't always get the words right because it 's over the phone and all that  so they attach the audio file at the bottom of the email so you can listen to double check the services are called things like spinvox
 the one i use callwave a lot of people say how are they doing this i don 't really want people listening in to my calls the executives at these companies told me 
 well we use a proprietary 
  i think basically it 's like these guys in india with headsets you know
 listening in  the reason i think that is that on the first day i tried one of these services i got two voicemail messages one was from a guy named
  stevenson which shouldn 't be that hard to transcribe and it was misspelled the other was from my video producer at the times whose name is vijaiy singh with the silent ' h ' 
 nailed that one 
 so
 you be the judge
  nobody is listening to your messages  and they also promise that they 're going to transcribe only the gist of your messages 
 so i thought i 'd see how that goes  this is me testing it out
  sky was blue  and your daughter broke her leg at soccer practice
  i 'm going to have a sandwich for lunch  she 's in room
 emergency room
  so a couple minutes later this i got by email it 's a very good transcription but a couple minutes after that i got the text message version now remember a text message can only be one hundred and sixty characters long so it had better be
 the gist of the gist right i 'm not kidding you the message said was walking along the street and sky was blue
  i guess that was the gist 
 and lastly i just have to talk about this one this is my favorite of all time 
 basically you 're going to go on some iffy date or a potentially bad meeting  so you go and you type in your phone number and
  minute where you want to be called and at that moment your phone will ring and you 're like i 'm sorry i 've got to take this 
  the really beautiful thing is you know how when somebody 's sitting next to you sometimes they can sort of hear 
  a little bit of the caller  so they give you a choice of what you want to hear on the other
  this is the i love this the boss call phone hey this is mr johnson calling from the office dp oh hi sir phone did you complete that thing about a month ago that photocopier training dp oh
  when was the last time you used the photocopier dp it was like three weeks ago phone well i don 't know if you heard
  you might have heard from lenny but  
 i think the biggest change when internet met phone was with the iphone not my finest moment in new york times journalism it was when in the fall of
 two thousand and six i explained why apple would never do a cell phone i looked like a moron however my
  logic was good  because i don 't know if you realize this but until the iphone came along the carriers verizon at & t cingular held veto power over every aspect of every design 
  of every phone  i know the people who worked on the treo they went around to these carriers and said look at these cool features
  't anticipate was that steve jobs went around and said tell you what i 'll give you a five year exclusive if you 'll let me design this phone in peace and you won 't even see it till it 's done 
 actually even so he was turned down by verizon and others finally cingular said ok 
 i 'm going to talk about the effect of the iphone please don 't corner me at the party tonight and go what are you an apple
  you can see what i said about it it 's a flawed masterpiece it 's got bad things and good things lets all acknowledge that right now  but it did change a few things the first thing it changed was that 
 all those carriers saw that they sold ten million of these things in a year and they said oh my gosh maybe we 've been doing it wrong  maybe we should let phone designers design the phones 
  another thing was that it let ten million people for the first time experience being online all the time not using these 
 cellular cards for their laptops 
 i don 't understand why we 're not there yet  when i 'm an old man i 'm going to tell my grandchildren when i was your age if i wanted to check my email i used to drive around town looking for a coffee shop
  we had wireless base stations that could broadcast yay about one hundred and fifty feet across 
 it 's absurd we have power outlets in every room of every building  we have running water  what 's the problem
  anyway but this teaches people what it 's like you have to go to youtube and type in iphone shuffle
  this guy did a mock video of of one that 's one inch square like the real ipod shuffle  it 's like it only has one button 
 touch it and it dials a number at random who the hell is this 
 but the other thing it did is it opened up this idea of an app store it downloads right to the phone and you can use the tilt sensor
  steer this car using this game these programs can use all the components of the iphone the touch screen  this is the etch a sketch program the theme of eg two thousand and eight you know how you erase it 
 of course  you shake it right of course  we shake it to erase like this they have ten thousand of these programs  this is the translator program they have every language in the world you type in what you want and it gives you the
 the translation
  this is amazing this is midomi a song is running through your head you
  you type in a band or a song name it will immediately play you that song or that band it has a 
 like this song or not
 if you like it it tries another song on you from a different band with the same instrumentation vocals theme and tempo if you like that one or don 't like it
  songs it eventually only plays songs you like this is urbanspoon you 're in a city it knows from gps where you 're standing you want to find a place to eat you shake it  it proposes a
 it gives you the price and the the location and ratings video i 'm not
 going all the way to flushing  
  just amazing amazing things of course 
 its not just about the iphone the iphone broke the dyke  the wall but now it 's everybody else so google has done their own android operating system that will soon be on handsets phones from thirty four companies 
 touch screen very very nice also with its own app store where you can download programs this is amazing in the wake of all this 
 verizon the most calcified corporate 
  you can use any phone you want on our network i love the wired headline pigs fly  hell freezes over and verizon opens up its network no really so everything is changing 
 we 've entered a new world of of innovation  where the cell phone becomes your laptop customized the way you want it
  just to round it up this is the new apple power music stand it 's only three pounds or twelve if you install microsoft office 
 sorry that was mean  this is a song i did for the new york times website as a music video ladies and gentlemen for seven
 blissful hours it was the number one video on youtube
  my phone i too will join the
  you had me from
