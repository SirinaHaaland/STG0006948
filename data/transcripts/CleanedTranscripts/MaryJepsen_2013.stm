  i had brain surgery eighteen years ago and since that time brain science has become a personal passion of mine  i 'm actually an engineer 
 and first let me say  i recently joined google
 's moonshot group where i had a division the display division in google x  and the brain science work i 'm speaking about today is work i did before i joined google and on the side outside of google so
 that said  there 's a stigma when you have brain surgery  are you still smart or not 
 and if not can you make yourself smart again 
  part of my brain was missing  and i had to
 deal with that it wasn 't the grey matter but it was the gooey part dead center that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters 
 immediately after my surgery  i had to decide what amounts of each of over a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day 
 because if i just took nothing i would die within hours 
 every day now for eighteen years every single day
 i 've had to
  try to decide the combinations and mixtures of chemicals and try to get them to stay alive  
 there have been several close calls  but luckily  i 'm an experimentalist at heart so i decided
 i would experiment to try to find more optimal dosages because there really isn 't a clear road map on this that 's detailed i began to try different mixtures and i was
  was
 blown away by how tiny changes in dosages
 dramatically changed my sense of self my sense of who i was my thinking my behavior towards people 
 one particularly dramatic case for a couple months i actually tried dosages and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s 
 and i was blown away by how my thoughts changed
  i was angry all the time  
 i thought about sex constantly  and i thought i was the smartest person in the entire world and 
 of course over the years i 'd met guys kind of like that or maybe kind of toned down versions of that i was kind of extreme
  to me the surprise was i wasn 't trying to be arrogant  i was actually
 trying with a little bit of insecurity 
 to actually fix a problem in front of me  and it just didn 't come out that way so i i couldn 't handle it i changed my dosages but that
 experience i think gave me a new appreciation for men and what they might walk through and i 've gotten along with men a a lot better since then 
 what i was trying to do
  with tuning these hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth
 was to try to get my intelligence back after my illness and surgery 
 my creative thought my idea flow  and i think mostly in images and so for me that became a key metric
 how to get these mental images that i use as a way of rapid prototyping if you will my ideas
 trying on different new ideas for size playing out scenarios this kind of thinking isn 't new philiosophers like hume and descartes and hobbes saw things 
  similarly  they thought that mental images and ideas were actually the same thing 
  most of us are central in inventive and creative thinking  
 so after several years i tuned myself up and i have lots of great really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication and the analytical backbone behind them and so now i 'm working on 
 how can i get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen faster 
 can you imagine
 if you will a movie director being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her 
 or a musician to get the music out of his head  
 there are incredible possibilities with this as a way for creative people to share at light speed  and the truth is the remaining bottleneck in being able to
 do this is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems 
 so let me show you why i think we 're pretty close to getting there by sharing with you two recent experiments from two top neuroscience groups  
 both used
 technology functional magnetic resonance imaging technology to image the brain and here is a brain scan set from giorgio ganis and his colleagues at harvard 
 and the left hand column shows a brain scan of a person looking at an image
  middle column shows the brainscan of that same individual imagining seeing that same image 
 and the right column was created by subtracting the middle column from the left column showing the difference to be nearly zero 
 this was repeated on lots of different individuals with lots of different
  always with a similar result the difference between seeing an image and imagining seeing that same image is next to nothing  
 next let me share with you one other experiment this from jack gallant 's lab at cal berkeley  
 they 've been able to decode brainwaves into recognizable visual fields  so let me set this up for you in this experiment individuals were shown hundreds of hours of youtube videos while scans were made of their brains
 to create a large
 library of their brain reacting to video sequences 
 then a new movie was shown with new images new people new animals in it and a new scan set was recorded 
 the computer using brain scan data alone decoded that new brain scan to show what it thought
 the individual was
  you see the computer 's guess and on the left hand side the presented clip  this is the 
 we are so close to being able to do this we just need to up the resolution 
 and now remember that when you see an image versus when you imagine that same image it creates the same brain scan 
  brain scan systems available today and their resolution has increased really about a thousandfold in the last several years 
 next we need to increase the resolution another thousandfold
 to get a deeper glimpse 
 how do we do that there 's a lot of techniques in this approach  one way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes  i 'm not for that
  there 's a lot of new imaging techniques being proposed some even by me but given the recent success of mri 
 first we need to ask the question is it the end of the road with this technology  
 conventional wisdom says the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets  but at this point bigger magnets only offer incremental resolution improvements not the thousandfold we
  i 'm putting forward an idea  instead of bigger magnets let 's make better magnets  
 there 's some new technology breakthroughs in nanoscience when applied to magnetic structures that have created a whole new class of magnets  and with these magnets we 
  can lay down very fine detailed magnetic field patterns throughout the brain and using those  we can actually create
  patterns 
 as is shown here by shifting things we can create much more complicated structures with with slightly different arrangements kind of like making spirograph 
 so why does that matter a lot of effort in mri over the years has gone into making really big  really
  but yet most of the recent advances in resolution have actually come from
 ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions in the  f m radio frequency transmitters and receivers in the mri systems  
 let 's also instead of a uniform magnetic field put down structured magnetic patterns in addition
 to the f m radio frequencies so by combining the magnetics patterns with the patterns in the
  processing which can massively increase the information that we can extract in a single scan  
 and on top of that we can then layer our ever growing knowledge of brain structure and memory
 to create a thousandfold increase that we need  
 and using fmri we should be able to measure not just oxygenated blood flow  but the hormones and neurotransmitters i 've talked
  about and maybe even the direct neural activity which is the dream we 're going to be able to dump our ideas directly to digital media  
 could you imagine if we could leapfrog language and communicate directly with human thought 
 what would we be capable of then  and how will we learn to deal with the truths of unfiltered human thought
 you think the internet was big  
 these are huge questions it might be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills  
 and indeed this very same tool may prove to lead to the cure for alzheimer 's and similar diseases  
 we have little option but to open this door  regardless pick a year will
  it happen in five years or fifteen years it 's hard to imagine it
 taking much longer we need to learn how to take this step together  thank you
