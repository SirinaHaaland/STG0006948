 to live life differently can start in some of the most unusual places this is where i
 come from todmorden it 's a market town in the north of england fifteen thousand people between leeds and manchester  fairly normal market town
  and now it 's more like this with fruit and veg and herbs sprouting up all over the place  we call it propaganda gardening 
 corner row railway station car park front of a health center people 's front gardens 
 and even in front of the police station
  we 've got edible canal towpaths  and we 've got sprouting cemeteries the soil is extremely good 
 we 've even invented a new form of tourism it 's called vegetable tourism  
 and believe it or not people come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds even when there 's not much growing 
 but it starts a conversation
  're not doing it because we 're bored we 're doing it
 because we want to start a revolution  
 we tried to answer this simple question can you find a unifying language that cuts across age and income and culture that will help people themselves find a new way of living 
 see spaces around them differently  think about the resources they use differently
  can we find that language  and then  can we replicate those actions 
 and the answer would appear to be yes  and the language would appear to be food 
 so three and a half years ago a few of us sat around a kitchen table and we just invented the whole thing
  we came up with a really simple game plan that we put to a public meeting we did not consult we did not write a report enough of all that 
 and we said to that public meeting in todmorden  look  let 's imagine that our town is focused around three plates a community plate the way we live our everyday lives a learning plate 
 what we teach our kids in school and what new skills we share
  what we do with the pound in our pocket and which businesses we choose to support now let 's imagine those plates agitated with community actions around food 
 if we start one of those community plates spinning that 's really great that really starts to empower people but if we can then spin that community plate with the learning plate  and then 
  spin it with the business plate  we 've got a real show there  we 've got some action theater  
  reinvent community ourselves  and we 've done it all without a flipping strategy document 
 and here 's the thing as well  
 we 've not asked anybody 's permission to do this we 're just doing it 
 and we are certainly not waiting for that check to drop through the letterbox before we start and most importantly of all we are not
  daunted by the sophisticated arguments that say these small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow 's problems because
 i have seen the power of small actions and it is awesome so back to the public meeting 
 laughter we put that proposition to the meeting  
 two seconds and then the room exploded i have never ever experienced anything like that in my life  and it 's been the same in
  every single room in every town that we 've ever told our story 
 people are ready and respond to the story of food they want positive actions they can engage in and in their bones 
 they know it 's time to take personal responsibility and invest in more kindness to each other and to the environment  
 and since we had that meeting three and a half years ago it 's been a heck of a
  roller coaster  
 we started with a seed swap really simple stuff  and then we took an area of land a strip on the side of our main road which was a dog toilet basically  and we turned it into a 
  really lovely herb garden we took the corner of the car park in the station that you saw  and we made vegetable beds for everybody to share and pick from themselves 
  some reason that i cannot comprehend  it has been surrounded by prickly plants so
 we went to the doctors said would you mind us taking them up they said absolutely fine provided you get planning permission and you do it in latin and you do it in triplicate so we did 
 and now there are fruit trees and bushes and herbs and vegetables around
  and there 's been lots of other examples like the corn that was in front of the police station  and the old people 's home that we 've planted it with food that they can pick and grow  but it isn 't just about growing because we all are part of this jigsaw it
 's about taking those artistic people in your community and doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds to explain to people what 's growing there 
 because there 's so many people that don 't really recognize a vegetable unless it 's in a bit of plastic with a bit of an instruction packet on
  designed these things if it looks like this please don 't pick it but if it looks like this help yourself this is about sharing and investing in kindness 
 and for those people that don 't want to do either of those things maybe they can cook  so we pick them seasonally and then we go on the street  or in the pub or in the church or wherever people are living their lives this is about us going to the people
  we are all part of the local food jigsaw we are all part of a solution 
 and then because we know we 've got vegetable tourists and we love them to bits and they 're absolutely fantastic 
 we thought what could we do to give them an even better experience so we invented without asking of course the incredible edible green route 
 and this is a route of exhibition gardens  and edible towpaths and
 bee friendly sites  and the story of pollinators  and it 's a route that we designed that takes people through the whole of our
  town past our cafes and our small shops through our market 
 not just to and fro from the supermarket  and we 're hoping that in changing people 's footfall around our town  we 're also changing their behavior  and then there 's the second plate 
 the learning plate  
 well we 're in partnership with a high school we 've created a company  we are designing and building an aquaponics unit in some land that was spare at the back of the high school like you do
  and now we 're going to be growing fish and vegetables in an orchard with bees  
 and the kids are helping us build that and the kids are on the board  and because the community was really keen on working with the high school the high school is now teaching
 agriculture  
 and because it 's teaching agriculture  we started to think how could we then get those kids that that never had a qualification before in their lives but are really excited about growing  how can we give them some more experience
  so we got some land that was donated by a local garden center  it was really quite muddy but in a truly incredible way totally voluntary led 
 we have turned that into a market garden training center  
 and that is polytunnels and raised beds and all the things you need to get the soil under your fingers and think maybe there 's a job in this for me in the future  
 and because we were doing that some local academics said you know we could help design a commercial horticulture course for you
  one that we know of so they 're doing that and we 're going to launch it later this year  
 and it 's all an experiment  and it 's all voluntary and then there 's the third plate  because if you walk through an edible landscape and if you 're learning new skills and if you start to get interested in what 's growing seasonally you might just want to spend more of your own money in support of local producers 
 not just veg  but meat and cheese and beer and whatever else it might be  
 but then we 're just a community group
  just all volunteers what could we actually do so we did some really simple things  we fundraised we got some blackboards we put incredible edible on the top we gave it every market trader that was selling locally  and they scribbled on
 what they were selling in any one week really popular people congregated around it sales were up  
 and then we had a chat with the farmers and we said we 're really serious about this but
 didn 't actually believe us  so we thought  okay 
 what should we do i know if we can create a campaign around around one product and show them there is local loyalty to that product maybe they 'll change their mind and see we 're serious  so we launched a campaign because it just amuses me called every egg matters 
 and what we did
 was we put people on our egg map it 's a stylized map of togmorden
 anybody that 's selling their excess eggs at the garden gate perfectly legally to their neighbors we 've stuck on there we started with four  and we 've now got
 sixty four on and the result of that was that people were then going into shops asking for a local todmorden egg and the result of that was some farmers upped the amount of flocks they got of free range birds and then they went on to meat birds and although these are really really small steps 
 that increasing local economic
 confidence is starting to play out in a number of ways and we now have farmers doing cheese and they 've upped their flocks and rare breed pigs they 're doing pasties and pies and things that they would
  have never done before we 've got increasing market stalls selling local food and in a survey that local students did for us forty nine percent
 of all food traders in that town said that their bottom line had increased because of what we were actually doing and we 're just volunteers and it 's only an experiment 
 laughter now none of this is rocket science it certainly is not clever  and it 's not original  but it is joined
  up  and it is inclusive 
 this is not a movement for those people that are going to sort themselves out anyway this is a movement for everyone  we have a motto  if you eat you 're in
  's been really quite a roller coaster experience but going back to that first question that we asked is
 it replicable  yeah  it most certainly is replicable more than thirty towns in england now are spinning the incredible edible plate  
 whichever way they want to do it of their own volition they 're trying to make their own lives differently 
 and worldwide we 've got communities across america and japan it 's incredible
 america and japan and new zealand people after the earthquake in new zealand visited us in order to incorporate some of this public spiritedness around local growing into the heart of christchurch 
 and none of this takes more money
 and none of this demands a bureaucracy  but it does demand that you think things differently and you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs in
  order to create that supportive framework that
 communities can bounce off  and there 's some great ideas already in our patch our local authority has decided to make everywhere
 incredible edible and in support of that have decided to do two things first they 're going to create an asset register of spare land that they 've got put it in a food bank so that communities can use that wherever they live and they 're going to underpin that with a license  and then they 've said to every
  single one of their workforce  if you can help those communities grow  and help them to maintain their spaces 
 suddenly  we 're seeing actions on the ground from local government we 're seeing this mainstreamed we are responding creatively at last to what rio demanded of us  and there 's 
  lots more you could do i mean just to list a few one please stop putting prickly plants around public buildings it 's a waste of space
  please create edible landscapes so that our children start to walk past their food day in day out on our high streets in our parks wherever that might be inspire local planners to put the
 food sites at the heart of the town and the city plan not relegate them to the edges of the settlements that nobody can see  
 encourage all our schools to take this seriously this isn 't a second class exercise  
 if we want to
  inspire the farmers of tomorrow then please let us say to every school 
 create a sense of purpose around the importance to the environment local food and soils put that at the heart of your school culture and you will create a different generation
  the power of small actions
