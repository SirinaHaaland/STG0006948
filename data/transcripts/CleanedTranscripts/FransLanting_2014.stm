  humanity takes center stage at ted  but i would like to add a voice for the animals 
 whose bodies and minds and spirits shaped us  some years ago  it was my good fortune
 to meet a tribal elder
  on an island not far from vancouver his name is jimmy smith  and he shared a story with me
 that is told among his people who call themselves the 
 once upon a time he told me all animals on earth were one  
 even though they look different on the outside inside they 're all the same
  time to time they would gather
 at a sacred cave deep inside the forest to celebrate their unity 
 when they arrived  they would all take off their skins  
 raven shed his feathers bear his fur  and salmon her scales  and then they would dance  
 but one day a human made it to the cave
 and laughed at what
  he saw
 because he did not understand  
 embarrassed the animals fled and that was the last time they revealed themselves this way 
 the ancient understanding that underneath their separate identities all animals are one 
 has been a powerful inspiration to me  
 i like to get past
  and the scales  i want to get under the skin no matter whether i 'm facing a giant elephant or a tiny tree frog my goal
 is to connect us with them eye to eye 
 you may wonder  do i ever photograph people  sure 
 people are always present in my photos  no matter whether they appear to
  portray tortoises or cougars
 or lions  you just have to learn how to look past their disguise 
 as a photographer i try to reach beyond the differences in our genetic makeup
 to appreciate all we have in common
 with every other living thing  when i use my
  camera  i drop my skin
 like the animals at that cave
 so i can show who they really are as animals blessed
 with the power
 of rational thought we can marvel at the intricacies of life  
 as citizens of a planet in trouble it is our moral responsibility
 to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life  
 but as humans with hearts we can all rejoice
 in the unity of life  and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave 
 let 's find a way
 to join the dance  thank you
