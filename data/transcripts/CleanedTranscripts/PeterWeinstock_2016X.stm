  what if i told you there was a new technology
 that when placed in the hands of doctors and nurses  
 improved outcomes for children and adults patients of all ages  
 reduced pain and suffering
  reduced time in the operating rooms  reduced anesthetic times 
 had the ultimate dose response curve that the more you did it the better it benefitted patients 
 here 's a kicker it has no side effects and it 's available no matter where care is delivered i can tell
  doctor at boston children 's hospital this would be a game changer for me that technology is lifelike
 rehearsal  this lifelike rehearsal is being delivered
 through medical simulation i thought i would start with a case 
 just to really describe the the challenge ahead and why this technology is not just
 going to improve health care but why it 's critical to health care  this is a
  child that 's born  
 young girl day of life zero we call it the first day of life just born into the world and just as she 's being born we notice very quickly that she is deteriorating  
 her heart rate is going up her blood pressure is going down she 's breathing very very fast and the reason for this
 is displayed in this chest
 as you look on the top side of this that 's where the heart and lungs are supposed to be as you look at the bottom end that 's where the abdomen is and that 's where the intestines are supposed to be  and you can see how there 's sort of 
  that translucent area that made its way up into the right side of this child 's chest  
  as a result they 're pushing on the lungs and making it very difficult for this poor baby to breathe 
 the fix for this problem is to take this child immediately to the operating room bring those intestines back into the abdomen let the lungs expand and allow this child to breathe again  
 but before she can go to the operating room she must get whisked away to the icu 
 where i work i work with surgical teams we gather around her and we place this child
  we put her to sleep  we make a tiny little incision in the neck we place catheters into the major vessels of the neck and i can tell you that these vessels are about the size
 of a pen the tip of a pen
 and then we have blood drawn from the body we bring it through a machine it gets oxygenated  and it goes back into the body 
 we save her life and get her safely to the operating room
  here 's the problem these disorders what is known is congenital diaphragmatic hernia
 this hole in the diaphragm that has allowed these intestines to sneak up these disorders are rare  
 even in the best hands in the world 
 there is still a challenge to get the volume the natural volume of these patients in order to get our
  expertise curve at one hundred percent they just don 't present that often so how do you make the rare common 
 here 's the other problem 
 in the health care system that i trained for over twenty years 
 what currently exists the model of training is called the apprenticeship model it 's been around for centuries  it 's based on this
  idea that you see a surgery maybe once  maybe several times you then go do that surgery  
 and then ultimately you teach that surgery to the next generation  
 and implicit in this model
 i don 't need to tell you this
 is that we practice on the very patients that we are delivering care to that 's a problem
 i think there 's a better approach 
 medicine may very well be the last high stakes industry that does not practice prior to game time
 i want to describe to you a better approach through medical simulation
  the first thing we did is we went to other high stakes industries that had been using this type of methodology for decades  this is nuclear power nuclear power runs scenarios 
  on a regular basis in order to practice what they hope will never occur  
  training on scenarios that we hope will never occur but we know if they did 
 they would be prepared for the worst 
 in fact  
 the airline industry has gone as far as to create fuselages of simulation environments because of the importance of the team coming together  
 this is an evacuation drill simulator  
 so again if that ever were to happen these rare rare events
  ready to act on the drop of a dime
 i guess the most compelling for me in some ways is the sports industry
 arguably high stakes 
 you think about a baseball team baseball players practice i think it 's a beautiful example of progressive training the first thing they do is go out to spring training they go to a spring training camp  
 perhaps a simulator in
 baseball they 're not on the real field but they 're on a simulated field and they 're playing in the pregame season then they make their way to the field during
 the season games and what 's the first thing they do before they
 start the game they go into the batting cage and do batting practice for hours having different types of pitches being thrown at
  ball after ball as they limber their muscles getting ready for the game itself  and here 's the most phenomenal part of this 
 and for all of you who watch any sport event you will see this phenomenon happen  
 the batter gets into the batter 's box the pitcher gets ready to pitch right before the pitch is thrown 
 what does that batter do the batter steps out of the box
 and takes a
  practice swing  he wouldn 't do it any other way i want
 to talk to you about how we 're building practice swings like this in medicine we are building batting cages
 for the patients that we care about at boston children 's i want to use this case that we recently built it
 's the case of a four year old who had a progressively enlarging head and as a result had loss of developmental milestones
  neurologic milestones and the reason for this problem is here it 's called hydrocephalus so a quick
 quick study in neurosurgery there 's the brain and you can see the cranium surrounding the brain
 what surrounds the brain between the brain and cranium is something called cerebrospinal fluid or fluid which acts as a shock absorber
 in your heads right now there is cerebrospinal
  fluid just bathing your brains and making its way around it 's produced in one area and flows through and then is re exchanged and this beautiful flow pattern occurs for all of us  
 but unfortunately in some children there 's a blockage of this flow pattern  
 much like a traffic jam 
 as a result the fluid accumulates
  and the brain is pushed aside  it has difficulty growing 
 as a result  the child loses neurologic milestones this is a devastating disease in children
 the cure for this
 is surgery  the traditional surgery is to take a bit of the cranium off a bit of the skull drain this fluid out stick a drain in place  
 and then eventually bring this drain internal to the body  big operation  
 but some great news
  that advances in neurosurgical care have allowed us to develop minimally invasive approaches
 to this surgery through a small pinhole a camera can be inserted  
 led into the deep brain structure and cause a little hole in a membrane that allows all that fluid to drain much like it would in a sink
 all of a sudden the brain is no longer under
  pressure can re expand and we cure the child through a single hole incision  
 but here 's the problem  hydrocephalus is relatively rare  
 and there are no good training methods to get really good at getting this scope to the right place but
 surgeons have been quite creative about this even our own  and they 've come up with training models here 's the current training model
 i kid you not 
 this is a red pepper  not made in hollywood it 's real red pepper  and what surgeons do is they stick a scope into the pepper and they do what is called a 
 they use this scope to remove seeds
 using a little tweezer  and that is a way to get under their belts
 the rudimentary components of doing this surgery 
 then they head right into the apprenticeship model seeing many of them as they present themselves 
 then doing it  and then teaching it waiting for these patients to arrive  
 we can do a lot better we are manufacturing
 reproductions of children
 in order for surgeons and surgical teams to rehearse in the
  most relevant possible ways let me show you this here 's my team
 in what 's called the sim engineering division of the simulator program  
 this is an amazing team of individuals 
 they are mechanical engineers you 're seeing here  illustrators  they take primary data from
  translate it into digital information animate it put it together into the components of the child itself
 elements of the child that have been casted as needed depending on the surgery itself  and then take this digital data and be able to output it on
  the micron detail of what the child 's anatomy will look like you can see here the skull of this child being printed
 in the hours before we performed this surgery  but we could not do this
 work without our dear friends on the west coast in hollywood california
 these are individuals that are incredibly talented at being able to recreate reality
  it was not a
 long
 leap for us  the more we got into this field the more it became clear to us that we are doing cinematography  
 we 're doing filmmaking  it 's just that the actors are not actors
 they 're real doctors and nurses so these are some
  this is justin raleigh and his group
 this is not one of our patients 
 laughter but kind of the exquisite work that these individuals do we have now collaborated and fused our experience  
 bringing their group to boston children 's hospital sending our group out to hollywood california
  and exchanging around this to be able to develop these type of simulators what i 'm about to show you
 is a reproduction of this child 
 you 'll notice here that every hair on the child 's head
 is reproduced and in fact  this is also that reproduced child and i apologize for any queasy
  but that is a reproduction and simulation of the child they 're about to operate on
 here 's that membrane we had talked about the inside of this child 's brain
 what you 're going to be seeing here is on one side the actual patient  and on the other side the simulator 
 as i mentioned a scope a little camera needs to make its way down and you 're seeing that here it needs to make a small hole in this membrane and allow this fluid
 to seep out i won 't do a
 quiz show to see who thinks which side is which but on the right is the simulator
 so surgeons can now produce training opportunities do these surgeries as many times as they want to their heart
 's content until they feel comfortable  and then and only then bring the child into the operating room  
 but we don 't stop here we know that a key step to this is not just the skill itself  but combining that skill
 with a team who 's going to deliver that care now we turn to formula one  
 and here is an example of a technician putting on a tire and doing that time and time again on this car  but that is very quickly going to be incorporated
  experiences now as a full team orchestrating the exchange of tires and getting this car back on the speedway
 we 've done that step in health care so now what you 're about to see is a simulated operation  
 we 've taken the simulator i just described to you we 've brought it into the operating room at boston children 's hospital and these individuals these native teams
 operative teams are doing the surgery before the surgery  operate twice  cut once  let me show that to you
  the second step to this which is critical is we take these teams out immediately and debrief them  
 we use the same technologies that are used in lean and six sigma
 in the military  and we bring them out and talk about what went right but more
  importantly  we talk about what didn 't go well  
 and how we 're going to fix it  then we bring them right back in and do it again  deliberative batting practice
 in the moments when it matters most let
 's go back to this case now 
 same child but now let me describe how we care for this child at boston children 's hospital this child was born at three o 'clock in the morning
 at two o 'clock in the morning  we assembled the team 
 and took the reproduced anatomy that we would gain out of scans and images  and brought that team to the virtual bedside to a simulated bedside the same team that 's going to operate on this child in the hours ahead
 and we have them do
  show you a moment of this this is not a real incision  and the baby has not yet been born  
 imagine this 
 so now the conversations that i have with families
 in the intensive care unit at boston children 's hospital are totally different  imagine this conversation not only
 do we take care of this disorder frequently in
 icu and not only have we done surgeries like the surgery we 're going to do on your child  but
 we have done your child 's surgery  
 and we did it two hours ago  
 and we did it ten times  and now we 're prepared to take them back to the operating room 
 so a new technology in health care lifelike
 rehearsal practicing prior to game time  thank you
