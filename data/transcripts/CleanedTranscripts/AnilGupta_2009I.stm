  a message from
 tens of thousands of people
 in the villages in the slums in the hinterland of the country who have solved problems through their own genius
 without any outside help 
 when our home minister announces
 a few weeks ago
 a war
 on one third of india about two hundred districts that he mentioned were ungovernable 
 he missed the point  
 the point that we have been stressing for the last
 the point that
 people may be economically poor  but they 're not poor in the mind  in other words  the minds on the margin
 are not the marginal minds that is the message which we started thirty one years ago and what did it start
  let me just tell you briefly my personal journey which led me to come to this point in '
 eighty five ' eighty six i was in bangladesh advising the government and the research council there how to help scientists work
 on the lands on the fields of the poor people  and how to develop research technologies  which are based on the knowledge of the people 
 i came back in ' eighty six i had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that i found in that country which had sixty percent landlessness
  but amazing creativity  i started looking at my own work the work that i had done
 for the previous ten years  almost every time had instances of knowledge that people had shared now
 i was paid in dollars as a consultant  
 and i looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself is there a line in my return which shows how much of this income
 gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible 
 was it because i 'm brilliant that i 'm getting this reward or because of the revolution 
 is it that i write very well is it that i articulate very well is it that i analyze the data very well is it because i 'm a professor and therefore i must be entitled to this reward from society 
 i tried to convince myself that
 will become more responsive to the needs of the poor poor and therefore i think it 's okay but it appeared to me
 that all these years that i 'd been working on exploitation exploitation by landlords by moneylenders by traders
 gave me an insight that probably i was also an exploiter 
  no line in my income tax return which showed this income accrued because of the brilliance of the people
 those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me and nothing ever went back to them so much so that much of my work till that time was in the english language the
 majority of the people from whom i learned didn 't know english  
 so what kind of a contributor was i i was talking about social justice  
 and here i was a professional who was pursuing the most unjust act of taking knowledge from the people making them anonymous  
 getting rent from that knowledge
 by sharing it and doing consultancy writing papers and publishing them in the papers  getting invited to the conferences  getting consultancies and whatever have you 
 so then a dilemma rose in the mind that if i 'm also an exploiter then this is not right life cannot go on like that 
 and this was a moment of great pain and
  't live with it any longer  
 so i did a review of of ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research wrote  read about one hundred papers 
 and i came to the conclusion that while dilemma is unique  
 dilemma is not unique the solution had to be unique  and one day i don 't know what happened while coming back from the office towards home
 maybe i saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if i only could be like the honey bee life would be wonderful
  what the honey bee does it pollinates takes nectar from the flower  pollinates another flower cross pollinates 
 and when it takes the nectar the flowers don 't feel shortchanged 
 in fact they invite the
 honey bees through their colors  and the bees don 't keep all the honey for themselves 
 these are the three guiding principles of the honey bee network that whenever we learn
  something from people
 it must be shared with them in their language  they must not remain anonymous 
 and i must tell you that after twenty years  i have not made one percent of change in the professional practice of this art that is a great tragedy which i 'm carrying still with me and i hope that all of you will carry this with you
 that the profession still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without attributing them by making them
  anonymous  the research guidelines of u s national academy of sciences or research councils of the u k or of indian councils of science research
 do not require
 that whatever you learn from people you must share back with them  
 we are talking about an accountable society  a society  that is fair and just and we don 't even do justice in the knowledge market and india wants to be a knowledge society 
 how will it be a knowledge society  
 so obviously you cannot have two principles of justice one for
  yourself and one for others it must be the same  you cannot discriminate you cannot be in favor of your own values which are at
 a distance from the values that you espouse so fairness to one and to the other is not divisible  look at this picture 
 can you tell me where has it been taken from and
  it been used for what has it been used for 
 you know you 're so right we must give him a hand 
 because this man knows how insensitive our government is look at this this is the site of the government of india  it invites tourists
 to see the shame of our country
  i 'm so sorry to say that is this a beautiful picture or is it a
 terrible picture it
 depends upon how you look at the life of the people if
 this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles  you cannot be celebrating that
 we should be doing something about it and let me tell you with all the science and technology at our command  millions of women still carry water on their
  do not ask this question you must have taken tea in the morning 
 think for a minute  the leaves of the tea  
 plucked from the bushes  you know what the action is the action is the lady picks up a few leaves puts them in the basket
 on the backside just do it ten times  you will realize the pain in this shoulder  and she does it a few
  the rice that you ate in the lunch  and you will eat today is transplanted by women bending
 in a very awkward posture millions of them every season in the paddy season  when they transplant paddy
 with their feet in the water and feet in the water will develop fungus  infections  and that infection pains because
  point nine percent of the paddy is transplanted manually no machines have been developed so the silence of scientists 
 of technologists of public policy makers of the change agent drew our attention that this is not on this is not on this is not the way society will work this is not what our parliament would do  you know  we have a program for employment one
  million people have to be given jobs for one hundred days
 by this great country doing what breaking stones digging earth 
 so we asked a question to the parliament do poor have heads 
 do poor have legs  mouth and hands but no head  
 so honey bee network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich  and what has happened an anonymous  faceless  nameless person
  gets in contact with the network and then gets an identity  this is what honey bee network is about and this network grew
 voluntarily continues to be voluntary and has tried to map the minds of millions of people of our country and other parts of the world
 who are creative  they could be creative in terms of education they may be creative in terms of culture they may be creative in terms of institutions but a lot of our work is in the field of technological
  in terms of contemporary innovations or in terms of traditional knowledge 
 and it all begins with curiosity 
 it all begins with curiosity  this person whom we met and you will see it on the website  www sristi org this tribal person  he had a wish 
 and he said if my wish gets fulfilled somebody was sick and he had to monitor
  and if you cure him  
 i will get my wall painted and this is what he got painted  somebody was talking yesterday about maslowian hierarchy there could be nothing more wrong than the maslowian model of hierarchy of 
  needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment kabir rahim all the great sufi saints  they were all poor people  and they had a great reason 
  person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something look at this we saw it
 in shodh yatra every six months we walk in different parts of the country  i 've walked about four thousand kilometers in the last twelve years  so on the wayside we found these dung cakes 
  this lady on the wall of the dung cake heap has made a painting that 's the only space she could express her creativity  and she 's so
 marvelous look at this lady ram timari devi on a grain bin in champaran  we had a shodh yatra
 and we were walking in the land where gandhiji went to hear about the tragedy pain of indigo growers
 bhabi mahato in purulia and
  look at what she has done  the whole wall is her canvas she 's sitting there with a broom 
 is she an artisan or an artist  obviously she 's an artist she 's a creative person if we can create markets for these artists we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones  they will 
  be paid for what they are good at not what they 're bad at 
 look at what rojadeen has done
  lot of people who sell tea on the shack
 and  obviously there 's a limited market for tea  every morning you have tea as well as coffee so he thought why don 't i convert a pressure cooker into a coffee machine  
 so this is a coffee machine just takes a few hundred rupees people bring their own cooker he attaches a valve and a steam pipe  and now he gives you espresso coffee
  jahangir has done a
 lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground  
 so this fellow is bringing a flour grinding machine on a two wheeler 
 if you have five hundred grams 
 one thousand one kilogram he will grind it for it for you the flourmill
 will not grind such a small quantity  please understand the problem of poor people  they have needs which have to be met efficiently
 in terms of energy in terms of cost in terms of quality
 outputs  but to be able to give them high quality output you need to adapt technology to their needs and that is what sheikh jahangir
 did but that 's not enough what he did  look at what he did here  
 if you have clothes and you don 't have enough time to wash them he brought a washing machine to your doorstep  
  washing machine he is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep 
 you bring your water you bring your soap i wash the clothes for you charge fifty paisa one rupee for you per lot and a new business model can emerge  
 now what we need is we need people who will be able to scale them up look at this 
  but you know what it is can anybody guess what it is  somebody from india would know 
 it 's a
 tawa it 's a hot plate made of clay  
 now  what is the beauty in it when you have a non stick pan it costs about  maybe 
 two hundred and fifty rupees five dollars six dollars  this is
  less than a dollar
 and this is non stick it is coated with one of these
 food grade materials  and the best part is that while you use a costly non stick pan  you eat
 the so called teflon or teflon like material because after some time the stuff disappears where has it gone it has gone in your stomach  it was not meant for that 
 you know  but here in this clay hot plate hot plate it will never go into your stomach  so it is better  it is safer
  affordable  it is energy efficient in other words solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper need not be so called jugaad need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement they have to be better  they 
  have to be more efficient they have to be affordable  and that is what mansukh bhai prajapati has done he has designed this plate with a handle  and now with one dollar  you can afford a better
  alternative than the people market is offering you this lady  she developed a herbal pesticide formulation
 we filed the patent for her the national innovation foundation and who knows somebody will license this technology
 and develop marketable products  and she would get revenue  
 now let me mention one thing i think we need a polycentric model of development where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country in different parts of the world would solve the needs of locality
  efficient and adaptive manner  higher the local fit  greater is the chance of scaling up 
 in the scaling up there 's an inherent inadequacy to match
 the needs of the local people  point by point with the supply that you 're making  so why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch things can scale up and they have scaled up
  for example cell phones we have four hundred million cellphones in this country  now  it is possible that i use only two buttons on the cellphone only three options on the cellphone it has three hundred options i 'm paying for three hundred i 'm using only three but i 'm willing to live with it therefore it is scaling up  
 but if i had to get a match to match  obviously  i would need a different design of a cellphone  so what we 're saying is that scalability should not become an enemy of sustainability 
 there must be a place in the world for solutions that are only relevant for a locality and yet
 one can be able to fund them one of the greatest studies that we 've been finding is that many times investors would ask this question what is a scalable model 
 as if the need of a community which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places has no legitimate right to get them for free because it 's not part of a larger scale
  needs to a larger scale or else you remain out  now  the eminent model the  long tail model tells you that small sales
 of a large number of books for example  having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model 
 and we must find a mechanism where people will pool in the portfolio will invest in the portfolio where different innovations will go to to a small number of people in their localities and yet the overall platform of the
  an amazing man at the age of seventy he is linking up something very creative
  but he stills sells at this age honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood because
 we haven 't been able to convince the water park people the lake people in [ unclear ] operations  and we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people in mumbai where there was a flood a few years ago and people had
  to walk twenty kilometers wading in the water that look you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office because you can then go to those lanes where your buses will not go where your transport
  not go so we have not yet cracked the problem of
 making it available as a rescue device as a vending device during the floods in eastern india when you have to deliver things to people in different
 islands where they 're marooned but the idea has a merit the idea has a merit what has appachan done appachan  unfortunately is no more but he has left
  a message a very powerful message
  many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internationally
 what i call a g2g model grassroots to global and a professor in the university of massachusetts in the zoology department  
 bought this climber because she wanted
 to study the insect diversity of the top of the tree canopy
  this device makes it possible for her to take samples from a larger number of palms rather than only a few 
 because otherwise she had to make a big platform and then climb her [ unclear ] would climb on that so you know we are advancing the frontiers of science 
 remya jose has developed  you can go to the youtube and find india innovates and then you will find these videos innovation by her when she was in class
  person one and a half foot height only but he has modified a two wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and
 flexibility this innovation is from the slums of rio  
 and this person mr ubirajara  we were talking about my friends in brazil how we scale up this model in china and brazil and we have a very vibrant network in china particularly
  but also emerging in brazil and other parts of the world  this stand on the front wheel you will not find on any cycle india and china have the largest number of cycles  
 but this innovation emerged in brazil  
 the point is  none of us should be parochial none of us should be so nationalistic to believe that all good ideas will come only from our country no we have to have the humility to learn from knowledge of economically poor people wherever they are and look at this
  a sprayer cycle that generates energy from the shocks on the road i can 't change the condition of the road but i can make the cycle run faster that is what kanak das has done  and
 in south africa  we had taken our innovators and many of us had gone there
 share with the colleagues in south africa as to how innovation can become a means of liberation from the drudgery that people have and this is a donkey cart which they modified there 's an axle here of thirty forty kg serving no purpose
  it the cart needs one donkey less  this is in china 
 this girl needed a breathing apparatus 
 these three people in the village sat down and decided to think how do we elongate the life of this girl of our village they were not related to her  but they tried to find out how can we use they used a cycle they put together a breathing
  and this breathing apparatus now saved the life and she 's very welcome there 's a whole range of innovations that we have a car which runs on compressed air with six paisa per kilometer 
 assam kanak gogoi  and you would not find this car in u s or europe  but this is available in india  now  this lady she used to do the winding of the yarn for pochampally saree in one day eighteen thousand times she had to do
  this is what her son has done after seven years of struggle she said change your profession he said i can 't this is the only thing i know but i 'll invent a machine which will solve your problem and this is what he did a sewing machine in uttar pradesh  
 so this is what sristi is saying give me a place to stand  and i will move the world i will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity 
 a whole range of things we have sold things all over the world 
 from ethiopia to turkey to u s to wherever
 products have gone to the market a few these are the people whose knowledge made this herbavate cream for eczema possible  and here a company which licensed this herbal pesticide put a photograph of the innovator on the 
  packing so that every time a user uses it it asks the user you can also be an innovator if you have an idea  send it back to us so creativity counts knowledge matters
