  love story with the poor  living on less than one dollar a day
  i went to a very elitist  snobbish expensive education
 in india and that almost destroyed me  
 i was all set to be a diplomat teacher doctor all laid out
  i don 't look it but i was the indian national squash champion for three years laughter
 the whole world was laid out for me everything was at my feet i could do nothing wrong 
 and then i thought out of curiosity i 'd like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like so 
 i went to what was called the worst bihar famine in india and i saw
  starvation death people dying of hunger for the first time it
 changed my life i
 came back home told my mother i 'd like to live and work in a village 
 mother went into a coma 
  the whole world is laid out for you the best jobs are laid out for you and you want to go and work in a village i mean is there something wrong with you i said no i 've
 got the best eduction it made me think  and i wanted to give something back
 in my own way 
 what do you want to do in a village  no job  no money no security no prospect i said i want to live
 and dig wells for five years
  wells for five years you went to the most expensive school and college in india and you want to dig wells for five years she didn 't speak to me for
 a very long time  because she thought i 'd let my family down  
 but then 
 i was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have which are never brought into the mainstream
 which is never identified respected applied on a large scale  and i thought i 'd start a barefoot college
 college only for the poor  what the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college i
 went to this village for the first time  elders came to me
 and said are you
  are you doing here  why are you here  the education system in india makes you look look at paris and new delhi and
 zurich  what are you doing in this village is there something wrong
  actually start a college only for the poor 
 what the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college so the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice  they said please 
 don 't bring anyone
 with a degree and qualification into your college so it 's the only college in india
 where if you should have a ph d or a master 's you are disqualified to come
 you have to be a cop out or a wash out or a dropout
 to come to our college  
 you have to work with your hands  you have to have a dignity of labor you have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service
 to the community  so we started
 the barefoot college  and we redefined professionalism
  a professional is someone who has a combination of competence  confidence and belief a water diviner
 is a professional a traditional midwife
 is a professional a traditional bone setter
 is a professional these are professionals all over the world you find them in any inaccessible village around the world  and we thought that these people should come into
  and show
 that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal it needs to be used needs to be applied needs to be shown to the world outside
 that these knowledge and skills are relevant even today  so the college works
 following the lifestyle and workstyle of mahatma
  you eat on the floor  you sleep on the floor  you work on the floor there are no contracts  no written contracts you can stay with me for twenty years go tomorrow  
 and no one can get more than $ one hundred a month  you come for the money  you don 't come to barefoot college  
 you come for the work and the challenge  you 'll come to the barefoot college 
 that is where we want you to try crazy ideas whatever idea you have come and try
  doesn 't matter if you fail  battered bruised you start again it 's the only college where the teacher is the learner
 and the learner is the teacher 
 and it 's the only college where we don 't give a certificate  you are certified by the community you serve  you don 't need a paper to hang on the wall to show
 that you are an engineer  
 so when i said that they said well show us what is possible what are you doing this is all
  mumbo jumbo if you can 't show it on the ground so we built the first barefoot college in 
 it was built by twelve barefoot architects who can 't read and write built on $ one 
 hundred and fifty people lived there  worked there they got the aga khan award for architecture in two thousand and two but then they suspected
  thought there was an architect behind it i said yes they made the blueprints  but the barefoot architects actually constructed the college we
 are the only ones who actually returned the award
 for $ fifty thousand because they didn 't believe us and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the barefoot architects of tilonia 
  what can you build in this place he had one look at the soil and said forget it no way
 no water rocky soil 
 i was in a bit of a spot  and i said okay i 'll go to the old man in village and say ' what should i grow in this spot ' 
 he looked quietly at me and said you build this you build this you put this and
  is what it looks like today 
 went to the roof  and all the women said clear out 
 the men should clear out because we don 't want to share this technology with the men this is waterproofing the roof 
 it is a bit of jaggery a bit of urens and a bit of other things i don 't know but it actually doesn 't leak 
 it hasn 't leaked
  all the power comes from the sun forty five kilowatts of panels on the roof and everything works off the sun for the next twenty five years so long as the sun shines we 'll have no problem with power but
 the beauty is that is was
 installed
 by a priest a hindu priest
  who 's only done eight years of primary schooling
 never been to school never been to college  he knows more about solar than anyone i know anywhere in the world
 guaranteed 
 food if you come to the barefoot college  is solar cooked  
 but the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women
  illiterate women 
 who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker it 's a parabolic scheffler solar cooker  
 unfortunately they 're almost half german  they 're so precise
  to the last inch they can make that cooker and we have sixty meals twice a day
 of solar cooking we have a dentist she 's a grandmother illiterate who
 's a dentist she actually looks after the teeth of seven thousand children 
 barefoot technology 
  no engineer no architect thought of it but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs 
 very little water is wasted all the roofs are connected underground to a four hundred thousand liter tank  
 and no water is wasted  if we have four years of drought we still have water on the campus because we collect rainwater 
 sixty percent of children don 't go to school  because they have to look after animals
  so we thought of starting a school at night for the children
 because the night schools of tilonia over seventy five thousand children
 have gone through these night schools because it 's for the convenience of the of the child it 's not for the convenience of the teacher and what do we teach in these schools  democracy  citizenship 
 how you should measure your land 
 what you should do if you
  if your animal is sick this is what we teach in the night schools but all the schools
 every five years we have an election between six to fourteen year old children
 participate in a democratic process  and they
 elect a prime minister the prime minister is twelve years old
  she looks after twenty goats in the morning but she 's prime minister in the evening  
 she has a cabinet a
 minister of education a minister for energy a minister for health  and they actually monitor and supervise one hundred and fifty schools for seven thousand children 
 she got the world 's children 's prize five years ago and she went
  first time ever going out of her village  never seen
 sweden  wasn 't dazzled at all by what was happening  
 and the queen of sweden who 's there  turned to me and said can you ask this child where she got her confidence from she 's only twelve years old and she 's not dazzled by anything 
 and the girl who 's on her left  turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye
 and said please tell
  where the percentage of illiteracy is very high we use puppetry 
 puppets is the way we communicate  
 you have
  jokhim chacha who is three hundred years old  
 he is my psychoanalyst  he is my teacher he 's my doctor  he 's my lawyer  
 he 's my donor  he actually raises money solves my disputes
  he solves my problems in the village  if there 's tension
  a friction between the teacher and the parent the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says shake hands  the attendance must not drop 
 these puppets are made out of recycled world bank reports
  we 've covered all over india from ladakh up to bhutan
 all solar electrified villages by people who have been trained  
 and we went to ladakh  and we asked this woman this
  at minus forty you have to come out of the roof  because there 's no place it was all snowed up on both sides
 and we asked this woman what was the benefit you had from solar electricity 
 and she thought for a minute and said it 's the first time i can see my husband 's face in winter 
 went to afghanistan  one lesson we learned
  men are restless men are ambitious men are compulsively mobile  and they all want a certificate 
 all across the globe you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate why because they want to leave the village
 and go to a city looking for a job  so we came up with a great solution train grandmothers what
 's the best way of communicating in the world today
  afghanistan for the first time 
 and we picked three women and said we want to take them to india they said impossible they don 't even go out of their rooms and you want to take them to india 
 i said i 'll make a concession i 'll take the husbands along as well so i took the husbands along of course the women were much more intelligent than the men
  six months 
 how do we train these women sign language  
 you don 't choose the written word  you don 't choose the spoken word  you use sign language  and in six months
 they can
 become solar engineers  they go back and solar electrify their own village  this woman went back and
  set up a workshop the first village ever to be solar electrified in afghanistan [ was ] by the three women 
 this woman
 is an extraordinary grandmother fifty five years old and she 's solar electrified two hundred houses for me in afghanistan and they haven 't collapsed 
  she actually went and spoke to an engineering department in afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between ac and dc he didn 't know 
 those three women have trained twenty seven more women and solar electrified one hundred villages in afghanistan  we went to
 africa  and we did the same thing 
 all these women sitting at one table from eight nine countries all chatting to each other not understanding a word because they 're all speaking a different language but their body language is great
 they 're speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers  i went to
 sierra leone  and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night
 comes across this village comes back goes into the village says
  there 's a solar electrified village in sierra leone he said no half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day what 's the story 
 so he summoned me and said can you train me one hundred and fifty grandmothers 
 i said i can 't mr president  but they will  the grandmothers will so he built me the first barefoot training center in sierra leone  and one hundred and fifty grandmothers
  went to select a grandmother in gambia went to this village  i knew which woman i would like to take the community got together and said take these two women
  up on the mobile she went like a grandmother
 and came back like a tiger  she walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she
  a veteran she handled the national press  and she was a star and when i went back six months later i said where 's your husband
  for solutions within and listen to people they have the solutions in front of you they
 're all over the world don 't even worry don 't listen to the world bank listen to the people on the ground  they have all the solutions  in the world 
 i 'll end with a quotation by mahatma gandhi first they ignore you 
  then they laugh at you then they fight you
