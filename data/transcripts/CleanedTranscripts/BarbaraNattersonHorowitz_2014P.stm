  ten years ago  i got a phone call that changed my life 
 at the time  i was cardiologist at ucla specializing in cardiac imaging
  the call came from a veterinarian at the los angeles zoo
 an elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial droop
 and the veterinarians were worried that she 'd had a stroke they asked if i 'd come to the zoo
 and image the animal 's heart to look for a possible cardiac cause  now to be
  north american zoos are staffed by highly qualified
 veterinarians who take outstanding care of their animal patients  
 but occasionally they do reach into the human medical community  particularly for some speciality consultation  
 and i was one of the lucky physicians who was invited in to help 
 i had a chance to rule out a stroke
 in this chimpanzee
 and make sure that this gorilla didn 't have a torn aorta  evaluate this macaw
 for a heart murmur make sure that this california sea lion 's  paricardium wasn 't inflamed  
 and in this picture i 'm listening to the heart of a lion
 after a lifesaving  collaborative procedure with veterinarians and physicians where we drained seven hundred cc 's of fluid from the sac in which this lion 's heart was contained  
 and this procedure which i have done on many human patients was identical with the exception of
 that paw
 and that tail  
 now most of the time  
 i was working at ucla medical center with physicians discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments
 for my human patients  but some of the
  i was working at the los angeles zoo with veterinarians discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for their animal patients  
 and occasionally  on the very same day  i went on rounds at ucla medical center
 and at the los angeles zoo and here 's what started coming into very clear focus for me 
 physicians and
  veterinarians were essentially taking care of the same disorders in their animal and human patients  
 congestive heart failure  
 brain tumors
  got a confession to make  
 even though i studied comparative physiology and evolutionary biology as an undergrad
 i had even written my senior thesis on darwinian theory
 learning about the
  significant overlap between the disorders of animals and humans it came as a much needed wake up call for me  
 so i started wondering 
 with all of these overlaps how was it that i had never thought to ask a veterinarian
  or consult the veterinary literature for insights into one of my human patients
  why had i never  nor had any of my physician friends and colleagues whom i asked  
 ever attended a veterinary conference 
 for that matter  why was any of this a surprise
  every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans  
 every medication that we prescribe
 or that we 've taken ourselves or we 've given to our families has first been tested on an animal 
 but there 's something very different about giving an animal a medication
 or a human disease and the
  animal developing congestive heart failure or diabetes or breast cancer on their own 
 now maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the 
 you know we hear about these city kids who think that wool
  grows on trees
 or that cheese comes from a plant  
 well today 's human hospitals  increasingly 
 are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology  
 and this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there
 and animal patients
 who are living in oceans
 and farms and jungles  but i think there 's an even deeper reason 
 physicians and scientists we accept intellectually that our species homo sapiens is merely
  no more unique or special than any other 
 but in our hearts we don 't completely believe that 
 i feel it myself when i 'm listening to mozart
 or looking at pictures of the mars rover on my macbook  
 i feel that tug of human exceptionalism 
 even as i recognize
 the scientifically isolating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species  apart well
 i 'm trying these days 
 when i see a human patient now  i always ask  what do the animal doctors know about this problem that i don 't know 
 and might i be taking better care
  care of my human patient if i saw them as a human animal patient 
 here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connections that this kind of thinking has led me to
 fear induced heart failure
 around the year two thousand human cardiologists
  discovered emotionally induced heart failure 
 it was described in a gambling father who had lost his life 's savings with a roll of the dice 
 in a bride who 'd been left at the alter  
 but it turns out
  human diagnosis
 was neither new  nor was it uniquely human veterinarians
 had been diagnosing treating and even preventing
 emotionally induced symptoms in animals ranging from monkeys to flamingos from to deer to rabbits  
  have been saved if this veterinary knowledge had been put into the hands of e r docs and cardiologists
 some human patients harm themselves  
 some pluck out patches of hair  others actually cut themselves
  some animal patients also harm themselves 
 there are birds that pluck out feathers 
 there are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed  
 but veterinarians have very specific and very effective
  this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands of psychotherapists and parents and patients struggling with self injury 
 postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis  sometimes
  soon after giving birth some women become depressed and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psychotic 
 they may neglect their newborn  and in some extreme cases  even harm the child
 equine veterinarians also know that occasionally a mare  soon after giving birth  
 will neglect the foal  refusing to nurse  and in some instances
 the foal even to death  
 but veterinarians have devised an intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome
 that involves increasing oxytocin
 in the mare oxytocin is the bonding hormone  and this leads to renewed interest on the part of the mare in her foal
 shouldn 't this information be put into the hands of ob gyn 's and family doctors and patients
 who are struggling with postpartum depression and psychosis  
 well despite all of this promise  unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains
  large to explain it i 'm afraid i 'm going to have to air some dirty laundry some physicians
 can be real snobs about doctors who are not m d ' s i 'm talking about dentists and optometrists and psychologists
  but maybe especially
 animal doctors of course most physicians don 't realize that it is harder to get into vet school these days
 than medical school  
 and that when we go to medical school we learn everything there is to know about one species homo sapiens
  but veterinarians need to learn about health and disease in mammals amphibians reptiles fish and birds
 so i don 't blame the vets for feeling annoyed
 by my profession 's condescension and ignorance  but here 's one from the vets  
 what do you call a veterinarian
 who can only take care of one species
  closing the gap has become a passion for me  
 and i 'm doing this through programs like darwin on rounds at 
 where we 're bringing animal experts and evolutionary biologists
 and embedding them on our medical teams with our interns and
  our residents  
 and through zoobiquity conferences  where we bring medical schools together with veterinary schools for 
 discussions of the shared diseases and disorders of animal and human patients at
  cancer in a tiger
 can help us better treat breast cancer in a kindergarten teacher 
 how understanding polycystic  overies in a holstein cow can help us better take care of a dance instructor with painful periods 
 and how better understanding the treatment of separation anxiety
 can help an anxious young child struggling with his first days of school 
 in the united states and now internationally at zoobiquity conferences
 physicians and veterinarians check their attitudes and their preconceptions at the door
 and come together
 as colleagues as peers as doctors 
 after all we humans are animals too 
 and it 's time for us physicians to embrace our patients ' and our own animal natures and join veterinarians in a
 approach to health because it turns out some of the best
 and most humanistic medicine
 is being practiced by doctors whose patients aren 't human 
 and one of the best ways we can take care of the human patient
 is by paying close
  attention to how all the other patients on the planet live  grow get sick
 and heal
