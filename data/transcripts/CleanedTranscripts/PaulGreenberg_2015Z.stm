  i was a kid this was my team 
 i stunk at sports i didn 't like to play them i didn 't like to watch them so this is what i did i went fishing 
  and for all of my growing up i fished on the shores of connecticut  and these are the creatures that i saw on a regular basis  
 but after i grew up and went to college  and i came home
 in the early ninety 's this is what i found 
 my team had shrunk  
 it was like literally having your roster devastated and as i sort of looked into that from a very personal point of view as a fisherman  i started to kind of
  what was the rest of the world thinking about it
  first place i started to look was fish markets  and when i went to fish markets 
 in spite of where i was whether i was in north carolina  or paris or london or wherever
 i kept seeing this weirdly repeating trope of four creatures again and again on the menus on ice shrimp tuna salmon and cod  
 and i thought this was
  as i looked at it i was wondering did anyone else notice this sort of shrinking of the market  well  when i looked into it i realized that people didn 't look at it as their team  
 ordinary people the way they looked at seafood was like this 
 it 's not an unusual human characteristic to reduce the natural world down to very few elements  we did it before  ten thousand years ago when we came out of our caves 
 if you look at fire
  'll see all kinds of different creatures  but if you telescope to the age of you know 
 two thousand years ago  you 'll see these four mammals pigs cows  sheep and goats it 's
 true of birds too you look at the menus in new york city restaurants one hundred and fifty years ago two hundred years ago you 'll see snipe woodcock  grouse  dozens of ducks dozens of geese  
 but telescope ahead to the age of modern animal husbandry and you 'll see four turkeys ducks chicken and geese  
 so it makes sense that we 've headed in this direction but how have we headed in this direction well  
 first it 's a very very new problem 
 this is the way we 've been fishing the oceans over the last fifty years world war ii was a tremendous incentive to arm ourselves in a war against fish
  all of the technology that we perfected during world war ii sonar lightweight polymers all these things
 were redirected towards fish and so you see this tremendous buildup in fishing capacity  quadrupling in the course of time from the end of world war ii to the present time 
 and right now that means we 're taking between eighty and ninety million metric tons out of the sea every year that 's the equivalent of the human weight of china taken out of the sea every year 
  and it 's no coincidence that i use china as the example because china is now the largest fishing nation in the world
  well that 's only half the story  the other half of the story is this incredible boom in fish farming and aquaculture  which is now only in the last year or two starting to exceed 
 the amount of wild fish that we produce  so that if you add wild fish and farmed fish together  
  in addition to being the biggest catcher of fish is also the biggest farmer of fish  
 so let 's look though at the four choices we are making right now 
 the first one by far the most consumed seafood in america and in much of the west is shrimp shrimp in the wild as a wild product
 is a terrible product
  fifteen pounds of wild fish are regularly killed to bring one pound of shrimp to the market  
 they 're also incredibly fuel inefficient to bring to the market in a recent study that was produced out of dalhousie university it was found that dragging for shrimp is one of the most  carbon intensive ways of fishing that you can find 
 so you can farm them  and people do farm them and they farm them a lot in this very area  problem
  the place where you farm shrimp
 is in these wild habitats in mangrove forests now look at those lovely roots coming down those are the things that hold soil together  protect coasts create habitats for all sorts of young fish young shrimp all sorts of things that are important to this environment 
 well this is what happens to a lot of coastal mangrove forests we 've lost millions of acres of coastal mangroves over the last thirty or forty years  that rate of destruction has slowed
  but we 're still in a major mangrove deficit
 the other thing that 's going on here is a phenomenon
 that the filmmaker mark benjamin called grinding nemo 
 this phenomenon is very very relevant to anything that you 've ever seen on a tropical reef because what 's going on right now  we have shrimp draggers dragging for shrimp catching 
  a huge amount of bycatch that bycatch in turn gets ground up and turned into shrimp food 
  fish fish that we would love to see on a reef  grinding them up and turning them into shrimp feed an ecosystem literally eating itself and spitting out shrimp  
 the next most consumed seafood
 in america and also throughout the west is tuna  so tuna
 is this ultimate global fish  these huge management areas have to be observed in order for tuna to be well managed our own management area
 called a regional fisheries management organization is called iccat the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas  the great naturalist carl safina
 once called it the international conspiracy to catch all the tunas 
 of course we 've seen incredible improvement in iccat in the last few years 
 there is total room for improvement but it remains to be said that tuna is a global fish  and to manage it we have to manage the globe well
 we could also try
  to grow tuna but tuna is a spectacularly bad animal for aquaculture 
 many people don 't know this but tuna are warm blooded 
 they can heat their bodies twenty degrees above ambient temperature  they can swim at over forty miles an hour so that pretty much eliminates all the advantages of farming a fish right a farmed fish is or a fish is cold blooded it doesn
  move too much that 's a great thing for growing protein but if you 've got this crazy wild creature that swims at forty miles an hour and heats its blood not a great
 candidate for aquaculture
 the next creature
 most consumed seafood in america
 and throughout the west is salmon now salmon got its plundering too but it didn 't really necessarily happen through fishing 
 this is my home state of connecticut connecticut used to be home to
  lot of wild salmon  but if you look at this map of connecticut every dot on that map
 is a dam 
 there are over three thousand dams in the state of connecticut i often say this is why people in connecticut are so so uptight 
 if somebody could just unblock connecticut 's chi i feel that we could have an infinitely better world but i made this particular comment at a convention once of national parks officers and this guy from north carolina sidled up to me
  know you oughtn 't be so hard on your connecticut cause we here in north carolina we got thirty five thousand dams 
 so it 's a national epidemic it 's an international epidemic and there are dams everywhere  and these are precisely the things that stop wild salmon from reaching their spawning grounds  
 so as a result we 've turned to aquaculture and salmon is one the most successful
  at least from a numbers point of view 
 when they first started farming salmon it could take as many as six pounds of wild fish to make a single pound of salmon 
 the industry has to its credit greatly improved  they 've gotten it below two to one although
 it 's a little bit of a cheat because if you look at the way aquaculture feed is produced they 're measuring pellets pounds of pellets per pound of salmon  those pellets are in turn reduced
  so the actual what 's called the fifo the fish in and the fish out
 kind of hard to say  but in any case credit to the industry it has lowered the amount of fish per pound of salmon problem is
 we 've also gone crazy with the amount of salmon that we 're producing aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet it
 's growing at something like seven percent per year  and so even though
 we 're doing less per fish
 to bring it to the market we 're still killing a lot of these little fish
  and it 's not just
 fish that we 're feeding fish to we 're also feeding fish to chickens and pigs  so we 've got chickens
 and they 're eating fish  but weirdly  we also have fish that are eating chickens because the byproducts of chickens feathers blood bone get ground up and fed to fish  so i often wonder
  is there a fish that ate a chicken that ate a fish it 's sort of a reworking of the chicken and egg thing  anyway 
 all together though it results in a terrible mess what you 're talking about is something between twenty and thirty million metric tons of wild 
  creatures that are taken from the ocean and used and ground up  that 's the equivalent of a third of a china or of an entire united states of humans that 's taken out of the sea each and every year  
  is a kind of amorphous thing it 's what the industry calls whitefish 
 there are many fish that get cycled into this whitefish thing but the way to kind of tell the story i think is through that classic piece of american culinary innovation the filet o fish sandwich  so the filet o fish sandwich actually started as halibut 
 and it started because a local franchise owner found that when he served his mcdonald 's on
  came because it was a catholic community they needed fish  so he went to ray kroc and he said i 'm going to bring you a fish sandwich going to be made out of halibut ray kroc said 
 i don 't think it 's going to work  i want to do a hula burger  and there 's going to be a slice of pineapple on a bun but let 's do this let 's have a bet whosever sandwich
 sells more that will be the winning sandwich
  's kind of sad for the ocean that the hula burger didn 't win
  so he made his halibut sandwich 
 unfortunately though the sandwich came in at thirty cents  ray wanted the sandwich to come in at twenty five cents  so he turned to atlantic cod 
 we all know what happened to atlantic cod in new england  so now the filet o fish sandwich is made out of alaska pollock  it 's the largest fin fish fishery in the united states two to three billion pounds of fish taken out of the sea every single year
  if we go through the pollock  the next
  choice is probably going to be tilapia tilapia is one of those fish nobody ever heard of twenty years ago
 it 's actually a very efficient converter of plant protein into animal protein and it 's been a godsend to the third world it 's actually a tremendously sustainable solution it goes from an egg to an adult in nine months the
 problem is that when you look about the west  it doesn 't do what the west wants it to do it really doesn 't have what 's called an oily fish profile it doesn 't have the
 dha omega 3s that we all think are going to make us live forever so
 what do we do i mean first of all what about this poor fish the clupeids the fish that represent a huge part of that twenty to thirty million metric tons 
 well one possibility that a lot of conservationists have raised is
 could we eat them could we eat them directly instead of feeding
  there are arguments for it they are tremendously fuel efficient to bring to market a fraction of the fuel cost of say shrimp and at the very top of the carbon efficiency scale 
 they also are omega 3 rich a great source for epa and dha so that is a potential  and if we were to go down that route what i would say is 
 instead of paying a few bucks a pound or a few bucks a ton really
 and making it
  could we halve the catch and double the price for the fishermen and make that our way
 of
 treating these particular fish  other possibility though which is much more interesting is looking at bivalves particularly mussels now mussels are very high in 
 they 're similar to canned tuna 
 they 're also extremely fuel efficient to bring a pound of mussels to market is about a thirtieth of the carbon as required to bring beef to market  
 they require no forage fish  they actually get their
 omega 3s by filtering the water of microalgae in fact that 's where omega 3s come from they don 't come from fish  microalgae make the omega 3s they 're only 
 mussels and other bivalves do tremendous amounts of water filtration a single mussel can filter dozens of gallons every single day  
 and this is incredibly important when we look at the world right
  of phosphates in our waterways are causing tremendous algal blooms 
 over four hundred new dead zones have been created in the last twenty years  tremendous sources of marine life death  
 we also could look at not a fish at all we could look at a vegetable we could look at seaweed the kelps all these different varieties of things that can be high in omega 3s can 
  be high in proteins tremendously good things they filter the water just like mussels do 
  it turns out that you can actually feed this to cows now i 'm
 not a big fan of cattle  but if you wanted to keep growing cattle in a time and place where water resources are limited you 're growing seaweed in the water you don 't have to water it
 major consideration and the last fish is a question mark we have the ability to create
  that creates a net gain of marine protein for us this creature would have to be vegetarian it would have to be fast growing it would have to be adaptable to a changing climate
 and it would have to have that oily fish profile that 
  fatty acid profile that we 're looking for 
 this exists kind of on paper i have been reporting on these subjects for fifteen years  every time i
  new story somebody tells me we can do all that we can do it we 've figured it all out we can produce a fish that 's a net gain of marine protein and has omega 3s great 
 it doesn 't seem to be getting scaled up it is time to scale this up if we do 
 thirty million metric tons of seafood a third of the world catch stays in the water 
 so i guess what i 'm saying is
 this is what we 've been going with we tend to go with our appetites rather than our minds  but if we went with this or some configuration of it
 we might have a little more of this thank
