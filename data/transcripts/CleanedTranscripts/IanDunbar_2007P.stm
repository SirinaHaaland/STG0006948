  they have interest sniffing each other
  chasing squirrels  and if we don 't make that a reward in training that will be a distraction it 's always sort of
 struck me as
 really a scary
  thought that
 if you see a dog in a park and the owner is calling it and the owner says you know puppy come here  come here and the dog thinks hmm 
 interesting i 'm sniffing this other dog 's rear end 
 the owner 's calling it 's a difficult choice right rear end owner rear end wins i mean you lose  you cannot compete with the environment if you have an adolescent dog 's brain
  brain so when we train we 're always trying to take into account the dog 's point of view 
 now  i 'm here largely because there 's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment that on one side we have people who think that
 you train a dog number one by making up rules 
 human rules we don 't take the dog 's point of view into account so the human says you 're going to act this way  damn it we 're going to
  force you to act against your will to bend to our will then number two we keep these rules a secret from the dog  
 and then number three now we can punish the dog for breaking rules he didn 't even know existed  
 so you get a little puppy he comes his only crime is he grew  when he was a little puppy he puts his paws on your leg
  you reward him for jumping up 
 his one mistake is he 's a tibetan mastiff and a few months later he weighs  you know  eighty pounds
 every time he jumps up he gets all sorts of abuse  i mean it is really very very scary
 the abuse that dogs get so this whole dominance issue number one what we get in dog training is this
  very complicated social system  and they take this stuff seriously  
 male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy because it prevents physical fights of course female dogs bitches on the other hand have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule the number one is i have it you don 't 
 and what you will find is a very very
  will quite easily keep a bone away from a high ranking male 
 so we get in dog training this notion of dominances or of the alpha dog i 'm sure that you 've heard this dogs get so abused 
 dogs horses and humans these are the three species which are so abused in life  and the reason is built into their behavior is to always come back and apologize like oh i 'm sorry you had to beat me i 'm really
  it 's my fault they are just so beatable and that 's why they get beaten 
 the poor puppy jumps up  you open the dog book what does it say hold his front paws squeeze his front paws stamp on his hind feet  squirt him in the face 
  with lemon juice hit him on the head with a rolled up newspaper knee him in the chest flip him over backwards 
  the first stage is basically teaching a dog esl  i could speak to you and say
  swahili well i 've got news for you the dog doesn 't speak english 
 or american or spanish or french  so the first stage in training is to teach the dog esl english as a second language and that 's how we use the food lure
 in the hand and we use food because we 're dealing with owners  my wife doesn 't need food she 's a
  they 're making a hand signal in front of the dog 's rectum for some reason like the dog has a third eye there it 's insane you know 
 sit  sit no we go puppy sit boom it 's got it in six to ten trials then we phase out the food as a lure  and now the dog knows that sit means sit  and you can actually
  and the name of my son jamie 
 and the dog can take a note and i 've got my own little search and rescue dog he 'll find jamie wherever he is you know  wherever kids are crushing rocks by a stream or something and take him a little message that says hey dinner 's ready  come in for dinner 
 so at this point the dog knows what we want it to do will it do it
  necessarily no as i said if he 's in the park and there 's a rear end to sniff why come to the owner the dog lives with you 
 the dog can get you any time the dog can sniff your butt  if you like when he wants to at the moment he 's in the park and you are competing with smells and other dogs  and squirrels  so the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want
 to do what we want him to do
  this is very easy we use the premack principle basically we follow a low frequency behavior one the dog doesn 't want to do by a  high frequency behavior commonly known as a behavior problem or a dog hobby
 something the dog does like to do that will then become a reward for the
  dog yes we put sniff butt on queue sit sniff butt  so now all of these distractions
 that worked against training now become rewards that work for training and what we 're doing in essence is we 're teaching the dog kind of like
 we 're letting the dog think that the dog is training us  and i can imagine this dog you know speaking through the fence to say an akita saying
 owners they are so incredibly easy to train they 're like golden retrievers all i have to do is sit and they do everything they open doors 
 they drive my car they massage me  they will throw tennis balls  they will cook for me and serve the food  
 it 's like if i just sit  that 's my command then i have my own personal doorman chauffeur
  and now the dog 's really happy  and this to me is always what training is so we really motivate the dog to want to do it  
 such that the need for punishment seldom comes up 
 now we move to phase three when now there 's times you know when daddy knows best and i have a
 little sign on my fridge and it says because i 'm the daddy that 's why
  i 'm the daddy  you 're not sit 
 and there 's times for example if my son 's friends leave the door open the dogs have to know you don 't step across this line 
 this is a life or death thing 
 you leave this the sanctity of your house  and you could be hit on the street so some things we have to let the dog know you mustn 't do this 
 and so
 we have to enforce but without force people here get very
  confused about what a punishment is they think a punishment is something nasty  
 i bet a lot of you do right you think it 's something painful or scary or nasty  it doesn 't have to be
 there 's several definitions of what a punishment is but one definition the most popular is a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior  such that it 's less likely to occur
 in the future
  it does not have to be nasty  scary or painful  and i would say  if it doesn 't have to be then maybe it shouldn 't be 
 i was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago and this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital plus the brother in law plus the child  
 and i only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house and they never took it outside 
  actually euthanized now but this was a dog i worked with for a while a lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen  so while i was there this was on the fourth visit we did a four and a half hour down stay with the dog on his mat  
 and he was kept there by the owner 's calm insistence when the dog would try to leave the mat she would say rover on the mat 
 on the mat  
 on the mat the dog broke his
 down stay twenty two times in four and a half hours while she cooked dinner
 because we had a lot of aggression related towards food the breaks got fewer and fewer  you see the punishment was working 
 the behavior problem was going away she never raised her voice if she did she would have got bitten it
 's not a good dog you shout at and a lot of my friends train really neat animals
  if you 've ever seen a grizzly bear on the telly or in film then it 's a friend of mine who 's trained it killer whales 
 i love it because it wires you up  how are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear bad bear bad bear voom 
 your head now is one hundred yards away sailing through the air  ok this is crazy so where do we go
  we want a better way dogs deserve better but for me
 the reason for this actually has to do with dogs it has to do with watching people train puppies and realizing they have horrendous
 interaction skills 
 horrendous relationship skills not just with their puppy  but with the rest of the family at class i mean my all time classic is another come here one you see someone in the park
 and i 'll cover my mic when i say this because i
  and there 's the owner in the park and their dog 's over here and they say
  i was walking onto a plane this for me was a pivotal moment in my career  and it really cemented what i wanted to do with this whole puppy training thing the notion of how to teach 
 puppies in a dog friendly way to want to do what we want to do so we don 't have to force them you know 
 was getting on a plane in dallas and in row two was a father i presume and a young boy about five kicking the back of the chair 
 johnny don 't do that kick kick kick johnny don 't do that kick kick kick i 'm standing right here with my bag  
 the father leans over grabs him like this and gives him ugly face and ugly face is this when you go
 with a puppy or a child you say
  that child has lost everything
 that one of the two people he can trust in this world has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet  
 and i thought do i tell this jerk to quit it i thought ian stay out of it stay out of it  you know  walk on i walked to the back of the plane 
 i sat down  and a thought came to me  
 if that had been a dog i would
  if he had kicked a dog i would have punched him out 
 he kicked a child  grabs the child like this and i let it go  and this is what it 's all about 
 these relationship skills are so easy i mean  we as humans our
 shallowness when we choose a life mate based on the three cs coat color conformation cuteness  you know kind of like a little robot this is how we go into a relationship
  a little behavior problem comes up  no different from the dog barking 
 the husband won 't clear up his clothes or the wife 's always late for meetings whatever it is ok  and it then starts  and we get into this thing and our personal feedback 
  there 's two things about it  when you watch people interacting with animals or other people there is very little
  it 's too infrequent  and when it happens it 's bad  it 's nasty  
 you see it 's especially in families 
 especially with spouses  especially with children especially with parents you see it especially in the workplace especially from boss to employee  
 it 's as if there 's some schadenfreude there that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong 
 so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them  and this i would say is the biggest human
  foible that we have it really is we take the good for granted  and we moan and groan at the bad  
 and i think this whole notion of these skills should be taught you know 
 calculus is wonderful when i was a kid i was a calculus whiz i don 't understand a thing about it now but i could do it as a kid
  geometry fantastic
  you know quantum mechanics these are cool things but they don 't save marriages and they don 't raise children
