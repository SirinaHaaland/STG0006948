  this is my niece stella she 's just turned one and started to walk and she 's walking in that really cool way that
  things to do at the moment is to stare at herself in the mirror  she absolutely loves her reflection 
 she giggles and squeals and gives herself these big wet kisses it is
 apparently all of her friends do this
 and my mom tells me that i used to do this and it got me thinking when did i stop doing
 when is it suddenly not okay
 to love the way that we look  because apparently we don 't ten thousand people every month
 google am i ugly this is faye faye is thirteen and she lives in denver  and like any teenager
  she just wants to be liked and to fit in 
 it 's sunday night  she 's getting ready for the week ahead at school and she 's slightly dreading it and she 's a bit confused because despite her mom telling her
 all the time
 that she 's beautiful every day at school someone tells her
 that she 's ugly  
 because of the difference between what her mom tells her and what her friends at school or her peers at school are telling her 
 she doesn 't know who to believe so she takes a video
  of herself she posts it to youtube
 and she asks people to please leave a comment am i pretty or am i ugly well so far  faye has received over thirteen thousand comments 
 some of them are so nasty they don 't bear thinking about 
 this is an average healthy looking teenage girl
 receiving this feedback at one of the most emotionally vulnerable times in her life
 thousands of people are posting videos like this  mostly teenage girls reaching out in this way 
 but what 's leading them to do this  well today 's teenagers are rarely alone 
 they 're under pressure to be online and available at all times talking
  posting it never ends 
 never before have we been so connected so continuously so instantaneously so young 
 and as one mom told me it 's like there 's a party in their bedroom every night  there 's simply no privacy 
 and the social pressures that go along with that are relentless
  is training our kids
 to value themselves based on the number of likes they get and the types of comments that they receive 
 there 's no separation between online and offline life what 's real
 or what isn 't is really hard to tell the difference the difference between and it 's also really hard to tell the difference between what 's authentic and what
 's digitally manipulated what 's a highlight in someone 's life versus what 's normal in the context of everyday 
 and where are they looking to for inspiration 
 well you can see the kinds of images that are covering the newsfeeds of girls today size zero models still dominate our catwalks  
 airbrushing is now routine 
 and trends like # thinspiration
  these trends are teamed with the stereotyping and flagrant objectification of women in today 's popular culture it is not hard to see
 what girls are benchmarking themselves against  
 but boys are not immune to this either  aspiring to the chiseled jaw lines and ripped six packs of
  sports stars and playboy music artists  but what 's the problem with all of this well  surely we want our kids to grow up
 as healthy  well balanced individuals 
 but in an image obsessed culture  we are training our kids to spend more time and mental effort on their appearance
 at the expense of all of the other aspects of their
  things like their relationships  the development of their physical abilities and their studies and so on begin to suffer 
 six out of ten girls are now choosing not to do something
 because they don 't think they look good enough 
 these are not trivial activities these are fundamental activities to their development as humans and as contributors to society and to the workforce
  one in three teenagers 
 are withdrawing from classroom debate they 're failing to engage in classroom debate because they don 't want to draw attention to the way that they look one in five are not showing up to class at all
 on days when they don 't feel good about it 
 and when it comes to exams if you don 't think you look good enough  specifically if you don 't think you are thin enough you will score a lower grade
  point average than your peers who are not concerned with this 
 and this is consistent across finland the u s and china 
 and is true regardless of how much you actually weigh  
 so to be super clear we 're talking about the way you think you look not how you actually
  low body confidence is undermining academic achievement  
 but it 's also damaging health 
 teenagers with low body confidence do less physical activity eat less fruits and vegetables  partake in more unhealthy weight control practices that can lead to eating disorders they have lower self esteem 
 they 're more easily influenced by people around them
  at greater risk of depression  and we think it 's for all of these reasons
 that they take more risks with things like alcohol and drug use  
 crash dieting cosmetic surgery  unprotected earlier sex and self harm 
 the pursuit of the perfect body is putting pressure on our healthcare systems and costing our governments billions of dollars every
  and we don 't grow out of it women who think they 're overweight again regardless of whether they are or are not
 have higher rates of absenteeism  
 seventeen percent of women would not show up to a job interview on a day when they weren 't feeling confident about the way that they look 
 have a think about what this is doing to our economy if we could overcome this what that opportunity looks like
 unlocking this potential
 is in the interest of every single one of us 
 but how do we do that 
 well  talking on its own only gets you so far  it 's not enough by itself if you actually want to make a difference you have to do something  
 and we 've learned there are three key ways
  the first is we have to educate for body confidence we have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome image related pressures and build their self esteem now the good news is
 that there are many programs out there available to do this  the bad news is
 that most of them don 't work i was shocked to learn
 that many well meaning programs are inadvertently actually making the situation worse
 so we need to make damn sure that the programs that our kids are receiving
 are not only having a positive impact but having a lasting impact as well  
 and the research shows that the best programs address six key areas  
 the first is the influence of family friends and relationships  the second is media and celebrity culture  then how to handle teasing and bullying
 the way we compete and compare with one another based on looks 
 talking about appearance some people call this body talk or fat talk and finally  the foundations of respecting and looking after yourself these six things are crucial 
  starting points for anyone serious about delivering body confidence education that works
  tackling this problem is going to require each and everyone of us to step up
 and be better role models for the women and girls in our own lives  challenging the status quo of how women are seen and talked about in our own circles it is not okay
 that we judge the contribution of our politicians by their haircuts
  or the size of their breasts
 or to infer that the determination or the success of an olympian is down to her not being a looker 
 we need to start judging people by what they do not what they look like 
 we can all start
 by taking responsibility for the types of pictures and comments that we post on our own social networks  we can compliment people based
 on their effort and their actions and not on their appearance
 and let me ask you when was the last time that you kissed a mirror  
 ultimately we need to work together as communities as governments and as businesses to really change this culture of ours
 so that our kids grow up valuing their whole selves  valuing
  we need to put the people that are making a real difference on our pedestals 
 making a difference in the real world  
 giving them the airtime because only then will we create a different world a world where our kids
 are free to become the best versions of themselves 
 where the way they think they look never holds them back from being who they are or achieving what they want in life
 think about what this might mean for someone in your life 
 who have you got in mind is it your wife your sister  your daughter  your niece  your friend it could just be
 the woman a couple of seats away from you today  what would it mean for her
 if she were freed
 from that voice of her inner critic
  her to have longer legs  thinner thighs smaller stomach shorter feet  what could it mean for her if we overcame this and unlocked
 her potential in that way
  each and everyone of us
  work together as communities
