  let me begin with four words that will provide the context for this week  four words that will come to define this century 
 here they are the earth is
  's full of us it 's full of our stuff full of our waste full of our demands  
 yes we are a brilliant and creative species but we 've created a little too much stuff
 so much that our economy is now bigger than its host our planet 
 this is not a philosophical statement this is just science
  analyses of this but they all draw the same conclusion that we 're living beyond our means 
 the eminent scientists of the global footprint network for example calculate that we need about one point five earths to sustain this economy 
 in other words 
 to keep operating at our current level we need fifty percent more earth than we 've got
  in financial terms this would be like always spending fifty percent more than you earn going further into debt every year  
 but of course you can 't borrow natural resources so we 're
 burning through our capital or stealing from the future 
 so when i say full i mean really full well past any margin for error well past any dispute about
  methodology 
 what this means is our economy is unsustainable i 'm not saying it 's not nice or pleasant
 or that it 's bad for polar bears or forests though it certainly is 
 what i 'm saying is our approach is simply unsustainable  in other words  thanks to those pesky laws
  but that 's not possible you might think we can 't stop
 economic growth because that 's what will stop economic growth  it will stop because of the end of trade resources  it will stop because of the
 growing demand of us on on all the resources all the capacity  all the systems of the earth which is now having economic damage
  when we think about economic growth stopping we go that 's not possible because economic growth is so essential to our society that is is rarely questioned  
 although growth has certainly delivered many benefits  it is an idea so essential that we tend not to
 understand the possibility of it not being around  even though it has delivered many benefits  it is based on a crazy idea the crazy idea being that we can
  have infinite growth on a finite planet  
 and i 'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes that the crazy idea is just that it is crazy  and with the earth full  it 's game over 
 come on you 're thinking that 's not possible  
 technology is amazing people are innovative there are so many ways we can improve the way we do things we can surely sort this out 
  true  well it 's mostly true  we are certainly amazing and we regularly solve complex problems with amazing creativity 
 so if our problem was to get the human economy down from one hundred and fifty percent to one hundred percent
 of the earth 's capacity we could do that the problem is we 're just warming up this growth engine  we plan to take this
  make it twice as big
 and then make it four times as big
 not in some distant future  but in less than forty years in the life time of most of you 
 china plans to be there in just twenty years  
 the only problem with this plan
 is that it 's not possible  
 in response some people
  argue but we need growth we need it to solve poverty we need it to develop technology we need it to keep social stability  i find this argument fascinating as though
  we can kind of bend the rules of physics to suit our needs it
 's like the earth doesn 't care what we need mother nature
  she just sets rules and describes consequences  
 and these are not esoteric limits this is about food and water  soil and climate the basic practical and economic foundations of our lives  
 so the idea that we can smoothly transition to a
  economy transformed by science and technology so that nine billion people can live in two thousand and fifty a life
 of abundance and digital downloads is a delusion it
 's not that it 's not possible to feed clothe and house us all and have us live live decent lives  
 it certainly is but the idea that we can
 gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong  and it 's dangerously wrong  because it means we 're not getting ready for what 's really going to happen 
  happens when you operate a system past its limits and then keep on going at an
 is that the system stops working and breaks down  and that 's what will happen to us 
 many of you will be thinking  but surely we can still stop this if it 's that bad
  bad we 'll react let
 's just think through that idea now we 've had fifty years of warnings we 've had
 science proving the urgency of change we 've had economic analysis pointing out that not only can we afford it it 's cheaper to act early  
 and yet the reality is we 've done
 pretty much nothing to change course we 're not
 even slowing down  last year on climate for example  we had the highest global emissions ever  
 the story on food on water on soil on climate is all much the same 
 i actually don 't say this in despair  i 've done my grieving about the loss i accept where we are it is sad 
  but it is also time that we ended our denial and recognized
 that we 're not acting we 're not close to acting and we 're not going to act until this crisis hits the economy 
 and that 's why the end of growth is the central issue
 and the event that we need to get ready for so when does this transition
  when does this breakdown begin  
 in my view  it is well underway  i know most people don 't see it that way we tend to look at the world not as the integrated system that it is 
 but as a series of individual issues  we see the occupy protests we see
 spiraling debt crises we see growing inequality we see money 's influence on politics we see resource constraint food and oil
  but we see mistakenly each of these issues as individual problems to be solved  
 in fact  it 's the system in the painful process of breaking down our system 
 of debt fueled economic growth 
 of ineffective democracy of overloading planet earth is eating itself alive
  i could give you countless studies and evidence to prove this but i won 't because if you want to see it that
  evidence is all around you  i want to talk to you about fear  
 i want to do so because  in my view  the most important issue
 we face
 is how we respond to this question the crisis is now inevitable
  issue is how will we react 
 of course we can 't know what will happen the future is inherently uncertain but let 's just think through what the science is telling us
 is likely to happen  imagine our economy
 when the carbon bubble bursts when the financial markets recognize that to have any hope of preventing the climate spiraling out of control  
 the oil and coal industries are finished
 imagine china india and pakistan going to war as climate impacts
 generate conflict over food and water  imagine the middle east without oil income  but with collapsing governments
 imagine thirty percent unemployment in america as the global economy is gripped by fear and uncertainty  
 now imagine what that means for you your family your friends your personal financial security  imagine what it means for your
 personal security
 as a heavily armed civilian population gets angrier and angrier about why
  this was allowed to happen  
 imagine what you 'll tell your children when they ask you so in two thousand and twelve  mom and dad what was it like
 when you 'd had the hottest decade on record for the third decade in a row  
 when every scientific body in the world was saying you 've got a major problem  
 when the oceans were acidifying when oil and food prices were spiking
 they were rioting in the streets of london and occupying wall street  when the system was so clearly breaking down mom and dad  
 what did you do what were you thinking 
 so how do you feel when the lights go out on the global economy in your
  when your assumptions about the future fade away and something very different emerges just take a moment
 and take a breath
 and think what do you feel at this point
  fear 
 of course we can 't know what 's going to happen and we have to live with uncertainty 
 but when we think about the kind of possibilities i paint  
 we should feel a bit of fear  
 we are in danger
  all of us and we 've evolved to respond to danger with fear to motivate a powerful response 
 to help us bravely face a threat  
 but this time it 's not a tiger at the cave mouth 
 you can 't see the danger at your door  but if you look you can see it at the door of your civilization  
 that 's why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on because if we wait until the crisis takes hold we may
  panic and hide if we feel it now and think it through we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself  
 yes things will get ugly  
 and it will happen soon certainly in our lifetime but we are more than capable of getting through everything that 's coming  you see those people
 that have faith that humans can solve any problem
 that technology is limitless that markets can be a force for good are in fact right  the only thing they 're missing
 is that it takes a good crisis to get us going  
 when we feel fear and we fear loss we are capable of quite extraordinary things think about
 war after the bombing of pearl harbor it just took four days for the government to ban the production of
  civilian cars and to redirect the auto industry and from there to rationing of food and energy 
 think about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat and how a change that seemed impossible just gets done think about how an individual responds to a
 diagnosis of a life threatening illness and how lifestyle changes
 that previously were just too difficult
 suddenly become relatively easy
 we are smart  in fact we really are quite amazing but we do love a good crisis and the good news this one 's a monster 
 sure  if we get it wrong  we could face the end of this civilization  
 but if we get it right  it could be the beginning of civilization instead 
 and how cool would it be to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that
 's certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way  
 scientists like james hansen tell us we may need to eliminate net co2 emissions from the economy
 in just a few decades  i wanted to know what that would take so i worked with professor jorgen randers from norway
 to find the answer
  we developed a plan called the one degree war plan so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required 
 to my surprise  eliminating net  co2 emissions from the economy in just twenty years is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap 
 not very cheap  but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization  
 we didn 't calculate that precisely but we understand that 's very expensive
  you can read the details but in summary we can transform our economy  we can do it
 with proven technology  we can do it at an affordable cost we can do it with existing political structures the only thing we need to change is how we think and how we feel 
 and this is where you come in 
 when we think about the future i paint of course we should feel a bit of fear 
 but fear can be paralyzing or motivating  we need to accept the fear and then we need to act
  we need to act like the future depends on it we need to act like we only have one planet  
 we can do this i know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do 
 they 're wrong  
 we can be more we can be much more 
 we have achieved
  remarkable things since working out how to grow food some ten thousand years ago we 've built a powerful foundation of science knowledge and technology more than enough
 to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent  meaningful and satisfying lives  the earth can support that if we choose the right path  
 we can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society 's
  evolution
 like what do we want to be when we grow up  
 when we move past this bumbling adolescence where we think there are no limits and suffer delusions of immortality  
 well it 's time to grow up 
 to be wiser to be calmer to be more considered 
 like generations before us we 'll be growing up in war not a war between civilizations but a war for civilization
 for the extraordinary opportunity to build a society
 which is stronger and happier
 and plans on staying around into middle age  
 we can choose life over fear  we can do what we need to do  but it will take
 every entrepreneur 
  every artist every scientist  every communicator every mother every father every child  every one of us 
 this could be our finest hour  thank you
