  i worked as a war reporter
 for fifteen years before i realized that i really had a problem there was something really wrong with me  this was about a year before nine eleven and
  america wasn 't at war yet  
 we weren 't talking about ptsd  we were not yet talking about the effect of trauma and war on the human psyche 
 i 'd been in afghanistan for a couple of months with the northern alliance as they were fighting the taliban and at that point the taliban
 had an air force they had fighter planes they had tanks they had artillery  and we really got hammered pretty badly a couple of times we saw some very ugly things
  but i didn 't really think it affected me i didn 't think much about it  i came home to new york where i live  then one day i went down into the subway  
 and for the first time in my life  i knew real fear  i had a massive panic attack 
 i was way more scared than i had ever been in afghanistan  
 everything i was looking at seemed like it was going to kill me  but i couldn 't
  i couldn 't explain why  the trains were going too fast  there were too many people  the lights were too bright  
 everything was too loud everything was moving too quickly  i backed up against a support column and just waited for it
 when i couldn 't take it any longer i ran out of the subway station and walked wherever i was going 
 later  i found out that what i had was
  ptsd post traumatic stress disorder  we evolved as animals as primates to survive periods of danger and if
 your life has been in danger  you want to react to unfamiliar noises  
 you want to sleep lightly  wake up easily you want to have nightmares and and flashbacks of the thing that could kill you 
 you want to be angry because it makes you predisposed to fight or depressed
 because it keeps you out of circulation a little bit  keeps you safe  it 's not very pleasant but it 's better than getting eaten  
 most people recover from that pretty quickly it takes a few weeks a few months 
 i kept having panic attacks but they eventually went away 
 i had no idea it was connected to the war that
  i just thought i was going crazy  and then i thought well now i 'm not going crazy anymore 
 about twenty percent of people however  wind up with chronic long term ptsd they are not adapted to temporary danger  they are 
 for everyday life unless they get help  we know that the people who are vulnerable
 to  long term ptsd are people who were abused as children  who suffered trauma as children people who have low education levels
 people who have psychiatric disorders in their family if you served in vietnam and your brother is schizophrenic 
 you 're way more likely to get long term ptsd from vietnam 
 so i started to study this as a journalist and i realized that there was something really strange going on 
 the numbers seemed to be going in the wrong direction  every war that we have fought as a country
  starting with the civil war the intensity of the combat has gone down as a result the casualty rates
 have gone down  but disability rates have gone up they should be going in the same direction  
 but they 're going in different directions  
 the recent wars in iraq and afghanistan have produced  thank god a casualty rate
 about one third of what it was in vietnam  
 but they 've also created they 've also produced three times the disability rates
 around ten percent of the us military is
 actively engaged in combat  ten percent or under they 're shooting at people killing people getting shot at
 seeing their friends get killed it 's incredibly traumatic but it 's only about ten percent of our military  but about half of our military has filed for some kind of
 ptsd compensation from the government  
 and suicide doesn 't even fit into this in a very logical way  we 've all heard the tragic statistic
 of twenty two vets a day on average
  in this country  killing themselves  most people don 't realize that the majority of those suicides are veterans
 of the vietnam war that generation  and their decision to take their own lives
 actually might not be related to the war they fought fifty years earlier 
 in fact  there 's no statistical connection between combat and suicide
 in the military and you 're in a lot of combat you 're no more likely to kill yourself than if you weren 't in fact
 one study found that if you deploy to iraq or afghanistan you 're actually slightly less likely
 to commit suicide later  
 i studied anthropology in college  i did my fieldwork on the navajo
  i had this thought 
 i thought back to to the work i did when i was young and i thought  i bet
 the navajo  the apache the comanche i mean these are very warlike nations
 i bet they weren 't getting ptsd like we do when their warriors came back from fighting the us
  military or fighting each other i bet they pretty much just slipped right back into tribal life  
 and maybe what determines
 the rate of long term ptsd
 isn 't what happened out there 
 but the kind of society you come back to and maybe if you come back to a close cohesive tribal society
 you can get over trauma pretty quickly  and if you come back to
 an alienating modern society you might remain traumatized
 your entire life in other words  maybe the problem isn 't them the vets maybe the problem is us  
 certainly
  on the human psyche by every metric that we have 
 as wealth goes up in a society  
 the suicide rate goes up
 instead of down if you live in modern society you 're up to eight times more likely
 to suffer from depression in your lifetime than if you live in a poor agrarian society
 modern society has probably produced the highest rates of suicide and depression and anxiety and loneliness and child abuse ever in human history  
 i saw one study
 that compared
 women in nigeria one of the most chaotic and violent and corrupt and poorest countries in
  to women in north america and the highest rates of depression were urban women in north america that was also the wealthiest group  so 
 let 's go back to the us military  ten percent are in combat  around fifty percent have
 filed for ptsd compensation so about forty percent of veterans really were not traumatized overseas
 but have
  come home to discover they are dangerously alienated and depressed  
 so what is happening with them what 's going on with those people  
 the phantom forty percent that are troubled
 but don 't understand why maybe it 's this maybe they had an experience of sort of tribal closeness in
  their unit when they were overseas 
 they were eating together  sleeping together  doing tasks and missions together  they were trusting each other with their lives  
 and then they come home and they have to give all that up and they 're coming back to a society a modern society
  which is hard on people
 who weren 't even in the military it 's just hard on everybody  and we keep focusing on trauma ptsd  
 but for a lot of these people 
 maybe it 's not trauma i mean certainly  soldiers are traumatized and the ones who are have to be treated for that 
 but a lot of them maybe what 's bothering them is actually a kind of alienation i mean
  i mean maybe we just have the wrong word for some of it and just changing our language our understanding would help a little bit
 alienation disorder maybe even just calling it that for some of these people
 would allow them to stop imagining trying to imagine a trauma that didn 't really happen
 in order to explain a feeling that really is happening and in fact it 's an extremely dangerous feeling that alienation and depression can lead to suicide these people are in danger
  very important to understand why  the israeli military has a ptsd rate of around one percent  the theory
 is that
 everyone in israel is supposed to serve in the military when soldiers come back from the front line they 're not going from a military environment to a civilian environment
  they 're coming back to a community where everyone everyone understands
 about the military everyone 's been in it or is going to be in it everyone understands the situation they 're all in it 's as if they 're all in one big tribe  
 we know that if you take a lab rat
 and traumatize it and put it in a cage by itself  you can maintain its trauma symptoms almost indefinitely  and if you take that same lab rat
 and put it in a cage with
 other rats
  after a couple of weeks  it 's pretty much ok  
 after nine eleven  
 the murder rate in new york city went down by forty percent  the suicide rate went down  
 the violent crime rate in new york went down
 after nine eleven even combat
  veterans of previous wars
 who suffered from ptsd
 said that their symptoms went down after nine eleven happened 
 the reason is that if you traumatize an entire society  
 we don 't fall apart and turn on one another  we come together we unify  basically we tribalize 
 and that process of unifying
 feels so good and is so good for us that it even helps people who are struggling
  with mental health issues  during the blitz in london  admissions to psychiatric wards went down during the bombings 
 for a while that was the kind of country that american soldiers came back to
 a unified country  we were sticking together we were trying
  trying to help
 ourselves and the world  
 but that 's changed  
 now american soldiers  american veterans are coming back to a country that is so bitterly divided
 that the two political parties are literally accusing each other
 of treason of being an enemy of the
  of trying to undermine the security and the welfare of their own country  the gap between rich and poor
 is the biggest it 's ever been it 's just getting worse race relations are terrible 
 there are demonstrations and even riots in the streets because of racial injustice  
 and veterans know
 that any tribe that treated itself that way in fact any platoon that treated itself that way would never survive
  we 've gotten used to it veterans have gone away and are coming back and seeing
 their own country
 with fresh eyes and they see what 's going on this is the country they fought for 
 no wonder they 're depressed  no wonder they 're scared 
 sometimes we ask ourselves if we can save the vets
  i think the real question is if we can save ourselves if we can  i think the vets are going to be fine
 it 's time for this country to unite  
 if only to help the men and women who fought to protect us  thank you very much
