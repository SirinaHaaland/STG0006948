  when i first began recording wild soundscapes forty five years ago
 i had no idea that ants insect larvae sea anemones and viruses
  created a sound signature but they do and so does every wild habitat on the planet like the amazon rainforest you 're hearing behind me
 in fact
 temperate and tropical rainforests each produce a vibrant animal orchestra
 that instantaneous and organized expression of insects reptiles amphibians birds and mammals
 and every soundscape that springs from a wild habitat generates its own unique signature
 one that contains incredible amounts of information and it 's some of that information i want to share with you today
 the soundscape is made up of three basic sources the first is the geophony
 or the nonbiological sounds that occur in any given habitat
 like wind in the
  trees water in a stream waves at the ocean shore movement of the earth
 the second of these is the biophony the biophony
 is all of the sound that 's generated by organisms in a given habitat
 at one time and in one place
 and the third is all of the sound that we humans generate that 's called anthrophony
  some of it is controlled like music or theater but most of it is chaotic and incoherent
 which some of us refer to as noise
 there was a time when i considered wild soundscapes to be a worthless artifact they were just there but they had no significance
 well i was wrong what i learned from these encounters was that careful listening
 gives us incredibly valuable tools by which to evaluate the health of a habitat across the entire spectrum of life
 when i began recording in the late sixty s
 the typical methods of recording were limited to the fragmented capture of individual species
 like birds mostly in the beginning but later animals like
 mammals and and amphibians
 to me this was a little like trying to understand the magnificence of beethoven 's fifth symphony by abstracting the sound of a single violin player out of the context of the orchestra
 and hearing just that one part
 fortunately
  more and more institutions are implementing the more holistic models that i and a few of my colleagues have introduced to the field of soundscape ecology
 when i began recording over four decades ago
 i could record for ten hours and capture one hour of usable material good enough for an album or a film soundtrack
 or a museum installation
 now because of global warming resource extraction
 and human noise among many other factors it can take up to one thousand hours or more to capture the same thing
 fully fifty percent of my archive comes from habitats so radically altered
 that they 're either altogether silent or can no longer be heard in
  any of their original form
 the usual methods of evaluating a habitat have been done by visually counting the numbers of species and the numbers of individuals within each species in a given area
 however by comparing data that ties together both density and diversity from what we hear
 i 'm able to arrive at much more precise fitness outcomes
 and i want to show you some examples that typify the possibilities unlocked by diving into
  this universe
 this is lincoln meadow lincoln meadow 's a three and a half hour drive east of san francisco in the sierra nevada mountains at about two thousand meters altitude and i 've been recording there for many years
 in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight a logging company convinced local residents that there would be absolutely no environmental impact from a new method they were trying called selective logging
 taking out a tree
  here and there rather than clear cutting a whole area
 with permission granted to record both before and after the operation i set up my gear
 and captured a large number of dawn choruses to very strict protocol and calibrated recordings because i wanted a really good baseline
 this is an example of a spectrogram a spectrogram is a graphic illustration of sound with time from left to right across the
  page fifteen seconds in this case is represented
 and frequency from the bottom of the page to the top lowest to highest and you can see
 that the signature of a stream
 is represented here in the bottom third or half of the page
 while birds that were once in that meadow are represented in the signature across the top there were a lot of them and here 's lincoln meadow before selective logging
  well a year later i returned and using the same protocols and recording under the same conditions
  choruses and now this is what we 've got this is after selective logging you can see that the stream is still represented in the bottom third of the page
 but notice what 's missing in the top two thirds nature sounds
 coming up is the sound of a woodpecker
  well i 've returned to lincoln meadow fifteen times in the last twenty five years and i can tell you
 that the biophony the
 density and diversity of that biophony has not yet returned to anything like it was before the operation
 but here 's a picture of lincoln meadow taken after and you can see that from the perspective of the camera or
  the human eye hardly a stick or a tree appears to be out of place which would confirm the logging company 's contention that there 's nothing of environmental impact
 however our ears tell us a very different story
 young students are always asking me what these animals are saying and really
  i can tell you
 that they do express themselves whether or not we understand it is a different story
 i was walking along the shore in alaska
 and i came across this tide pool
 filled with a colony of sea anemones these these wonderful eating machines relatives of coral and jellyfish
 and curious to see if any of them made any noise i dropped a hydrophone an underwater microphone
 covered in rubber
 down the mouth part and immediately the critter began to absorb the microphone into its belly and the tentacles were searching out of the surface for something of nutritional value 
 the static like sounds that are very low that you 're going to hear right now static sounds
 yeah but watch when it didn 't find anything to eat
 i think that 's an expression that can be understood in any language laughter
 at the end of its breeding cycle the great basin spadefoot toad digs itself down about a meter under the hard panned desert soil of the american west
 where it can stay for many seasons until conditions are just right for it to emerge again
 and when there 's enough moisture in the soil in the spring frogs will dig themselves to the surface and gather around these large
 vernal pools in in great numbers and they vocalize in
 in a chorus
 that 's absolutely in sync with one another and they do that for two reasons the
 first is
 competitive because they 're looking for mates and the second is cooperative because if they 're all vocalizing in sync together
 it makes it really difficult for predators like coyotes foxes and owls to single out any individual for a meal
 this is a spectrogram of what the frog chorusing looks like when it 's in a very healthy pattern
  lake is just to the east of yosemite national park in california
 and it 's a favorite habitat of these toads and it 's also favored by u s navy jet pilots who train in their fighters flying them at speeds exceeding one thousand one hundred kilometers an hour and altitudes only a couple
  hundred meters above ground level of the mono basin very fast very low
 and so loud that the anthrophony the human noise even though it 's six and a half kilometers from the frog pond you just heard a second ago
 it masked the sound of the chorusing toads you can see in this spectrogram that all of the energy
 that was once in the first spectrogram is gone from the top end of the spectrogram
 and that there 's breaks in the chorusing at two and a half four and a half and six
  and a half seconds
 and then the sound of the jet the signature is in yellow at the very bottom of the page frogs croaking
 now at the end of that flyby it took the frogs fully forty five minutes to regain their chorusing synchronicity
  during which time and under a full moon we watched as two coyotes and a great horned owl came in to pick off a few of their numbers
 the good news is that with a little bit of habitat restoration and fewer flights
 the frog populations once diminishing during the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s and early ninety s
 have pretty much returned to normal
 i want to end with a story told by a beaver
 a very sad story but
 it really illustrates how animals can sometimes show emotion a very controversial subject among some older biologists
 a colleague of mine was recording in the american midwest around this pond that had been formed maybe sixteen thousand years ago at the end of the last ice age it was also formed in part by a beaver dam at one end that
  held that whole ecosystem together in a very delicate balance and one afternoon while he was recording
 there suddenly appeared from out of nowhere
 a couple of game wardens who for no apparent reason walked over to the beaver dam dropped a stick of dynamite down it
 blowing it up killing the female and her young babies
  horrified my colleagues remained behind to gather his thoughts
 and to record whatever he could the rest of the afternoon and that evening he captured a remarkable event
 the lone surviving male beaver swimming in slow circles
 crying out inconsolably for its lost mate and offspring
 this is probably
  the saddest sound i 've ever heard coming from any organism human or other
  there are many facets to soundscapes among them the ways in which animals taught us to dance and sing which i 'll save for another time
 but you have heard how biophonies help clarify our understanding of the natural world
 you 've heard the impact of resource extraction human noise and habitat destruction and where environmental sciences have typically tried to understand the
  world from what we see a much fuller understanding can be got from what we hear
 biophonies and geophonies are the signature voices of the natural world
 and as we hear them we 're endowed with a sense of place the true story of the world we live in
 in a matter of seconds a soundscape reveals much more information from many
  perspectives from quantifiable data to cultural inspiration
 visual capture implicitly frames a limited frontal perspective of a given spatial context
 while soundscapes widen that scope to a full three hundred and sixty degrees completely enveloping us
 and while a picture may be worth one thousand words a soundscape
 is worth one thousand pictures
 and our ears tell us that the whisper of every leaf and creature
 speaks to the natural sources of our lives
 which indeed
 may hold the secrets of love for all things especially our own humanity and
 the last word goes to a jaguar from the
  amazon growling
 thank you for listening
