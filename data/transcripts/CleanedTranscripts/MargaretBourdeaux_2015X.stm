  so have you ever wondered what it would be like to live in a place with no rules that sounds pretty cool 
 you wake up one morning however and you discover that the reason there are no rules is because there 's no government and there are no laws in fact
  fact all social institutions
 have disappeared  
 so there 's no schools there 's no hospitals there 's no police there 's no banks there 's no athletic clubs 
 there 's no utilities well
 i know a little bit about what this is like because when i was a medical student in one thousand 
  i worked in a refugee camp in the balkans during the kosovo war when the war was over i got permission unbelievably from my medical school
 to take some time off and follow some of the families that i had befriended
 in the camp back to their village in kosovo and understand how they navigated life in this postwar
 setting 
  postwar kosovo was a very interesting place because nato troops were there mostly to make sure the war didn 't break out again  
 but other than that it was actually a lawless place and almost every social institution both public and private had been destroyed  
 so
 i can tell you that when you go into one of these situations and settings
  absolutely thrilling for about thirty minutes  because that 's about how long it takes before you run into a situation
 where
 you realize how incredibly vulnerable you are 
 for me that moment came when i had to cross the first checkpoint  and i realized as i drove up that i would be negotiating passage
 through this checkpoint with a
  armed individual
 who if he decided to shoot me right then and there actually wouldn 't be doing anything illegal  
 but the sense of vulnerability that i had was absolutely nothing
 in comparison to the vulnerability of the families that i got to know over that year you see life
 in a society where there are no social institutions is
 with danger and uncertainty  and simple questions like what are we going to eat tonight 
 are very complicated to answer 
 questions about security when you don 't have any security systems are terrifying is
 that altercation i had with the neighbor down the block going to turn into a violent episode that will end my life or my family 's life
  health concerns when there is no health system
 are also terrifying  
 i listened as many families had to sort through questions like my infant has a fever what am i going to do 
 my sister who is pregnant is bleeding 
 what should i do who should i turn to where are the doctors where are the nurses  if i could find one are they trustworthy 
 how will i pay them in what currency will i pay them
  i need medications where will i find them  if i take those medications are they actually counterfeits and on and on 
 so for life in these settings  the dominant theme  the dominant feature of life 
 is the incredible vulnerability
 that people have to manage day in and day out because of the lack of social systems
  and it actually turns out that this feature of life
 is incredibly difficult to explain and be understood by people who are living outside of it i discovered this
 when i left kosovo i came back to boston i became a physician  i became a global public health policy
  i joined the harvard medical school and brigham and women 's hospital division of global health 
 and i as a researcher really wanted to get started on this problem right away i was like how do we reduce the crushing vulnerability of people living in these types of fragile settings 
 is there any way we can start to think about how to protect and quickly recover the institutions that are critical to survival like the health system 
 and i have to say i had amazing colleagues
 but one interesting thing about it was this was sort of an unusual question for them they were kind of like oh if you work in war doesn 't that mean you
 work on refugee camps and you work on documenting mass atrocities which is by the way very very very important so it took me a while
 to explain why i was so passionate about this issue  until about six years ago that 's when this landmark study
  at and described the public health consequences of war was published
 they came to an incredible provocative conclusion 
 these researchers concluded
 that the vast majority of death and disability from war happens after the cessation of conflict so the most dangerous time to be a person living in a
  after the cessation of hostilities  it 's after the peace deal has been signed it 's when that political solution has been achieved  that seems so puzzling but of course it 's not 
 because war kills people
 by robbing them of their clinics of their hospitals of their supply chains their doctors are
  on the run and more invisible and yet more deadly
 is the destruction of the health governance institutions and their finances  
 so this is really not surprising at all to me  
 but what is surprising and somewhat dismaying is how little impact this insight has had in terms of how we think about human suffering
  let me give you a couple examples last year you may remember ebola hit
 the west african country of liberia
 there was a lot of reporting about this group doctors without borders sounding the alarm and calling for aid and assistance  
 but not a lot of that reporting answered the question why is doctors without borders even in liberia 
  borders is an amazing organization  dedicated and designed to provide emergency care in war zones 
 liberia 's civil war had ended in two thousand and three that was eleven years before ebola even struck 
 when ebola struck liberia there were less than fifty doctors in the entire country of four point five million people 
 doctors without borders is in liberia
 because liberia still doesn 't really have a functioning health system eleven years later 
 when the earthquake hit haiti in two thousand and ten  the outpouring of international aid was phenomenal 
 but did you know that only two percent of that funding
 went to rebuild haitian public institutions including its health sector from that perspective  haitians continue to die from the earthquake even
  he 's the minister of health in the northern autonomous region of iraq in kurdistan here he is announcing
 that in the last nine months 
 his country  his region has increased from four million people to five million people 
 that 's a twenty five percent increase  thousands of these new arrivals have experienced
  his budget has not increased by twenty five percent it has decreased by twenty percent as funding has flowed to security concerns
 and to short term relief efforts when his health sector fails and if history is any guide it will
 how do you think that 's going to influence the decision making of the five million people in his region as they think about whether
  should flee that type of vulnerable living situation 
 so as you can see this is a frustrating topic for me and i really try to understand  why the reluctance
 to protect and support indigenous health systems and security systems i usually tier two concerns two arguments
  the first concern is about corruption and the concern that people in these settings are corrupt and
  and they are untrustworthy  and i will admit that i have met unsavory characters working in health sectors in these situations but i will tell you that the opposite
 is absolutely true in every case i have worked on from afghanistan to libya to kosovo to haiti to liberia
 i have met inspiring people who when the chips were down for their country  they risked everything to save their health institutions
 the trick for the outsider who wants to help
 is identifying who those individuals are and building a pathway for them to lead  that is exactly what happened in afghanistan 
 one of the
 unsung and untold success stories of our nation building effort in afghanistan
 involved the world
 bank in two thousand and two investing heavily in identifying training and promoting
 afghani health sector leaders 
 these health sector leaders have pulled off an incredible feat in afghanistan  they have
 aggressively increased access to health care for the majority of the population they are rapidly improving the health status of the afghan population which used to be the worst in the
  in fact the afghan ministry of health does things that i wish we would do in america  they use things like data to make policy  it 's incredible 
 laughter the other concern i hear a lot about is we just can 't afford it we just don 't have the money it 's just unsustainable 
 i would submit to you that the current situation and the current system we have is the most expensive
  inefficient system we could possibly conceive of the current situation is that when governments like the us or let 's say the collection of governments that make up the european commission
 every year  they spend fifteen billion dollars on just humanitarian and emergency and disaster relief worldwide
 that 's nothing about foreign aid that 's just disaster relief ninety five percent of it
 goes to international relief
  that then
 have to import resources into these areas and knit together some type of temporary health system let 's say which they then dismantle and send away when they run out of money  
 so
 our job it turns out is very clear 
 we as the global health community policy experts our first job
  how to monitor the strengths and vulnerabilities of health systems in threatened situations
  and that 's when we see doctors fleeing when we see health resources drying up when we see institutions crumbling
 that 's the emergency  that 's when we need to sound the alarm and wave our arms  ok 
 not now  everyone can see that 's an emergency they don 't need us to tell them that
  places like where i work at harvard need to take their cue from the world bank experience in afghanistan and we need to and we will build robust platforms to support health sector leaders like these
 these people risk their lives i think we can
 match their courage with some support number three we need to reach out and make new partnerships at our global health center
  we have launched a new initiative with nato and other security policy makers to explore with them what they can do to protect
 health system institutions during deployments we want them to see that protecting health systems and other critical social institutions
 is an integral part of their mission it 's not just about avoiding collateral damage  it 's about winning the peace
 but the most important partner we need to engage is you 
 the american public and indeed the world public because unless you
 understand the value of
 social institutions like health systems in these fragile settings you won 't support efforts to save them you won 't click on that article
 that talks about hey  all those doctors
  are on the run in country x i wonder what that means  i wonder what that means for that health system 's ability to let 's say detect
 influenza hmm it 's probably not good that 's what i 'd tell you  up on the screen i 've put up my
 three favorite
 american institution defenders and builders over here is
  george c marshall he was the guy that proposed the marshall plan to save all of europe 's economic institutions after world war ii 
 and this eleanor roosevelt her work on human rights really serves as the foundation for all of our international human rights organizations 
 then my big favorite is ben franklin
  did many things in terms of creating institutions but was the midwife of our constitution  and i would say to you
 that these are folks who when our country was threatened or our world was threatened  
 they didn 't retreat  they didn 't talk about building walls  they talked about building institutions
 to protect human security 
 for their generation and also for ours  and i think our generation should do the same
