  what i do is i organize information i 'm a graphic designer  professionally i try to make sense
 often of things that don 't make much sense themselves  so my father might not understand what it is that i do for a
  his part of my ancestry has been farmers he 's part of this ethnic minority called the pontic greeks  
 they lived in asia minor and fled to greece after a genocide about a hundred years ago  
 and ever since that  migration has somewhat been a theme in my family my father moved to germany  studied there and married  
 and as a result  i now have this
  with all the analytical thinking and that slightly dorky demeanor that come with that  
 and of course it meant that i was a foreigner in both countries  and that of course made it pretty easy for me
 to migrate as well  in good family tradition if you like 
 but of course most journeys that we undertake from day to day are within a city 
 and especially if you know the city  getting from a to b may seem pretty obvious
  but the question is why is it obvious how do we know where we 're going  
 so i washed up on a dublin ferry port about twelve years ago a professional foreigner if you like  and
 i 'm sure you 've all had this experience before yeah  you arrive in a new city  and your brain is trying to make sense of this new place once you find your base your home
  you start to build this cognitive map of your environment 
 it 's essentially this virtual map that only exists in your brain 
 all animal species do it even though we all use slightly different tools  us humans of course we don 't
 move around marking our territory by scent like dogs  we don 't run around emitting ultrasonic squeaks like bats
  just don 't do that although a night in the temple bar district can get pretty wild 
 laughter no
  we do two important things to make a place our own first we move along linear routes  typically we find a main street  
 and this main street becomes a linear strip map in our minds  but our mind keeps
  every street is generally perceived as a straight line  and we kind of ignore the little twists and turns that the streets make 
 when we do however make a turn into a side street  our mind tends to adjust that turn to a 90 degree angle 
 this of course makes for some funny moments when you 're in some old city layout that follows some sort of
 circular
  maybe you 've had that experience as well   let 's say you 're on some spot on a side street that projects from a main cathedral square  and you want to get to another point
 on a side street just like that 
 the cognitive map in your mind may tell you 
 aris go back to the main cathedral square  take a 90 degree turn and walk down that other side street 
 but somehow you feel adventurous that day  and you suddenly discover
  that the two spots were actually only a single building apart  now i don 't know about you  but i always feel like i find this wormhole or this inter dimensional portal 
 so we move along linear routes
 and our mind straightens streets and perceives
  the second thing that we do to make a place our own is we attach meaning and emotions to the things that we see along those along those lines  
 if you go to the irish countryside
 and you ask an old lady for directions  
 brace yourself for some elaborate irish storytelling about all the landmarks  yeah  she 'll tell you the pub where her sister used to work and go past that church where i got married that kind of thing
  so we fill our cognitive maps with these markers of meaning 
 what 's more  we abstract repeat patterns and recognize them we recognize them by the experiences
 and we abstract them into symbols  and of course  we 're all capable of understanding
  what 's more  we 're all capable of understanding the cognitive maps  and
 you are all capable of creating these cognitive maps yourselves  so next time when you want to tell your friend how to get to your place  
 you grab a beermat grab a napkin  
 and you just observe yourself create this awesome piece of communication design it 's got straight lines it 's got
  little symbols along the way  and
 when you look at what you 've just drawn  
 you realize it does not resemble a street map  
 if you were to put an actual street map on top of what you 've just drawn  you 'd realize your streets and the distances they 'd be way off 
 no what you 've just drawn is more like a diagram or a
  schematic it 's a visual construct
 of lines  dots  letters designed in the language of our brains so it 's no big surprise
 that the big
 icon of the last century the pinnacle of showing everybody how to get from a to b the london underground map
 was not designed by a cartographer or
  a city planner it was designed by an engineering draftsman in the 
 harry beck applied the principles of schematic diagram design
 and changed the way public transport maps are designed forever now the very key to the success of this map
 is in the omission of less important
  information
 and in the extreme simplification  
 so  straightened streets  
 corners of ninety and forty five degrees  but also the extreme geographic distortion in that map  if you were to look at the actual locations of these stations  you 'd see they 're very different 
  but this is all for the clarity of the public tube map
  if you say wanted to get from regent 's park station to great portland street  the tube map would tell you  take the tube  go to baker street  change over take another tube of course what you don 't know is
 that the two stations are only about a hundred meters apart  now we 've reached the subject of public
  public transport here in dublin is a somewhat touchy subject 
 for everybody who does not know the public transport here in dublin essentially we have this system of local buses that grew with the city  
 for every outskirt that was added  there was another bus route added  running from the outskirt all the way to the city center  
 and as these local buses approach the city center  they all run side by
  side and converge in pretty much
 one main street so when i stepped stepped off the boat twelve years ago  i tried to make sense of that  
 because
 exploring a city on foot only gets you so far  but when you explore a foreign and new public
  you will build a cognitive map in your mind in pretty much the same way  
 typically  you choose yourself a rapid transport route 
 and in your mind this route is perceived as a straight line  
 and like a pearl necklace all the stations and stops are nicely and neatly aligned along the line  
 and only then you start to discover
 some local bus routes
 that would fill in the gaps and that allow for those wormhole inter dimensional portal shortcuts  
 so i tried to make sense  
 and when i arrived  i was looking for some information leaflets that would help me crack this system and understand it  and i found those brochures
  a lot of omission of information  but unfortunately the wrong information  say in the city center
 there were never actually any lines that showed the routes there are actually not even any stations with names
  have gotten better  and
 after i finished the project
  they got a good a good bit better  but still no station names  still no routes so being naive  
 and being half german 
 i decided aris why don 't you build your own map so that 's what i did  i researched how each and every bus route moved through the city
 nice and logical every bus route a separate line  i plotted it into my own map of dublin 
 and in the city center  i got a nice spaghetti plate 
 now this is a bit of a mess  so i decided of course
  you 're going to apply the rules of schematic design cleaning up the corridors widening the streets where there were loads of buses and making the streets at straight 90 degree corners 45 degree corners or fractions of that 
 and filled it in with the bus routes 
 and i built this city center bus map of the system how it was five years ago i
 'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact of
 the quays and westmoreland street
  now i can proudly say 
 i can proudly say 
 as a public transport map  this diagram
 is an utter failure 
 except probably in
  i now had a great visual representation of just how clogged up and overrun the city center really was now call me 
 but i think a public transport route map should have lines  
 because that 's what they are  yeah  they 're little pieces of string that wrap their way through the city center or through the city  
 if you will  the greek guy inside of me
 feels if i don 't get a line  it 's like entering the labyrinth
  of the minotaur without having ariadne giving you the string to find your way  so the outcome of
 my academic research  loads of questionnaires case studies
 and looking at a lot of maps 
 was that a lot of the problems and shortcomings of the public transport system here in dublin was the lack of a coherent public transport map a simplified coherent public transport map
 because i think this is the crucial step to understanding a public transport network on a physical level  but it 's also the crucial step
 to make a public transport network mappable on a visual level  
 so i teamed up with a gentleman called james leahy a civil engineer and a recent master 's
  and together we drafted the simplified model network  which i could then go ahead and visualize  so here 's what we did  
 we distributed these
  corridors throughout the city center  and extended them into the outskirts rapid  because we wanted them to be
  james wanted to use bus rapid transport for that rather than light rail for me it was important
 that the vehicles that would run on those rapid transport corridors would be visibly distinguishable from local buses on the
  we could take out all the local buses that ran alongside those rapid transport means any gaps that appeared in the outskirts were filled again so in other words 
  if there was a street in an outskirt where there had been a bus  we put a bus back in 
  one of these thick lines over there so the rest was merely a couple of months of work
 and a couple of fights with my girlfriend of our place constantly being
 clogged up with maps and the outcome one of the outcomes was this map of the greater dublin area i 'll zoom in a little bit 
 this map only shows the rapid transport connections no local bus very
  was so successful in london and that since has been
 exported to so many other major cities and therefore is the language that we should use for public transport maps 
 what 's also important is with a simplified network like this it now would become possible for me
 to tackle the ultimate challenge and make a public transport map for the city center
  where i wouldn 't just show rapid transport connections  but also all the local bus routes streets and the likes  and this is what a map like this could look like i 'll zoom in a little bit 
 in this map  i 'm including each transport mode  so rapid transport 
  individual route is represented represented by a separate line  
 the map shows each and every station each and every station name  
 and
 i 'm also displaying displaying side streets in fact  most of the side streets even with their
  for good measure also a couple of landmarks some of them signified by little symbols  others by these isometric three dimensional bird 's eye view drawings  
 the map is relatively small in overall size so something that you could still hold as a fold out map or display in a reasonably sized display box on a bus shelter i think
 it tries to be the the best balance between actual representation
 and simplification the language of way finding in our brain 
 so straightened lines 
 cleaned up corners  and of course that very very important geographic distortion that makes public transport maps possible 
 if you for example have a look at the two main corridors that run through the city the yellow and orange one over here this is how they look in
  accurate street map  and this is how they would look in my
 distorted simplified public transport map  
 so for a successful public transport map  we should not stick to accurate representation  but design them in the way our brains work  the reactions i got were tremendous 
 it was really good to see  and of course for my own self  i was very happy to see that my folks in germany and greece finally have an idea
