  i have spent the past thirty eight years trying to be invisible  
 i 'm a copy editor 
 i work at the new yorker and copyediting for the new yorker is like playing shortstop for a major league baseball team
  every little movement gets picked over by the critics
 god forbid you should commit an error 
 just to clarify copy editors don 't choose what goes into the magazine  
 we work at the level of the sentence maybe the paragraph the words the punctuation  
 our business is in the
  we impose house style  every publication has a house style the new yorker 's is particularly distinctive  
 we sometimes get teased for our style imagine we still spell teen ager with a hyphen 
 as if that word had just been coined  
  and you know you 're reading the new yorker copyediting at the new yorker is a mechanical process  there is a related role called query proofreading or
 whereas copyediting is mechanical 
 query proofreading is interpretive  we make suggestions to the author through the editor to improve the emphasis of a sentence or
  point out unintentional repetitions and supply
 compelling alternatives 
 our purpose is to make the author look good 
 note that we give our proofs not directly to the author but to the editor this often creates a good cop bad cop dynamic
 in which the copy editor i 'll use that as an umbrella term is invariably the
  bad cop 
 if we do our job well we 're invisible  but as soon as we make a mistake  we copy editors become glaringly visible 
 here is the most recent mistake that was laid at my door [ last tuesday
  where were the new yorker 's fabled copy editors a reader wrote didn 't the writer mean 
 ouch there 's no excuse for this mistake  but i like it
  ruby was seventy six but she retained her authoritative bearing  only her unsteady gait belied her age ]
 he added surely someone at the new yorker knows the meaning of ' belied ' and that it is the opposite of how it is used in this sentence come on get it together 
 belie 
 to give a false impression it should have been
 e b white once wrote of commas in the new yorker they fall with the precision of knives outlining a body 
 and it 's true we get a lot of complaints about commas are there really two commas in ' martin luther king jr boulevard ' 
 there may not be on the sign but
  if we must have commas around at least
  we might change it up by using dashes around that phrase
  cords not chords ] the outraged reader added 
 i 'm sure i 'm not the first to write regarding this egregious proofreading error  but i 'm equally sure i won 't be the last 
 i used to like getting mail  there is a pact between writers and editors the editor never sells out the writer never goes
  public about bad jokes that had to be cut or stories that went on too long a great
 editor saves a writer from her excesses copy editors too have a code  we don 't advertise our oversights 
 i feel disloyal divulging them here  so let 's have look at what we do right 
 somehow i 've gotten a reputation for sternness
  sternness  but i work with writers who know how to have their way with me  
 i 've known ian frazier or sandy since the early 80s and he 's one of my favorites 
 even though he sometimes writes a sentence that gives a copy editor pause 
 here is one from a story about staten island after
  a dock that had been broken in the middle and lost its other half sloped down toward the water its support pipes and wires leaning forward
 like when you open a box of linguine and it slides out ] 
 this would never have got past the grammarian in the days of yore  but what could i do technically the like 
  but it sounds ridiculous as if the author were about to embark on an extended homeric simile as when you open a box of linguine 
 i decided that the hurricane conferred poetic justice on sandy and let the sentence stand 
 generally if i think something is wrong i query it three times  i told sandy that not long ago in a
  moment of indiscretion and he said only three so he has learned to hold out recently he wrote a story for talk of the town that 's the section at the front of the magazine with short pieces 
  on subjects ranging from ricky jay 's exhibit at the metropolitan museum to the introduction of doggie bags in france 
  a grammar query the justice was wearing black and sandy wrote [ her face and hands stood out like in an old mostly dark painting ]
 now  unlike with the hurricane with this like the author didn 't have the excuse of describing hurricane damage like in this sense is a preposition and a preposition takes an object which is a noun 
 this like had to be an
  quoting someone who was assisting the justice [ it will be just a minute we are getting the justice 
 the music industry spells it mic because that 's how it 's spelled on the equipment i 'd never seen it used as a verb with this spelling and i was distraught to think that mic 'ed would get into the magazine on my watch 
 new yorker style for
  abbreviated form is mike 
 finally there was a sticky grammar and usage issue in which the pronoun has to have the same grammatical number as its antecedent [
 everyone in the vicinity held their breath
 is here  but people say things like everyone held their breath all the time 
 to give it legitimacy copy editors call it the singular ' their ' as if calling it singular makes it no longer plural it
 is my job
 when i see it in print to do my best to eliminate it 
  everyone held his or her breath whatever i suggested had to blend in 
 i asked through the editor if the author would consider changing it to all in the vicinity held their breath 
 because all is plural
 i tried again all those present held their breath i thought this sounded vaguely judicial  but the
  everyone held their breath he stood his ground two out of three isn 't bad 
 in the same issue in that piece on doggie bags in france there was the gratuitous use of the f word by a frenchman  
 i wonder when the mail comes in which will have offended the readers more
