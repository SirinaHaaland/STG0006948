  in my industry  we believe that images can change the world  okay  we 're naive we 're
 bright eyed and bushy tailed the truth is that we know that the images themselves don 't change the world  but we 're also aware
  since the beginning of photography images have provoked reactions in people and those reactions have caused change to happen  
 so let 's begin with a group of images 
 i 'd be extremely surprised if you didn 't recognize many or most of them  
 they 're best described as iconic  
 so iconic  perhaps they 're cliches in fact they 're so well known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form
 but i think we 're looking for something more  
 we 're looking for something more we 're looking for images that shine an uncompromising light on crucial issues images that transcend borders that transcend religions 
 images that provoke us to step up and do something
 in other words to act well this image you 've all seen it changed our view of the physical world
  we had never seen our planet from this perspective before many people credit
 a lot of the birth of the environmental movement to our seeing the planet like this for the first time
 its smallness its fragility  
 forty years later this group more than most are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment 
 and at last we appear to be doing something about it
 this destructive power takes many different forms for example these images taken by brent stirton in the congo 
 these gorillas were murdered some would even say crucified  and unsurprisingly they sparked international outrage 
 most recently  we 've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself
 with the recent earthquake in haiti
  what is far worse
 is man 's destructive power over man  
 samuel pisar an auschwitz survivor said and i 'll quote him the holocaust teaches us that nature even in its cruelest moments is benign
 in comparison with man when he loses his moral compass and his reason there 's another kind of crucifixion the horrifying images from abu ghraib
  well as the images from guantanamo had a profound impact  
 the publication of those images as opposed to the images themselves  caused a government to change its policies  some would argue
 that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in iraq than virtually any other single act  furthermore those
  moral high ground of the occupying forces 
 let 's go back a little in the 1960s and 1970s the vietnam war was basically shown in america 's living rooms day in day out news photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war a little girl burned by napalm 
 a student killed by the national guard at kent state university in ohio during a protest 
 in fact these images became the voices of protest themselves  now images have power to
 shed light of understanding on suspicion ignorance  and in particular i 've given a lot of talks on this but i 'll just show one image
 the issue of hiv aids 
 in the 1980s the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it a simple act in one thousand nine  hundred and
  of the most famous woman in the world the princess of wales  touching an hiv aids infected baby
 did a great deal especially in europe to stop that she  better than most knew the power of an image 
 so when we are confronted by a powerful image  we all have a choice 
 we can look away or we can address the image thankfully when these photos appeared in the guardian in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight they put a lot of focus
 focus and attention and in the end a lot of money towards the sudan famine relief efforts did the images change the world  no but they had a major impact  
 images often push us to question our core beliefs and our responsibilities to each other 
 we all saw those images after katrina  
 and i think for millions of people they had a very strong impact  and i think it 's very unlikely that they were far from the minds of americans when they went to vote in november two thousand and eight
  images are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them i
 'll show you one photo here and it 's a photo by eugene richards of an iraq war veteran from an extraordinary piece of work which has never been published called war is personal  
 but images don 't need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war john moore set up this
 photo at arlington cemetery after all the tense moments of conflict
 in all the conflict zones of the world  there 's one photograph from a much quieter place
 that haunts me still much more than the others  
 ansel adams said and i 'm going to disagree with him 
 you don 't take a photograph you make it 
 in my view it 's not the photographer who makes the photo it 's you we bring to each image our own values our own belief systems and as a result of that the image
  resonates with us my company has seventy million images i have one image in my office here it is 
 i hope that the next time you see an image that sparks something in you you 'll better understand why  and i know that speaking to this audience you 'll definitely do something about it  and thank you to all the photographers
