  i guess what we 're going to do is we 're going to
 talk about your life and using some pictures that you shared with me and i think we should start right here with this one  okay now
 who is this
  son eli  he was about age five this is taken in nigeria right after having taken the washington d c bar exam ca 
 okay but this doesn 't really look like a martine mr 
 right that was
 myself as a male the way i was brought up
  before i transitioned from male to female and martin to martine ca 
 you were brought up martin rothblatt mr correct ca and about a year after this picture
  you married a beautiful woman was this love at first sight what happened there mr it was love at the first sight i saw bina
 at a discotheque in los angeles  
 and we
 later began living together but the moment i saw her i saw just an aura of energy around her i asked her to
  dance she said she saw an aura of energy around me  
 i was a single male parent she was a single female parent
  we showed each other our kids ' pictures  and we 've been happily married for a third of a century now
  companies and then you started addressing this problem of how could you
 use satellites to revolutionize radio  
 tell us about that mr right i always loved space technology and satellites to me  are sort of like the canoes that our ancestors first pushed out into the water  
 so it was exciting for me to be part of the navigation
 of the oceans of the sky  and as i developed different
  types of satellite communication systems  
 the main thing i did was to launch bigger and more powerful satellites  the consequence of which was that the receiving antennas
 could be smaller and smaller and after going through direct television broadcasting i had the idea that if we could make a more powerful
  the receiving dish could be so small that it would just be a section of a parabolic dish a flat little plate
 embedded into the roof of an automobile and it would be possible to have nationwide satellite radio  and that 's sirius xm today ca 
 wow so who here has used sirius mr 
 thank you for your monthly subscriptions
  at the time it was a huge commercial success  but soon after this in the early 
 there was this big transition in your life and you became martine
  i discussed with each of them that i felt
 my soul was was always female and as a woman  but i was afraid people would laugh at me if i expressed it so
 i always kept it bottled up
 and just showed my male side and each of them had a different take on this
 i love your soul
 and whether the outside is martin and martine it doesn 't it matter to me i love your soul my son
 said if you become a woman will you still be my father 
 and i said yes i 'll always be your father and i 'm still his father today my youngest daughter did an
  brilliant five year old thing she
 told people i love my dad and she loves me 
 so she had no problem with a gender blending whatsoever ca 
 and a couple years after this  you published this book the apartheid of sex what was your thesis in this book mr 
 my thesis in this book is that there are seven billion people in the world
  and actually seven billion unique ways to express one 's gender and while
 people may have the genitals of a male or a female 
 the genitals don 't determine your gender or even really your sexual identity that 's just a matter of anatomy and reproductive tracts
  and people could choose whatever gender they want if they weren 't forced by society into categories of either male or female the way south africa used to force people into categories of black or white  
 we know from anthropological science that race is fiction 
 even though racism is very very real  
 and we now know from cultural studies that separate male or female genders is a constructed fiction  the reality is a gender fluidity
 that crosses the entire continuum from male to female ca 
 you yourself don 't always feel one hundred percent female mr 
 correct  i would say in some ways i change my gender about as often as i change my hairstyle ca 
 okay  now this is your gorgeous daughter jenesis
  and i guess she was about this age when something pretty terrible happened mr yes  she
 was finding herself unable to walk up the stairs in our house to her bedroom 
 and after several months of doctors she was diagnosed to have a rare  almost invariably fatal disease
 called pulmonary arterial hypertension ca so how did you respond to that
  we first tried to get her to the best doctors we could we ended up at children 's national medical center in washington d c the head of pediatric cardiology
 told us that he was going to refer her to get a lung transplant  
 but not to hold out any hope because there are very few lungs available especially for children  
 he said that
 all people with this illness died and if any of you have seen the film lorenzo 's oil
  scene when the protagonist kind of rolls down the stairway crying and and bemoaning the fate of his son 
 and that 's exactly how we felt about jenesis ca 
 but you didn 't accept that as the limit of what you could do you started trying to research and see if you could find a cure somehow mr 
 correct she was in the intensive care ward for weeks at a time
 bina and i would tag team to stay at the hospital while the other watched the rest of the kids  
 and when i was in the hospital and she was sleeping i went to the hospital library  i read every article that i could find on pulmonary hypertension  
 i had not taken any biology  even in college so i had to go from a biology textbook
  textbook and then medical textbook and the journal articles  
 back and forth  
 and eventually i knew enough to think that it might be possible that somebody could find a cure 
 so we started a nonprofit foundation i wrote a description
 asking people to submit grants and we would pay for medical research i became an
  expert on the condition doctors said to me martine  we really appreciate all the funding you 've provided us but
 we are not going to be able to find a cure in time to save your daughter  however there is a medicine that was developed at
 the burroughs wellcome company that could halt the progression of the disease  but
 burroughs wellcome has just been acquired by glaxo wellcome they made a decision not to develop any
  medicines for rare and orphan diseases and
 maybe you could use your expertise in satellite communications to develop this cure for pulmonary hypertension ca 
 so how on earth did you get access to this drug mr i went to glaxo wellcome and
 after three times being rejected and having the door slammed in my face because they weren 't going to
 out license the drug to a satellite communications expert
 they weren 't going to send the drug out to anybody at all  and they thought i didn 't have the expertise finally
 i was able to persuade a small team of people to work with me and develop enough credibility  i wore down their resistance and
  they had no hope this drug would even work by the way  
 and they tried to tell me you 're just wasting your time we 're sorry about your daughter but finally for twenty five thousand dollars
 and agreement to pay ten percent of any revenues we might ever get they agreed to give me worldwide rights to this drug ca 
 and so you put this drug on the market
  way by basically charging what it would take to make the economics work mr oh yes chris but this really wasn 't a drug that i ended up 
  after i wrote the check for twenty five thousand  
 and i said okay where 's the medicine for jenesis they said oh martine  there 's no medicine for jenesis this is just something we tried in rats
  and they gave me like a little plastic ziploc bag of a small amount of powder they said don 't give it to any human 
 and they gave me a piece of paper which said it was a patent 
 and from that we had to figure out a way to make this medicine 
 a hundred chemists in the u s at the top universities all swore that little patent could never be turned into a medicine if it was turned into a
  a year or two later  you were there with a medicine that
 worked for jenesis mr chris the astonishing thing is that this absolutely worthless
 piece of powder that had the sparkle of a promise of hope for jenesis is not only keeping jenesis and other people
 alive today
  produces almost a billion and a half dollars a year in revenue
  dollars last year one hundred million dollars it 's the best return on investment they ever received
 and believe me if you grew up your whole life with people in your face saying that you 've got a fatal disease i would probably run to tahiti and just not want to run into anybody again 
 but instead she chooses to work in united therapeutics she says she wants to do all she can to help other people with orphan diseases get medicines
  she 's our project leader for all telepresence activities 
 where she helps digitally unite the entire company to work together to find cures for pulmonary hypertension ca 
 but not everyone who has this disease has been so fortunate  there are still many people dying and you are tackling that too how mr
 exactly chris there 's some three thousand people a year in the united states alone perhaps ten times that number worldwide who continue to die of this illness because the medicines
  slow down the progression but they don 't halt it 
 the only cure for pulmonary hypertension pulmonary fibrosis  cystic fibrosis emphysema   copd what leonard nimoy just died of is a lung transplant  
 but sadly there are only enough available lungs for two thousand
  a year to get a lung transplant  whereas nearly a half million people a year
 die of end stage lung failure ca so how can you address that mr 
 so i conceptualize the possibility that just like we keep cars and planes and
 buildings going forever with an unlimited supply of building parts and machine parts why can 't we create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs to keep people living
  and especially people with lung disease so we 've teamed up with the decoder of the human genome  
 craig venter  and the company he founded with peter diamandis the founder of the x prize 
 to genetically modify the pig genome  so that the pig 's organs will not be rejected by the human body
 and thereby to create an unlimited supply
  supply of transplantable organs we do this through our company united therapeutics ca 
 so you really believe that within what a decade that this shortage of transplantable lungs maybe be cured  through these guys mr 
 absolutely chris i 'm as certain of that as i was of the success that we 've had with
 direct television
  it 's actually not rocket science it 's straightforward engineering away one gene after another we 're so lucky to be born in the time that sequencing genomes
  is a routine activity and the brilliant folks at synthetic genomics are able to zero in on the pig genome find exactly the genes that are problematic and fix them ca 
  and i think
 this graph for
 you says something quite profound  what does this mean mr what this graph means and it comes from ray kurzweil is that the rate of
 development in computer processing
  firmware and software has been advancing along a curve such that by the 2020s as we saw in earlier presentations today
 there will be information technology that processes information and the world around us at the same rate as a human mind ca 
 and so that being so you 're actually getting ready for this world by believing
  what we 're working on is creating a situation where people can create a mind file  
 and a mind file is the collection of their mannerisms personality recollection feelings  beliefs attitudes and
  everything that we 've poured today into google into amazon into facebook  and
 all of this information stored there will be able in the next couple decades  once software is able to recapitulate consciousness 
 be able to revive the consciousness which is imminent in our mind file ca 
 now you 're not just messing around with this you
  she was programmed by hanson robotics out of texas  
 there 's the centerfold from national geographic magazine with one of her caregivers and she roams the web and has hundreds of hours of bina 's
 mannerisms
  she 's kind of like a two year old kid  but
 she says things that blow people away best expressed by perhaps a new york times pulitzer prize winning journalist amy harmon who says her answers are often frustrating  but
 other times as compelling as those of any flesh person she 's interviewed ca 
 and is is your thinking here  part of your hope here is that
 this version of bina can in a sense live on forever
  some future
 upgrade to this version can live on forever mr 
 yes not just bina but everybody you know it costs us virtually nothing to store our mind files
 on facebook instagram what have you social media is i think one of the most extraordinary inventions of our time  
 and as apps become available that will allow us to
  better and develop consciousness operating systems everybody in the world  billions of people will be able to develop mind clones of themselves that will have their own life on the web ca 
 so the thing is martine that in any normal conversation this would sound 
 but in the context of your
  what you 've done some of the things we 've heard this week  the constructed realities that our minds give  i mean  you wouldn 't
 bet against it mr well i think it 's really nothing coming from me if anything i 'm perhaps a bit of a
 communicator of activities that are being undertaken by the greatest companies in china  japan  india the
  there are tens of millions of people working on writing code
 that expresses more and more aspects of our human consciousness and you don 't have to be
 a genius to see that all these threads are going to come together and ultimately create human consciousness  and it 's something we 'll value
 there are so many things to do in this life and if we could have a simulacrum 
  of ourselves
 that helps us process books do shopping 
 be our best friends  i believe our mind clones these digital versions of ourselves will ultimately be our best friends and for me personally and bina personally 
 we love each other like crazy each day we are always saying like wow  i love you even more than thirty years ago  and so for us the prospect of mind clones
 and regenerated bodies is that our love affair chris can go on forever and
 we never get bored of each other i 'm sure we never will ca i think bina 's here right
 when
 you got married 
 if someone had told you that 
 in a few years time  the man you were marrying would become a woman and a few years after that you would become a robot 
 laughter how has this gone how has it been bina rothblatt it 's been really
  an exciting journey and i would have never thought that at the time  but we started
 making goals and setting those goals and accomplishing things and before you knew it we just keep going up and up and we 're still not stopping so it 's great ca 
 martine told me something really
 beautiful just
 actually on skype before this which was
 that he wanted to live for hundreds of years
  we want to wake up together ca 
 so just so as you know from my point of view this isn 't only one of the most astonishing lives i have heard it 's one of the most astonishing love stories i 've ever heard it
 's just a delight to have you both here at ted
