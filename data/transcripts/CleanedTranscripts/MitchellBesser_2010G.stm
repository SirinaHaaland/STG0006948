  want you to take a trip with me 
 picture yourself driving down a small road in africa  and as you drive along you look off to the side  and this is what you see 
 you see a field of graves
  and you stop and you get out of your car and you take a picture and you go into the town and you inquire what 's going on here and people are initially reluctant to tell you  
 and then someone says these are the recent aids deaths in our community 
 hiv isn 't like other medical conditions  it 's stigmatizing people are reluctant to talk about it
 there 's a fear associated with it  and i 'm going to talk about hiv today about the deaths about the stigma
  a medical story but more than that it 's a social story 
 this map depicts the global distribution of hiv and as you can see africa has a disproportionate share of the infection 
 there are thirty three million people living with hiv in the world today 
 of these
  million are living in
  there are one point four million pregnant women in low and middle income countries living with hiv and of these  ninety percent
 are in sub saharan africa  
 we talk about things in relative terms and i 'm going to talk about annual pregnancies and hiv positive mothers 
 the united states a large country each year seven thousand mothers with hiv who give birth to a child 
 but you go to rwanda a very small
  country eight thousand mothers with hiv who are pregnant 
 and then you go to baragwanath hospital outside of johannesburg in south africa and
 eight thousand hiv positive pregnant women giving birth a hospital the same as a country and to realize that this is just the tip of an
  when you compare everything here to south africa it just pales because
 in south africa  each year three hundred thousand mothers with hiv give birth to children  
 so we talk about pmtct and we refer to pmtct prevention of mother to child transmission  i think there 's an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a 
 she 's going to infect her child the reality is really very different in
 resource rich countries with all the tests and treatment we currently have  less than two percent of babies are born 
 percent of babies are born hiv negative 
 and yet the reality in  resource poor countries in the absence of tests and treatment forty percent forty percent of children are infected forty percent versus two percent
  an enormous difference 
 so these programs and i 'm going to refer to pmtct
 though my talk these prevention programs 
 simply they 're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers to prevent them from infecting their babies 
 and also the medicines we give to mothers to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children so it 's the test a mother gets when she comes in it 's the drugs she receives to protect the baby that 's inside the uterus and during
  it 's the guidance she gets around infant feeding and safer sex  it 's an entire package of services  
 and it works 
 so in the united states since the advent of treatment in the middle of the 1990s there 's been an 80 percent decline in the number of hiv infected children
 less than one hundred babies are born with hiv each year in the united states
 and yet  still  over four hundred thousand children are born every year in the world today with hiv
 what does that mean it means one thousand one hundred children infected each day one thousand 
 one hundred children each day infected with hiv and where where do they come from well  less than one comes from the united states 
 one on average comes from europe 
 one hundred
  come from asia and the pacific and each day a thousand babies
 a thousand babies are born each day with hiv in africa  
 so again i look at the globe here and the disproportionate share of hiv in africa  
 and let 's look at another map and here again we see africa has a disproportionate share of
 the numbers of doctors that thin sliver you see here that 's africa  and it 's the same with nurses
 the truth is sub saharan africa has twenty four percent of the global disease burden
 and yet only three percent of the world 's health care workers that means doctors and nurses simply don 't have the time to take care of patients 
 a nurse in a busy clinic will see fifty to one hundred patients in a day  
 which leaves her just minutes per patient minutes per patient  and so when we look at these pmtct
  programs what does it mean well back in two thousand and one when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug a nurse 
 in the course of her few minutes with a patient would have to counsel for the hiv test perform the hiv test explain the results dispense a single dose of the drug nevirapine explain how to take it discuss infant feeding options reinforce
 infant feeding and test
  fortunately since two thousand and one we 've got new treatments new tests and we 're far more successful  but we don 't have any more nurses  and so
 these are the tests a nurse now has to do in those same few minutes it 's not possible
 it doesn 't work  and so we need to find better ways of providing
  is a picture of a maternal health clinic in africa
 mothers coming pregnant and with their babies these women are here for care  
 but we know that just doing a test just giving someone a drug  it 's not enough 
 meds don 't equal medical care 
 doctors and nurses  frankly don 't have the time or skills to tell people what to do in ways they understand i 'm a doctor
 i tell people things to do and
  i expect them to follow my guidance because i 'm a doctor i went to harvard
 but the reality is if i tell a patient you should have safer sex  you should always use a condom and yet in her relationship she 's not empowered
 what 's going to happen if i tell her to take her medicines every day and yet  no one in the household knows about
  it 's just not going to work  
 and so we need to do more we need to do it differently we need to do it in ways that are affordable and accessible and can be taken to scale which means it can be done everywhere 
 so i want to tell you a story
 i want to take you on a little trip  
 imagine yourself if you can you 're a young woman in africa you 're going to the hospital or clinic you go in for a test and you find out that you 're pregnant and you 're delighted
 and then they give you another test and they tell you 
  and you 're devastated and the nurse takes you into a room  and she tells you about the tests and hiv and the medicines you can take
 and how to take care of yourself and your baby  and you hear none of it  all you 're hearing is i 'm going to die  and my baby is going to die and then you 're out on the street  
  and you don 't know where to go and you don 't know who you can talk to because the truth is hiv is so stigmatizing that if you partner your family anyone in your home you 're likely to be thrown out without any means of support 
 and this this is the face and story
 of hiv in africa today  but we 're here to talk about possible solutions and some good news and i want to change the story a little
  take the same mother and the nurse 
 after she gives her her test takes her to a room  
 the door opens and there 's a room full of mothers mothers with babies  and they 're sitting and they 're talking they 're listening they 're drinking tea they 're having sandwiches  
 and she goes inside and woman comes up to her and says welcome to mothers2mothers 
 have a seat you 're safe here we 're all
  going to be okay  you 're going to live your baby is going to
  we view mothers as a community 's single greatest resource 
 mothers take care of the children take care of the home so often the men are gone  they 're working or they 're not part of the household 
 our organization mothers2mothers enlists women with hiv as care providers  
 we bring mothers who have hiv who 've been through these pmtct programs in the very facilities
 to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team 
 these mothers we call them mentor mothers 
 are able to engage women who just like themselves  pregnant with babies have found out about being hiv positive 
 who need support and education and they support them around the diagnosis and educate them about how to take their medicines how to take care of themselves how to take care of their babies
 consider if you needed surgery you would want the best possible technical surgeon 
 right but if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life you 'd like to engage someone someone who 's had the procedure 
 patients are experts on their own experience and they can share that experience with others this is the medical care that goes
  beyond just medicines 
 so the mothers who work for us they come from the communities in which they work  
 they 're hired they 're paid as professional members of the health care teams just like doctors and nurses  
 and we open bank accounts for them and they 're paid directly into the accounts  because
 their money 's protected the men can 't take it away from them they go through two to three weeks of rigorous
  now doctors and nurses they too get trained but so often they only get trained once so they 're not aware of new medicines new guidelines as they come out 
 our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained  and so doctors and nurses they look up to them as experts  
 imagine that a woman a former
  being able to educate her doctor for the first time and educate the other patients
 that she 's taking care of 
 our organization has three goals the first to prevent mother to child transmission  
 the second  keep mothers healthy  keep mothers alive keep the children alive
 no more orphans and the third and maybe the most grand is to find ways to empower women 
 enable them to fight the stigma and to live
  positive and productive lives with hiv  
 so how do we do it well  maybe the most important engagement is the one to one 
 seeing patients one to one educating them  supporting them explaining how they can take care of themselves  
 we go beyond that we try to bring in the husbands the partners
  in africa it 's very very hard to engage men men are not frequently part of
 pregnancy care 
 but in rwanda in one country  they 've got a policy that a woman can 't come for care unless she brings the father of the baby with her
 that 's the rule  
 and so the father and the mother together go through the counseling and the testing the father and the mother together they get the results  and this is so important in breaking through the stigma
 is so central to prevention how do you have safer sex how do you use a condom regularly if there hasn 't been disclosure 
 disclosure is so important to treatment  because again people need the support of family members and friends to take their medicines regularly  
 we also work in groups now the groups it 's not like me
  what happens is women they come together under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers they come together and they share their personal experiences  
 and it 's through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves  how to disclose how to take medicines  
 and then there 's the community outreach  engaging women in their communities 
 if we can change the way households believe and think 
 we can change the way communities believe and think and if we can change enough communities
  we can change national attitudes we can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to hiv 
 the hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction we have the medicines we have the tests  but how do you reduce the stigma 
 and it 's important about disclosure so 
 a couple years ago one of the mentor mothers came back and she told me a story 
 she had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home
 of the client
  client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her hiv status  
 and she was afraid to go by herself  and so the mentor mother went along with and the patient walked into the house and said to her
 to her mother and siblings i have something to tell you i 
 and everybody was quiet  and then her oldest brother stood up and said 
  i too have something to tell you i 'm hiv positive i 've been afraid to tell everybody 
 and then this older sister stood up and said i too am living with the virus  and i 've been ashamed 
 and then her younger brother stood up
 and said i 'm also positive  i thought you were going to throw me out of the family and you see where this is going the last sister stood up and said i 'm also positive i
  going to hate me and there they were all of them together for the first time being able to share this experience for the first time and to support each other for the first time female narrator 
 women come to us and they are crying and scared  i tell them my story  that i am
 but my child is
 i tell them you are going to make it  and you will raise a healthy baby
  i am proof that there is hope mitchell besser 
 remember the images i showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in africa  
 and it is a crisis in health care systems  even as we have more tests and more drugs  we can 't reach people we don 't have enough providers so we talk in terms of what we call
  is traditionally when you take health care services from one provider and have another provider do it
  it 's a doctor giving a job to a nurse and
 the issue in africa is that there are fewer nurses really than doctors and so we need to find new paradigm for health care how do you build a better health care system 
 we 've chosen to redefine the health care system as a doctor a nurse and a mentor mother and so what nurses do is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain
  take the drugs the side effects they delegate education about infant feeding family planning safer sex  
 actions that nurses simple just don 't have time for 
 so we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission the world is increasingly seeing these programs as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health and our organization helps women across that bridge 
 the care doesn 't stop when the baby 's born we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby
  ensuring that they live healthy successful lives 
 our organization works on three levels the first at the patient level mothers and babies keeping babies from getting hiv keeping mothers healthy to raise them  
 the second communities empowering women 
 they become leaders within their
  they change the way communities think we need to change attitudes to hiv we need to change attitudes to women in africa  
 we have to do that  and then
 rework the level of the health care systems building stronger health care systems our health care systems are broken 
 they 're not going to work the way they 're currently designed  and so doctors and nurses
 who need to try to change people 's behaviors don 't have the
  don 't have the time our mentor mothers do  and so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in we can do that 
 i started the program in capetown south africa back in two thousand and one it was at that point just the spark of an idea 
 referencing steven johnson 's
 very lovely speech yesterday on where ideas come from i was in the shower at the time
  the program is now working in nine countries  we have six hundred and seventy program sites  
 we 're seeing about two hundred and thirty thousand women every month  
 we 're employing one thousand six hundred mentor mothers and last year they enrolled three hundred thousand
  pregnant women and mothers that is
 twenty percent of the global hiv positive pregnant women
 twenty percent of the world what 's extraordinary is how simple the premise is mothers with hiv caring for mothers with hiv  
 past patients taking care of present patients and empowerment through employment reducing stigma
  pregnant women
  all of this is possible if we each contribute to this fight mb 
 simple solutions to complex problems mothers caring for mothers
