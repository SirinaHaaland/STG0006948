  as a scientist  and also as a human being i 've been trying to make myself susceptible to wonder  
 i think jason webley last night called it conspiring to be part of the magic so it 's fortunate that my
  career as a biologist lets me dive deeply into the lives of some truly wondrous creatures
 that share our planet 
 fireflies  
 now for many of you  i know that fireflies might conjure up some really great memories  childhood  summertime even other ted talks
  something like this 
 my seduction into the world of fireflies began when i was back in graduate school 
 one evening i was sitting out in my backyard in north carolina  and suddenly 
 these silent sparks
 rose up all around me
  i began to wonder how do these creatures make light  and what 's with all this flashing are they talking to one another  
 and what happens after the lights go out  
 i 've been lucky enough to answer some of these questions as i 've explored this nocturnal world 
 now if you 've ever seen
 or even heard about fireflies  then you 'll know how magically they can transform our everyday landscape into something ethereal and otherworldly and this
  happens around the globe like this hillside in the smoky mountains that i saw transformed into a living cascade of light
 by the eerie glows of these blue ghost fireflies  
 or a roadside river that i visited in japan as it was giving birth to the slow  floating flashes of these genji
  or in malaysia  the mangrove trees that i watched blossom nightly not with flowers but with the lights of a thousand fireflies  all blinking together in stunning synchrony 
 these luminous landscapes still fill me with wonder  and they keep me connected to the magic
 of the natural world  and i find it amazing that they 're created by these tiny insects in
  person fireflies are charming  they 're charismatic  they 've been celebrated in art and in poetry for centuries 
 as i 've traveled around the world i 've met many thoughtful people who have told me that god put fireflies on earth for humans to enjoy 
 other creatures can enjoy them too  
 i think these graceful insects are truly miraculous because they so
 beautifully illuminate
 the creative improvisation of evolution  
 they 've been shaped by two powerful evolutionary forces  natural selection  the struggle for survival  and sexual selection  
 the struggle for reproductive opportunity 
 as a firefly junkie the past twenty years have been quite an exciting ride
  together with my students at tufts university and other colleagues  we 've made lots of new discoveries about fireflies  
 their courtship and sex lives their treachery and murder  
 so today i 'd like to share with you just a couple of tales that we 've brought back from our collective adventures
 into this hidden
  fireflies belong to a very beautiful and diverse group of insects  the beetles  
 worldwide there are more than two thousand firefly species  
 and these have evolved remarkably diverse courtship signals that is different ways to find and attract mates 
 around one hundred and fifty million years ago  the very first fireflies probably looked like this they flew during the daytime and they didn 't light up
  instead males used their fantastic antennae to sniff out perfumes given off by their females 
 in other fireflies it 's only the females who light up  they are attractively plump
 and wingless  so every night they climb up onto perches and they glow brightly for hours to attract their flying but unlit males
  in still other fireflies  both sexes use quick bright flashes to find their mates  
 here in north america we have more than one hundred different kinds of firefly that have the remarkable ability to shine
 energy out from their bodies in the form of light how do they do that
  it seems totally magical but these bioluminescent signals arise from carefully orchestrated chemical reactions that happen inside the firefly lantern  
 the main star is an enzyme called luciferase  which in the course of evolution has figured out a way to wrap its tiny arms around an even smaller molecule called luciferin 
 in the process getting it so excited that it actually gives off light
  could these bright lights have benefited some
 to answer this question we need to flip back in the family album to some
 baby pictures fireflies completely reinvent their bodies as they grow  
 they spend the vast majority of their lifetime up to two years in this larval form 
 their main goal here like my teenagers
  is to eat and grow  
 and firefly light first originated in these juveniles every single firefly larva can light up even when their adults can 't but what
 's the point to being so conspicuous well we know that these juveniles make
  that help them survive their extended childhood  
 so we think these lights first evolved as a warning 
 a neon sign that says toxic stay away to any would be predators 
 it took many millions of years before these bright lights evolved into a smart communication tool that could be used not just to ward off potential predators but to bring in potential mates  
 driven now by
 sexual selection some adult fireflies like this proud male
 evolved a shiny new glow in the dark lantern
 that would let them take courtship to a whole new level these adults only live a few weeks  and now
  focused on sex that is on propelling their genes into the next firefly generation  
 so we can follow this male out into the field
 as he joins
 hundreds of other males who are all showing off their new courtship signals 
 it 's amazing to think that the luminous displays we admire
 here and in fact everywhere around the world are actually the silent love songs of
  male fireflies they 're flying and flashing their hearts out i still find it very romantic
  but meanwhile where are all the females well
 they 're lounging down below surveying their options  
 they have plenty of males to choose from and these females turn out to be very picky 
 when a female sees a flash
  flash from an especially attractive male she 'll aim her lantern in his direction  and give him a flash back 
 it 's her come hither sign so he flies closer and he flashes again  
 if she still likes him  they 'll strike up a conversation these creatures speak their love in the language of light
  so what exactly do these females consider sexy  
 we decided to conduct some firefly opinion polls to find out 
 when we tested females using blinking led lights we discovered they prefer males who give
  males their sex appeal now we get to see what happens when the lights go out 
 the first thing we discovered is that once a male and female hook up like this they stay together all night long 
 and when we looked inside to see what might be happening  we discovered a surprising new twist to firefly sex  
 while they 're mating the male is busy giving the female not just his sperm
  but also a 
 package called a nuptial gift 
 we can zoom in to look more closely inside this mating pair we can actually see the gift it 's shown here in red
 as it 's being passed from the male to the female what makes this gift so valuable is that it 's packed with protein that the
  female will use to provision her eggs 
 so females are keeping their eyes on this prize as they size up potential mates  
 we discovered that females use male flash signals to try to predict which males have the biggest gifts to offer because this bling helps 
  the female lay more eggs and ultimately launch more of her own offspring
 into the next generation 
 so it 's not all sweetness and light firefly romance is risky 
 for the most part these adult fireflies don 't get eaten because like their juveniles they can manufacture toxins that are repellent to birds and other insectivores
  somewhere along the line one particular group of fireflies somehow lost the metabolic machinery needed to make their own protective toxins 
 this evolutionary flaw  which was discovered by my colleague tom eisner  has driven these fireflies to take their bright lights
 out into the night
 with treacherous intent
  jim lloyd another colleague these females have figured out how to target the males of other firefly species  
 so the hunt begins with the predator she 's shown here in the lower left
 where she 's sitting quietly and eavesdropping on the courtship conversation of her intended prey and here 's how it might go first
  so then he flashes again but this time the predator sneaks in a reply
 that cleverly mimics exactly what the other female just said  
 she 's not looking for love she 's looking for toxins  if she 's
  she can lure this male close enough to reach out and grab him  
 and he 's not just a light snack  over the next hour  she slowly
  this male
 leaving behind just some gory remains  
 unable to make their own toxins these females resort to drinking the blood of other fireflies
  brought to you by natural selection  
 we still have a lot to learn about fireflies  but it looks like many stories will remain untold because around the world firefly populations are blinking out  
  pretty much everywhere the fields and forests  the mangroves and meadows that fireflies need to survive are giving way to development and to sprawl 
 here 's another problem  we 've conquered darkness  but in the process we spill so much extra light out into the night
 that it disrupts the lives of other creatures and fireflies are especially sensitive to light pollution
 because it obscures the signals that they use to find their mates
 do we really need fireflies  after all they 're just one tiny bit of earth 's biodiversity  
 yet every time a species is lost it 's like extinguishing a room full of candles
 one
 by one you might not notice when the first few flames flicker out but in the end you 're left sitting in
  darkness
  as we work together
 to craft a planetary future  i hope we can find a way to keep these bright lights shining  thank you
