  i want to talk with you about is really the problem of how does one
 supply health care
 in a world in which cost is everything  how do you do that and the basic paradigm we want to suggest to you i want to
  suggest to you is
 one in which you say that in order to treat disease  you have to first know what you 're treating  that 's diagnostics and then you have to do something 
 the program we 're involved in is something we call diagnostics for all or zero cost diagnostics how do you provide medically relevant information at as close as possible to zero cost  how do you do it  
 let me just give you two examples
 the rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world poor resources a rigorous environment
 a
 series of problems light weight and things of this kind and also they 're not so different from the home health care and diagnostic system world  
 so the technology i want to talk about is for the third world for the developing world
  but it has i think much broader application  because information is so important in the health care system  
 so you see two examples here one is a lab that is actually a fairly  high end laboratory in africa  
 the second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing 
  a table in a market
  i don 't know what kind of health care is delivered there  but it 's not really what is probably most efficient  what is our
 approach 
 the way in which one typically approaches a problem of lowering cost starting from the perspective of the united states is to take our solution  
 and then try to cut cost out of it  
  how you do that you 're not going to start with a $ one hundred thousand instrument and bring it down to no cost it isn 't going to work 
 so the approach we took was the other way around to ask what is the cheapest possible stuff that you could make a diagnostic system out of and get useful information and add function  
 and what we 've chosen is paper
 what you see here is a prototypic device it 's about a centimeter on the side it 's about the size of a
  the lines around the edges are a polymer it 's made of paper and
 paper of course wicks fluid as you know paper cloth drop wine on the tablecloth  and the wine wicks all over everything
  put it on your shirt it ruins the shirt that 's what
 a hydrophilic surface does so in this device the idea is that you drip the bottom end of it in a
 drop of in this case urine  
 the fluid wicks its way into those chambers at the top  the brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine  
 the blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine  and the combination of those two is a first order shot at a number of useful things that you want 
 so this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper now how simple can you make the production
  why do we choose paper 
 there 's an example of the same thing on a finger showing you basically what it looks like one reason for using paper is that it 's everywhere we have made these kinds of 
  devices using napkins and toilet paper and wraps and all kinds of stuff 
  'll show you in a moment
 that the stack of paper there would probably hold something like one hundred thousand tests something of that kind  
 and then finally a point you don 't think of so much in developed world medicine 
 it eliminates sharps  and what sharps means is needles things that stick if you 've taken a sample of someone 's blood
 and the someone might have hepatitis c  you don 't want to make a mistake and stick it in
  you don 't want to do that so how do you dispose of that it 's a problem everywhere and here you simply burn it  so it 's a sort of a practical approach to starting on things 
 now you say if paper is a good idea 
 other people have surely thought of it and the answer is of course yes  
 those half of you roughly who are women at some point may have had a pregnancy test  and the
 most common of these is in a device that looks like
  thing on the left it 's something called a lateral flow immunoassay 
 in that particular test urine  either containing a hormone called hcg does or does not flow across a piece of paper 
 and there are two bars one bar indicates that the test is working  and if the second bar shows up you 're pregnant 
 this is a terrific
 kind of test in a binary world and the nice thing about pregnancy is either you are pregnant or you 're not pregnant you 're not partially pregnant or thinking about being pregnant or something of that sort  
 so it works very well there but it doesn 't work very well when you need more quantitative information 
 there are also dipsticks  but if you look at the dipsticks they 're for another kind of urine analysis  there are an awful lot of colors and things like that what do you actually do about that in a difficult circumstance  
 so the approach
 we started with is to ask is it really practical to make things of this sort  
 and that problem is now in a purely engineering way solved  
 and the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper  you run it through a new kind of printer called a wax printer  
 the wax printer does what looks like printing
  you put that on you warm it a little bit the wax prints through so it absorbs into the paper and you end up with the device you want 
 the printers cost eight hundred bucks now
 we estimate that if you were to run them twenty four hours a day they 'd make about ten million tests a year  so it 's a solved problem  that particular problem is solved 
 and there is an example of the kind of thing that you see that 's on a piece of eight by twelve
  that takes about two seconds to make and so i regard that as done 
 there 's a very important issue here  which is that because it 's a printer 
 a color printer it prints colors that 's what color printers do i 'll show you in a moment that 's actually quite useful 
 now the next question that you would like to ask is what would you like to measure  what would you like to analyze  
 and the thing you 'd most like to analyze we 're a fair distance from it 's what 's called fever of
 undiagnosed origin someone comes into the clinic they have a fever they feel bad  what do they have do they have tb do they have aids do they have a common cold 
 the triage problem  that 's a hard problem for reasons i won 't go through there are an awful lot of things that you 'd like to distinguish among  
 but then there are a series of things aids
  such as guidance of treatment  now even that 's more complicated than you think a friend of mine works in 
  psychiatry  and he is interested in the question of why people do and don 't take their meds  
 so dapsone or something like that you have to take for a while he has a wonderful story of talking to a villager
  what the guy actually meant was that he 'd fed a 30 day dose of dapsone to his dog that morning and he
 was telling the truth  because in a different culture
 the dog is a surrogate for you today this month since the rainy season there are lots of
  and so an issue here is to in some cases figure out how to deal with matters that seem uninteresting like compliance 
 now  take a look at what a typical test looks like 
 prick a finger  you get some blood about fifty microliters that 's about all you 're going to get because you can 't use
 the usual sort of
  you can 't manipulate it very well i 'll show something about that in a moment  so you take the drop of blood no further manipulations you put it on a little device 
 the device filters out the blood cells lets the serum go through and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there 
 and the colors
 indicate
  suffering from probably an excess of education what do you do about something which requires quantitative analysis  
 and so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there 
 and at this point there is a dramatic flourish and out comes the universal solution to everything these days which is a cell phone in this particular case a camera phone 
 they 're everywhere
 six billion a month in india
  and the idea is that what one does is to
 take the device you dip it  you develop the color you take a picture the picture goes to a central laboratory you don 't have to send out a doctor  you send out somebody who can just take the sample 
 and in the clinic either a doctor or ideally a computer in this case does the
  turns out to work actually quite well  particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work 
 so my view of the health care worker of the future is not a doctor  but an 18 year old otherwise unemployed who has two things a backpack full of these tests and a lancet to occasionally take a blood sample  and 
  and these are the things that get him through his day 
 there 's another very interesting connection here  and that is
  that what one wants to do is pass through
 useful information over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system 
 it turns out there 's an enormous amount of information already available on that subject which is the mars rover problem  how do you get back an accurate view of the color on mars if you have a really
  terrible bandwidth to do it with 
 and the answer is not complicated but it 's one which i don 't want to go through here  other than to say that the communication systems for doing this are really pretty well understood  
 also a fact which you may not know
 is that the compute capability of this thing is not so different from the compute capability of your desktop computer this is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped 
 i don 't know whether the idea of one computer one child makes any sense
  computer of the future because this screen is already there and they 're ubiquitous 
 all right let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices and we 'll start by posing a little problem 
 what you see here is another centimeter sized device  
 and the different colors are different colors of dye  
 and you notice something which might strike you as a little bit interesting which is the yellow seems to disappear
 get through the blue and then get through the red how does that happen how do you make something flow through something 
 and of course the answer is you don 't you make it flow under and over but now the question is how do you make it flow under and over in a piece of paper
 the answer is that what you do and the details are not terribly important here
 is to make something more elaborate you take several different layers of paper
  each one containing its own little fluid system  
 and you separate them by pieces of literally double sided carpet tape  the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor  
 and the fluid will flow from one layer into the next  it distributes itself flows through further holes distributes itself  and what you see at the lower
  side there is a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top  
 and it has gone through and distributed itself into these sixteen holes on the bottom in a piece of paper basically it looks like a chip two pieces of paper thick  
 and in this particular case we were just interested in the replicability of that but that is in principle the way you solve the fever of
  because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease  
 and this will work in due course 
 here is an example of a slightly more complicated device 
 there 's the chip  you dip in a corner  the fluid goes into the center  it distributes itself out into these various wells or holes and turns color
 all done with paper and carpet tape
  as we 're likely to be able to come up and make things 
 now i have two last little stories to tell you in finishing off this business 
 this is one one of the things you occasionally need to do is separate blood cells from serum  
 and the question was here we do it by taking a sample we put it in a
  you get blood cells out terrific what happens if you don 't have electricity a centrifuge and whatever  
 and we thought for a while of how you might do this and the way in fact you do it is what 's shown here you get an eggbeater 
 which is everywhere  and you saw off a blade  and then you take tubing and you stick it on that you put the blood in somebody sits there and spins it it works really really well  and we sat down we did the physics of eggbeaters and
  tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing and sent it off to a journal we were very proud of this particularly the title which was eggbeater as centrifuge 
 and we sent it off and by return mail it came back i called up the editor and i said what 's going on how is this possible the editor said 
 with enormous disdain i read this  and we 're not going to publish it because we only publish science
 laughter and it 's an important issue because it means that
 we have to as a society think about what we value and if it 's just papers and phys rev letters we 've got a problem
  here is another example of something which is
 this is a little spectrophotometer  it measures the absorption
  light in a sample  the neat thing about this is you have a light source that flickers on and off at about one thousand hertz 
 another light source that detects that light at one thousand hertz  and so you can run this system in broad daylight 
 it performs about equivalently to a system that 's on the order of
 one hundred thousand dollars  it costs fifty dollars  we can probably make it for fifty cents if we put our mind to it  why doesn 't somebody do it 
 the answer is how do you make a profit in a capitalist system
  doing that interesting problem  so let me finish by saying that
 we 've thought about this as a kind of engineering problem 
 and we 've asked what is the scientific unifying idea here  and we 've decided we should think about this not so much in terms of cost but in terms of simplicity 
 simplicity is a neat word you 've got to think about what simplicity means
 i know what it is but i don 't actually know what it means so i actually was interested enough in this to put together
 several groups of people the most recent involved a couple of people at mit one of them being an exceptionally bright kid who is
 one of the very few people i would think of who 's an authentic genius we all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity and i want to give you the answer of
  this deep scientific thought
