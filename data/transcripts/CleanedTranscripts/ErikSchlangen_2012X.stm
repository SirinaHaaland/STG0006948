  ha
  you probably all agree with me that
 this is a very nice road it 's made of asphalt  and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on  but not always
  especially not on these days as today when it 's raining a lot 
 then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt  and especially if you then ride with your bicycle  and pass these cars  then
 that 's not very nice 
 also asphalt can create a lot of noise it 's a noisy material  
 and if we produce roads like in the netherlands very close to cities then we would like a silent road 
 the solution for that is to make
 roads out of porous asphalt
  porous asphalt a material that we use now in
 most of the highways in the netherlands  
 it has pores and water can just rain through it 
 so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides  and you have a road that 's easy to drive on  so no splash water anymore 
 also the noise will disappear in these pores because it 's very hollow all the noise will disappear so it 's a very silent road 
  has disadvantages of course  and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur what is raveling you see that in this road
 that the stones at the surface come off  first you get one stone  
 then several more and more and more and more and more and then they
  not happy with that  and finally this raveling can also lead to more and more damage  sometimes you can create potholes with that ha he
 's ready  
 potholes of course that can become a problem but we have a solution here you see actually how the damage appears
  in this material it 's a porous asphalt like i said so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones 
 due to weathering  due to u v light due to oxidation 
 this binder this bitumen the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink  
 and if it shrinks it gets micro cracks and it delaminates from the aggregates  then if you drive over the road you take out the aggregates what we just saw here 
 to solve this
  if we can make this material self healing 
 then probably we have a solution  
 so what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans  
 and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen  
 so then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it 
  then you need a machine like you see here that you can use for cooking an
 induction machine 
 induction can heat especially steel it 's very good at that 
 then what you do is you heat up the steel you melt the bitumen  and the bitumen will flow into these micro cracks and
 the stones are again fixed to the surface 
 today i use a microwave because i cannot
 take the big induction
  microwave is a similar system  so i put the specimen in  which i 'm now going to take out to see what happened  
 so this is the specimen coming out now  so i said we have we have such an industrial
 machine in the lab to heat up the the specimens we tested a lot of specimens there  and then the government they actually saw our
  that 's very interesting we have to try that so they donated to us a piece of highway four hundred meters of the 
  had to make a test track to test this material  so that 's what we did here you see where we were making the test road 
 and then of course this road will last several years without any damage that 's what we know from practice  
 so we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab so we did
 aging on the samples did a lot of loading on it healed them with our induction machine  and
 healed them and tested them again several times we can repeat that  
 so actually the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years
 with our healing machine this is the big version we have made to go on the real road if we go on the road every four years we can
 double the surface life
 of this road which of course saves a lot of money well to conclude i can say that we made a material
 using steel fibers the addition of steel fibers  using induction energy
 to really increase the surface life of the road double the surface life you can even do so it will
  really save a lot of money with very simple tricks
