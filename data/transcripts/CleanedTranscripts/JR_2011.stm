  my studio in paris  and the phone rang
 and i heard hey jr  you won the ted prize two thousand and eleven  you have to make a wish to save the world 
 i was lost  i mean  i can 't save the world  nobody can
  up come on you have dictators
 ruling the world  population is growing by millions  there 's no more fish in the sea  the north pole is melting
 and as the last ted prize winner said we 're all becoming fat 
 except maybe french people whatever 
  the ted guys i just won 't show up  i can 't do anything to save the world she said hey jr your wish is not to save the world  but to change the
  the world
  i started when i was fifteen years old  and at that time  i was not thinking about changing the world  i was doing graffiti
 writing my name everywhere using the city as a canvas  
 i was going in the tunnels of paris  on the rooftops with my friends each trip was an excursion was an adventure
  was like leaving our mark on society to say i was here on the top of a building  
 so when i found a cheap camera on the subway  i started documenting those adventures with my friends
 and gave them back as photocopies really small photos just that size
  at seventeen years old i started pasting them and i did my first expo de rue which means sidewalk gallery and i framed it
 with color so you would not confuse it with advertising  
 i mean  the city 's the best gallery i could imagine i would never have to make a book
  then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was
 nice enough to show it to people i would control it directly with the public
 in the streets  so that 's paris  i would change
  the places i would go the title of the of the exhibition that 's on the champs elysees i was quite proud of that one because i was just eighteen and i was just
 up there on the top of the champs elysees then when the photo left
  still there 
 november two thousand and five the streets are burning a large wave of riots
 had broken into the first projects of paris  everyone was glued to the tv watching
 disturbing frightening images
 taken from the edge of the neighborhood  
 i mean these kids without control
 throwing molotov cocktails 
 attacking the cops and the firemen looting everything they could in the shops these were criminals  thugs dangerous  
 destroying their own environment  
 and then i saw it could it be possible my photo
 on a wall
 revealed by a burning car a pasting i 'd done a year earlier
 an illegal one still there  i mean  these were the faces of my friends 
 i know those guys all of them are not angels but they 're not monsters either 
 so it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television  so i went back there
  it was the only one i had at that time but with that lens  you have to be as close as ten inches from the person so you can do it only with their trust  
 so i took full portraits of people from le bosquet  they were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves
  and then i pasted
 huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of paris with the name  age even building number
 of these guys 
 a year later  the exhibition was displayed in front of the
  city hall of paris  
 and we go from thug images who 've been stolen and distorted by the media who 's now proudly taking over his own image  
 that 's where i realized the power of paper and glue  
 so could art change the world
 a year later  i was listening to all the noise
 about the middle east conflict  i mean at that time  trust me they were only referring to the israeli and palestinian conflict  so with my friend marco we decided to go there
 and see who are the real palestinians and who are the real israelis  are they so different 
  we got there  we just went in the street started talking with people
 everywhere  and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media  so we decided to take portraits
 of palestinians and israelis doing the same jobs taxi driver lawyer  cooks 
 asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment not a smile that really doesn 't tell about who you are and what you feel 
 they all accepted to be pasted
  next to the other  i decided to paste in eight israeli and palestinian cities
 and on both sides of the wall we launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever we called the project face two face 
 the experts said no way
  the people will not accept the army will shoot you and hamas will kidnap you we said okay let 's try and push as far as we can 
 i love the way that people will ask me how big will my photo be it will be as big as your house 
 when we did the wall we did the palestinian side so we arrived with just our ladders and we realized that they were not high enough  and so palestinians
  i 'm going to find you a solution so he went to the church of nativity
 and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being born 
 we did face two face with only six friends two ladders two brushes 
 a rented car a camera and twenty thousand square feet of paper  
 we had all sorts of help from all walks of life
 okay for example that 's palestine we 're in ramallah right now we 're pasting portraits so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market people come around us
 and start asking what are you doing here oh we 're actually doing an art project and we are pasting an israeli and a palestinian doing the same job and those
  and then there was always a silence 
 you mean you 're pasting an israeli face doing a face right here well yeah yeah that 's part of the project 
 and i would always leave that moment and we would ask them so can you tell me who is who and most of them
 couldn 't say
  military towers and nothing happened
 when you paste an image it 's just paper and glue  people can tear it tag on it or even pee on it some are a bit high for that i agree but
 the people in the street 
 the rain and the wind will take them off anyway  they are not meant to stay but exactly four years after the photos  most of them are still there
  face two face demonstrated that what we thought impossible
 was possible and you know what even easy  we didn 't push the limit we just showed that they were further
 than anyone thought 
 in the middle east i experienced my work in places 
 so the reactions in the street
  so i decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums
 when you go in these developing societies women are the pillars of their community  
 but the men are still the ones holding the streets so we were inspired
 to create a project where men
 will pay tribute to women by posting their photos
  i called that project women are heroes  
 when i listened to all the stories everywhere i went on the continents i couldn 't always understand the complicated circumstances
 of their conflict  i just
 observed  sometimes there was no words no sentence just tears  
 i just took their pictures
  and pasted them
  women are heroes took me around the world  
 most of the places i went to i decided to go there because i 've heard about it
 through the media  so for example in june two thousand and eight i was watching tv in paris  and then i heard about this terrible thing that happened in rio de
  the first favela of brazil named providencia three kids that was three students
 were [ detained ] by the army
 because they were not carrying their papers  and the army took them and instead of bringing them to the police station 
 they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces  
 i was shocked  all brazil was shocked  
  i heard it was one of the most violent favelas because the largest drug cartel controls it 
 so i decided to go there 
 when i arrived i mean  
 i didn 't have any contact with any ngo there was none in place no association no ngos nothing no eyewitnesses  
 so we just walked around  and we met a woman 
 and i showed her my book 
  so i went out and i started with the kids  
 i just took a few photos of the kids and the next day i came with the posters and we pasted them the day after i came back and they were already scratched
  but that 's okay  i wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them  
 then the next
  i held a meeting on the main square and some women came they were all linked
 to the three kids
 that got killed there was the mother the grandmother the best friend they all wanted to shout the story
 after that day  everyone in the favela gave me the green light i took more photos and we started the project
  the drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place so
  filming the violence and the weapons you see that enough in the media  what i want to show is the incredible life and energy i 've been
 seeing it around me the last few days 
 so that 's a really symbolic pasting because that 's the first one we did that you couldn 't see from the city  and that 's where the three kids got arrested  
 and that 's the grandmother of one of them and on that stairs  that 's where the traffickers always stand and
  of exchange of fire  everyone there understood the project 
 and then we pasted everywhere the whole hill 
 what was interesting is that the media couldn 't get
  i mean you should see that they would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter
 and then have a really long lens  and we would see ourselves on tv pasting and they would put a number please call this number if you know what 's going on in providencia 
 we just did a project and then left
 so the media wouldn 't know so how can we know about the project so they had to go and find the women
 and get an explanation from
  so you create a bridge between the media and the anonymous women
  we kept traveling  we went to africa sudan sierra leone liberia  kenya 
 in war torn places like monrovia people come straight to you  i mean they want to know what you 're up to 
 they kept asking me what is the purpose of your project 
 are you an ngo are you the media 
 art just
  why is it in black and white don 't you have color in france or
 they tell you are these people all dead some who understood the project would explain it to others 
 and to a man who did not understand i heard someone say you know you 've been here for a few hours trying to understand discussing with your fellows 
 during that time  you haven 't thought about
  i think it 's people 's curiosity that
 motivates them to come into the projects and then it becomes more it becomes
 a desire a need an armor on this bridge that 's in
 monrovia  ex rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait of a woman that might have been raped during the war women are always the first
  during conflict  
 this is kibera  kenya one of the largest slums of africa  
 you might have seen images about the post election violence that happened there in two thousand and eight
 this time we covered the roofs of the houses  but we didn 't use paper   because
 paper doesn 't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house vinyl
  does then art becomes useful  so the people kept it you know what i love is for example when you see the biggest eye there there are so [ many ] houses inside 
 and i went there a few months ago photos are still there
 and it was missing a piece of the eye so i asked the people what happened
 woman said as a joke now god can see me  when you look at kibera now they look back  
 okay  india 
 before i start that just so you know each time we go to a place we don 't have authorization so we set up like commandos we 're a group of friends who arrive there and we try to paste on the walls  but there are places where you
  on a wall in india it was just impossible to paste i heard
 culturally and and because of the law they would just arrest us at the first pasting  
 so we decided to paste white white on the walls so imagine white guys pasting white papers  so people would come to us and ask us
  but you know how india has a lot of dust in the streets and the more dust you would have
 going up in the air on the white paper you can almost see but
 there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker  
 so the more dust you have the more it will reveal the photo so we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves
 so we 
  get caught this time  
 each project that 's a film from women are heroes
  most of what you see that 's a trailer from women are heroes 
  kept traveling even without us
 wind
  of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos  because that 's a big part of it there 's layers behind each photo behind each image is a story 
 women are heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities and the women kept that dynamic after we left
  example we did books not for sale that all the community would get  but to get it they would have
 to [ get ] it signed by one of the women 
 we did that in most of the places we go back regularly  and so in in providencia for example in the favela we have a cultural center running there in kibera each year we cover more roofs because of course when we left the
  what about my roof so we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project a
 really important point for me is that i don 't use any brand or corporate sponsors  
 so i have no responsibility to anyone but myself
 and the subjects 
  that is for me one of the more important things in the work
 i think today as important as the result is the way you do things and that has always been a central part of the work 
 and what 's interesting is that that fine line that i have with images and advertising we just did some pasting in los angeles on another project in the last weeks and
 i was even invited to cover the moca museum  but yesterday the city called them and said look you 're going to have to tear it down
 because this can be taken for advertising and because of the law it has to be taken down but tell me advertising for what 
 the people i photograph were proud to participate in the project
 and to have their photo in the community but they asked me for a promise basically they asked me please make our story travel with you 
 so i did that 's paris
  that 's rio in each place we built exhibitions with a story and the story traveled you understand the the full scope of the project  that 's london  
 new york
  and today  they are with you in long beach all right recently i started a public art project  where
  don 't use my artwork anymore  
 i use man ray helen levitt  
 giacomelli other people 's artwork it doesn 't matter today if it 's your photo or not the importance is what you do with the images  
 the statement it makes where it 's pasted 
 so for example i pasted the photo of the minaret
 in switzerland
 a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding
  this image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in
 chernobyl originally and i pasted it in southern italy where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground 
 in some ways art can change the world  art is not supposed to change the world  to change practical things but to change perceptions
  can change the way we see the world  art can create an analogy actually the fact that art cannot change
 things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions  and then enables you to change the world  
 when i do my work i have two kinds
  why don 't you go in iraq or afghanistan they would be really useful or how can we help 
 i presume that you belong to the second category  and that 's good because
 for that project  i 'm going to ask you to take the photos and paste them  so now my wish is
  to stand up for what you care about
 by participating in a global art project and together we 'll turn the world
 inside out and this starts right now  yes  everyone in the room  everyone watching 
 i wanted that wish to actually start now
  a subject you 're passionate about a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos tell me what you stand for 
 take the photos the portraits upload it i 'll give you all the details
 and i 'll send you back your poster  join by groups
 and reveal things to the world the full data is on the website
 what we see changes who we are when we act together the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts  
 so i hope that together we 'll create something that the world will remember  and this starts right now and depends on you  thank you
