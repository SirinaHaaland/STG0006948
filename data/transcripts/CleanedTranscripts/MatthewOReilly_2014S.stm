  i 've been a critical care emt for the past seven years in suffolk county new york  i 've been a first responder in a number of incidents ranging from car accidents to hurricane sandy 
 if you are like most people death might be one of your greatest fears  some of us will see it coming  some of us won
  medical term called impending doom it
 's almost a symptom 
 as a medical provider i 'm trained to respond to this symptom like any other so when a patient having a heart attack looks at me and says i 'm going to die today 
 we are trained to reevaluate the patient 's condition  
 throughout my career  i have responded to a number of incidents where the patient had minutes
  left to live
 and there was nothing i could do for them with this i was faced with a dilemma do i tell the dying
 that they are about to face death or do i lie to them to comfort them 
 early in my career  i faced this dilemma by simply lying  i was afraid  
 i was afraid if i told them the truth  that they would die in terror in fear  just grasping for those last moments of life 
 that all changed with one incident
 five years ago i responded to a motorcycle accident the rider had suffered critical critical injuries  
 as i assessed him  i realized that there was nothing that could be done for him 
 and like so many other cases  he looked me in the eye and asked that question am i going to die 
 in that moment  i decided to do something different  i decided to tell him the truth
  i decided to tell him that he was going to die
 and that there was nothing i could do for him 
 his reaction shocked me to this day  
 he simply laid back and had a look of acceptance on his face he was not met with that terror or fear that i thought he would be 
 he simply laid there and as i looked into his eyes i saw inner peace and acceptance
  from that moment forward i decided it was not my place to comfort the dying with my lies 
 having responded to many cases since then where patients were
 in their last moments and there was nothing i could do for them in almost every case they have all had the same reaction to the truth of inner peace and acceptance
  in fact there are three patterns i have observed in all these cases the first pattern
 always kind of shocked me  regardless of religious belief
 or cultural background there 's a need for forgiveness  whether they call it sin
 or they simply say they have a regret their guilt is universal  
 i had once cared for an elderly gentleman who was having a massive heart attack as i prepared myself and
  my equipment for his imminent cardiac arrest  
 i began to tell the patient of his imminent demise  
 he already knew by my tone of voice and body language  
 as i placed the defibrillator pads on his chest  prepping for what was going to happen 
 he looked me in the eye and said i wish i had spent more time with my children and grandchildren instead of being selfish with my time 
 faced with imminent death
  death all he wanted was forgiveness  
 the second pattern i observe is the need for remembrance  
 whether it was to be remembered in my thoughts or their loved ones ' they needed to feel that they would be
 living on there 's a need for immortality within the hearts and thoughts of their loved ones myself my crew or anyone around  
 countless times  i have had a patient look me
  eyes and say will you remember me the final pattern i observe
 always touched me the deepest to the soul the dying need to know that their life had meaning 
 they need to know that they did not waste their life on meaningless tasks 
 this came to me
  early in my career  
 i had responded to a call there was a female in her late  50s severely pinned within a vehicle  
 she had been  t boned at a high rate of speed  
 critical critical condition  as the fire department worked to remove her from the car i climbed in to begin to render care 
 as we talked she had said to me there was so much more i wanted to do with my life she had felt she had not left her mark on this earth
  as we talked further it would turn out that she was a mother of two adopted children who were both on their way to medical school because of her two children
 had a chance they never would have had otherwise and would go on to save lives in the medical field as medical doctors  
 it would end up taking forty five minutes to free her from the
  she perished prior to freeing her  
 i believed what you saw in the movies when you 're in those last moments that it 's strictly terror fear  
 i have come to realize  regardless of the circumstance it 's generally met with peace and acceptance 
 that it 's the littlest things the littlest moments the littlest
 things you brought into the world that give you peace in those final moments
