  want to help you re perceive what philanthropy is what it could be 
 and what your relationship to it is and in doing that i want to offer you a vision an imagined future if
  of how as
 the poet seamus heaney has put it once in a lifetime the longed for tidal wave of justice can rise up 
 and hope and history rhyme 
 i want to start with
 these word pairs here we all know which side of these we 'd like to be on when philanthropy was reinvented a
  when the foundation form was actually invented 
 they didn 't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either 
 in fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways as slow to respond to new challenges as small and risk averse and in fact they weren 't they were reinventing charity in those times what rockefeller called the
 business of benevolence but by the end of the 20th
  a new generation of critics and reformers
 had come to see philanthropy just this way  
 the thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about and that 's exactly what is happening
 is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected in service of the long term this entrepreneurial energy
  is emerging from many quarters  and it 's driven and propelled forward by new leaders like many of the people here by new tools like the ones we 've seen here and by new pressures 
 i 've been following this change for quite a while now and participating in it this report is our main public report what it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as one hundred years ago  
 what i want to do is share some of the coolest things that are going on
  as i do that i 'm not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about
 the gates or the soros or the google instead  what i want to do is talk about the philanthropy
 of all of us the democratization of philanthropy this is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time  
 what i 'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments each of which challenges an old assumption
 of philanthropy 
 the first is mass collaboration represented here by wikipedia now this may surprise you but remember 
 philanthropy is about giving of time and talent not just money  
 clay shirky that great chronicler of everything networked has captured the assumption that this
  challenges in such a beautiful way 
 he said we have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money now we have wikipedia  
 suddenly big things can be done for love 
 watch this spring 
 for paul hawken 's new book author and entrepreneur many of you may know about the book is called blessed unrest 
 and when it comes out a series of wiki sites under the label wiser are going to launch at the same time wiser stands for world index for social and environmental responsibility
  wiser sets out to document link and empower what paul calls the largest movement and fastest growing movement in human history 
 humanity 's collective immune response to today 's threats 
 now all of these
 big things for love experiments aren 't going to take off but the ones that do are going to be the biggest the most open the fastest the most connected form of
  philanthropy
 in human history 
 second category is online philanthropy marketplaces this is of course to philanthropy what ebay and amazon are to commerce think of it 
  philanthropy  and this challenges yet another assumption which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very
  omidyar network has
 made a big investment in donorschoose it 's one of the best known of these new marketplaces where a donor can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need 
 take a look at changing the present started by a tedster next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present giveindia is for a whole country and it goes on and on 
 the third category is represented by warren buffet 
 which i call aggregated giving it 's not just that warren buffet was so
  amazingly generous in that historic act last summer it 's that he challenged another assumption that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation 
 there are now today so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing bringing together people
 around a common goal to think bigger one of the best known is acumen fund led by jacqueline novogratz a tedster who got
  boost here at ted
 but there are many others new profit in cambridge new school 's venture fund in silicon valley venture philanthropy partners in washington 
 global fund for women in san francisco take a look at these these funds are to philanthropy
 what
 venture capital private
  eventually mutual funds are to investing  but with a twist
 because often a community forms around these these funds as it has at acumen and other places  
 now imagine for a second these first three
 types of experiments mass collaboration online marketplaces aggregated giving and
 understand how
  what organized philanthropy is it 's not about foundations necessarily it 's about the rest of us and imagine
 the mash up if you will of these things in the future when these things come together in the experiments of the future imagine that somebody puts up  
 say one hundred million dollars
 for an inspiring goal there were twenty one gifts of one hundred million dollars or more in the us last year not out of the question
 but only puts it up if it 's matched by millions of
  gifts from around the globe thereby engaging lots of people and building visibility and engaging people in the goal that 's stated 
 i 'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories which are innovation competitions and social investing  
 they 're betting a visible competition a prize can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues and thereby speed the solution
  this tackles yet another assumption that the giver and the organization is at the center as opposed to putting the problem at the center 
 you can look to these innovators
 to
 help us especially with things that require technological or scientific solution that leaves
 the final category social investing which is really anyway the biggest of them all  represented here by
 xigi net and
 this of course tackles the biggest assumption of all that business is business and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world 
 xigi is a new community site
  that 's built by the community linking and mapping this new social capital market it lists already one thousand entities
 that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise
 so we can look to these innovators to help us
 remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that seeks a return the good that can be driven
 could be astonishing  
 now  what 's really interesting here
 is that we 're not
 thinking our way into a new way of acting
  we 're acting our way into a new way of thinking 
 philanthropy is reorganizing itself before our very eyes 
 and even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers don 't yet fulfill this aspiration i think this is the new zeitgeist 
 open big fast connected 
 and let us also hope long we have got to realize that it is going to take a long time
  do these things if we don 't develop the stamina to stick with things whatever it is you pick stick with it all of this stuff is just going to be you know 
 a fad  
 but i 'm really hopeful and i 'm hopeful because it 's not only philanthropy that 's reorganizing itself it 's also whole other portions of the social sector
  and of business that are busy
 challenging business as usual and everywhere i go  including here at ted i feel that there is a new moral hunger
 that is growing what we 're seeing is people really wrestling to describe what is this new thing that 's happening words like
  it 's new it 's beginning  and i think it 's gong to quite significant 
 and that 's where my imagined future comes in which i am going to call the social singularity 
 many of you will realize that i 'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer vernor vinge 's notion of a technological singularity where a number of trends accelerate
  and converge and come together to create really a shockingly new reality it may be
 that the social singularity ahead
 is the one that we fear the most 
 a convergence of catastrophes of environmental degradation of weapons of mass destruction of pandemics of poverty 
 that 's because
 our ability to confront the problems that we face has
  not kept pace with our ability to create them and as we 've heard here it is no exaggeration to say
 that
 we hold the future of our civilization in our hands as never before the
 question is is there a positive social singularity is there a frontier
 for us of how we live together 
 our future doesn 't have to be imagined we can create a future where hope and history rhyme but
 we have a problem
 our experience to date  
 both individually and collectively hasn 't prepared us for what we 're going to need to do or who we 're going to need to be we
 are going to need
 a new generation of citizen leaders
 willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing
  learning as rapidly as possible that 's why i have one last thing i want to show you
  i want to show you
