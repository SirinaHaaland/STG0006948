  guatemala is recovering from a 36 year armed conflict a conflict that was fought during the cold war it was really just
 a small leftist insurgency and a devastating response by the state
  what we have as a result is two hundred thousand civilian victims one hundred and sixty thousand of those killed in the communities small children men women the elderly even 
 and then we have about forty thousand others  the missing  the ones we 're still looking for today we call them
 now eighty three percent of the victims are mayan victims victims
 that are the descendants of the original inhabitants of central america and only about seventeen percent are of european
  descent but
 the most important thing here is that the very people who are supposed to defend us 
 the police the military are the ones that committed most of the crimes 
 now the families they want information they want to know what happened they want the bodies of their loved ones  
 but most of all what they want is they want you they want everyone to know
  that their loved ones did nothing wrong 
 now my case was that my father received death threats
 in one thousand nine hundred and eighty and we left we left guatemala and we came here  so i grew up in new york i grew up in brooklyn as a matter of fact and i went to new utrecht high school
 and i graduated from brooklyn college  the only thing was that i really didn 't know what was happening in guatemala i didn
  care for it it was too painful  but it wasn 't 
  decided to
 do something about it  so i went back i went back to guatemala 
 to look for the bodies to understand what happened and to look for part of myself as well  
 the way we work is that we give people information
  we talk to the family members and we let them choose 
 we let them decide to tell us the stories to tell us what they saw to tell us about their loved ones  and even more important we let them choose
 to give us a piece of themselves 
 a piece an essence of who they are and that dna is what we 're going to compare to the dna that comes from the skeletons 
 while we 're doing that though  we 're looking for the bodies and these are skeletons by now most of these crimes happened
 when we find the grave  we take out the dirt and eventually clean the body  document it and exhume it  we literally bring the skeleton out of the ground  
 once we have those bodies though we take them back to the city to our lab  and we begin a process of trying to understand mainly two things one is how people died  
 so here you see a gunshot wound to the back of the head
 or a machete wound for example
  the other thing we want to understand is who they are  whether it 's a baby 
 or an adult  whether it 's a woman or a man  
 but when we 're done with that analysis what we 'll do is we 'll take a small fragment of the bone and we 'll extract dna from it we
 'll take that dna and then we 'll compare it with the dna of the families
  way to explain this to you is by showing you two cases the first is the case of the military diary  now this is a document that was smuggled out of somewhere in one thousand nine hundred
 and ninety nine and what you see there is the state following individuals people that like you wanted to change their country  
 and they
  of the things that they wrote down is when they executed them inside that yellow rectangle you see a code it 's a secret code three hundred 
 and then you see a date the three hundred means executed and the date means when they were executed  now that 's going to come into play in a second 
 what we did is we conducted an exhumation in two thousand and three where we exhumed two hundred and twenty
  in a military base 
 grave nine though matched the family of sergio saul linares now sergio was a professor at the university 
 he graduted from iowa state university and went back to guatemala to change his country  
 and he was captured on february 
 and if you can see there he was executed on march twenty nine one thousand nine hundred and eighty four which was
  we had the body we had the family 's information and their dna and now we have documents that told us exactly what happened  
 but most important is about two weeks later  we go another hit  another match from the same grave
 the dna of that body also matched the dna of that family 
 and then we noticed that he was also in the diary  but it was amazing to see that he was also executed on march
  think hmm how many bodies were in the grave  six so then we said how many people
 were executed on
 march twenty nine one thousand nine hundred and eighty four that 's right six
 as well  so we have juan de dios  hugo  moises
  all of them executed on the same date  all captured at different locations and at different moments 
 all put in that grave  the only thing we needed now was the dna of those four families so we went
 and we looked for them
 and we found them and we identified those six bodies
 and gave them back to the families  the other case i want to tell you about is that of a military base
 called
  to believe in peace but the acronym really means regional command center for peacekeeping operations and this is where the guatemalan military
 trains peacekeepers from other countries the ones that serve with the u n 
 and go to countries like haiti and the congo 
 well  we have testimony that said that within this military base there were bodies there were graves  
 so we went in there with a search warrant and about two hours after we went in we found the first of
 eighty four graves a total of five hundred and thirty three bodies  now if you think about that 
 peacekeepers being trained on top of bodies it 's very ironic  
 but the bodies
 face down most of them hands tied behind their backs  blindfolded all types of trauma these were people who were defenseless who were being executed people
 that five hundred and thirty three families are looking for 
 so we 're going to focus on grave fifteen grave fifteen what we noticed was a grave full of women and children sixty three of them 
 and that immediately made us think  my goodness where is there a case like this when i got to guatemala in one thousand nine 
  i heard of a case of a massacre that happened on may fourteen
 eighty two where the army came in killed the men  and took the women and children in helicopters to an unknown location well 
 guess what the clothing from this grave matched
 the clothing from the region where these people were taken from where these women and children were taken from  
 so we conducted some dna analysis and guess what we identified martina rojas and manuel chen  both of them disappeared in that case
  we could prove it we have physical evidence that proves that this happened and that those people were taken to this base 
 now manuel chen was three years old his mother went to
 to the river to wash clothes and she left him with a neighbor 
 that 's when the army came and that 's when he was taken away in a helicopter and never seen again until we found him in grave fifteen  so now with science
  with archaeology with anthropology with genetics what we 're doing is we 're giving a voice to the voiceless  
 but we 're doing more than that we 're actually providing evidence for trials 
 like the genocide trial that happened last year in guatemala where general ros montt was found guilty of genocide and sentenced to eighty years  
 so i came here to tell you today that this is happening everywhere it 's happening in mexico right in front of us today and we
  't let it go on anymore we have to now
 come together and decide that we 're not going to have any more missing  so no more missing guys okay no more missing  thank you
