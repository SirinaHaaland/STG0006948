  my journey to become a polar specialist photographing specializing in the polar regions began
 when i was four years old  when my family moved from southern canada to northern baffin island up by greenland there we lived with the inuit in the tiny inuit community of two hundred inuit
  people where [ we ] were one of three non inuit families  and in this community we didn 't have a television we didn 't have computers obviously  
 radio we didn 't even have a telephone all of my time was spent
 outside with the inuit playing the snow and the ice were my sandbox and the inuit were my teachers and that 's where i became truly obsessed with this polar realm and i knew someday that i was going to do
  something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it 
 i 'd like to share with you for just two minutes only some images a cross section of my work to the beautiful music by brandi carlile have you ever i don 't know why national geographic has done this  they 've never done this before 
 but they 're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that i 've just completed that is not published yet national
  geographic doesn 't do this so i 'm very excited to be able to share this with you  and what these images are you 'll see them at the start of the slide show there 's only about four images but it 's of a little bear that lives 
  in the great bear rainforest it 's pure white but it 's not a polar bear it 's a spirit bear or a kermode bear there are only two hundred of these bears left they 're more rare than the panda bear 
 so i had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what i was going to do in my next life after i was a photographer because they were going to fire me  because national geographic is a magazine they remind us all the time they publish pictures not excuses 
 and after two months of sitting there one day thinking that it was all over this incredible big white male came down right beside me three feet away from me and he went down and
  grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it 
 and then i spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest he went through this this old growth forest and sat up beside this  400 year old culturally modified tree and went to sleep and i actually got to sleep
 within three feet of him  just in the forest and photograph him so i 'm very excited to be able to
  my work that i 've done on the polar regions  please enjoy
 the
 the
  thank you very much  the show 's not over 
 my clock is ticking ok let 's stop thank you very much  i appreciate it we 're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it 's at its lowest level and in fact  
 scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years then they said fifty years now they 're saying the sea ice in the arctic  the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to ten
 and what does that mean after a while of reading this in the news it just becomes news you glaze over with it and what i 'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this and i want people 
  to understand and get the concept that if we lose ice  we stand to lose an entire ecosystem  projections are that we could lose polar bears they could become extinct in the next fifty to one hundred years  
 megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on 
 polar bears are amazing hunters  this was a bear i sat with for a while on the shores there was no ice around but this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it and this bear swam out to that 
  seal eight hundred lb bearded seal grabbed it swam back and ate it  and he was so
  he was so happy and so fat eating this seal that as i approached him about twenty feet away to get this picture his only defense was to keep eating more seal and as he as he ate 
 he was so full he probably had about two hundred lbs of meat in his belly and as he ate inside one side of his mouth he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth  
  found dead bears  and in the last four or five years we 're finding dead bears popping up all over the place we 're seeing them in the beaufort sea floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out i found a couple in norway last 
  year we 're seeing them on the ice  these bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice  
 here 's a mother and her two year old cub were traveling
  on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere and they 're riding on this big piece of glacier ice  which is great for them they 're safe at this point they 're not going to die of hypothermia  they 're going to get to land 
 but unfortunately ninety five percent of the glaciers in the arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem 
 these ringed seals these are the fatsicles of the arctic these little
  bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear  and they 're not like the harbor seals that you have here these
 ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice they give birth inside the ice  and they feed on the arctic cod that live under the ice  
 and here 's a picture of sick ice  this is a piece of multi year ice that 's twelve years old  and what scientists didn 't predict is that as this ice melts these big pockets of black water
  are forming and they 're grabbing the sun 's energy and accelerating the melting process 
 and here we are diving in the beaufort sea  the visibility 's six hundred ft we 're on our safety lines the ice is moving all over the place i wish i could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive but
 what 's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi year ice that big chunk of ice up in the corner in that one single piece of ice you have three hundred species of microorganisms and
  the spring when the sun returns to the ice  it forms the phytoplankton grows under that ice and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed  and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life  so really 
  what the ice does is it acts like a garden  it acts like the soil in a garden  it 's an inverted garden  losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden  
  this is after an hour under the ice  i can 't feel my lips my face is frozen i can 't feel my hands i can 't feel my feet  and i 've come up and all i wanted to do was get out of the water after an hour in these conditions 
 it 's so extreme that when i go down almost every dive i vomit into my regulator because my body can 't deal with the stress of the cold on my head  and so i 'm just so happy that the dive is over  i get to hand my camera
  and he thinks i 'm saying take my picture so we had this little communication breakdown 
 but it 's worth it i 'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales  bowhead whales and narwhals and polar bears and leopard seals today  but this picture right here means more to me than any other i 've ever made i dropped down in this ice
  that hole that you just saw  and i looked up under the underside of the ice  and i was dizzy i thought i had vertigo i got very nervous no rope no safety line the whole world is moving around me and i thought 
 i 'm in trouble but what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice  giving birth and living out their entire 
  life cycle this is the foundation of the whole food chain in the arctic right here and when you have low productivity in this in ice  the productivity in copepods go down
 this is a bowhead whale 
 supposedly science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now this very whale right here could be over two hundred and fifty years old this whale could have been born around 
 the start of the industrial revolution it could have survived one hundred and fifty years of whaling  and now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the north because of the lives that we 're leading in the south 
  narwhals with their eight foot long ivory tusks 
 don 't have to be here they could be out on the open water but they 're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe catch a breath because right under that ice are all the swarms of 
  cod and the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods 
  any other even though that spirit bear moment was powerful  i don 't think i 'll ever have another experience like i did with these leopard seals 
 leopard seals since the time of shackleton have had a bad reputation  they 've got that wryly smile on their mouth they 've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body they look positively prehistoric and a bit scary  and tragically in [ two thousand
  scientist was taken down and drowned  and she was being consumed by a leopard seal 
 and people were like we knew they were vicious we knew they were and so people love to form their opinions and that 's when i got a story idea i want to go to antarctica 
 get in the water with as many leopard seals as i possibly can and give them a fair shake find out if they really are these vicious animals or if they 're misunderstood so this is that story 
 oh and they also happen to eat happy feet
  as a species as humans we like to say penguins are really cute  therefore  leopard seals eat them so leopard seals are ugly and bad it doesn 't work that way  the penguin doesn 't know it 's cute  and the leopard seal doesn 't know it 's kind of big and monstrous  
 this is just the food chain unfolding  
 they 're also big they 're not these little harbor seals they are twelve ft 
  a thousand pounds  and they 're also curiously aggressive you get twelve tourists packed into a zodiac  floating in these icy waters and a leopard seal 
  comes up and bites the pontoon the boat starts to sink they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked 
  so after five days of crossing the drake passage isn 't that beautiful
 after five days of crossing the drake passage we have finally arrived at antarctica i 'm with my swedish assistant and guide his name is goran ehlme from sweden goran  
 and he has a lot of experience with leopard seals i have never seen one so we come around the cove in our little zodiac boat  and there 's this monstrous leopard seal and even in his voice he goes that 's a bloody big seal
 laughter and this seal
 is taking this penguin by the head and it 's flipping it back and forth and what it 's trying to do is turn that penguin inside out so it can eat the meat off the bones  and then it goes off and gets another one  
 and so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin came under the boat the zodiac  starting hitting the hull of the boat and
  not fall in the water and we sit down and that 's when goran said to me this is a good seal ya  it 's time for you to get in the water 
 and i looked at goran and i said to him forget that but i think i probably used a different word starting with the letter f 
 but he was right he scolded me out and said this is why we 're here and you purposed this stupid story to national geographic and now you 've got to deliver  and you can 't publish excuses
  dry mouth probably not as bad as now but i had such 
 such dry mouth  and my legs were just trembling i couldn 't feel my legs i put my flippers on i could barely part my lips i put my snorkel in my mouth  and i rolled over the side of the zodiac into the water and this was the first thing she did
 she came racing up to me  engulfed my whole camera and her teeth are up here and down here
  before i had gotten in the water had given me amazing advice he said if you get scared you close your eyes ya and she 'll go away 
 so that 's all i had to work with at that point but i just started to shoot these pictures so she did this threat display for a few minutes and then the most amazing thing happened she totally relaxed 
 she went off she got a penguin
  she stopped about ten feet away from me  and she sat there with this penguin the penguin 's flapping and she let 's it go the penguin swims toward me  takes off she grabs another one she does this over and over and it dawned on me that she 's trying to feed me a penguin why else would she
 release these penguins at me 
 and after she did this four or five times she swam by me with this dejected look on her face you don 't want to be too anthropomorphic but i swear that she looked at me like this useless predator 's going to starve in my ocean
 so realizing i couldn 't catch swimming penguins she 'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me bobbing like this and she 'd let them go 
  this didn 't work i was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding because i was crying underwater just because it was so amazing 
 display sliding down this iceberg
 like this and she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me  this went on for four days this just didn 't happen a couple of times  
 and then so she realized i couldn 't catch live ones so she brought me dead penguins 
 now i 've got four or five penguins floating around my head  and i 'm just sitting there shooting away  
 and she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like are you for real because she can 't believe i can 't eat this penguin
  in her world you 're either breeding or you 're eating and i 'm not breeding so 
 and then that wasn 't enough she started to flip penguins onto my head she was trying to force feed me she 's pushing me around she 's trying to force feed my camera  which is every photographer 's dream  
 and she would get frustrated she 'd blow bubbles in my face she would i think let me know that i was going to starve but yet she didn 't stop she would not stop trying to feed me penguins
 and on the last day with this female where i thought i had pushed her too far i got nervous because she came up to me  
 she rolled over on her back and she did this deep guttural jackhammer sound this gok gok gok gok and i thought  she 's about to bite she 's about to let me know she 's too frustrated with me  what had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me
  and she did that to threat display she chased that big seal away went and got its penguin and brought it to me 
 that wasn 't the only seal i got in the water with i got in the water with thirty other leopard seals  
 and i never once had a scary encounter they are the most remarkable animals i 've ever worked with and the same with polar bears and just like the polar bears these animals depend on an
  it 's a story that lives deep in my heart and i 'm proud to share this with you  and i 'm so passionate about it anybody want to come with me to antarctica or the arctic i 'll take you  let 's go we 've got to get the story out now thank you very much
