  the future as we know it is very unpredictable  the best minds in the best institutions generally get it wrong  
 this is in technology  this is in the area of politics where pundits  the
  always get it wrong  and it 's clearly in the area of finance with institutions established to think about the future the imf the bis the financial stability forum  couldn 't see what was coming 
 over twenty thousand economists whose job it is competitive entry to get there  couldn 't see what was happening globalization is getting more complex  and this change is getting more rapid the future will be more unpredictable
  coming together leads to a new renaissance it did this a thousand years ago  the last forty years have been extraordinary times life expectancy has gone up by about twenty five years it took from the stone age to achieve that 
 income has gone up for a majority of the world 's population despite the population going up by about two billion people over this period 
 and illiteracy has gone down from a half to about a quarter of the people on earth a huge
  huge opportunity unleashing of new potential for innovation for development but there is an underbelly there
 are two achilles ' heels of globalization 
 there is the achilles ' heel of growing inequality those that are left out those that feel angry those that are not participating globalization has not been inclusive  the second achilles ' heel is complexity
 a growing
 fragility a growing brittleness what happens in one place very quickly affects everything else this is a systemic risk
  systemic shock we 've seen it in the financial crisis we 've seen it in the pandemic flu it will become virulent
 and it 's something we have to build resilience against 
 a lot of this is driven by what 's happening in technology there have been huge leaps there will be a million fold improvement in what you can get for the same price in computing by two thousand and thirty that 's what the experience of the last twenty years has been it will continue 
 our computers our systems will be as
  primitive as the apollo 's are for today our mobile phones are more powerful than the total apollo space engine our mobile phones are more powerful than some of the strongest computers of twenty years ago  
 so what will this do it will create huge opportunities in technology  miniaturization as well there will be invisible capacity invisible capacity in our bodies in our brains
  and in the air this is a dust mite on a nanoreplica 
 this sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential not least in the area of medicine this is a stem cell that we 've developed here in oxford from
 an embryonic stem cell we can develop any part of the body  increasingly over time this will be possible from our own skin able to replicate parts of the body  fantastic potential for regenerative 
  medicine  i don 't think there will be a special olympics long after two thousand and thirty  because of this capacity to regenerate
  parts of the body  but the question is who will have it 
 the other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics the capacity to create 
 as this mouse has been genetically modified something which goes three times faster  lasts for three times longer we could produce as this mouse can to the age of our equivalent of eighty
  about the same amount of food  but will this only be available for the super rich for those that can afford it are we headed for a new eugenics will only those
 that are able to afford it be able to be this super race of the future so
 the big question for us is how do we manage this technological change how do we ensure that it creates a more inclusive technology a technology
 which means that not only as we grow older  that we can also grow wiser
  wiser  and that we 're able to support the populations of the future  
 one of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements will be moving from population pyramids to what we might term population coffins there is unlikely to be a pension or a retirement age in two thousand and thirty  
 these will be redundant concepts and this isn 't only something of the west the most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new pyramids that will take place
  in china and in many other countries so forget about retirements if you 're young  forget about pensions think about life and where it 's going to be going of course migration will become even more important  the war 
  on talent  the need to attract people at all skill ranges to push us around in our wheelchairs  but also to drive our economies our innovation will be vital 
  would imply a massive leap in migration so the concerns the xenophobic concerns of today of migration will be turned on their head as we search for people to help us sort out our 
  pensions and our economies in the future  and then the systemic risks we understand that these will become much more virulent that what we see today is this interweaving of societies of systems fastened by technologies and hastened by
 just in time management systems small levels of stock push resilience into other people 's responsibility  
 the collapse in biodiversity climate change pandemics financial crises these will be the currency that we will think about and so a new awareness will have to arise of how we 
  deal with these how we mobilize ourselves in a new way and come together as a community to manage systemic risk
  it 's going to require innovation it 's going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization could also be its downfall this could be our best century ever because of the achievements or it could be our worst  
 and of course we need to worry about the individuals particularly the individuals that feel that they 've been left out in one way or another 
 an individual for the first time in the history of humanity will have the capacity by two thousand and thirty to destroy the
  planet to wreck everything 
 through the creation for example of a biopathogen how do we begin to weave these tapestries together how do we think about complex systems in new ways that will be the challenge of the scholars  and of all of us
 engaged in thinking about the future the rest of our lives will be in the future  we need to prepare for it now we need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized it cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring
 we have to develop a new way of managing the planet  collectively  through collective wisdom
