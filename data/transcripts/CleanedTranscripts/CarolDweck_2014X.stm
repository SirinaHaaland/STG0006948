  i heard about a high school in chicago where students had to pass a certain number of courses to graduate  and if they didn 't pass a course they got the
  i thought that was fantastic because if you get a failing grade you think i 'm nothing i 'm nowhere  but if you get the grade not yet you understand 
 that you 're on a learning curve it gives you a path into the future 
  to see how children coped with challenge
 and difficulty so i gave  10 year olds problems that were slightly too hard for them 
 some of them reacted in a shockingly positive way they said things
  you know i was hoping this would be informative they understood
 that their abilities could be developed  they had what i call a growth mindset 
 but other students felt it was tragic catastrophic  
 from their more fixed mindset perspective 
 their intelligence had
  been up for judgment and they failed 
 instead of luxuriating in the power of yet  they were gripped in the tyranny
 of now  so what do they do next i 'll tell you what they do next in one
  they told us they would probably cheat the next time
 instead of studying more if they failed a test in another study after a failure  
 they looked for someone who did worse than they did so they could feel really good about themselves  
 and in study after study  they have run from difficulty
  the electrical activity from the brain as students confronted an error 
 on the left you see the fixed mindset students there 's hardly any activity they run from the error  
 they don 't engage with it but on the right you have the students with the growth mindset the idea that abilities can be developed 
  engage deeply their brain is on fire with yet  they engage deeply  
 they process the error  they learn from it and they correct it 
 how are we raising our children are we raising them for now instead
  are we raising kids who are obsessed obsessed with getting as 
 are we raising kids who don 't know how to dream big dreams 
 their biggest goal is getting the next a or the next test score  
 and are they carrying this need for constant validation with them
 into their future lives  maybe because employers
  are coming to me and saying we have already raised a generation
 of young workers who can 't get through the day without an award 
 so what can we do how can we build that bridge to yet  here are some things we can do first of all we can praise wisely
 not praising intelligence or talent that has failed don 't do that anymore but praising the process that kids engage in 
 their effort their strategies their focus their perseverance their improvement 
 this process praise creates kids who are hardy and resilient 
 there are other
  ways to reward yet  we recently teamed up with game scientists
 from the university of washington to create a new online math game that rewarded yet  
 in this game students were rewarded for effort strategy and progress
  the usual math game rewards you for getting answers right right now  but this game rewarded process 
 and we got
 more effort 
 more strategies 
 more engagement over longer periods of time and more perseverance when they hit really really hard problems
  into the future that creates greater persistence
 and
 we can actually change students ' mindsets 
 in one study we taught them that every time they push out of their comfort zone
 to learn something new and difficult
  the neurons in their brain can form new stronger connections  and over time they can get smarter  look what happened 
 in this study  students who were not taught this growth mindset continued to show declining grades over this difficult school
  but those who were taught this lesson showed a sharp rebound in their grades we have
 shown this now this kind of improvement with thousands and thousands of kids 
 especially struggling students 
 so let 's talk about
 equality in our country there are groups of students who
  chronically underperform for example children in inner cities 
 or children on native american reservations and they 've done so poorly for so long
 that many people think it 's inevitable but
 when educators create
  and here are just a few examples in one year a kindergarten class in harlem new york
 scored in the  95th percentile on the national achievement
  of those kids could not hold a pencil
 when they arrived at school in one year
 fourth grade students in the south bronx 
 way behind became the number one fourth grade class in the state of new york
 on the state math test in a year to a year and a half native
  american students in a school on a reservation went from the bottom of their district
 to the top  and that district included affluent sections of seattle so
 the native kids
  this happened
 because the meaning of effort and difficulty were transformed  
 before effort and difficulty
 made them feel dumb  made them feel like giving up but now effort and difficulty
  that 's when their neurons are making new connections stronger connections that 's when they 're getting smarter  
 i received a letter recently from a 
 boy  he said dear professor dweck  
 i appreciate that your writing is based on solid scientific research
  that 's why i decided to put it into practice  i put more effort into my schoolwork 
 into my relationship with my family  and into my relationship
 with kids at school and i experienced
 great improvement
 in all of those areas  i now realize i 've wasted most of my life
 let 's not waste any more lives  
 because once we know
 that abilities are capable of such growth  it becomes a basic human right
 for children all children to live in places
 that create that growth
