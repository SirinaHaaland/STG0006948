 the
  cello concert one would most likely think of johann sebastian bach unaccompanied cello suites
  as a child studying these eternal masterpieces bach 's music would intermingle with the singing voices
 of muslim prayers from the neighboring arab village of the northern kibbutz in israel where i grew up  
 late at night after hours of practicing i would listen to janis joplin and billie holiday as the sounds of tango music would be creeping from my parents
 stereo  
 it all became music to me  i didn 't hear the boundaries  
 i still start every day practicing playing bach his music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me  
 but as i was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression 
 i realized that with today 's
  resources there 's no reason
 to limit what can be produced
 at one time from a single string instrument the power and coherency that comes from one person hearing perceiving and playing all the voices
 makes a very different experience 
 the excitement of a great orchestra performance comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians producing one unified
  whole concept the excitement from using multi tracking the way i did in the piece you will hear next comes from
 the attempt to build and create a whole universe with many diverse layers all generated from a single source 
 my cello and my voice are layered to create this large sonic canvas
  when composers write music for me i ask them to forget what they know about the cello i hope to arrive at new territories to discover sounds i have never heard before  
 i want to create endless possibilities
 with this cello i become the medium through which the music is being channeled and in the process when all is right 
  the music is transformed and so am
