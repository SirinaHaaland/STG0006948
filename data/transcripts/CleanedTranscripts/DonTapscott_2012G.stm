  it 's a word that
 denotes opportunity and possibilities open ended open hearth open source open door policy open
  the world is opening up  and it 's a good thing  why is this happening the technology revolution is opening the world  
 yesterday 's internet was a platform for the presentation of content  
 the internet of today is a platform for computation the internet is becoming a giant global computer and every time you go on it you upload a video you do a google search you remix something
  global computer that we all share humanity is building a machine  
 and this enables us to collaborate in new ways collaboration can occur on an astronomical basis  
 now a new generation is opening up the world as well i started studying kids about fifteen 
  and i noticed how my own children were effortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology and at first i thought my children are prodigies 
 but then i noticed all their friends were like them so that was a bad theory so i 've started working with a few hundred
 kids and i came to the conclusion that this is the first generation to come of age in the digital age to be bathed in bits i call them the net
  i said these kids are different  they have no fear of technology  because it 's not there it 's like the air it 's sort of like i have no fear of a refrigerator  
 and and
 there 's no more powerful force to change every institution than the first generation of digital natives i 'm a digital immigrant  i had to learn the language  
 the global economic crisis is opening up the world as well our opaque institutions from the industrial age
  everything from old models of the corporation government media wall street 
 are in various stages of being stalled or frozen or in atrophy or even failing  
 and this is now creating a burning platform in the world i mean think about wall street 
 the core modus operandi of wall street almost brought down global
  you know the idea of a burning platform that you 're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are become greater than the costs of moving to something different  perhaps something radically different  
 and we need to change and open up all of our institutions  so this technology push a demographic kick from a new generation
 and a demand pull from a new
  global environment is causing the world to open up now 
 i think in fact we 're at a turning point in human history 
 where we can finally now rebuild many of the institutions of the industrial age around a new set of principles  
 now  what is openness well  as it turns out openness has a number of different meanings  and for each there 's a corresponding principle for the transformation of civilization 
 is collaboration  
 now this is openness in the sense of the boundaries of organizations becoming more porous and fluid and open 
 the guy in the picture here i 'll tell you his story his name is rob mcewen i 'd like to say i have this think tank we scour the world for amazing case studies 
 the reason i know this story is because he 's my neighbor
  he actually moved across the street from us and he held a cocktail party to meet the neighbors and he says you 're don tapscott i 've read some of your books i said great what do you do and he says well i used to be a banker and now i 'm a gold miner 
 and he tells me this amazing story  he takes over this gold mine and his geologists can 't tell him where the gold is he gives them more money for geological data they come back they can 't tell him where to go into production 
 after
 a few years
  he 's so frustrated he 's ready to give up  but he has an epiphany one day he wonders if my geologists don 't know where the gold is maybe somebody else does 
 so he does a radical thing  he takes his geological data he publishes it and he holds a contest on the internet called the goldcorp challenge it 's basically
 half a million dollars in prize money for anybody who can tell me do i have any gold and if so where is it
 he gets submissions from all around the world they use techniques that he 's never heard heard of and for his half a million dollars in prize money rob mcewen finds three point four billion dollars worth of gold 
 the market value of his company goes from ninety million to ten billion dollars  and i can tell you because he 's my neighbor  he 's a happy
  conventional wisdom says talent is inside right your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night 
 he viewed talent differently  he wondered  who are their peers he should have fired his geology department  but he didn 't 
 you know some of the best submissions didn 't come from geologists they came from computer scientists engineers
  the winner was a computer graphics company that built a three dimensional model of the mine where you can helicopter underground and see where the gold is  
 he helped us understand that social media 's becoming social production  it 's not about hooking up online this is a new means of production in the making  
 and this ideagora that he created an open market agora for uniquely qualified minds
  was part of a change a profound change in the deep structure and architecture of our organizations and how we
 sort of orchestrate capability to innovate to create goods and services to engage with the rest of the world in terms of government how we create public value 
 openness is about collaboration  
 now secondly openness is about transparency this is different here we 're talking about the communication of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations employees customers
  business partners shareholders and so on  
 and everywhere our institutions are becoming naked  people are all bent out of shape about wikileaks but that 's just the tip of the iceberg  
 you see people at their fingertips now everybody  not just julian assange have these powerful tools for finding out what 's going on scrutinizing informing others and even organizing collective responses
  institutions are becoming naked  and if you 're going to be naked well
  there 's some corollaries that flow from that i mean one is fitness is no longer optional 
 you know or if you 're going to be naked you 'd better get buff  now  by buff i mean you need to have good value because value is evidenced like never
  better be good  
 but you also need to have values you need to have integrity as part of your bones and your dna as an organization because if you don 't you 'll be unable to build trust and trust is a sine qua non of this new network world  
 so this is good  it 's not bad sunlight is the best disinfectant and we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world
  the third meaning and corresponding principle of openness is about sharing now this is different than transparency transparency is about the communication of information sharing is about giving up assets intellectual property 
 and there are all kinds of famous stories about this ibm gave away four hundred million dollars of software to the linux movement and that gave them a  multi billion dollar payoff  
  our intellectual property belongs to us and if someone tries to infringe it we 're going to get out our lawyers and we 're going to sue them well  
 it didn 't work so well for the record labels  did it i mean  
 they took
 they had a technology disruption  and rather than taking a business model innovation to correspond to that they took and sought a legal solution and the industry that brought you elvis and the beatles is now suing children
  and is in danger of collapse  
 so we need to think differently about intellectual property i 'll give you an example the pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble first of all there aren 't a lot of big inventions in the pipeline and this is a big problem for human health 
 and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem
  about to fall off something called the patent cliff do you know about this they 're going to lose twenty to thirty five percent of their revenue in the next twelve months 
 and what are you going to do like cut back on paper clips or something no we need to reinvent the whole model of
 scientific research  the pharmaceutical industry needs to place assets in a commons they need to start sharing precompetitive
  they need to start sharing clinical trial data  and in doing so create a rising tide that could lift all boats not just
 for the industry but for humanity now the fourth
 meaning of openness and corresponding principle is about empowerment and i 'm not talking about the motherhood sense here knowledge and intelligence is power and as it becomes more distributed 
  distribution and decentralization and disaggregation of power that 's underway in the world today  the open world is bringing freedom 
 now take the arab spring  the debate about the role of social media and social change has been settled you
 know one word  tunisia and then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too but in the tunisian revolution  the new media didn 't
  cause the revolution it was caused by injustice 
 social media didn 't create the revolution it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and
 who who didn 't want to be treated as subjects anymore  but just as the internet drops transaction and collaboration costs in business and government
  it also drops the cost of dissent of rebellion  and even insurrection in ways that people didn 't understand  you know during the tunisian revolution snipers associated with the regime 
 were killing unarmed students in the street so the students would take their mobile devices  take a picture triangulate the location send that picture to friendly military units who 'd
  unarmed people from murderers it was a tool of self defense you know as we speak today young people are being killed in syria  
 and up until three months ago 
 if you were injured on the street an ambulance would pick you up take you to the hospital you 'd go in say with a broken leg  and you 'd come out with a bullet in your head  
  created an alternative health care system where what they did is they used twitter and basic
 publicly available tools that when someone 's injured 
 a car would show up it would pick them up take them to a makeshift medical clinic where you 'd get medical treatment as opposed to being executed  
 so this is a time of great change now  it 's not without its problems up until
 two years ago all revolutions in human history had a leadership
 and when the old regime fell the leadership and the organization would take power well these wiki revolutions happen so fast they create a vacuum and politics abhors a vacuum and unsavory forces can fill that 
 typically the old regime or
 extremists or fundamentalist forces you can see this playing out today in egypt 
  but that doesn 't matter because this is moving forward the train has left the station the cat is out of the bag  
 the horse is out of the barn help me out here okay the toothpaste is out of the tube  i mean we 're not putting this one back  the open world is bringing empowerment and freedom  
 i think at the end of these four days that you 'll come to conclude that the arc of history is a
  and it 's towards openness if you go back a few hundred years 
 all around the world it was a very closed society it was agrarian and the means of production and political system was called feudalism and knowledge was concentrated in
 the church and the and the nobility people didn 't know about things there was no
 concept of progress you were born you lived your life and you died but then johannes gutenberg came along with his great invention and over time 
 the society opened up
  people started to learn about things and when they did the institutions of feudal society appeared to be stalled or frozen 
 or failing  it didn 't make sense for the church to be responsible for medicine when people had knowledge  so we saw the protestant reformation martin luther called the printing press god 's highest act of
 grace the
  eventually the industrial revolution and it was all good  
 but it came with a cost and now once again  the technology genie is out of the bottle but this time it 's different  
 the printing press gave us access to the written word the internet enables each of us to be a producer  the printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge the internet gives 
  us access not just to information and knowledge but to the intelligence contained in the crania of other people
  on a on a global basis to me this is not an information age  it 's an age of networked intelligence  
 it 's an age of vast promise an age of collaboration  
 where the boundaries of our organizations are changing of transparency where sunlight is disinfecting
 civilization
 an age of sharing
 and understanding the new power of the commons  and it 's an age of empowerment
 and of freedom  now  what i 'd like to do is to close to share with you
 some research that i 've been doing i 've tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like
  but
 i 've been studying nature recently you know  
 bees come in swarms and fish come in schools 
 starlings in the area around edinburgh 
 in the moors of england come in something called a murmuration 
 and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings of the birds and throughout the day the starlings are out over a 20 mile radius sort of doing their starling thing
 and at night they come together and they create one of the most spectacular things in all of nature  and it 's called a murmuration
  and scientists that have studied this have said they 've never seen an accident  
 now this thing has a function  it protects the birds  you can see on the right here  there 's a predator being chased away
 by the collective power of the birds  and apparently this is a frightening thing
 if you 're a predator of starlings  
 and there 's leadership  but there 's no one leader
  now  is this some kind of fanciful analogy or could we actually learn something from this 
 well  the murmuration functions to record a number of principles and they 're basically the principles that i have described to you today 
 this is a huge collaboration  it 's an openness
  of all kinds of information not just about location and trajectory and and danger and so on but about food sources  and
 there 's a real sense of interdependence that the individual birds somehow understand that their interests are in the interest of the collective  
 perhaps like we should understand
  that business can 't succeed in a world that 's failing well i look at this thing  and
 i get a lot of hope think about the kids today in in the
 arab spring  and you see something like this that 's underway and
 imagine just consider this idea if you would what if we could connect ourselves in this world through
 a vast network of air and glass
  glass could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge could we start to share our intelligence 
 could we create some kind of collective intelligence that goes beyond an individual or a group or a team to create
  perhaps some kind of consciousness on a global basis well if we could do this we could attack some big problems in the world  
 and i look at this
  thing and i don 't know i get a lot of hope that maybe this
 smaller 
 networked  open world that our kids inherit might be a better one and that this new age of networked intelligence could be an age of of promise fulfilled and of peril unrequited
  let 's do this
