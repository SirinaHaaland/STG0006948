  talk today about saving more but not today 
 tomorrow i 'm going to talk about save more tomorrow it 's a program that richard thaler from the university of chicago
 and i devised maybe fifteen years ago the program in a sense is an example
  of behavioral finance on steroids
 how we could really use behavioral finance now you might ask  what is behavioral finance  
 so let 's think about how we manage our money  
 let 's start with mortgages it 's kind of a recent topic at least in the u s 
 a lot of people buy the biggest house they can afford and
  actually slightly bigger than that  
 and then they foreclose  and then they blame the banks for being the bad guys who gave them the mortgages
  let 's also think about how we manage risks
 for example investing in the stock market  two years ago three years ago about four years ago markets did well  we were risk takers of course
  then market stocks seize and we 're like wow these losses  they feel emotionally they feel very different
 from what we actually thought about it when markets were going up so we
 're probably not doing a great job when it comes to risk taking  
 how many of you have
 iphones
 i would bet many more of you insure your iphone
 you 're implicitly buying insurance by having an extended warranty  what if you lose your iphone what if you do this how many of you have
 kids anyone 
 keep your hands up if you have sufficient life insurance i see a lot of hands coming down i would
 predict  if you 're a representative sample that many more of you insure your iphones
 than your lives  even when you have kids  we 're not doing that well when it comes to insurance  the average american household
 spends one thousand dollars a year on lotteries  and i know it sounds crazy
 how many of you spend a thousand dollars a year on lotteries  
 no one  so that tells us that the people not in this room are spending more than a thousand
 to get the average to a thousand low income people
 spend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries  so where does it take us we 're not doing a great job managing money
  behavioral finance is really a combination of psychology
 and economics  trying to understand the money mistakes people make 
 and i can keep standing here for the twelve minutes and fifty three seconds that i have left
 and make fun of all sorts of ways we manage money  and at the end you 're going to ask
  what i really want to focus on today  how do we take an understanding of the money mistakes people make  
 and then turning the behavioral challenges
 into behavioral solutions  and what i 'm going to talk about today is save more tomorrow i want to address the issue of savings 
 we have on the screen
 a representative sample of one hundred americans  and we 're going to look at their
  saving behavior  first thing to notice is half of them
 do not even have access to a four hundred and one plan  they cannot make savings easy  
 they cannot have money go away from their paycheck into a four hundred and one plan before they see it before they can
  what about the remaining half of the people some of them elect not to save 
 they 're just too lazy they never get around to logging into a complicated website and doing seventeen clicks to join the four hundred and one plan  and then they have to decide how they 
  're going to invest in their fifty two choices and they never heard about what is a money market fund and they get overwhelmed and the just don 't join  
 one
 third of americans two thirds are not saving now are
 they saving enough take out those who say they save too little 
 one out of ten are saving
 enough
 nine out of ten either cannot save through their four hundred and one plan decide not to save or don 't decide
 or save too little  we think we have a problem of people saving too much  let 's look at that we have
 one person well actually we 're going to slice him in half
 because it 's less than one percent  
 roughly half a percent of americans feel that they save too much
  what are we going to do about it that 's what i really want to focus on we have to understand why people are not saving  
 and then we can hopefully flip the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions  
 and then see how powerful it might be so let me divert for a second as we 're going to identify the
  the behavioral challenges that prevent people from saving i
 'm going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate  suppose we had another wonderful ted event next week 
 and during the break there would be a snack and you could choose bananas or chocolate  how many of you think you would like to have bananas
 during this hypothetical ted event next week who would go for bananas
  i predict scientifically seventy four percent of you will go for bananas well that 's at least what one wonderful study predicted  
 and then
 count down the days and see what people ended up eating 
 the same people that imagined themselves eating the
  is not a problem
 in the future  it 's only a problem now when the chocolate is next to us 
 what does it have to do with with time and savings this issue of immediate gratification 
 or as some economists call it present bias  
 we think about saving we know we should be saving we know we 'll do it next year but today let us
  go and spend christmas is coming we might as well buy a lot of gifts for everyone we know 
 so this issue of present bias causes us to think about saving but end up spending 
 let me now talk about another behavioral obstacle to saving having to do with inertia but again a little diversion
 to the topic of organ
  wonderful study comparing different countries we 're going to look at two similar countries  germany and austria  
 and in germany if you would like to donate your organs god forbid something really bad happens to you
 when you get your driving license or an i d you check the box
  i would like to donate my organs not many people like checking boxes it takes effort you need to think twelve percent do 
 austria a neighboring country  
 slightly similar  slightly different what 's the difference 
 well you still have choice  you will decide whether you want to donate your organs or not 
 but when you get your driving license you check the box if you do not want
  to donate your organ
 nobody checks boxes that 's kind of too much effort one percent check the box the rest do nothing doing nothing is very common not many people check boxes  
 what are the implications to saving lives
 and having organs
  in germany twelve percent check the box twelve percent are organ donors  huge shortage of organs god forbid if you need one 
 in austria again nobody checks the box  therefore ninety nine percent of people are organ donors  
 inertia  lack of action what is the default setting if people do nothing  if they keep procrastinating if they don 't check the boxes very powerful
 're going to talk about what happens if people are overwhelmed
 and scared to make their four hundred and one choices are we going to make them automatically join the plan 
 or are they going to be left out in too many four hundred and one plans if people do nothing  
 it means they 're not saving for retirement if they don 't check the box and checking the box
 takes effort  
 so we 've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges one more before we flip the challenges into solutions having to do with monkeys and apples no no no this is a real study
 and it 's got a lot to do with behavioral economics 
 one group of monkeys gets an apple they 're pretty happy  the other group gets two apples one is taken away they still have an apple left they 're really mad
  why have you taken our apple  
 this is the notion of loss aversion 
 we hate losing stuff  even if it doesn 't mean a lot of risk 
 you would hate to go to the atm take out one hundred dollars and notice that you lost one of those $ twenty bills  it 's very painful
  even though it doesn 't mean anything those twenty dollars might have been a quick lunch  so this notion of loss aversion
 kicks in when it comes to savings too 
 because people mentally and emotionally and intuitively frame savings as a loss because i have to cut my spending  
 so we talked about all sorts of behavioral challenges
 having to do with
  eventually  whether you think about immediate gratification  and the chocolates versus bananas  
 it 's just painful to save now  it 's a lot more fun to spend
 now we talked about inertia and organ donations and checking the box 
  if people have to check a lot of boxes to join a four hundred and one plan they 're going to keep procrastinating and not join  
 and last we talked about loss aversion and the monkeys and the apples  if people frame mentally
 saving for retirement as a loss they 're not going to be saving for retirement  
 so we 've got these challenges  and what richard thaler and i were always fascinated by
 take behavioral finance make it behavioral finance
  on steroids or behavioral finance two point zero or behavioral finance in action
 flip the challenges into solutions  
 and we came up with an embarrassingly simple solution called save more not today tomorrow 
 how is it going to solve the challenges we chatted about if you think about the problem of bananas versus chocolates  we think we 're going to eat
  bananas next week  we think we 're going to save more next year save more tomorrow
 invites employees to save more maybe next year sometime in the future
 when we can imagine ourselves eating bananas volunteering more in the community  exercising more and doing all the right things on the
  about checking the box and the difficulty of taking action save more tomorrow
 makes it easy  it 's an autopilot  once you tell me you would like to save more in the future  
 let 's say every january you 're going to be saving more automatically and it 's going to go away from your paycheck to the four hundred and one plan before you see it before you touch it
  before you get the issue of immediate gratification  but what are we going to do about the monkeys
 and loss aversion 
 next january comes and people might feel that if they save more they have to spend less and that 's painful 
 well  maybe it shouldn 't be just january maybe we should make people save more
 when they make more money
 that way when they make more money when they get a pay raise they don 't have to cut their
 spending  they take a little bit of the increase in the paycheck home and spend more take a little bit of the increase and put it in a four hundred and one plan  
 so that is the program embarrassingly
  but as we 're going to see extremely
 powerful we first implemented it richard thaler and i back in one thousand nine 
  company in the midwest blue collar employees struggling to pay their bills
 repeatedly told us they cannot save more right away saving more
  we invited them to save three percentage points more
 every time they get a pay raise  and
 here are the results 
 we 're seeing here a three and a half year period four pay raises people who were struggling to save were saving three percent of their paycheck three and a half years 
  later saving almost four times as much almost fourteen percent
  and there 's shoes and bicycles and things on this chart because i don 't want to just throw numbers
 in a vacuum i want really to think about the fact that saving four times more
 is a huge difference in terms of the lifestyle that people will be able to afford  it 's real  it 's not just numbers on a piece of paper  
 whereas with saving three
  percent people might have to add
 nice sneakers so they can walk because they won 't be able to afford anything else when they save fourteen percent
 they might be able to maybe have nice dress shoes to walk to the car to drive this is a real difference by now 
 about sixty percent of the large companies
 actually have programs like
  this in place it 's been part of the pension protection act and needless to say that thaler and i have been blessed to be part of
 this program and make a difference  let me
 wrap with with two key messages one is behavioral finance is
  this is just one example 
 message two is there 's still a lot to do 
 this is really the tip of the iceberg  if you think about people and mortgages and buying houses and then not being able to pay for it 
 we need to think about that if you 're thinking about
 people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they 're taking or taking too little risk we need to think about that if you
  think about people spending a thousand dollars a year on lottery tickets  
 we need to think about that the average actually  the record is in singapore the average household spends $ four thousand a year
 on lottery tickets  we 've got a lot to do a lot to solve also
 in the retirement area when it comes to what
  people do with their money after retirement one last question  how many of you feel comfortable
 that as you 're planning for retirement you have a really solid plan
 when you 're going to retire when you 're going to claim social security benefits  what lifestyle to expect 
 how much to spend every month so you 're not going to run out of money  how many of you feel you have
  a solid plan for the future when it comes to post retirement decisions 
 one two three four 
 less than three percent of a very sophisticated audience 
 behavioral finance has a long way there 's a lot of opportunities to make it powerful again
 and again
 and again  thank you
