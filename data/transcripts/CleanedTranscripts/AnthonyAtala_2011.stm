  actually a major health crisis today in terms of the shortage of organs  
 the fact is that we 're living longer  medicine has done a much better job of making us live longer and the problem is as we
  our organs tend to fail more and so currently
 there are not enough organs to go around in fact in the last ten years the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled while in the same time the actual number of transplants has barely gone up so
 this is now a public health crisis 
 so that 's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine it really involves many different areas you can use actually scaffolds biomaterials
 they 're like the piece of your
  blouse or your shirt but specific materials you can actually implant in patients and they will do well and help you regenerate 
 or we can use cells alone  either your very own cells or different stem cell populations 
 or we can use both we can use actually biomaterials and the cells together  
 and that 's where the field is today  
 but it 's actually not a new field
 interestingly this is a book that was published back in 
 's titled the culture of organs the first author alexis carrel a nobel prize winner he actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels 
 and some of the blood vessel grafts we use today were actually designed by alexis  
 that 's the same charles lindbergh who actually spent the rest of his life working with alexis at the rockefeller institute in new york
 in the area of the culture of organs  so if the field 's been around for so long why so few clinical advances and that really has to do to many different challenges but if i were to point to three challenges
  the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time and many advances now we can do that fairly readily  
 the second challenge was cells we could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body  
 over the last twenty years we 've basically tackled that many scientists can now grow many different types of cells  plus we have stem cells but even now two thousand and eleven  there 's still certain cells that we just can 't grow from the patient
  cells  nerve cells  pancreatic cells we still can 't grow them even today 
 and the third challenge is vascularity  the actual supply of blood to allow those organs or tissues to survive once we regenerate them  
 so we can actually use biomaterials now this is actually a biomaterial we can weave them
  knit them or we can make them like you see here this is actually like a cotton candy machine 
 you saw the spray going in that was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure this tubularized structure which is a biomaterial that we can then use 
 to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so 
  and we then created one of these smart biomaterials and then we then used that smart biomaterial to replace and repair that patient 's structure 
 what we did was we actually used the biomaterial as a bridge so that the cells in the organ could walk on that bridge if you will and help to bridge the gap to regenerate that tissue  and you see that patient now six months
  showing you the regenerated tissue which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope 
 we can also use cells alone these are actually cells that we obtained these are stem cells that we create from specific sources and we can drive them to become heart cells and they start beating in culture 
 so they know what to do the cells genetically know what to do and they start beating together now today many clinical trials are using different kinds of
  cells for heart disease  so that 's actually now in patients 
 or if we 're going to use larger structures to replace larger structures we can then use the patient 's own cells or some cell population and the biomaterials the scaffolds  together  
 so the concept here so if you do have a deceased
 or injured organ we take a very small piece of that tissue less than
  half the size of a postage stamp  
 we then tease the cells apart  we grow the cells outside the body  we then take a scaffold a biomaterial again 
 looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt we then shape that material and we then use those cells to coat that material one layer at a time
 very much like baking a layer cake if you will  we then place it in an
  device  and we 're able to create that structure and bring it out this is actually a heart valve
 that we 've engineered  
 and you can see here we have the structure of the heart valve and we 've seeded that with cells  and then we exercise it so you see the leaflets opening and closing
 of this heart valve that 's currently being used experimentally
 to try to get it
 to to further studies  another
 technology that we have used in patients actually involves bladders we actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient less than half the size of a postage stamp  
 we then grow the cells outside the body take the scaffold coat the scaffold with the cells the patient 's own cells two different cell types 
 we then put it in this
  as the human body thirty seven degrees centigrade ninety five percent oxygen a few weeks later you have your engineered organ that we 're able to implant back into the patient 
 for these specific patients we actually just suture these materials we use 
  analysis but we actually created these biomaterials by hand  but we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells we use now
 some type of
 technologies where for solid organs for example like the liver what we do is we take discard livers
  as you know a lot of organs are actually discarded not used so we can take these liver structures which are not going to be used  
 and we then put them in a washing machine like structure
 that will allow the cells to be washed away  two weeks later you have
 something that looks like a liver  you can hold it like a liver  but it has no cells it 's just a skeleton of the liver  and we then can 
  liver with cells  preserving the blood vessel tree so we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree with the patient 's own blood vessel cells and we then infiltrate the
  with the liver cells and we now have been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology  
 another technology that we 've used is actually that of printing this is actually a desktop inkjet printer 
 but instead of using ink we 're using cells  
 and you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure and it takes about forty minutes to print this structure and there 's
  that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through and then finally you 're able to get that structure out 
 you can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it and this is actually a piece of bone that i 'm going to show you 
 in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implanted as you see here  that was all new bone that was implanted using these techniques
  another
 more advanced technology we 're looking at right now our next generation of technologies are more sophisticated printers this particular printer we 're designing now is actually one where we print right on the patient  
 so what you see here
 i know it sounds funny but
  that 's the way it works because in reality  what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound and you have a scanner basically like a flatbed scanner 
 that 's what you see here on the right side you see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient
  scanning the wound  
 once it 's scanned it sends information in the correct layers of cells where they need to be 
 and now you 're going to see here a demo of this actually being done
 in a in a representative wound and we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material so once those cells are on the patient they will stick where they need to be  and this is actually new technology still
 under development  
 we 're also working on more sophisticated printers because in reality our biggest challenge are the solid organs i
 don 't know if you realize this but ninety percent of the patients on the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney 
 patients are dying every day because we don 't have enough of those organs to go around  so this is more challenging
 large organ  vascular a lot of blood vessel supply a lot of cells present  
 so the strategy here is this is actually a ct scan an x ray
 and we go layer by layer using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3d reconstruction to get right down to those patient 's own kidneys 
 we then are able to actually image those do three hundred and sixty degree rotation
  to analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics  and we then are able to actually take this information
 and then scan this in a printing computerized form so we go layer by layer through the organ  
 analyzing each layer as we go through the organ  and we then are able to send that information as you see here through the computer
  and actually design the organ for the patient this actually shows the actual printer 
 and this actually shows that printing in fact  we actually have the printer right here  so
 while we 've been talking today 
 you can actually see the printer back here in the back stage that 's actually the actual printer right now  and that 's been
  printing this kidney structure that you see here
  it takes about seven hours to print a kidney so this is about three hours into it now 
 and  dr kang 's going to walk onstage right now and we 're actually going to show you one of these kidneys
 that we printed a little bit earlier today  
 put a pair of gloves here
 thank you 
 go backwards
 so these gloves are a little bit small on me but here it is you can actually see that kidney as it was printed
  a little bit of consistency to it 
 this is dr kang who 's been working with us on this project and part
  actually a new generation  this is actually the printer that you see here onstage and this is actually a new technology we 're working on now 
 in reality we now have a long history of doing this i 'm going to share with you a clip in terms of
 technology we have had in patients now for
  and this is actually a very brief clip only about thirty seconds of a patient
 who actually received an organ luke massella i was really sick i could barely get out of bed i was missing school it was pretty much miserable i couldn
 go out and play
 basketball at recess without feeling like i was going to pass out when i got back inside  i felt so sick  i was facing basically a lifetime
  i don 't even like to think about what my life would be like if i was on that so after the surgery  life got a lot better for me i was able to do more things i was
 able to wrestle in high school i became the captain of the team and
 that was great i was able to be a normal kid with my friends and because they used my own cells to build this bladder it 's going to be with me i 've got it for life so
  these experiments sometimes work  and it 's very cool when they do luke  come up please
  last time you saw tony lm ten years ago when i had my surgery and it 's really great
  well right now i 'm
 in college at the university of connecticut i 'm a sophomore and studying communications tv and mass media and basically trying to live life like a normal kid which i always wanted 
  growing up but it was hard to do that when i was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren 't working i went through about sixteen surgeries and
 it seemed impossible to do that when i was in kidney failure when i was ten  and this surgery came along and basically made me who i am today and saved my life
  from he 's working really hard in his lab and coming up with
 crazy stuff i know i was one of the first ten people to have this surgery and when i was ten i didn 't realize how amazing it was i was a little kid and i was like yeah i
 'll have that i 'll have that surgery laughter
 all i wanted to do was to get better and i didn 't realize how amazing it really was until now that i 'm older and i see the amazing things that he 's doing
 when you got this call out of the blue
 tony 's really shy  and it took a lot of convincing
 to get somebody as modest as tony to allow us to bring luke  
 so luke you go to your communications professors you 're majoring in communications and you ask them for permission to come to ted which might have a little bit to do with communications
  a couple that were a little stubborn but i had to talk to them i pulled them aside je well it 's an honor and a privilege to meet you thank you so
