  the most important and prioritized sense that we have 
 we are constantly looking at the world around us and quickly we identify and make sense of what it is that we see
  let 's just start with an example of that very fact  i 'm going to show you a photograph of a person just for a second or two and i 'd like for you to identify what emotion is on his face  ready  
 here you go go with your gut reaction okay
 what did you see  
 well  we actually surveyed over one hundred and twenty individuals and the results were mixed people did not agree on what emotion they saw on his face
 you saw discomfort that was the most frequent response that we received  but if you asked the person on your left they might have said regret or skepticism  
 and if you asked somebody on your right they might have said something entirely different like hope or empathy
  so we are all looking at the very same
  we might see something entirely different 
 because perception is subjective what we think we see is actually filtered through our own mind 's eye 
 of course  there are many other examples of how we see the world through own mind 's eye i 'm going to give you just a few
  so dieters for instance see apples as larger than people who are not counting calories  
 softball players
 see the ball as smaller if they 've just come out of a slump  compared to people who had a hot night at the plate
  and actually our political beliefs also can affect the way we see other people  including politicians  
 so my research team and i decided to test this question in
  barack obama was running for president for the very first time  and we surveyed hundreds of americans one month before the election  
 what we found in this survey was that some people some americans think photographs like these
 best reflect how obama really looks 
 of these people seventy five percent voted for obama in the actual election other people though thought photographs like these
 best reflect how obama really looks
  of these people voted for mccain 
 we presented many photographs of obama one at a time  so people did not realize that what we were changing from one photograph to the next
 was whether we had artificially lightened or darkened his skin tone  
 so how is that possible how could it be that when i look at a person an object or an event  i see something very
  different than somebody else does 
 well the reasons are many  but one reason requires that we understand a little bit more about how our eyes work  
 so vision scientists know that the amount of information that we can see
 at any given point in time what we can focus on is actually relatively small what we can see with great sharpness and clarity and accuracy
  equivalent
 of the surface area of our thumb on our outstretched arm
  everything else around that is blurry  rendering much of what is presented to our eyes as ambiguous  
 but we have to clarify and make sense of what it is that we see  and it 's our mind that helps us fill in that gap
  as a result perception is a subjective experience  and that 's how we end up seeing through our own mind 's eye  
 so i 'm a social psychologist and it 's questions like these that really intrigue me  
 i am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to eye 
 why is it that somebody might literally see the glass as half full and somebody literally sees it as half empty 
 what is it about what one person is thinking and feeling that leads them to see the world in an entirely
  different way  and does that even matter  
 so to begin to tackle these questions  my research team and i decided to delve deeply into an issue that has received international attention 
 our health and fitness  
 across the world people are struggling to manage their weight  and there is a variety of strategies that we have to help us keep the pounds off
  instance  we set the best of intentions to exercise after the holidays
  but actually the majority of americans find that their new year 's resolutions are broken by valentine 's day  
 we talk to ourselves in very encouraging ways  telling ourselves this is our year to get back into shape  but that is not enough to bring us back to our ideal weight
  of course there is no simple answer  but one reason i argue is that our mind 's eye might work against us 
 some people may literally see exercise as more difficult and some people might literally see exercise as easier
  so as a first step to testing these
  we gathered objective measurements of individuals ' physical fitness  we measured the circumference of their waist compared to the circumference of their hips 
 a higher  waist to hip ratio is an indicator of being less physically fit than a lower waist to hip ratio 
 after gathering these measurements  
 we told our participants that they would walk to a finish line while carrying extra weight in a sort of race  
 but before they did that we asked them to estimate the distance
  distance to the finish line  we thought that the physical states of their body might change how they perceived the distance  so what did we find 
 well waist to hip ratio predicted perceptions of distance  
 people who were out of shape and unfit actually saw the distance to the finish line as significantly greater than people who were in better shape 
 people 's states of their own body
 changed how they perceived the environment  
 but so too can our mind in fact our bodies and our minds work in tandem to change how we see the world around us 
 that led us to think that maybe people with strong motivations and strong goals to exercise
 might actually see the finish line as closer than people who have weaker motivations  so to test
  whether motivations
 affect our perceptual experiences in this way we conducted a second study  again  we gathered objective measurements
 of people 's physical fitness  measuring the circumference of their waist and the circumference of their hips  and we had them do a few other tests of fitness  
 based on feedback that we gave them 
 some of our participants told us they 're not motivated to exercise any more
 they felt like they already met their fitness goals and they weren 't going to do anything else these people were not motivated 
 other people though  based on our feedback told us they were highly motivated to exercise they had a strong goal to make it to the finish line  
 but again before we had them walk to the finish line  we had them estimate the distance how far away was the finish line
  and again like the previous study  we found that  waist to hip ratio predicted perceptions of distance  
 unfit individuals saw the distance as farther saw the finish line as farther away than people who were in better shape  
 importantly though this only happened for people who were not motivated to exercise 
 on the other hand people who were highly motivated to exercise
 saw the distance as short  even the most out of shape individuals saw the
  finish line as just as close if not slightly closer than people who were in better shape  
 so our bodies can change how far away that finish line looks  
 but people who had committed to a manageable goal that they could accomplish in the near future
 and who believed that they were capable of meeting that goal actually saw the exercise as easier that
  led us to wonder is there a strategy that we could use and teach people that would help
 change their perceptions of the distance help them make exercise look easier  
 so we turned to the vision science literature to figure out what should we do and based on what we read we came up with a strategy that we called keep your eyes on the prize
  this is not the slogan from an inspirational poster  it 's an actual directive for how to look around your environment
 people that we trained in this strategy  we told them to focus their attention on the finish line to avoid looking around 
 to imagine a spotlight was shining on that goal and that everything around it was blurry and perhaps difficult to see  
 we thought that this strategy would help make the exercise look easier
  we compared this group to a baseline group to
 this group we said just look around the environment as you naturally would you will notice the finish line  but you might also notice the garbage can off to the right 
 or the people and the lamp post off to the left  we thought that people who used this strategy would see the distance as farther  
 so
 what did we find when we had them estimate the distance was this strategy
  successful for changing their perceptual experience  
 yes 
 people who kept their eyes on the prize saw the finish line as thirty percent closer than people who looked around as they naturally would  
 we thought this was great we were really excited because it meant that this strategy helped make the exercise look easier  but the big
  could this help make exercise
 actually better could it improve the quality of exercise as well
  so next we told our participants you are going to walk to the finish line while wearing extra weight  we added
 weights to their ankles that amounted to fifteen percent of their body weight  we told them to lift their knees up high and walk to the finish line quickly 
 we designed this exercise in particular to be moderately challenging but not impossible like most exercises
 that actually improve our fitness  so the big question then did keeping your eyes on the prize and narrowly focusing on the finish line
 change their experience of the exercise 
 it did 
 people who kept their eyes on the prize told us afterward that it required seventeen percent less exertion for them to do this exercise than people who looked around naturally
  it changed their subjective experience of the exercise  
 it also changed the objective nature of their exercise people who kept their eyes on the prize actually moved twenty three percent faster
 than people who looked around naturally to put that in perspective a twenty three percent increase
  we were so excited by this because this meant that a strategy that costs nothing 
 that is easy for people to use regardless of whether they 're in shape or struggling to get there had a big effect 
 keeping your eyes on the prize made the exercise look and feel easier even when people were working harder because they were moving
  faster
  now  i know there 's more to good health than walking a little bit faster  
 but keeping your eyes on the prize might be one additional strategy that you can use to help promote a healthy lifestyle 
 if you 're not convinced yet that we all see the world through our own mind 's eye  let me leave you with one final
  here 's a photograph of a beautiful street in stockholm 
 with two cars the car in the back looks much larger than the car in the front  however in reality these cars are the same size  
 but that 's not how we see it 
 so does this mean that our eyes have gone haywire and that our brains are a mess  no it doesn 't mean that at all it 's just how our eyes work  
 we might see the world in a different way  and sometimes that might not
 line up with reality  but it doesn 't mean that one of us is right and one of us is wrong 
 we all see the world through our mind 's eye  but we can teach ourselves to see it differently
  so i can think of days that have gone horribly wrong for me  i 'm fed up  i 'm grumpy  i 'm tired and i 'm so behind  and
  there 's a big black cloud hanging over my head  and on days like these it looks like everyone around me is down in the dumps too 
 my colleague at work looks annoyed when i ask for an extension on a deadline
  and my friend looks frustrated when i show up late for lunch because a meeting ran long  
 and at the end of the day my husband looks disappointed because i 'd rather go to bed than go to the movies  
 and on days like
  when everybody looks upset and angry to me  i try to remind myself that there are other ways of seeing them  
 perhaps my colleague was confused perhaps my friend was concerned 
 and perhaps my husband was feeling empathy instead  
 so we all see the world through our own mind 's eye  and on some days it might look like the world is a dangerous and challenging and insurmountable place
  but it doesn 't have to look that way all the time  we can teach ourselves to see it differently  
 and when we find a way to make the world look nicer and easier  it might actually become so thank you
