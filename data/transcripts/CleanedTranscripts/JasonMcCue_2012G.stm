  we most certainly do talk to terrorists  no question about it  we are at war
 with a new form of terrorism  it 's sort of the good old traditional form of terrorism  but it 's sort of been packaged for the
 one of the big things about countering terrorism
 is 
 how do you perceive it  because perception leads to your response to it 
 so if you have a traditional perception of terrorism
  it would be that it 's one of criminality one of war so
  you going to respond to it naturally it would follow that you meet kind with kind you fight it
  if you have a more modernist approach  and your perception of terrorism is almost cause and effect then
 naturally from that the responses that come out of it
 are much more asymmetrical 
 we live in a modern global world terrorists have actually adapted to it  it 's something we have to
 too and that means the people who are working on counterterrorism responses
 have to start in effect putting on their  google tinted glasses or whatever 
 for my part what i wanted us to do was just to look at
 terrorism as though it was a global brand say coca cola both are fairly bad for your health
 if you look at
 it as a brand in those ways what you 'll come to realize is  it 's a pretty flawed product as we 've said it 's pretty bad for your health
  it 's bad for those who it affects and it 's not actually good if you 're a suicide bomber either
  it doesn 't actually do what it says on the tin
  you 're not really going to
  get seventy two virgins in heaven
 it 's not going to happen i don 't think 
 and you 're not really going to in the ' 80s end capitalism by supporting one of these groups it 's a load of nonsense but what you realize it 's got an achilles ' heel  
 the brand has an achilles ' heel  
 we 've mentioned the health  but it needs consumers to buy into it 
 the consumers it needs
 are the terrorist constituency they 're the people who buy into the brand support them facilitate them 
 and they 're the people we 've got to reach out to 
 we 've got to attack that brand in front of them  there 's two essential ways of doing that if we carry on this brand theme one is reducing their market 
  what i mean is it 's their brand
 against our brand
  we 've got to compete  we 've got to show we 're a better product  if i 'm trying to show we 're a better product 
 i probably wouldn 't do things like guantanamo bay  
 we 've talked there about curtailing the underlying need
 for the product itself you could be looking there at poverty injustice
  all those sorts of things which feed terrorism  the other thing to do is to knock the product  
 attack the brand myth as we 've said you know there 's nothing heroic about killing a young kid  
 perhaps we need to focus on that and get that message back across
  we 've got to reveal the dangers in the product our target audience  it 's not just the producers of terrorism as i 've said the
  it 's not just the marketeers of terrorism which is those who finance those who facilitate it  
 but it 's the consumers of terrorism  we 've got to get in to those homelands that 's where they recruit from that 's where they get their power and strength that 's where their consumers come from  
 and we have to get our messaging in there 
 so the essentials are we 've got to have interaction in those areas with the terrorists the facilitators etc
  've got to engage  we 've got to educate  and we 've got to have dialogue  now
  staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds
 think about delivery mechanisms how are we going to do these attacks well  reducing the market is really one for governments and civil society
  we 've got to show we 're better  we 've got to show our values
  we 've got to practice what we preach  but when it comes to knocking the brand  if the terrorists are coca cola and we 're pepsi  
 i don 't think being pepsi  anything we say about coca cola anyone 's going to believe us 
 so we 've got to find a different mechanism  and one of the best mechanisms i 've ever come across is
  the victims of terrorism  they are somebody who can actually stand there and say this product 's crap 
 i had it and i was sick for days  it burnt my hand whatever you believe them you can see their scars  you trust them
  but whether it 's victims whether it 's governments  ngos or even the queen yesterday 
  in northern ireland we have to interact and engage with those different
 layers of terrorism and in effect we do have to have a little dance with the devil this
 is my favorite part of my speech i wanted to blow you all up to try and make a point but 
  for health and safety reasons have told me i 've got to do a countdown so
 i feel like a bit of an irish or jewish terrorist sort of a health and safety terrorist and i 
 i 've got to count three two one and
 it 's a bit alarming  so thinking of what my motto would be and it would be body parts not heart attacks
  was a suicide bomber amongst us all we 're all victims of terrorism  there 's six hundred and twenty five of us in this room we 're going to be scarred for life 
 there was
 a father and a son who sat in that seat over there the son 's dead the father lives  the father
 will
 probably kick himself for years to come that he didn 't take that seat
 instead of his kid he 's going to take to alcohol and he 's probably going to kill himself in three years that 's the stats there 's a
 very young attractive lady over here  and she has something which i think 's the worst form of psychological physical injury i 've ever seen out of
  a suicide bombing  it 's human shrapnel  
 what it means is when she sat in a restaurant in years to come ten years to come fifteen years to come or she 's on the beach  every so often she 's going to start rubbing her skin  
 and out of there will come a piece of that shrapnel  
 and that is a
 hard thing for
  's a lady over there as well who lost her legs in this
 bombing  she 's going to find out that she gets a pitiful amount of money off our
 government
 for looking after what 's happened to her she had a daughter who was going to go to one of the best universities she 's going to give up university to
 look after mum we 're all here  and all of those
  who watch it are going to be traumatized by this event  but all of you here who are victims are going to learn
 some hard truths that is our society  we sympathize  
 but after a while  we start to ignore  we don 't do enough as a society  we do not look after our victims  and we do not enable them
  and what i 'm going to try and show is that actually victims are the best weapon we have
 against more terrorism  how would the government at the turn of the millennium
 approach today well we all know what they 'd have done then is an invasion
  if the suicide bomber was from wales good luck to wales i 'd say
 knee jerk legislation
  emergency provision legislation which hits at the very basis of our society as we all know
 it 's a mistake 
 we 're going to drive prejudice throughout edinburgh throughout the u k 
 for welsh people 
 today 's approach governments have learned from their mistakes  they are looking at what i 've started off on on these more asymmetrical
 approaches to it  more modernist views
  cause and effect  but mistakes of the past are inevitable it 's human nature  the fear and the pressure to do
  just to before the bang to this idea of brand and i was talking about coke and pepsi  etc  
 we see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war they 'll see it as freedom fighters and truth against
 injustice imperialism  etc  
 we do have to see this as a deadly battlefield
  's not just [ our ] flesh and blood they want  they actually want our cultural souls  and that 's why the brand analogy
 is a very interesting way of looking at this  if we look at
 al qaeda  al qaeda was essentially a
 product on a shelf in a souk somewhere which not many people had heard of nine eleven launched it  it was its big marketing day
  and it was packaged for the 21st century they knew what they were doing
 they were effectively [ doing ] something in this brand image of creating a brand which can be franchised around the world where there 's poverty ignorance and injustice
 we as i 've said have got to
  looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks and crackpots 
 now it 's got a title  everyone 's doing it there 's a bomb people start suing  but one of the first early cases on this was the omagh bombing
  a civil action was brought from one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight 
 in omagh bomb went off real ira middle of a peace process that meant that
 the culprits couldn 't really be prosecuted
 for lots of reasons  mostly to do with the peace process and what was going on the greater good 
 it also meant then if you can imagine this that the people who bombed your children
 and your husbands were walking around the supermarket
 that you lived in some of those victims said enough is enough we brought a private action
  and thank god ten years later we actually won it  there is a slight appeal on at the moment so i have to be a bit careful but i 'm
 fairly confident why was it effective it was effective not just because justice was seen to be done where there was a huge void  
 it was because the real ira and other terrorist groups their whole strength is from the fact that they are an underdog when we put the victims
  as the underdog and flipped it 
 they didn 't know what to do  
 they were embarrassed their recruitment went down the bombs actually stopped fact because of this action 
 we became  or those victims became more importantly a ghost that haunted the terrorist organization  
 there 's other examples we have a case called almog which is to do with
  bank
 that was allegedly from our point of view  giving rewards to suicide bombers just by
 bringing the very action 
 that bank has stopped doing it  
 and indeed the powers that be around the world which for real politic reasons before  couldn 't actually deal with this issue because there was lots of competing interests have actually closed down those loopholes in the banking system
 's another case called the mcdonald case where some victims of semtex of the provisional ira bombings 
 which were supplied by gaddafi  
 sued  and that action has led to amazing
 things for new libya libya new libya has been compassionate towards those victims and started taking it so it started a whole new dialogue there
 but the problem is we need more
 and more support for these ideas and cases civil affairs and
 civil society initiatives a good one is in somalia there 's a war on piracy if anyone thinks you can have a war on piracy like a war on terrorism and beat it  you 're wrong 
 what we 're trying to do
  is turn pirates to fisherman they used to be fisherman of course
  but we stole their fish and dumped a load of toxic waste in their water 
 so what we 're trying to do is create security and employment by bringing a coastguard along with the fisheries industry  and i can guarantee you as that builds  al shabaab and such likes 
  will not have the poverty and injustice any longer to prey on those people 
  importantly  it takes the war to their homelands and not onto our shore  and we 're looking at the causes  the last one i wanted to talk about was dialogue
  the advantages of dialogue are obvious it self educates both sides
  enables a better understanding  reveals the strengths and weaknesses  and yes like some of the speakers before  the shared vulnerability does lead to trust
  and it does then become that process part of normalization  but it 's not an easy road after
 the bomb the victims are not into this there 's practical problems  it 's politically risky for the protagonists
 and for the interlocutors  on one occasion i was doing it every time i did a point that they didn 't like they actually threw stones at me  and when i did a point they liked
  they starting shooting in the air  equally not great 
 laughter whatever the point it gets to the heart of the problem  you 're doing it  you 're talking to them  now i just want to end
 with saying  if we follow reason 
 we realize that i think we 'd all say that we want to have a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure military perception of it
  we need to foster more modern and asymmetrical responses to it  
 this isn 't about being soft on terrorism  it 's about fighting them on contemporary battlefields  
 we must foster innovation as i 've said  
 governments are receptive  it won 't come from those dusty corridors  the private sector has a role 
 the role we could do right now is going away and looking at how
  we can support victims around the world to bring initiatives  
 if i was to leave you with some big questions here which may change one 's perception to it and who knows what thoughts and responses will come out of it
  but did myself and my terrorist group actually need to blow you up to make our point  
 we have to ask ourselves these questions however unpalatable have we been
  ignoring an injustice or a humanitarian humanitarian struggle somewhere in the world 
 what if actually engagement on poverty and injustice is exactly what the terrorists wanted us to do what if the bombs are just simply wake up calls for us 
 what happens
 if that bomb went off because we didn 't have any thoughts and things in place to allow dialogue
 to deal with these things and interaction
  what is definitely uncontroversial is that as i 've said we 've got to stop being reactive and more proactive  and i just want to leave you
 with one idea which is that it
 's a provocative question for you to think about and the answer will require sympathy with the devil
  it 's a question that 's been tackled by many great thinkers and writers  what if society actually needs
  crisis to change  what if society actually needs terrorism
 to change and adapt for the better it 's those bulgakov themes  it 's that picture of jesus and the devil hand in hand in gethsemane
 walking into the moonlight what it would mean is that humans
  in order to survive in development  quite darwinian spirit here inherently must dance with the devil
