  i am in search of another planet in the universe where life exists  i can 't see this planet with my naked eyes
 or even with the most powerful telescopes we currently possess
  but i know that it 's there and understanding contradictions that occur in nature will help us find it 
 on our planet where there 's water there 's life  so we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance from their stars 
 at this distance shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces as lakes and oceans where life might reside
  astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars 
 what i do picks up where their job ends i model the possible climates of exoplanets  
 and here 's why that 's important  there are many factors besides distance from its star that control whether a planet can support life
  take the planet venus 
 it 's named after the roman goddess of love and beauty because of its benign ethereal appearance in the sky  
 but spacecraft measurements revealed a different story 
 the surface temperature is close to nine hundred degrees fahrenheit  five hundred celsius 
 that 's hot enough to melt lead 
 its thick
  not its distance from the sun is the reason  it causes a greenhouse effect on steroids  trapping heat from the sun and scorching the planet 's surface 
 the reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet 
 from these lessons from our own solar system we 've learned that a planet 's atmosphere is crucial to its climate and potential to host life 
 we don 't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and
 dim compared to their stars and so far away from us for example one of the closest planets that could support surface water
 it 's called gliese six hundred and sixty seven cc such a glamorous name right  nice phone number for a name
 it 's twenty three light years away  so that 's more than one hundred trillion miles trying to measure the atmospheric composition
  of an exoplanet passing in front of its host star is hard it 's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car 's headlight ok
 now imagine that car is one hundred trillion miles away  and you want to know the precise color of that fly 
 so i use computer models to calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need to have a suitable climate for water and life
 here 's an artist 's concept of the planet
 with the earth for reference it 's
 one thousand two hundred light years away  and just forty percent larger than earth  
 our nsf funded work found that it could be warm enough for open water from many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit
  so i 'd like future telescopes to follow up on this planet to look for signs of life 
 ice on a planet 's surface is also important for climate ice absorbs longer redder wavelengths of light and reflects shorter bluer light 
 that 's why the iceberg in this photo looks so blue the redder light from the sun is absorbed on its way through the ice  only the blue light makes it all the way to the
  then it gets reflected back to up to our eyes and we see blue ice 
 my models show that planets orbiting cooler stars could actually be warmer than planets orbiting hotter stars  there 's another contradiction that ice absorbs the longer wavelength 
  light from cooler stars and that light that energy  heats the ice  
 and it 's no surprise that this is my specialty i 'm an african american female astronomer
 and a classically trained actor who loves to wear makeup and read fashion magazines so
 i am uniquely positioned to appreciate contradictions in nature 
 and how they can inform our search for
  the next planet where life exists  
 my organization  rising stargirls teaches astronomy to middle school girls of color  
 using theater  writing and visual art 
 that 's another contradiction science and art don 't often go together  but interweaving them can help these girls bring their whole selves to what they learn and maybe one day
 join the ranks of
  who are full of contradictions and use their backgrounds to discover  once and for all that we are truly not alone in the universe thank you
