  like to take you is what many believe will be the world 's deepest natural abyss  and i say believe because this process is still ongoing right now
 there are major expeditions being planned for next year
 i 'll talk a little bit about 
 one of the things that 's changed here  in the last one hundred and fifty years since jules verne had great science fiction concepts of what the underworld was like is that
 technology has enabled us to go to these places that were previously completely unknown and speculated about  we can now descend thousands of meters
 into the earth with relative impunity  along the way we 've discovered
  fantastic abysses
 and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight
  when you go on a thing like this we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months with a team as small as twenty or thirty to as big as one hundred and fifty 
 and a lot of people ask me you know what kind of people do you get for a project like this 
  while our selection process is not as rigorous as nasa it 's nonetheless thorough  we 're looking for
 competence  discipline endurance  and strength in case you 're wondering this is our strength test 
 but we also value esprit de corps
 and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter personal conflict while under great stress in remote locations  
 we have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance
 from the entrance  this is nothing like a a commercial cave you 're looking at camp two in a place called 
 we 're roughly two days from the entrance at that point  and
 it 's kind of like a
 high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse except that you 're now running a string of these things down the idea is to try to provide
 some measure of physical comfort while you 're down there otherwise in damp
  moist cold conditions in utterly dark places 
 i should mention that everything you 're seeing here by the way is artificially illuminated at great effort  otherwise it is completely dark in these places 
 the deeper you go  the more you run into a conflict with water  it 's
 basically like a tree collecting water coming down and eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous
 and unfortunately
 slides just don 't do justice so i 've got a very brief
 clip here that was taken in the late 1980s 
 so descend into huautla plateau in mexico now
 i have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous we would not do this today unless we were doing it for film
  along that same line i have to tell you that with the spate of hollywood movies that came out last year  we have never seen monsters underground
 at least the kind that eat you 
 if there is
 a monster underground  it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about three days inbound
  nearest entrance next year i 'll be leading an international team
 to j2 we 're going to be shooting from minus two thousand six hundred meters that 's a little over eight thousand six hundred feet down
 at thirty kilometers from the entrance  the lead crews will be underground for pushing thirty days straight i don 't think there 's been a mission like that in a long time 
 eventually if you keep going down in these things probability says that you 're going to run into a place like this
 it 's a place where there 's a fold in the geologic stratum that collects water and fills to the roof and
 when you used to find these things they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon now i remember that term really well for two reasons number one it 's the name of my rock band 
 second is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor  and we 've since gone on to develop many
  generations of gadgets for exploring places like this this is some life support equipment closed cycle and you can use that now to go for many kilometers
 horizontally underwater and to depths of two hundred meters straight down underwater when you do this kind of stuff
 it 's like doing eva  it 's like doing  extra vehicular activity in space but at much greater distances and at much greater physical peril so it makes you think about how to design your equipment for
  long range away from a safe haven here 's a clip from a national geographic movie that came out in
  was taken in
 wakulla springs florida 
 couple of things to note about that movie every piece of equipment that you saw in there did not exist before one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine 
 it was developed within a two year period and used on actual exploratory projects this gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper  and it produced the first
  map anybody has ever done of a cave and it happened to be underwater in wakulla springs  
 it was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door to another unexplored world  
 this is europa 
 carolyn porco mentioned another one called enceladus the other day  this is one of the places where
 planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth
 in the ocean that exists below there for those who have never seen this story jim cameron produced
  a really wonderful imax movie couple of years ago called aliens of the deep there was a brief clip narrator 
 a mission to explore under the ice of europa would be the ultimate robotic challenge  
 europa is so far away that even at the speed of light it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the
 it has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards
 and to find a good landing site on the ice now we
 have to get through the ice
  the ice could be anywhere from three to sixteen miles deep week after week  the melt probe will sink of its own weight through the
  what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean 
 you need an auv an
 autonomous underwater vehicle  it needs to be one smart puppy  able to navigate and make decisions on its own
 in an alien ocean bs 
 what jim didn 't know when he released that movie was that six months earlier nasa had funded a team i assembled
 to
  develop a prototype for the europa auv i mean i cut through
 three years of engineering meetings  design and system integration 
 and introduced depthx deep phreatic thermal explorer and as the movie says this is one smart puppy  
 it 's got ninety six sensors thirty six onboard computers one hundred thousand lines of behavioral autonomy code
  packs more than ten kilos of tnt in electrical onboard equivalent  
 this is the target site the world 's deepest hydrothermal spring at cenote zacaton in northern mexico it
 's been explored to a depth of two hundred and ninety two meters and beyond that nobody knows anything  
 this is part of depthx 's mission there are two primary targets we 're doing here one is how do you do science autonomy underground how do you take a robot and turn it
  a field microbiologist 
 there are more stages involved here than i 've got time to tell you about but basically we drive through the space we populate it with environmental variables sulphide  halide things like that 
  we calculate gradient surfaces and drive the bot over to a wall where there 's a high probability of life we move along the wall in what 's called proximity operations looking for changes in color if we see something that looks interesting we pull it into a microscope 
  the microscopic test we go for a collection we either draw in a liquid sample  or we can actually take a solid core
 from the wall no hands at the wheel this is all behavioral autonomy here that 's being conducted by the robot on its own  
 the real hat trick for this vehicle though is a disruptive new navigation system we 've developed known as 3d slam for simultaneous localization and mapping  
 depthx is an
  eyeball its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time allowing it to do new exploration while it 's still achieving geometric sensor lock on what it 's gone through already 
 what i 'm going to show you next
 is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground that 's ever been done
  're going to go from minus one thousand meters in zacaton and if we 're very lucky depthx will bring back the first
  division of bacteria  the next step after that is to test it in antartica and then if the funding continues
 and nasa has the resolution to go  we could potentially launch by two thousand and sixteen and by two thousand and nineteen we may have the first evidence of life off this planet 
 what then of manned space exploration  
 the government recently announced plans to return to the moon by
  the successful conclusion of that mission will result in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number of government scientists and pilots 
 it will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were fifty years ago 
 something fundamental has to change if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime what i 'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas
  and i hope you 'll bear with me and
 and have some faith that there 's credibility behind what we 're going to say here there are three underpinnings
 of working in space
 privately  one of them is the requirement for economical earth to space transport 
 the bert rutans and richard bransons of this world have got this in their sights and i salute them go go go
  the next thing we need are places to stay on orbit  orbital hotels to start with but workshops for the rest of us later on the final missing piece the real 
 is this a gas station on orbit  it 's not going to look like that 
 if it existed  it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning now
  to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement i 've got to give you the basics of space one hundred and one and the first thing is
 everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram
 anybody drink one of these here this week you 'd pay ten thousand dollars for that in orbit  that 's more than you pay for
 the second is more than ninety percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant  
 thus every time you 'd want to do anything in space 
 you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money every time you hit the accelerator not even the guys at tesla can fight that physics
  you could get your gas at a 10th the price 
 there is a place where you can in fact you can get it better you can get it at fourteen times lower if you can find propellant on the moon 
 there is a little known mission that was launched by the pentagon  thirteen years ago now called clementine and the most amazing thing that came out of that mission
 was a strong hydrogen signature at shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon
  that signal was so strong it could only have been produced
 by ten trillion tons of water buried in the sediment  
 collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material  
 if we 're going to get that and make that gas station
  we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space we can 't do that right now the way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces  
 we have to beat that 
 we can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics we can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything this is an idea that again 
 came out of livermore back in
  lowell wood 's group and we can extend that now
 to just about everything  bob bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit  we can go much further we can build space tugs  orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water 
 there 's another thing when you 're coming back from the moon 
 you have to deal with orbital mechanics it says you 're moving ten thousand feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station you got two choices you can burn rocket fuel to get there
 you can do something really incredible you can dive into the stratosphere and precisely dissipate that velocity and come back out to the space station  
 it has never been done  it 's risky and it 's going to be one hell of a ride
 better than disney  the traditional approach to space exploration
 has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency  if you try to do that for the moon you 're going to burn a billion dollars
  in fuel alone sending a crew out there  but if you send a mining team there without the return propellant first 
 did any of you guys hear the story of cortez 
 this is not like that i 'm much more like scotty i like this equipment you know and i really value it so we 're not going to burn the gear  but 
 if you were truly bold you could get it there
  manufacture it and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done 
 there 's a myth that you can 't do anything in space for less than a trillion dollars
 and twenty years that 's not true in seven years  we could pull off an industrial mission to shackleton and demonstrate that you could
 provide commercial reality out of this in low earth orbit  
 we 're living in one of the most exciting times in history  we 're at a magical confluence where private wealth and imagination are driving the demand for access to space  
 the orbital refueling stations i 've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration 
 to bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed  we can do it by jump starting with an industrial lewis and clark
  expedition to shackleton crater to mine the moon for resources and demonstrate they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit  
 talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities of purpose and timing  
 i would like to close here
 by putting a stake in the sand at ted  i intend to lead that expedition
  it can be done in seven years with the right backing  those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history
 and join other bold individuals from time past who had they been here today would have heartily approved
