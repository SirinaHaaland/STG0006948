  was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future 
 he had a vision  
 when he got out he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision  
 he 'd spent ten thousand dollars to buy a
  website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars 
 it was my first week in federal prison  
 and i was learning quickly that it wasn 't what you see on tv in fact it was teeming with smart  ambitious men
 business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the ceos who had wined and dined me six months earlier when i was a rising star in the missouri senate 
 now  ninety five percent of the guys that i was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside but when they talked about what they did 
 they talked about it
 in a different jargon but the business concepts that they talked about weren 't unlike those that you 'd learn in a first year mba class at wharton
  you never charge a first time user
 focus grouping new product launches  territorial expansion  
 but they didn 't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days for the most part  everyone was just trying to survive  
 it 's a lot harder than you might think  contrary to what
 most people think people
 don 't pay  taxpayers don 't pay for your life when you 're in prison you 've got to pay for your own life you 've got to pay for your soap your deodorant  toothbrush toothpaste all of it and it
 's hard for a couple of reasons first everything 's marked up thirty to fifty percent from what you 'd pay on the street and second  
 you don 't make a lot of money  i unloaded trucks  that was my full time job unloading trucks at a food warehouse
 all kinds of hustles there 's legal hustles  you pay everything in stamps those are the currency you charge another inmate to clean his cell 
 there 's sort of illegal hustles  like you run a barbershop out of your cell 
 there 's pretty illegal hustles  you run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell and there 's very illegal hustles  which you smuggle
  and just as in the outer world there 's a risk reward tradeoff so the riskier the enterprise the more profitable it can potentially be  you want a cigarette in prison  
 three to five dollars  
 you want an   old fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head three hundred bucks  
  you want a dirty magazine  well it can be as much as one thousand dollars  
 so as you can probably tell one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity  
 whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse  
 sculpting people 's hair with toenail clippers or constructing
 weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs
  prisoners learn how to make do with less and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they 've learned to the outside
 and start restaurants  barber shops  personal training businesses  but
 there 's no training nothing to prepare them for that no rehabilitation at all in prison  no one to help them write a business plan 
 figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into
  legal enterprises  no access to the internet even 
 and then  when they come out most states don 't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background
  so none of us should be surprised that two out of three
 within five years  
  i lied to the feds  i lost a year of my life
 from it 
 but when i came out 
 i vowed that i was going to do whatever i could to make sure that guys like the ones i was locked up with didn 't have to waste any more of their life than they already had
