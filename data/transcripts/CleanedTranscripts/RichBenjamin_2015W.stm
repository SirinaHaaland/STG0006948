  imagine a place where your neighbors greet your children by name 
 a place with splendid vistas a place where you can drive just twenty minutes and put your sailboat on the water it
 's a seductive place
  place isn 't it i don 't live there
  has posted at least six percent
 population growth since two thousand 
 secondly  the majority of that growth comes from white migrants  
 and third the whitopia has an ineffable charm a pleasant look and feel 
  are ticking i immersed myself for several months apiece in three of them
  1850s brigham young dispatched families to st george to grow cotton because of the hot arid climate  and so they called it utah 's dixie  
 and the name sticks to this day  
 i approached my time in each whitopia like an anthropologist i made detailed spreadsheets of all the power brokers in the communities
  who i needed to meet where i needed to be 
 and i threw myself with gusto in these communities  i went to zoning board meetings i went to democratic clubs and republican clubs 
 i went to poker nights 
 in st george i rented a home at the entrada one of the town 's premier gated communities
 there were no motel six 's or howard johnsons for me i lived in whitopia as a resident and not like a visitor  
 i rented myself this home
 by phone
  i went on my journey i had barely ever held a golf club 
 by the time i left  i was golfing at least three times a week 
 golf helps people bond  some of the best interviews i ever scored during my trip were on
  golf courses one venture capitalist for example invited me to golf
 in his private club that had no minority members  i also went fishing 
 because i had never fished this fellow had to teach me how to cast my line and what bait to use  
 i also played poker every
  my poker mates may have been bluffing about the hands that they drew but they weren 't bluffing about their social beliefs  some of the most raw salty conversations i ever had during my journey were at the poker table  
 i 'm a gung ho entertainer  
 i love to cook i hosted many
  and in return people invited me to their dinner parties  and to their barbecues and to their pool parties and to their birthday parties  
 but it wasn 't all fun 
 immigration turned out to be a big issue in this whitopia 
 the st george 's citizens council on illegal immigration held regular and active protests against immigration and so what i gleaned from this
  debate
 this would become it was a real time preview  and so it has become 
 next stop  almost heaven 
 a cabin i rented for myself in coeur d  'alene in the beautiful north idaho panhandle  
 i rented this place for myself also by phone 
  a thousand places to see before you die lists coeur d  'alene it 's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen boatmen and fishermen 
 my growing golf skills came in handy in coeur d 'alene i golfed with retired lapd cops in one thousand nine 
 around eleven thousand families and cops
  racial unrest for north idaho  and they 've built an expatriated community  
 given the conservatism of these cops there 's no surprise
 that north idaho has a strong gun culture
  in fact it is said north idaho has more gun dealers than gas stations 
 so what 's a resident to do
  to fit in 
 i hit the gun club 
 when i rented a gun the gentleman behind the counter was perfectly pleasant and kind  
 until i showed him my new york city driver 's license 
 that 's when he got nervous i
 'm not as bad a shot as i thought i might have been 
 what i learned from north idaho is the peculiar
 brand of paranoia that can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around 
 in north idaho  in my red
 pickup truck i kept a notepad  and in that notepad i counted more confederate flags than
 black people 
 in north idaho  i found confederate flags on key chains 
 on cellphone paraphernalia and on cars 
 about a seven minute drive from my hidden lake cabin was the compound of aryan nations the white supremacist group 
 america 's promise 
  during my visit so i decided to crash it i
 'm the only non aryan journalist i 'm aware of ever to have done so 
 among the many memorable episodes of that retreat is when abe
  sidled up next to me he slapped my knee and he said hey rich i just want you to know one thing  
 we are not white supremacists we are white separatists  we don 't think we 're better than you we just want to be away from you
  fact they 're not there for explicitly racial reasons at all  rather they emigrate there for friendliness  comfort security safety
 reasons that they implicitly associate to whiteness in itself next stop was georgia  
 in georgia  i stayed in an exurb north of atlanta
  in utah i found poker in idaho i found guns  in georgia i found god 
 the way that i immersed myself in this whitopia
 was to become active at first redeemer church a megachurch that 's so huge that it has golf carts to escort the congregants around its many
 parking lots on campus  i was active in the youth ministry
 and for me personally  
 i was more comfortable in this whitopia than say in a colorado or an idaho  or even a suburban boston 
 that is because [ there ] in georgia  white people and black people are more historically familiar to one another  i was less
  at the level of conscious and unconscious bias it 's possible
  not for racist reasons though it has racist outcomes 
 many whitopians feel pushed by illegals social welfare abuse
  how a country can have racism without racists 
 many of my smug urban liberal friends couldn 't believe i would go on such a venture  
 the reality is that many white americans
  interpersonal race relations how we treat each other as human beings are vastly better
 than in my parents ' generation 
 can you imagine me going to whitopia forty years ago what a journey that would have been 
 and yet some things haven 't changed america is as 
  and seventy 
 as americans we often find ways to cook for each other 
 to dance with each other to host with each other  
 but why can 't that translate into how we treat each other as communities it 's a devastating irony 
 how we have gone forward as individuals
 as communities  
 one of the whitopian outlooks that really hit me
 was a proverbial saying one black man is a delightful dinner guest  fifty black men is a ghetto 
  white people will no longer be the american majority as such will there be more 
 in looking at this  the danger of whitopia is
 that the more segregation we have the less we
  look at and confront conscious and unconscious bias  
 i ventured on my 
 thousand mile journey to learn where why and how white people are fleeing but i didn 't expect to have so much fun on my
  i didn 't expect to learn so much about myself  
 i don 't expect i 'll be living in a  whitopia or a blacktopia for that matter 
 i do plan to continue golfing every chance i get 
 and i 'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches
