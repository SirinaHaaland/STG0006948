  start with a question that has just been
 consuming me since i first became familiar with your work in you work there 's always this kind of hybrid quality of a natural force
 in some sort of interplay with creative force
 are they ever in equilibrium
 in the way that you see your work tom shannon yeah  the subject matter that i 'm looking for it 's usually to solve a question i
 had the question popped into my head what does the cone that connects the sun and and the earth look like if you could connect the two spheres 
 and in proportion what would
  the size of the sphere and the length and what would the taper be to the earth 
 and so i went about and made that sculpture  turning it out of solid bronze and
 i did one that was about thirty five feet long the sun end was about four inches in diameter and then it tapered over
 about thirty five feet to
 about a millimeter at the earth end and so for me it was really exciting just to see
 what it looks like if you could step outside
 and into a larger context  as though you were an astronaut and see these two things as an object  because they
 are so intimately bound and one is meaningless without the other jh is there a relief
 in playing with these forces  and i 'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces
  that that silver one there that was the result of hundreds of experiments with magnets trying to find a way to make something float
 with the least possible connection to the ground so
 i got it down to just one tether to be able to support that jh now is this electromagnetic here or are these
 static ts those are
  the magnetic works are a combination of gravity
 and and magnetism so it 's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything  the sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the
  and the earth 's magnetic field protects us from the sun so
 there 's this huge invisible shape structures that
 that magnetism takes in the universe  but
 with the pendulum  it allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets magnets up my
 sculptures are
  normally very simplified i try to refine them down to
 very simple forms but the paintings become very complex because i think the fields
 that are supporting them they 're billowing and they 're interpenetrating and  they 're interference patterns jh and they 're 
  i mean you don 't know necessarily where you 're headed when you begin  even though the forces can be calculated
  first one i did was in the late seventy 's and i just had a simple
 cone with a spigot at the bottom of it 
 i threw it into an orbit and it only had one color and
 when it got to the center the paint kept running out so i had to run in there didn 't have any control over the spigot remotely  
 so that told me right away i need a remote control device
  i started dreaming of having six colors  i sort of think about it as the dna these colors  the red blue yellow  the primary colors and white and black and 
 if you put them together in different combinations just like printing in a sense like how a magazine color is printed and put them under certain forces  
  these amazing things started appearing jh it looks like we 're loaded for bear here ts yeah  well let 's put a couple of canvases i 'll ask a
 couple of my sons to set up the canvases
  going to throw this into an orbit and see if i can paint everybody 's shoes in the front
  as a demo  and it 's more playful  but
 inevitably
 all of this can be used  i can redeem this painting just continuing on 
 doing layers upon layers and i keep it around for a couple of weeks
  do another session with it and bring it up to another level where all of this becomes
 the background  the depth of it jh that 's fantastic 
 so the valves at the bottom of those tubes there are
 and they can pinch them very tight and stop it or you can have them wide open 
 and all all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom you can always be changing colors put aluminum paint or i could put anything into this it could be
 tomato sauce
  so many forces there you 've got gravity you 've got the centrifugal force you 've got the fluid dynamics
  each of these beautiful paintings are they
 images in and of themselves or are they records of a physical event
  i wanted to do something very simple a simple iconic image of two two ripples interfering  so the one on the right was done first  
 and then the one on the left was done over over it and then i left gaps so you could see the one that was done before  and then when i did the second one 
 it really disturbed the piece these big blue lines
 crashing through
 so it created a kind of tension and an overlap  there are lines in front of the one on the right and there are lines behind the one on the left and so it
 takes it into different planes what it 's also about just the little events 
  two things that happened there 's an interference pattern and then a third thing happens there are shapes that come about just by the marriage of two
 two events that are happening
 very interested in that like the occurrence of moire patterns like this green one this is a painting i did about
 ten years ago  but it has some see in the upper third
  there there are these moires and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery and that 's something that in painting i 've never seen
 done i 've never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns  which are
 so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives
  is that a literal part of the image or is my eye
 making that interference pattern is my eye completing that interference pattern ts it is the paint actually
  makes it real  
 it 's really manifested there if i throw a very concentric circle or concentric ellipse  it just dutifully makes these
 evenly spaced lines  which get closer and closer together  
 which describes how gravity works there 's something very appealing about the exactitude of science that that i really enjoy and i love the shapes
 that i see in in scientific
 observations and apparatus especially astronomical forms
 and the idea of the vastness of it the scale is very interesting to me
  in recent years has kind of shifted more toward biology  some of these paintings when you look at them very close  
 odd things appear that really look like horses or birds or
 crocodiles  elephants there are lots of things that appear when you look into it it 's sort of like looking at cloud patterns but sometimes they 're very modeled and
  and then there are all these forms that we don 't know what they are but they 're equally  well resolved and complex  
 so i think conceivably those could be predictive  because since
 it has the ability to make
 forms that look like forms that we 're familiar with in biology
 it 's also making other forms that we 're not familiar with and maybe it 's the kind of forms we 'll discover underneath
  at this stage in your life  you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant
 i suppose it 's an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your parkinson 's and this creative force that
 both the the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life  is that 
 as it turns out this device kind of comes in handy because i don 't have to have the the fine motor skills
 to do that i can operate slides which is
  more of a mental process  i 'm looking at it and making decisions it needs more red it needs
 more blue it needs a different shape and so i make these creative decisions
 and can execute them in a much much simpler way  i mean i 've got the symptoms
 i guess parkinson 's kind of creeps up over the years but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms
  my left hand has a significant tremor and my left leg also  i 'm left handed and so i i draw all my
 creations really start on small drawings  which i have thousands of and it 's my way of just thinking i draw with a
 simple pencil and at
  parkinson 's was really upsetting because
 i couldn 't get the pencil to stand still jh so you 're not a gatekeeper for these forces you don 't think of yourself as the
 master of these forces you think of yourself as the servant ts nature is
 well it 's a godsend  it just
 has so much in it and i think nature wants wants to express itself in the sense that
 we are nature humans are of the universe
  the universe is in our mind and our minds are in the universe and we are
 expressions of the universe  basically as humans
 ultimately being part of the universe we 're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency
  to interface with it with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere
 act and show what they can do  giving them pigment and paint just like an artist 
 it 's a good ally  it 's a terrific studio assistant jh well i love the idea that somewhere within
 this idea of fine motion and control with the traditional skills that you have with your hand
  some sort of more elemental force gets revealed  and that 's the beauty here
