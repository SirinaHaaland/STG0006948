  for those of you who haven 't seen dancing bears these are the dancing bears in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five we started working on a two year investigative research project to try and find out what was going on because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted because of this 
  the qalandar community they are a marginalized islamic community who live across india  and have been in india since the 13th century  
 we went about getting evidence of what was going on and this is footage from a hidden camera in a button  
 and we went in pretending to be buyers and we found this right in this very state in karnataka
  bear cubs were being harvested from across
 the country and being sold and traded these were being sold for about two thousand dollars each and they are used for bear paw soup  and also being trained
 later on to become dancing bears like the one you just saw  
 sadly the family of qalandars depended on this bear 
 the couple are barely eighteen years old they already have four children beside them you can see them 
  the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals so we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner 
 now when we started working deeper and digging deeper we found that it 's an illegal act  these guys could go to jail for up to seven years if they were caught by authorities  
 and what they were doing to the bears was really appalling it was unacceptable 
 the mother bears are usually killed the cubs which are taken are
  teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod  and they use a red hot iron needle to
 make a hole through the muzzle 
 now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that for a livelihood to getting something else so this is bitu qalandar who was our first experiment and we were so unsure that this would work we weren 't sure at all  
 and we managed to convince him and we said okay here is some seed fund  let 's see if you can get something
  and we got the bear surrendered to we set up a sanctuary  we have four sanctuaries in india and now he sells cool drinks he 's by the highway he has
 a telephone booth  and then it started there was no turning back after that 
 this is sadua who came and surrendered his bear and now he runs a cattle fodder store and a grain store near agra 
 then there was no looking back at all for us  we gave cycle rickshaws  we set up
  vocational training for the women the women were just not allowed to come out of the community and work with mainstream society so we were able to address that 
 education the kids never went to school they only had islamic education very little of it and they were never allowed to go to school because they were an extra earning hand at home so we managed to get education so we sponsor six hundred
 children education programs today  we were able to ensure brighter futures for these people of course we also had
  get the bears in this is what happens to the bears when they come in and this is what we turn them into
 we have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers  so basically in two thousand and two there were one thousand two hundred dancing bears  
 we rescued over five hundred and fifty dancing bears  we 've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears
