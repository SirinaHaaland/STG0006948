  how many people here have heard of pms
  everybody right everyone knows that women go a little crazy right before they get their period 
 that the menstrual cycle throws them onto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster of irrationality and
  irritability  there 's a general assumption that fluctuations in reproductive hormones cause extreme emotions
 and that the great majority of women are affected by this well
 i am here to tell you that scientific evidence says neither of those assumptions is true  i 'm here to give you the good news about pms  
  let 's take a look at how firmly the idea of pms is entrenched in american culture  
 if you examine newspaper or magazine articles you 'll see how widely assumed it is that everyone gets pms 
 in an article in the magazine redbook
 titled you pms free readers were informed that between eighty to ninety percent of women suffer from pms
  muscle magazine warned its readers
 that forty to fifty percent of women suffer from pms and that it plays a major role in women 's mental and physical health  
 and a couple of years ago even the wall street journal ran an article on calcium as a treatment for pms  asking its female readers do you turn into a witch every month 
 from all these articles you would think there must be a mountain of research verifying the widespread nature of pms
  however after five decades of research 
 there 's no strong consensus on the definition the cause the treatment or even the existence of pms 
 as most commonly defined by psychologists 
 pms involves negative behavioral cognitive and physical symptoms from the time of ovulation to menstruation 
 but here 's where it gets tricky over one
  hundred and fifty different symptoms have been used to diagnose pms and here are just a few of those 
 now i want to be clear here i 'm not saying women don 't get some of these symptoms 
 what i 'm saying is that getting some of these symptoms doesn 't amount to a mental disorder 
 and when psychologists come up with a
  that 's so vaguely defined the label eventually becomes meaningless 
 with a list of symptoms this long and wide i could have pms you could have pms  the guy in the third row here could have pms  my dog could have pms 
 some researchers said you had to have five symptoms some said three 
 other researchers said that symptoms were only meaningful if they were highly disturbing to you but others said minor symptoms were just as important
 for many years because there was no standardization in the definition of pms  
 when psychologists tried to report prevalence rates their estimates ranged from five percent of women to ninety seven percent of women  
 so at the same time almost no one and almost everyone had pms  
  the weaknesses in the methods of research on pms have been considerable 
 first many studies asked women to report their symptoms retrospectively looking to the past and relying on memory  which is known to inflate reporting of pms
 compared to what 's called prospective reporting  which involves keeping a daily log of symptoms for at least two months in a row 
 many studies also exclusively focused on white
 middle class women  which makes it problematic to apply study findings to all women  
 we know there 's a strong cultural component to the belief in pms because it 's nearly unheard of outside of western nations 
 third many studies failed to use control groups 
 if we want to understand the specific characteristics of women who have pms we need to be able to compare them to women who don 't have pms
 and finally many different types of questionnaires were used to diagnose pms focusing on different symptoms symptom duration and severity 
 to do reliable research on any condition scientists must agree on the specific characteristics that make up that condition so they 're all talking about the same thing
  this has not been the case
  according to these new dsm guidelines 
 in most menstrual cycles in the last year at least five of eleven possible symptoms must appear in the week before menstruation starts 
 the symptoms must improve once menstruation has begun and the symptoms must be absent the week after menstruation has ended 
 one of these symptoms must come from this list of four
 marked mood swings irritability  anxiety or depression 
 the other symptoms could come from the first slide or from those on the second slide including symptoms like feeling out of control and changes in sleep or appetite 
 the dsm also required now that the symptoms should be associated with clinically significant distress
 there should be some kind of disturbance in work or school or social relationships
 and that symptoms and symptom severity should now be documented by keeping a daily log for at least two cycles in a row  
 and finally  the dsm required that the emotional disturbance should be more than simply an exacerbation of an already existing disorder  
 so scientifically speaking this
 we now have a limited number of symptoms and a high impact on functioning that 's required 
 and the reporting and timing of symptoms have both become very specific 
 well  using this criteria and looking at most recent studies we see that on average  three to
  not all women  not most women  not the majority of women not even a lot of women  three to eight percent 
 for everyone else variables like stressful events or happy occasions or even day of the week are more powerful predictors of mood than time of the month  
 and this is the information the scientific community has had since the 
 in two thousand and two
  my colleagues and i published an article describing the pms and pmdd research and several similar articles have appeared in psychology journals  
 the questions is why hasn 't this information trickled down to the public  why do these myths persist well
 certainly the onslaught of messages that women
  from books tv movies the internet that everyone gets pms go a long way in convincing them it must be true  
 research tells us that the more a woman believes that everyone gets pms the more likely she is to erroneously report that she has it let me tell you what i mean by erroneously 
 you might ask her do you have pms and she says yes  
  when you have her keep a daily log of psychological symptoms for two months no correlation is found between her symptoms and time of the month  
 another reason
 for the persistence of the pms myth has to do with the narrow boundaries of the feminine role 
 feminist psychologists like joan chrisler have suggested
 that taking on the label of pms allows women to express emotions that would otherwise be considered
  the near universal definition of a good woman
 is one who is happy loving caring for others and taking great satisfaction from that role well pms has become a permission slip
 to be angry complain be irritated  without losing the title of good woman 
 we know that the variables in a woman 's environment
 are much more likely to cause her to be angry than her hormones
  but when she attributes anger to hormones she 's absolved of responsibility or criticism oh that 's not who she is it 's out of her control 
 and while this can be a useful tool 
 it serves to invalidate women 's emotions when people respond to a woman 's anger with the thought oh 
  's just that time of the month her ability to be taken seriously or effect change is severely limited 
 so who else benefits from the myth of pms  
 well i can tell you that treating pms has become a profitable thriving industry
 amazon com currently offers over one thousand nine hundred books on pms treatment 
 a quick google search will bring up a cornucopia of clinics workshops and seminars
 reputable internet sources of medical information like webmd or the mayo clinic list pms as a known disorder it 's not a known disorder but they list it 
 and they also list the medications that physicians have prescribed to treat it like anti depressants or hormones  
 interestingly though both websites say that the success of medication
 in treating pms
  symptoms vary from woman to woman 
 well that doesn 't make sense 
 if you 've got a distinct disorder with a distinct cause which pms is supposed to be then the treatment should bring improvement for a great number of women  
 this has not been the case with these treatments 
 and fda regulations say that for a drug to be deemed effective a large portion of the target population should see clinically significant improvement
  so we have not had that at all with these so called treatments  
 however  the financial gain of perpetuating the myth that pms is a common mental disorder and is treatable
 is quite substantial 
 when women are prescribed drugs like anti depressants or hormones 
 medical protocol requires that they have physician follow up every three months that 's a lot of doctor visits
  visits 
 pharmaceutical companies reap untold profits when women are convinced they should take a prescribed medication for all of their  child bearing lives 
 over the counter drugs like midol even claim to treat pms symptoms like tension and irritability  even though they only contain a diuretic
  a pain reliever and caffeine 
 now far be it from me to argue with the magical powers of caffeine  but i don 't think reducing tension is one of them 
 since two thousand and two midol has marketed a teen midol to adolescents 
 they are aiming at young girls early 
 to convince them that everyone gets pms and that it will make you a monster  but wait there 's something you can do about it take midol and you will be a human being again
  in two thousand and thirteen midol took in forty eight million dollars in sales revenue 
 so while perpetuating the myth of pms has been lucrative for some it comes with some serious adverse consequences for women  
 first it contributes to the medicalization of women 's reproductive health 
  the medical field has a long history of conceptualizing women 's reproductive processes as illnesses that require treatment  
 and this has come at many costs including excessive cesarean deliveries hysterectomies
 and prescribed hormone treatments that have harmed rather than enhanced women 's health  
 second the pms myth also contributes to the stereotype
  when the menstrual cycle is described as a hormonal roller coaster that turns women into angry beasts 
 it becomes easy to question the competence of all women 
 women have made tremendous strides in the workforce but still there 's a minuscule number of women at the highest echelons of fields like government or business  
 and when we think about who makes for a good ceo or senator
  who has qualities like rationality  steadiness competence come to mind 
 and in our culture  that sounds more like a man than a woman and the pms myth contributes to that 
 psychologists know that the moods of men and women are more similar than different one study
 followed men and women for four to six months
 and found that the number of mood swings they experienced and the severity of those mood swings were no different  
 and finally the pms myth keeps women from dealing with the actual issues causing them emotional upset 
 individual issues like quality of relationship or work conditions
 or societal issues like racism or sexism or the daily grind of poverty are all strongly related to daily mood
 sweeping emotions under the rug of pms
 keeps women from understanding the source of their negative emotions but it also takes away the opportunity to take any action to change them 
 so the good news about pms is that while some women get some symptoms because of the menstrual cycle the great majority don 't get a mental disorder
  they go to work or school take care of their families and function at a normal level 
 we know the emotions and moods of men and women are more similar than different 
 so let 's walk away from the tired old pms myth of women as witches
 and embrace the reality of high emotional and professional functioning the great majority of women live every day thank you
