  i headed back to the corner
 to head west en route to a braille training session it was the winter of two thousand and nine  and i had been blind for about a year things were going pretty well
  safely reaching the other side  i turned to the left  pushed the auto button for the audible pedestrian signal  and waited my turn as it went off i took off
 and safely got to the other side  stepping onto the sidewalk  i then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me
  there 's a cafe on the corner and they have chairs out in front so i just adjusted to the left to get closer to the street as i did  
 so slid the chair 
 i just figured i 'd made a mistake and went back to the right and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity  
 now i was getting a little anxious i
 went back to the left and so slid the chair  blocking my path of travel  now i was officially freaking out 
 so i yelled
 who the hell 's out there what 's going on 
 just then over my shout i heard something else a familiar rattle it
 sounded familiar  and i quickly considered another possibility  and i reached out with my left hand as my fingers brushed against something
 fuzzy  and i came across an ear the ear of a dog  perhaps a golden retriever
  its leash had been tied to the chair as her master went in for coffee  and she was just persistent in her efforts to greet me  perhaps get a scratch behind the ear  
 who knows  maybe she was volunteering for service laughter
 but that little story is really about the the fears and misconceptions that come along
 with the idea of moving through the city without sight  seemingly oblivious
 to the environment and the people around you  
 so let me step back and set the stage a little bit on
 st patrick 's day of two thousand and eight  i reported reported to the hospital for surgery to remove a brain tumor 
 the surgery was successful two days later my sight started to fail on the third day  it was gone
  i was struck by an incredible sense of fear of confusion of vulnerability like anybody would 
 but as i had time to stop and think i actually started to realize i had a lot to be grateful for 
 in particular  i thought about my dad  who had passed away from complications
  i was seven at the time 
 so although i had every reason
 to be fearful of what was ahead and had no clue quite what was going to happen i was alive my son still had his dad  
 and besides it 's not like i was the first person ever to lose their sight  i knew there had to be all sorts of systems and techniques and training to have
 to live a full and meaningful  active life
  without sight  
 so by the time i was discharged from the hospital a few days later  i left with a mission a mission to get out and get the best training as quickly as i could
 and get on to rebuilding my life 
 within six months i had returned to work 
 my training had started i even started riding a tandem bike with my old cycling buddies and was commuting to work on
  my own walking through town and taking the bus  it was a lot of hard work 
 but what i didn 't anticipate through that that rapid transition
 was
 the incredible experience of the juxtaposition of my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience of the same places and the same people
 within such a short period of time
  from that came a lot of insights or outsights as i called them  things that i learned since losing my sight  
 these  outsights ranged from the the trival to the profound from the mundane to the humorous 
 as an architect 
 that stark juxtaposition of my sighted and unsighted experience of the same
 places and the same cities within such a short period of time has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights of the city
 itself  paramount amongst those
 was the realization that actually  cities are fantastic places for the blind  and then i was also surprised
 by the city 's propensity for kindness and care
 as opposed to indifference or worse  and then i started to realize that it seemed like the blind seemed to have a
  positive influence on the city itself that was a little curious to me  
 let me step back and take a look at why the city is so so good for the blind  
 inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss is is learning to rely
  things that you would otherwise maybe ignore it
 's like a whole new world of sensory information opens up to you 
 i was really struck by the symphony of subtle sounds all around me in the city that you can hear and work with to understand where you are 
 how you need to move and where you need to go  
 similarly  just through the grip of the cane you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below 
 and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you 're headed
  similarly just the sun warming one side of your face or the wind at your neck
 gives you clues about your alignment
 and your progression through a block and your your movement through time and space  
 but also the sense of smell  some districts and cities have their own smell as do places and things around you 
 and if you 're lucky you can even follow your nose to that new bakery
  that you 've been looking for all this really surprised me  because i started to realize
 that my unsighted experienced was so far more multi sensory than my sighted experience ever was 
 what struck me also was how much the city was changing around me
  lose your sight though and it 's a whole other story  
 and i don 't know who 's watching who but i have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me
  and i 'm not paranoid but everywhere i go i 'm getting all sorts of advice 
 go here move there watch out for this a lot of the information is good some of it 's helpful a lot
 's kind of reversed you 've got to figure out what they actually meant 
 some of it 's kind of wrong and not helpful  
 but it 's
  all good in the grand scheme of things  but one time i was in oakland walking along broadway  and came to a corner i was waiting for an an audible pedestrian signal 
 and as it went off i was just about to step out into the street when all of a sudden my
 right hand was just gripped by this guy  and
  yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street speaking to me in mandarin it 's
 like there was no escape from this man 's death grip  
 but he got me safely there what could i do  
 but believe me there are more polite ways to offer assistance  we don 't know you 're there  so it 's kind of nice to say hello first would you like some help 
 but
 while in oakland  i 've really been struck by how much the city
  of oakland changed as i lost my sight  
 i liked it sighted  it was fine it 's a perfectly great city but once i lost my sight and was walking
 along broadway  i was blessed every block of the way
  and even without sight i don 't get that in san francisco  and
 i know it bothers some of my blind friends it 's not just me  often it 's thought that that 's an emotion that comes up out of pity 
 i tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity out of our togetherness  and i think it 's
 pretty cool in fact if i 'm feeling down i just go to broadway in downtown oakland i go for a walk and i feel better like that in no time at all
  but also that it illustrates how disability and blindness sort of cuts across ethnic  social  racial  economic lines 
 disability is an  equal opportunity provider  everybody 's welcome
  i 've heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people 
 there are those with disabilities and there are those that haven 't quite found theirs yet  
 it 's a different way of thinking about it but i think it 's kind of beautiful  because it is certainly far more inclusive than the
  so my final takeaway for you is that
 not only is the city good for the blind  but the city needs us  
 and i 'm so sure of that that i want to propose to you today that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities 
 and not the people that are thought about after the mold has already been cast it 's too late
 so if you design a city with the blind in mind you 'll have a rich  walkable network of sidewalks
 with a dense array of options and choices all available
 at the street level  if you design a city with the blind in mind  sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous the space between buildings will be
  in fact  cars  who needs them  if you 're blind you don 't drive 
 they don 't like it when you drive 
 laughter if you design a city with the blind in mind  you design a city with a robust  accessible well connected mass transit system
 that connects all parts of the city and the region all around
  if you design a city with the blind in in mind there 'll be jobs  lots of jobs blind people want to work too they want to earn a living 
 so in designing a city for the blind  i hope you start to realize
 that it actually
 would be a more inclusive a more equitable a more just city for all and based on my prior sighted experience it sounds like a pretty cool city
  whether you 're blind whether you have a disability or you haven 't quite found yours yet
