  i first became fascinated with octopus at an early age i grew up in mobile  alabama
 somebody 's got to be from mobile right and mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers forming this beautiful delta 
 and the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping
  with snakes birds of every flavor it 's an absolute magical wonderland
 to live in if you 're a kid interested in animals to grow up in and this delta water flows to mobile bay and finally into the gulf of mexico  
 and i remember my first real contact with octopus was probably at age five or six i was in the gulf 
 and i was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom
  i reached down and picked him up and immediately became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility  it was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand it was all i could do to hold onto this amazing creature 
 then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands and started flashing colors just pulsing all of these colors  and as i looked at it 
 it kind of tucked its arms under it  raised into a spherical shape and turned chocolate brown
  i had never seen anything like this in my life  so i marveled for a moment and then decided it was time to release him so i put him down 
 the octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing it landed on the the bottom in the rubble and fwoosh 
 vanished right before my eyes  and i knew right then at age six that is an animal that i want to learn more about so i did  
 and i went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology and then moved to hawaii and entered graduate school
  the university of hawaii and while a student
 at hawaii i worked at the waikiki aquarium and the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays and being the spineless guy i thought well i 'll just go 
  out in the field and collect these wonderful animals i had been learning about as a student and bring them in and i built these elaborate sets and put them on display 
 but they didn 't really interact with people 
 but the octopus did if you walked up to an octopus tank especially early in the morning before anyone arrived  the octopus would rise up and look at you and you 're thinking is that guy
 really looking at me he is looking at me 
 and you walk up to the front of the tank then you realize that these animals all have different personalities some of them would hold their ground others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks
 and one in particular this amazing animal 
 i went up to the front of the tank and he 's just staring at me and he had little horns come up above his eyes  so i went right up to the front of the tank i was
 three or four inches from the front glass and the octopus was sitting on a perch 
 a little rock and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass so i was staring at this animal
 about six or seven inches away and at that time i could actually focus
  that close now as i look at my fuzzy fingers i realize those days are long gone  anyway there we were staring at each other 
 and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank from the filtration system and chk chk chk chk chk 
 this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down he reaches up takes another armful of gravel releases it
  i lift an arm then he lifts another arm
 and i lift another arm and then i realize the octopus won the arms race because i was out and he had six left 
 but the only way i can describe what i was seeing that day was that this octopus was playing which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate
  about three years into my degree 
 a funny thing happened on the way to the office which actually changed the course of my life a man came into the aquarium it 's
 a long story but essentially he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the south pacific
 to collect animals for him  and as we left he gave us two  16 millimeter movie cameras he said make a movie about this expedition 
 ok a couple of biologists making a movie this
  and off we went and we did we made a movie which had to be the worst movie ever made in the history of movie making but it was a blast i had so much fun  
 and i remember that proverbial light going off in my head thinking wait a minute 
 maybe i can do this all the time  
 yeah i 'll be a filmmaker so i literally came back from that job quit school hung my filmmaking shingle and just never told anyone that i didn 't know what i was doing it
 's been a good ride
 and what i learned in school though was really beneficial if you 're a wildlife filmmaker and
  going out into the field to film animals especially behavior it helps to have a fundamental
 background on who these animals are how they work and you know a bit about their behaviors  but where i really learned about octopus
 was in the field as a filmmaker
 making films with them where you 're allowed to spend large periods of time with the animals seeing octopus being octopus
 in their ocean homes
  homes i remember i took a trip to australia 
 went to an island called one tree island and apparently evolution had occurred at a pretty rapid rate on one tree between the time they named it and the time i arrived because i 'm sure there were at least three trees on that island when we were there 
 anyway one tree is situated right next to a beautiful coral reef in fact there 's a surge channel where the tide is moving back and forth twice a day
  rapidly and there 's a beautiful reef very complex reef with lots of animals including a lot of octopus 
 and not uniquely but certainly the octopus in australia are masters at camouflage as a matter of fact  
 there 's one right there 
 so our first challenge was to find these things and that was a challenge indeed  but
  the idea is we were there for a month
 and i wanted to acclimate the animals to us so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them so the first week was pretty much spent just getting as close as we could every day a little closer a little closer a little closer and you knew what the limit was they would start getting twitchy and you 'd back up 
 come back in a few hours  and after the first week  they ignored us  it was like i don 't know what that thing is but he 's no threat to me so they went on about their business
  and from a foot away we 're watching mating and courting and fighting and it is just an unbelievable experience  and one of the most fantastic displays that i remember 
 or at least visually 
 was a foraging behavior  
 and they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for foraging but this particular one used vision  and they would see
 a coral head maybe ten feet away  and start moving over
  toward that coral head  and i don 't know whether they actually saw crab in it or imagined that one might be but whatever the case they would leap off the bottom and go through the water and land 
  right on top of this coral head  and then the web between the arms would completely engulf the coral head and they would fish out swim for crabs  and as soon as the crabs touched the arm  it was lights out and i always wondered what happened under that web 
  if you 're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals you might as well pick one that 's fairly common and octopus are they live in all the oceans they also live deep  
 and i can 't say octopus are responsible for my really strong interest in getting in subs and going deep but whatever the case i like that 
 it 's like nothing you 've ever done if you ever really
 want to get away from it all and see something that you have never seen and have an excellent chance of seeing something no one
 has ever seen get in a sub you climb in seal the hatch turn on a little oxygen turn on the scrubber which removes the co2 in the air you breathe  and they chuck you overboard down you go there 's no connection to the surface apart from a pretty funky radio  
 and as you go down the washing machine at the surface
 calms down and it gets quiet  and it starts
  and as you go deeper that lovely blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue 
 and finally it 's a rich lavender and after a couple of thousand feet it 's ink black 
 and now you 've entered the realm of the mid water community 
 you could give an entire talk
 about the creatures that live in the mid water suffice to say though as far as i 'm concerned
  without question the most bizarre designs and outrageous behaviors
 are in the animals that live in the mid water community 
 but we 're just going to zip right past this area this area that includes about ninety five percent of the living space on our planet
 and go to the mid ocean ridge  which i think is even more extraordinary the mid ocean ridge is a huge mountain range forty thousand miles long snaking around the
  they 're big mountains thousands of feet tall some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface creating islands like hawaii 
 and the top of this mountain range is splitting apart 
 creating a rift valley and when you dive into that rift valley that 's where the action is because literally thousands of active volcanoes are going off at any point in time all along this forty thousand mile range  and as these tectonic
  plates are spreading apart magma lava is coming up and filling those gaps and you 're looking land new land being created right before your eyes  and over the tops of them is 
  three thousand to four thousand meters of water creating enormous pressure forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth until it hits a magma chamber where it becomes superheated 
 and supersaturated with minerals reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at yellowstone in fact this whole area
 is like a yellowstone national park with all of the trimmings  and this vent fluid is about six hundred or seven hundred degrees f the surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing so it immediately cools  
 and it can no longer hold in suspension
 all of the material that it 's dissolved  and it precipitates out forming black smoke  and it forms these towers these chimneys that are ten twenty thirty feet tall 
 and all along the sides of these chimneys
  is shimmering with heat and loaded with life you 've got black smokers going all over the place and chimneys that have tube worms that might be eight to ten feet long 
 and out of the tops of these tube worms are these beautiful red plumes and living amongst the tangle of tube worms is an entire community of animals shrimp fish 
  clams and swarms of arthropods that are playing that dangerous game between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold and this whole ecosystem wasn 't even known about
 until thirty three years ago  
 and it completely threw science on its head
  it made scientists rethink where life on earth might have actually begun and before the discovery of these vents
  all life on earth the key to life on earth was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis but down there there is no sun there is no photosynthesis  
 it 's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it and it 's all so ephemeral 
 you might film this unbelievable hydrothermal vent which you think at the time has to be on another planet it 's amazing to think that this is actually on earth  it looks like aliens in an alien environment  
 but you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead
  there 's no hot water 
 all of the animals are gone they 're dead  and the chimneys are still there creating a really nice ghost town 
 an eerie spooky ghost town but essentially devoid of animals of course but
 ten miles down the ridge pshhh there 's another volcano going  and there 's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has
  and this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every thirty or forty years all along the ridge  and that ephemeral nature
 of the hydrothermal vent community isn 't really different
 from some of the areas that i 've seen in thirty five years of traveling around making films where
 you go and film a really nice sequence at a at a bay  and you go back and i 'm at home and i 'm thinking okay what can i shoot ah
  i know where i can shoot that there 's this beautiful bay lots of soft corals and stomatopods and you show up and it 's dead  
 there 's no coral algae growing on it and the water 's pea soup you think 
 well what happened 
 and you turn around and there 's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth and over here
 there 's a golf course going in and this is the
  it 's raining like crazy here so this rainwater is flooding down the hillside carrying with it sediments from the construction site smothering the coral and killing it 
 and fertilizers and pesticides are flowing into the bay from the golf course
 the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom and there 's your pea soup 
 but encouragingly i 've seen just the opposite i 've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay
  of the island  
 five years later come back and that same bay is now gorgeous  it 's beautiful 
 it 's got living coral fish all over the place crystal clear water and you go how did that happen 
 well how it happened is the local community
 galvanized they recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it  enacted laws and made permits required to do responsible construction and golf course maintenance and stopped the
  sediments flowing into the bay and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay and the bay recovered the ocean has an amazing ability to recover if we 'll just leave it alone 
 i think margaret mead said it best  
 she said that a small group of thoughtful people could change the world  indeed it 's the only thing that ever has 
 and a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay
 'm a big fan of grassroots organizations i 've been to a lot of lectures
 where at the end of it  
 inevitably one of the first questions that comes up is but but what can i do i 'm an individual i 'm one person and these problems are so large and global and it 's just overwhelming 
 fair enough question my answer to that is don 't look at the big overwhelming issues of the world look in your own backyard
 look in your heart actually what do you really care about that isn 't right where you live and fix it 
 create a healing zone in your neighborhood and encourage others to do the same and maybe these healing zones can
 sprinkle a map little dots on a map and in fact the way that we can communicate today
 where alaska is instantly knowing what 's going on in china and the kiwis did this and then over in england they tried to
  and everybody is talking to everyone else it 's not isolated points on a map anymore it 's a network we 've created 
 and maybe these healing zones can start growing and possibly even overlap and good things can happen so that 's how i answer that question 
 look in your own backyard in fact look in the mirror what can you do that is more responsible than what you 're doing now 
 and do that and spread the word 
 the vent community
  animals can 't really do much about the life and death that 's going on where they live  
 but up here we can in theory we 're thinking rational human beings  
 and we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment like those people changed the health of that bay  
 now sylvia 's ted prize wish
 was to beseech us to do anything we could
  we could to set aside not pin pricks but significant expanses
 of the ocean for preservation hope spots she calls them  and i applaud that i loudly applaud that  and it 's my hope
 that some of these hope spots can be in the deep ocean an area that has has historically
 been seriously neglected if not abused the term
  six comes to mind if it 's too big or too toxic for a landfill deep six it 
 so i hope that we can also keep some of these hope spots in the deep sea 
 now  
 i don 't get a wish  but
 i certainly can say that i will do anything i can to support sylvia earle 's wish  and that i do
