  german girl called vera brandes
 walked out onto the stage of the cologne opera house  
 the auditorium was empty it was lit only by the dim green glow of the
  emergency exit sign 
 this was the most exciting day of vera 's life she was the youngest concert promoter in germany and she had persuaded the cologne opera house 
 to host a late night concert of jazz from the american musician 
  in just a few hours jarrett would walk out on the same stage he 'd sit down at the piano and without rehearsal
 or sheet music he would begin to play  
 but right now vera was introducing keith to the piano in question and it wasn 't going well
  jarrett looked to the instrument a little warily played a few notes walked around it  played a few more notes  muttered something to his producer
  producer came over to vera and said if you don 't get a new piano keith can 't play there
 'd been a mistake 
 the opera house had provided the wrong instrument this one had this harsh tinny upper register because all the the felt had worn away  
  the white notes were out of tune the pedals didn 't work
 and the piano itself was just too small it wouldn 't create the volume that would fill a large space such as the cologne opera house  so
 keith jarrett
 left  
 he went and sat outside in his car leaving vera brandes to get on the phone to try to find a replacement piano
 now she got a piano tuner  but she couldn 't get a
  new piano and so she went outside
 and she stood there in the rain talking to keith jarrett begging him
 not to cancel the concert  
 and he looked out of his car at this bedraggled rain drenched german teenager  took pity on her and said
 only for you 
 and so a few hours later  jarrett did indeed step out onto the stage of the opera house he sat down
 at the unplayable piano
 and began
  within moments it became clear that something magical was happening  jarrett was avoiding those upper registers he was sticking to the middle tones of the 
  keyboard which gave the piece a soothing ambient quality  
  because the piano was so quiet  he had to set up these rumbling repetitive riffs in the bass  
 and he stood up twisting  pounding down on the keys  desperately trying to create enough volume to reach the people in the back row 
 it 's an electrifying performance it somehow has this peaceful quality and at the same time it 's full of energy it 's dynamic 
 and the audience loved it
 continue to love it because the recording of the kln concert
 is the best selling piano album in history and the best selling solo jazz album in history 
 keith jarrett had been handed a mess he had embraced that mess  and it soared  
 but let 's think for a moment about
  jarrett 's initial instinct  
 he didn 't want to play of course i think any of us in any remotely similar situation would feel the same way we 'd have the same instinct  
 we don 't want to be asked to do good work with bad tools we don 't want to have to overcome unnecessary hurdles  
 but jarrett 's instinct was wrong and thank goodness he changed his mind
  i think our instinct
 is also wrong i think we need to gain a bit more appreciation for the unexpected advantages
 of having to cope with a little mess  
 so let me give you some examples from cognitive psychology from complexity science from social psychology  and of course
 so cognitive psychology first we
 've actually known for a while that certain kinds of difficulty certain kinds of obstacle can actually improve our performance for example  
 the psychologist daniel oppenheimer a few years ago  teamed up with high school teachers  
 and he asked them to reformat the handouts that they were giving to some of their classes  
 so the regular handout would be
  formatted in something straightforward such as helvetica or times new roman  
 but half these classes were getting handouts that were formatted in something sort of intense  like
 or something with a zesty bounce like comic sans italicized now these are really ugly fonts  and they 're difficult fonts to read but
  at the end of the semester students were given exams  
 and the students who 'd been asked to read the more difficult fonts had actually done better on their exams in a variety of subjects and the reason is 
 the difficult font had slowed them down forced them to work a bit harder to think a bit more about what they were reading to interpret it  
 and so they learned more
  the psychologist shelley carson has been testing harvard undergraduates for the the quality of their attentional filters what do i mean by that 
 what i mean is imagine you 're in a restaurant you 're having a conversation 
 there are all kinds of other conversations going on in the restaurant  you want to filter them out you want to focus on what 's important to you can you do that if you can
  you have good strong attentional filters  but some people really struggle with that some of carson 's undergraduate subjects struggled with that they had
 weak filters they had porous filters let a lot of
 external information in and so what that meant is they were constantly being interrupted by the sights and the sounds of the world around them if there was a television on while they were doing their essays they couldn 't screen it out now
 you would think that that was a disadvantage
  no  when carson looked at what these students had achieved the ones with the weak filters were vastly more likely
 to have some real creative milestone in their lives to have published their first novel to have released their first album 
 these distractions were actually grists to their creative mill they were able to think outside the box because their box was full of holes
 let 's talk about complexity science  so how do you solve a really complex the world 's full of complicated problems how do you solve a really complicated problem for example  you try to make a
 jet engine there are lots and lots of different variables the operating temperature  the materials all the different dimensions the shape 
 you can 't solve that kind of problem all in one go it 's too hard so what do you do well one thing you can do
 is try to solve it step by step 
 so you have some kind of prototype and you tweak it  you test it  you improve it  you tweak it  you test it  you improve it now 
 this idea of marginal gains will eventually get you a good jet engine and it 's been quite widely
  implemented in the world so you 'll hear about it for example in high performance cycling 
 web designers will talk about trying to optimize their web pages they 're looking for these step by step gains that 's a good way
 to solve a complicated problem but you know what would make it a better way a
 dash of mess  
 you add randomness early on in the process you make crazy moves you try stupid things that shouldn 't work and
  that will tend to make the problem solving work better  and the reason for that is the trouble with the step by step process the marginal gains is they can walk you gradually down a dead end 
 and if you start with the randomness that becomes less likely and your problem solving becomes more robust let
 's talk about social psychology  so the the psychologist katherine phillips
  with some colleagues recently gave murder mystery problems to some students 
 and these students were collected in groups of four and they were given dossiers with information about a crime
 alibis and evidence witness statements and three suspects 
 and the groups of four students were asked to figure out who who did it  who committed the crime 
 and there were two treatments in this experiment
 in some cases these were four friends  they all knew each other well 
 in other cases three friends and a stranger and
 you can see where i 'm going with this obviously i 'm going to say that the groups with the stranger solved the problem more effectively  which is true  they did 
  they solved the problem
 quite a lot more effectively so the groups of four friends  
 they only had a 50 50 chance of getting the answer right which is actually not that great in multiple choice for three answers 50 50 's not good 
 the three friends and the stranger  even though the stranger didn 't have any extra information even though it was just a case of how that changed
 the conversation to
  that awkwardness the three friends and the stranger  they had a seventy five percent chance of finding the right answer that 's quite a big leap in performance but i think what 's really interesting
 is not just that the three friends and the stranger did a better job but how they felt about it
 so when katherine phillips interviewed
 the groups of four friends  they had a nice time they also thought they 'd done a good job they were complacent
  she spoke to the three friends and the stranger  they had not had a nice time it 's actually rather difficult it 's rather awkward 
 and they were full of doubt  
 they didn 't think they 'd done a good job even though they had 
 and i think that really exemplifies the challenge that we 're dealing with here 
 because  yeah the the ugly font the awkward stranger
  the random move these disruptions
 help us solve problems they help us become more creative  but we don 't feel that they 're helping us we feel that they 're getting in the way  
 and so we resist and
 that 's why the last example is really important so
  want to talk about somebody from
 the background of the world of rock ' n ' roll and you may know him he 's actually a ted ster 
 his name is brian eno he is an ambient composer rather brilliant  he 's also
 a kind of catalyst
 behind some of the great rock ' n ' roll albums of the last forty years he 's worked with david bowie on
  coldplay he 's worked with everybody  and what does he do to make these great rock bands better well
 he makes a mess  
 he disrupts their creative processes it 's his role to be the awkward stranger  it 's his role to tell them that they have to play the unplayable piano 
 and one of the ways in which he creates this disruption is through
 this
 remarkable deck of cards i have my
  my signed copy here thank you brian they 're called the oblique strategies he developed them with a friend of his and
 when they 're stuck in the studio brian eno will reach for one of the cards he 'll draw one at random and
 he 'll make the band follow the instructions on the card 
  everyone swap instruments drummer on the piano
 brilliant  brilliant idea look closely at the most embarrassing details amplify them 
 make a sudden destructive unpredictable action incorporate 
 these cards are disruptive  now  they 've proved their worth in album after
  phil collins was playing drums on an early brian eno album he got so frustrated he started throwing beer cans across the studio
  carlos alomar great rock guitarist working with eno on david bowie 's lodger album and
 at one point he turns to brian and says brian this experiment
  but the thing is it
 was a pretty good album  but also  
 carlos alomar thirty five years later  
 now uses the oblique strategies  and he tells his students to use the oblique strategies because he 's realized something 
 just because you don 't like it
 doesn 't mean it isn 't helping you 
 the strategies actually weren 't a deck of cards originally
 a list list on the recording studio wall a checklist of things you might try
 if you got stuck the list didn 't work know why 
 not messy enough your eye would go down the list and it would settle
 on whatever was the least disruptive the least troublesome
  which of course misses the point entirely  
 and what brian eno came to realize was yes we need to run the stupid experiments 
 we need to deal with the awkward strangers we need to try to read the ugly fonts  these things help us they help us solve problems they help us be more creative  
 but also 
 we really need some
  persuasion
 if we 're going to accept this so however we do it  whether it 's sheer willpower  whether it 's the flip of a card
 or whether it 's a guilt trip from a german teenager all of us from time to time need to sit down
 and try and play the unplayable piano thank you
