  i have an overlooked but potentially lucrative investment opportunity for you 
 over the past ten years in the uk  the return on burial plots has outperformed the uk property market by a ratio of around three to one
  there are private cemeteries being set up with plots for sale to investors  and they start at around three thousand nine hundred pounds  
 and they 're projected to achieve about forty percent growth 
 the biggest advantage is that this is a market with continuous demand 
 now this is a real proposition
  there are companies out there that really are offering this investment but my interest in it is quite different 
 i 'm an architect and urban designer and for the past year and a half i 've been looking at approaches to death and dying and at how they 've shaped our cities and the buildings within them 
 so in the summer i did my first exhibition on death and architecture in venice  and it was called
  because death is a subject that many of us find quite uncomfortable to talk about the exhibition was designed to be quite playful  so that people would literally engage with it  
 so one of our exhibits was an interactive map of london which showed just how much of the real estate in the city is given over to death
 as you wave your hand across the map  the name of the piece of real estate the
 building or the cemetery is revealed  and
 those white shapes that you can see they 're all of the hospitals and hospices and mortuaries and cemeteries in the city in fact the majority are cemeteries 
 we wanted to show that even though death and
 burial are things that we might not think about they 're all around us  and they 're important parts of our cities  
 so about half a million people die in the uk each year and of those around a quarter
  will want to be buried  but the uk like
 many western european countries is running out of burial space  especially in the major cities 
 and the greater london authority has been aware of this for a while  and the main causes are population growth  the fact that existing cemeteries are almost full there 's a custom
 custom in the uk that graves are considered to be occupied forever  and there 's also development pressure people want to use that same land to build houses or offices or shops  
 so they came up with a few solutions they were like well  maybe we can reuse those graves after fifty years or maybe we can bury people like four deep so that four people can be buried in the same plot and we can make more efficient use of the land
  that way hopefully london will still have space to bury people in the near future 
 but traditionally cemeteries haven 't been taken care of by the local authority 
 in fact the surprising thing is that there 's no legal obligation on anyone in the uk to provide burial space  
 traditionally it 's been done by private and religious organizations like churches and mosques and synagogues
  there 's also occasionally been a for profit group who has wanted to get in on the act  
 and you know they look at the small size of a burial plot and that high cost and it looks like there 's serious money to be made  
 so actually  if you want to go out and start your own cemetery you kind of can 
 there was this couple in south wales  and they had a farmhouse and a load of fields next to it and they wanted to develop the land they had a load of ideas they
  thought about making a caravan park but the council said no and then they wanted to make a fish farm and again the council said no
 then they hit on the idea of making a cemetery
 and they calculated that by doing this they could increase the value of their land from about ninety five thousand pounds to over one million pounds 
  just to come back to this idea of making profit from cemeteries like it 's kind of ludicrous  
 right the thing is that the high cost of those burial plots is actually very misleading  
 they look like they 're expensive but that cost reflects the fact that you need to maintain the burial plot like  someone has to cut the grass for the next fifty years that means it 's very difficult to make money from cemeteries  
 and it 's the reason that normally they 're run by the council or by a
 not for profit group but anyway the council granted these people permission and they 're now trying to build their cemetery  
 so just to explain to you kind of how this works if i want to build something in the uk  like a cemetery for example  
 then i have to apply for planning permission first so if i want to build a a new office building for a client or if i want to extend my home
 or you know if i have a shop
 and i want to convert it into an office i have to do a load of drawings and i submit them to the council for permission  
 and they 'll look at things like how it fits in the surroundings so they 'll look at what it looks like  but they 'll also think about things like what impact is it going to have on 
  the local environment and they 'll be thinking about things like  is this thing going to cause pollution or is there going to be a lot of traffic that wants to go to this thing that
  built  but also good things is it going to add local services like shops to the neighborhood that local people would like to use  
 and they 'll weigh up the advantages and the disadvantages and they 'll make a decision  
 so that 's how it works if i want to build a large cemetery  
 but what if i 've got a piece of land and i just want to bury a few people like five or six
  actually i don 't need permission from anyone 
 there 's actually almost no regulation in the uk around burial and the little bit that there is is about not polluting water courses like not polluting rivers or groundwater  
 so actually if you want to go and make your own mini cemetery then you can 
 but i mean like really who
  if you 're an aristocratic family and you have a large estate then there 's a chance that you 'll have a mausoleum on it and you 'll bury your family there 
 but the really weird thing is that you don 't need to have a piece of land of a certain size before you 're allowed to start burying people on it 
 and so that means that technically this applies to like the back garden of your house in the
  what if you wanted to try this yourself at home  well there 's a few councils that have guidance on their website which can help you 
 so the first thing that they tell you is that you need to have a certificate of burial before you can go ahead
 you 're not allowed to just murder people and put them under the patio 
 they also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is but that 's pretty much it for formal requirements
 now they do warn you that your neighbors might not like this but legally speaking there 's almost nothing that they can do about it and
 just in case any of you still had that profit idea in your mind about how much those burial plots cost and how much money you might be able to make 
 they also warn that it might cause the value of your
  it 's more likely that no one will want to buy your house at all after that 
 so what i find fascinating about this is the the fact that it kind of sums up many of our attitudes towards death 
 in the uk and i think that the figures across europe are probably similar  only about thirty percent of people have ever talked to anyone about their wishes around
  percent of people have ever talked about this and the reasons that people give  you know  they think that their death is far off or
 they think that they 're going to make people uncomfortable by talking about it and you know to a certain extent  there are other people out there who are taking care of things for us  
 the government has all this regulation and bureaucracy around things like burying a death for example  and there 's people like funeral directors who devote their entire working lives
  to this issue  but when it comes to our cities and thinking about how death fits in our cities 
 there 's much less regulation and design and thought than we might imagine so we 're not thinking about this but all of the people we imagine are thinking about it they 're not taking care of it either
