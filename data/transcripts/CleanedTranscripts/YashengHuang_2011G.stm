  my topic is economic growth in china and india and the question i want to explore with you
 is whether or not democracy has helped or has hindered economic growth  you may say this is not fair
  because i 'm selecting two countries to make a case against democracy  
 actually 
 exactly the opposite is what i 'm going to do i 'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy  
 rather than against democracy  
 the first question there is why china has grown so much faster than india
  the last thirty years in terms of the gdp growth rates china has grown at twice the rate of india 
 in the last five years the two countries have begun to converge somewhat in economic growth  but over the last thirty years  china undoubtedly has done much
  one simple answer is china has shanghai and india has mumbai 
 look at the skyline of shanghai  this is the pudong area  
 the picture on india is the dharavi slum of mumbai in india  
 the idea there behind these two pictures is that the chinese government can act above rule of law  it can plan for the long term benefits of the country
 and in the process  evict millions of people that 's just a small technical issue  
 whereas in india  you cannot do that because you have to listen to the public you 're being constrained by the public 's opinion  
 even prime minister manmohan singh agrees with that view in an
  so let me call it the shanghai model of economic growth  that emphasizes the following features for promoting economic
 infrastructures airports  highways  bridges things like that and
 you need a strong government to do that because you cannot respect private property rights you cannot be constrained by the public 's opinion  
 you need also state ownership especially of land assets 
 in order to build
 and roll out infrastructures very quickly the implication
 of that model is that democracy is a hindrance for economic growth  rather than a facilitator of economic growth  
 here 's the key question just how important
 are infrastructures for economic growth  
 this is a key issue  if you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth  then you would argue a strong government is
  necessary to promote growth  if you
 believe that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe then you will put less emphasis on strong government 
 so to illustrate that question let me give you two countries  and for the sake of brevity i 'll call one country country one and the other country country two 
 country one has a systematic
  advantage over country two in infrastructures 
 country one has more telephones  and country one has a longer system of railways  so if i were to ask you 
 which is china and which is india  and which country has grown faster if you believe in the infrastructure
  then you will say country one must be china they must have done better in terms of economic growth  and country two is possibly
 actually the country with more telephones is the soviet union  and the data referred to one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine after the country reported
 very impressive
 statistics on telephones  the country
  that 's not too good the picture there is khrushchev i know that in
 one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine he no longer ruled the soviet union but that 's the best picture that i can find 
 laughter telephones infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth  
 country two that has fewer telephones is china
 if you know nothing about china and the soviet union other than the fact about their telephones  you would have made a poor prediction about their economic growth in the next two decades 
 country one that has a longer system of railways  is actually india  
 and country two is china  this is a very
 little known fact about the two countries
  yes  today china has a huge infrastructure advantage over india  
 but for many years  until the late 1990s china had an infrastructure disadvantage vis a vis india 
 in developing countries  the most common mode of transportation
 is the railways and the british built a lot of railways in india india is the smaller of the two
  countries  and yet it had a longer system of railways until the late 1990s so clearly infrastructure doesn 't explain why china did better before the late 1990s as compared with india  
 in fact  if you look at the evidence worldwide  the evidence is more supportive of the view that
 are actually the result of economic growth
 the economy grows government accumulates more resources and the government can invest in  infrastructure
 rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth  
 and this is clearly the story of the chinese economic growth  
 let me look at this question more directly is democracy bad for economic growth now let 's turn to two countries
  a and country b country a in one thousand nine hundred and ninety had about $ three hundred per capita gdp
 as compared with country b which had $ four hundred and sixty in per capita gdp 
 by two thousand and eight country a has surpassed country b with  $ seven hundred
 per capita gdp as compared with $ six hundred and fifty
 per capita gdp both
  countries are in asia  if i were to ask you which are the two asian countries  and which one is a democracy you may argue well maybe
 country a is china and country b is india in fact  country a is democratic india  
 and country b is pakistan
 the country that has a long period of military rule
  it 's very common that we compare india with china  that 's because the two countries have
 about the same population size  
 but the more natural comparison is actually between india and pakistan 
 those two countries are geographically similar they have a complicated  but shared common history 
 by that comparison democracy looks very
  good in terms of economic growth  
 so why do economists fall in love with authoritarian governments 
 one reason is the east asian model 
 in east asia  we have had successful economic growth stories such as korea  taiwan hong kong and
  the problem with that view
 is like asking all the winners of lotteries 
 have you won the lottery 
 and they all tell you yes  we have won the lottery and then you draw the conclusion the odds of winning the lottery are one hundred percent
  the reason is you never go and bother to ask the losers who also
  purchased lottery tickets and didn 't end up winning the prize 
 for each of these successful authoritarian governments in east asia  there 's a matched failure  
 korea succeeded  north korea didn 't taiwan succeeded  china under mao zedong didn 't  burma
 didn 't succeed  the philippines didn 't succeed  
 if you look at the statistical evidence worldwide 
 there 's really no support for the idea that authoritarian governments hold a systematic edge over democracies in terms of economic growth  
 so the east asian model has this massive selection bias it is known as selecting on a dependent variable something we always tell our
  so exactly why did china
 grow so much faster  i will take you to the cultural revolution  when china went mad  and compare that country 's performance with india
 under indira gandhi the question there is which country did better 
 china or india china was during the cultural revolution  it turns out even during the cultural
  in terms of gdp growth by an average of about two point two percent every year in terms of per capita gdp  
 so that 's when china was mad  the whole country went mad 
 it must mean that the country had something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth to overcome the negative effects of the cultural revolution
  the advantage the country had was human capital
 nothing else but human capital  this is the world development index indicator data
 in the early 1990s and this is the earliest data that i can find  the adult literacy rate in china is
  between chinese women and indian women
 i haven 't told you about the definition of literacy 
 in china  the definition of literacy is the ability to read and write one thousand five hundred chinese characters 
 in india  the definition of literacy operating definition of
  is the ability  the grand ability to write your own name in whatever language you happen to speak 
 the gap between the two countries in terms of literacy is much more substantial than the data here indicated  
 if you go to other sources of data such as human development index that data series go back to the early  1970s
  a huge advantage in life expectancy on average as a chinese in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five you lived ten years more than an average indian  so 
  if you have a choice between being a chinese and being an indian you would want to become a chinese
  in order to live ten years longer  
 if you made that decision in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five the down side of that is the next year we have the cultural revolution so you have to always think carefully
 about these
 decisions  if you cannot chose your nationality  then you will want to become an indian man  because
  as an indian man you have about two years of life expectancy advantage vis a vis indian women 
 this is an extremely strange fact  it 's very rare among countries to have this kind of pattern 
 it shows the systematic discrimination and biases in the indian society against women 
 the good news is by two thousand and six india has closed the gap between men and women in terms of life
  expectancy  today indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge over indian men so india is reverting to the normal 
 but india still has a lot of work to do in terms of gender equality 
 these are the two pictures taken of garment factories in guangdong province and garment factories
  's all women  sixty to eighty percent of the workforce in china is women in the coastal part of the country  whereas in india it 's all men 
 financial times printed this picture of an indian textile factory with the title india poised to overtake china in textile 
 by looking at these two pictures i say no it won 't overtake china for a while  if you look at other east asian countries women there play a
 a hugely important role in terms of economic take off in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle associated with east asia  india still has a long way to go to catch up with china  
 then the issue is what about the chinese political system  you talk about human capital you talk about education and public health  what about the political system 
 isn 't it true that the
  has facilitated economic growth in china  actually the answer
 is more nuanced and subtle than that it depends on a distinction that you draw between statics of the political system and the dynamics of the political system  
 statically china is a one party system authoritarian there 's no question about
 to become less authoritarian and more democratic  
 when you explain change for example economic growth economic growth is about change when you explain change  you use other things that have changed to explain 
  change  rather than using the constant to explain change  sometimes a fixed effect
 with the things that change 
 in terms of the political changes they have introduced village elections they have increased the security of proprietors  and they have increased the 
 security with long term land leases there are also financial reforms in rural china  there is also a rural
  revolution in china to me the pace of political changes is too slow too gradual  and my own view is the country is going to face some substantial challenges  because 
  they have not moved further and faster on political reforms  but nevertheless  the system has moved in a more liberal direction moved in a more democratic direction  
  india was growing at a hindu rate of growth about one percent two percent a year that was when india was least democratic 
 indira gandhi declared emergency rule in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five the indian government owned and operated all the tv stations 
 a little known fact about india in the 1990s is that the country not only has undertaken economic reforms the country has also undertaken
 political reforms by introducing village self rule privatization of media
 and introducing freedom of information acts  
 so the dynamic perspective fits both with china and in india in terms of the direction 
 why do many people believe that india is still a growth
 disaster one reason is
  they are always comparing india with china  but china is a superstar in terms of economic growth  
 if you are a nba player and you are always being compared to michael jordan  you 're going to look not so impressive  but that doesn 't mean that you 're a bad basketball player
  comparing with a superstar is the wrong benchmark  in fact  if you compare india with the
  developing country even before the more recent period of acceleration of indian growth now india is growing between eight and nine percent even 
  before this period india was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging economies this is a very impressive record indeed
  the elephant which country has the growth momentum 
 china  i believe still has some of the excellent raw fundamentals mostly the social capital the public health  the sense of egalitarianism that you don 't find in india  
 but i believe that india has the
  has the improving fundamentals the government has invested in basic education has invested in basic health  i believe the government should do more but nevertheless  the direction it is moving in is the right direction 
 india has the right institutional conditions for economic growth  whereas china is still struggling with political reforms  
 i believe that the political reforms are a must for
  to maintain its growth and
 it 's very important to have political reforms to have widely shared benefits of economic growth  i don 't know whether that 's going to happen or not but i 'm an optimist hopefully 
 five years from now i 'm going to report to tedglobal that political reforms will happen in china  thank you very much
