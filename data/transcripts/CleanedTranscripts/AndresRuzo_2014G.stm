  as a boy in lima my grandfather told me a legend of the spanish conquest of peru 
 atahualpa emperor of the inca had been captured and killed  
 pizarro and his conquistadors had grown rich and tales of their conquest and glory had reached spain and
  bringing new waves of spaniards hungry for gold
 and glory 
 they would go into towns and ask the inca 
 where 's another civilization we can conquer where 's more gold and the inca  out of vengeance told them 
 go to the amazon you
 'll find all the gold you want there in fact there is a city
  dorado in spanish made entirely of gold the spanish set off into the jungle but the few that return
 come back with stories stories
 of powerful shamans 
 of warriors with poisoned arrows 
 of trees so tall they blotted out the sun  spiders that ate birds  snakes that swallowed
  men whole and a river that boiled 
 all this became a childhood memory and years passed i 'm working on my phd at smu 
 trying to understand peru 's geothermal energy potential  when i remember this legend  
 and i began asking that question 
  could the boiling river exist 
 i asked colleagues from universities  the government  oil gas and mining companies and the answer was a unanimous no  
 and
 this makes sense 
 you see boiling rivers do exist in the world but they 're generally associated with volcanoes 
 you need a powerful heat source to produce such a large geothermal
  as you can see from the red dots here  which are volcanoes  
 we don 't have volcanoes in the amazon  nor in most of peru so it follows  we should not expect to see a boiling river
  telling this same story at a family dinner my aunt tells me but no 
  been there i 've swum in that river
  then my uncle jumps in no andrs she 's not kidding you see you can only swim in it after a very heavy rain  and
 it 's protected by a powerful shaman your aunt she 's friends with his wife
  aunt over seven hundred kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center  and
 well honestly  mentally preparing myself to behold the legendary warm stream of the amazon 
 but then  i heard something a low surge
 that got louder and louder
 as we came closer  
 it sounded like ocean waves constantly crashing  and as we got closer i saw smoke vapor coming up through the trees and then  
 i saw this i immediately grabbed for my thermometer
  the average temperatures in the river were
 this is not quite the 100 degree c boiling but definitely
 close enough the river flowed hot and fast  i followed it upriver and was led
 by actually the shaman 's apprentice to the most sacred site on the river and this is what 's bizarre it starts off as a cold stream and here at this site 
 is the home of the
  yacumama mother of the waters a giant serpent spirit who births hot and cold water  and here we find
 a hot spring  mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws
 and thus bringing their legends to life  the next morning i woke up and
  i asked for tea 
 i was handed a mug a tea bag and well  pointed towards the river  to my surprise  the water was clean
 and had a pleasant taste which is a little weird for geothermal systems what
 was amazing is that the locals had always known about this place  and that i was by no means the first outsider to see
 it was just part of their everyday life  they drink its water they take in its vapor  
 they cook with it clean with it even make their medicines with it 
 i met the shaman and he seemed like an extension
 of the river and his jungle  he asked for my intentions
 and listened carefully  then to my tremendous relief i was freaking out to be honest with you
 a smile began to snake across his face  and he just laughed 
 laughter i had received the shaman 's blessing to study the river  on the condition that after i take
  the water samples and analyze them in my lab wherever i was in the world that i pour the waters back into the ground
 so that as the shaman said the waters could find their way back home  
 i 've been back every year since that first visit in two thousand and eleven and the fieldwork has been exhilarating demanding and
  times
 dangerous  one story was even featured in national geographic magazine i was trapped on a small rock about the size of a sheet of paper
 in sandals and board shorts in between an eighty degree c river and a hot spring that well  looked like this close to boiling and on top of
  couldn 't see a thing the temperature differential made it all white it was a whiteout  intense  
 now after years of work i 'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical
 studies for publication  
 and i 'd like to share today with all of you here on the ted stage for the first time some of these discoveries
 first off  it 's not a legend  surprise 
 when i first started the research 
 the satellite imagery was too low resolution to be meaningful there were just no good maps  thanks to the support of the google earth team  i now have this
  with the heat of the sun 
 indicating that i 'm not the first to wonder why the river boils  
 and showing that humanity has always sought to explain the world around us
  so
 why does the
  it actually took me three years to get that footage  fault fed hot springs 
 as we have hot blood running through our veins and arteries so too the earth has hot water running through its cracks and faults 
 where these arteries come to the surface these earth arteries we 'll get geothermal manifestations
  springs and in our case the boiling river  
 what 's truly incredible though is the scale of this place  next time you cross the road think about this 
 the river flows wider than a two lane road along most of its path  it flows hot
 for six point
  there are thermal pools larger than this ted stage and that waterfall that you see there is six meters tall and all with 
 water  we mapped the temperatures along the river and this was by far the most demanding part of the fieldwork  and the results
 were just awesome
  geoscientist in me coming out and it showed this amazing trend you see the river starts off cold it
 then heats up cools back down heats up cools back down heats up again  and then has this beautiful decay curve until it smashes into this cold river  
 now i understand not all of you are geothermal scientists so to put it in
 more everyday
  put in coffee shop terms the boiling river plots like this there you have your hot coffee 
 here you have your extra hot coffee and you can see that there 's a bit point there where the river is still hotter than even
  and these are average water temperatures we took these in the dry season to ensure the purest geothermal temperatures  
 but there 's a magic number here that 's not being shown and that number is 
  c  
 because that 's where things start to hurt  and i know this from very personal experience
  above that temperature you don 't want to get in that water you need to be careful 
 it can be deadly  
 i 've seen all sorts of
  animals fall in and what 's shocking to me is the process is
 pretty much the same  
 so they fall in and the first thing to go are the eyes  eyes apparently cook very quickly they turn this milky white color the stream is carrying them they 're trying to swim out but their meat is cooking on the bone because it 's so hot so they 're losing power losing power until finally
 finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths and they cook from the inside out 
 a bit sadistic aren 't we jeez 
 leave them marinating for a little longer 
 what 's again  amazing are these temperatures  they 're similar to things that i 've seen on volcanoes all over the
  but here 's the thing 
 the data
 is showing that the boiling river exists independent of volcanism  
 it 's neither magmatic or volcanic in origin  
 and again over seven hundred kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center  how can a boiling river
  exist like this  i 've asked geothermal experts and volcanologists for years  and i 'm still unable to find another
  geothermal system of this magnitude  it 's
 unique  it 's special on a global scale so still how does it work
  where do we get this heat there 's still more research to be done
 to better constrain the problem and better understand the system  but from what the data is telling us now  it looks to be the result of a large hydrothermal system 
 basically it works like this so the deeper you go into the earth the hotter it gets  we refer to this as the geothermal gradient  
 the waters could be
  coming from as far away as glaciers in the andes then seeping down deep into the earth and coming out
 to form the boiling river after getting heated up from the geothermal gradient 
 all due to this unique geologic setting now  we found that in and around the river this is working with colleagues from
  lifeforms living in and around the river and have found new lifeforms unique species living in the boiling river  
 but again  despite all of these studies all of these discoveries and the legends 
 a question remains 
 what is the significance of the boiling river
 what is the significance of this stationary cloud
 that always hovers over this patch of jungle  and what is the significance
 of a detail in a childhood legend 
 to the shaman and his community
  it 's a sacred site to me as a geoscientist  it 's a unique geothermal phenomenon  
 but to the illegal loggers and cattle farmers  it 's just another resource to exploit 
 and to the peruvian government  it 's just another stretch
 of
 unprotected
 land ready for development my goal is
  to ensure that whoever controls this land understands the boiling river 's uniqueness and significance  
 because that 's the question  
 one of significance  and the thing there is 
 we define significance  it 's us we have that power  we are the ones who draw that line
 between the sacred and the trivial 
 and in this age where everything seems mapped measured and studied 
 in this age of information  i remind you all that discoveries are not just made in the black
 void
 of the unknown
 but in the white noise
  noise of overwhelming data 
 there remains so much to explore  
 we live in an incredible world  so go out 
 be curious  because we do live
 in a world
 where shamans still sing to the spirits
  of the jungle  where rivers do boil and where legends do come to life  thank you very much
