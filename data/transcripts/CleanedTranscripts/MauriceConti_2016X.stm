  or maybe you just have a really big imagination  show of hands that 's most of you 
 i have some news for us creatives  over the course of the next twenty
  years  
 more will change around the way we do our work
 than has happened in the last two thousand 
 in fact  i think we 're at the dawn of a new age in human history 
 now  there have been four major historical eras defined by the way we work
  age lasted several million years  
 and then the agricultural age lasted several thousand years  the industrial age lasted a couple of centuries  
 and now the information age has lasted just a few decades  
 and now today we 're on the cusp of our next great era as a species  
 welcome to the augmented
  this new era your natural human capabilities are going to be augmented by computational systems that help you think  
 robotic systems that help you make and a digital nervous system that connects you to the world far beyond your natural senses  
 let 's start with cognitive augmentation how many of you are augmented cyborgs 
 i would actually argue that we 're already augmented imagine you 're at a party and somebody asks you a question
  that you don 't know the answer to if you have one of these in a few seconds you can know the answer  
 but this is just a primitive beginning  even siri is just a passive
 tool in fact  for the last three and a half million years  the tools that we 've had have been completely passive 
 they do exactly what we tell them
 and nothing more our
  very first tool only cut where we struck it 
 the chisel only carves where the artist points it and even our most advanced tools do nothing
 without our explicit direction  in fact to date and this is something that frustrates me we 've always been limited by this need to manually push our
  let 's design a car and the computer shows me a car and i say no more fast looking and less german and bang the computer shows me an option laughter
 that conversation
  might be a little ways off probably less than many of us think but right now  we 're working on it tools are making this leap from being passive
 to being generative generative design tools use a computer and algorithms to synthesize geometry
 to come up with new designs all by themselves 
 all it needs are your goals and your constraints i 'll give you an example in the case of this aerial drone chassis 
 all you would need to do is tell it
  something like it has four propellers you want it to be as lightweight as possible and you need it to be aerodynamically efficient  then what the computer does
 is it explores the entire solution space  every single possibility that solves and meets your criteria millions of them it
 takes big computers to do this  but it comes back to us with designs that we by ourselves never could 've imagined 
 and the computer 's
  coming up with this stuff all by itself no one ever drew anything  and it started completely from scratch  and by the way it 's no accident
 that the drone body looks just like the pelvis of a flying squirrel it
 's because the algorithms are designed to work the same way evolution does 
  exciting is we 're starting to see this technology out in the real world we 've been working with airbus for a couple of years on this concept plane for the future it 's a ways out still  
 but just recently we used a generative design ai
 to come up with this 
 this is a  3d printed cabin partition that 's been designed by a computer it 's stronger than the original yet half the weight and it will be flying in the airbus
  can now generate they can come up with their own solutions to our well defined problems  
 but they 're not intuitive they still have to start from scratch every single time and that 's because they never learn  unlike
 maggie maggie 's actually smarter than our most advanced design tools what do i mean by that if her owner picks up that leash maggie knows
  with a fair degree of certainty it 's time to go for a walk  
 and how did she learn  well every time the owner picked up the leash they went for a walk and maggie did three things 
 she had to pay attention  she had to remember what happened
 and she had to retain and create a pattern in her mind  
 interestingly that 's exactly what computer scientists have been trying to get ais to do for the last sixty or so years
 back in one thousand nine hundred and fifty two they built this computer that could play tic tac toe 
 big deal then forty five years later in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven deep blue beats kasparov at chess two thousand
 and eleven  watson beats these two humans at jeopardy
  which is much harder for a computer to play than chess is in fact  rather than working from predefined recipes  
 watson had to use reasoning to overcome his human opponents  
 and then a couple of weeks ago 
 beats the world 's best human at go  
 which is the most difficult game that we have in fact in go  there are more possible moves than there are atoms in the universe  
 so in order to win
  what alphago had to do was develop intuition  and in fact  at some points alphago 's programmers didn 't understand why  alphago was doing what it was doing 
 and things are moving really fast i mean consider in the space of a human lifetime computers have gone from a child 's game
 to what 's recognized as the pinnacle of strategic thought  what 's basically happening
  happening is computers are going from being like spock to being a lot more like kirk right 
 from pure logic
 to intuition would you cross this bridge most of you are saying oh hell no
  you arrived at that decision in a split second 
 you just sort of knew that that bridge was unsafe  and that 's exactly the kind of intuition that our deep learning systems are starting to develop right now 
 very soon you 'll literally be able to show something you 've made you 've designed to a computer and it will look at it and say 
 sorry homie that 'll never work you have to try again 
 or you could ask it if people are going to like your next song or your next flavor of ice cream
  or much more importantly you could work with a computer to solve a problem that we 've never faced before 
 for instance climate change we 're not doing a very good job on our own  we could certainly use all the help we can get 
 that 's what i 'm talking about technology amplifying our cognitive abilities so we can imagine and design things that were simply out of our
  what about making all of this crazy new stuff that we 're going to invent and design  i think the era of human augmentation is as much about the physical world
 as it is about the virtual intellectual realm how will technology augment us in the physical world  robotic systems  
  there 's certainly a fear that robots are going to take jobs away from humans and that is true in certain sectors  but i 'm much more interested in this idea
 that humans and robots working together
 are going to augment each other  and start to inhabit a new space this is our applied research lab in san francisco where one of our areas of focus is advanced robotics specifically human robot collaboration  
 and this is bishop one of our robots as an experiment  we set it up to help a
  person working in construction doing repetitive tasks tasks like cutting out holes for outlets or light switches in drywall 
 so bishop 's human partner can tell what to do in plain english and with simple gestures kind of like talking to a dog  and then bishop executes on those instructions with perfect precision  
 we 're using the human for what the human is good at
 perception and decision making and we 're using the robot for what it 's good at precision and repetitiveness  
 here 's another cool project that bishop worked on 
 the goal of this project  which we called the hive 
 was to prototype the experience of humans computers and robots all working together to solve a highly complex design problem 
 the humans acted as labor they cruised around the construction site they manipulated the bamboo
  which by the way  because it 's a non isomorphic material is super hard for robots to deal with but then the robots did this fiber winding which was almost impossible for a human to do 
 and then we had an ai that was controlling
 everything it was telling the humans what to do telling the robots what to do and keeping track of thousands of individual components  
 what 's interesting is building this pavilion was simply not possible
 without human
 robot and ai augmenting each other  
 ok i 'll share one more project this one 's a little bit crazy  we 're working with amsterdam based artist joris  laarman and his team at 
 to generatively design and robotically print the world 's first autonomously manufactured bridge  so
  and an ai are designing this thing right now as we speak in amsterdam  and when they 're done we 're going to hit go and robots will start 3d printing in stainless steel  
 and then they 're going to keep printing without human intervention  until the bridge is finished  
 so as computers are going to augment our ability to imagine and design new stuff  robotic systems are going to help us build and make
 things that we 've never been able to make before  but what about our ability to sense and
  control these things what about a nervous system for the things that we make 
 our nervous system the human nervous system tells us everything that 's going on around us 
 but the nervous system of the things we make is rudimentary at best 
 for instance a car doesn 't tell the city 's public works department that it just hit a pothole at the corner of broadway and morrison 
 a building doesn 't tell its designers whether or not the people inside
  like being there and
 the toy manufacturer doesn 't know if a toy is actually being played with how and where and whether or not it 's any fun look i 'm sure that the designers
 imagined this lifestyle for barbie when they designed her 
 laughter but what if it turns out that barbie 's actually really lonely if
 the designers had known what was really
  happening in the real world with their designs the road the building barbie they could 've used that knowledge to create an experience that was better for the user  what 's missing
 is a nervous system connecting us to all of the things that we design make and use what if all of you had that kind of information flowing to you
 from the things you create in the real world
  with all of the stuff we make we spend a tremendous amount of money and energy in fact last year about two trillion dollars convincing people to buy the things we 've made  
 but if you had this connection to the things that you design and create after they 're out in the real world after they 've been sold or launched or whatever  
 we could actually change that and go from making people want our stuff 
 to just making stuff that people want in the first place  the good news is
 digital nervous systems that connect us to the things we design we 're working on one project with a couple of guys down in
 los angeles called the bandito brothers and their team  
 and one of the things these guys do is build insane cars that do absolutely insane things 
 these guys are crazy in the best way
  and what we 're doing with them is taking a traditional race car chassis and giving it a nervous system  so we instrumented it with dozens of sensors 
 put a world class driver behind the wheel  took it out to the desert and drove the hell out of it for a week  
 and the car 's nervous system captured everything that was happening to the car we captured four billion data points all of the forces that it was subjected to
  then we did something crazy  we took all of that data and plugged it into a generative design ai we call dreamcatcher 
 so what do get when you give a design tool a nervous system and you ask it to build you the ultimate car chassis  you get
 this this is something that a human could never have designed except a human did design
  this  but it was a human that was augmented by a generative design ai a digital nervous system and robots that can actually fabricate something like this 
 so if this is the future  the augmented age and
 we 're going to be augmented cognitively  physically and perceptually what will that look like 
 what is this
  going to be like  i think we 're going to see a world where we 're moving from things that are fabricated
 to things that are farmed where we 're moving from things that are constructed
 to that which is grown  we 're going to move from being isolated to being connected and we 'll move away from extraction
 to embrace aggregation  i also think we 'll shift from craving obedience from our things to
  valuing autonomy  
 thanks to our augmented capabilities our world is going to change dramatically  
 we 're going to have a world with more variety  more connectedness more dynamism more complexity more adaptability and of course 
 more beauty  
 the shape of things to come will be unlike anything we 've ever seen before why because what will be shaping those things
 is this new
  partnership
 between technology nature and humanity 
 that to me is a future well worth looking forward to thank you all so much
