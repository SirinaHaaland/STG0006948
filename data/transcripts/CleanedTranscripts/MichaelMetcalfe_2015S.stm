  will we do
 whatever it takes
 to tackle climate change  
 i come at this question not as a green campaigner in fact i confess to be rather hopeless at recycling  
 i come at it as a professional observer of financial policy making
 and someone that wonders how history will judge us one day  this ring
 that belonged to my grandfather
 will pass to my son  charlie  and i wonder what his generation and perhaps the one that follows will make
 of the two lives this ring has worked
  my grandfather
 was a coal miner in his time  burning fossil fuels for energy
 and for allowing economies to develop was accepted we know now that that is not the case
 because of the greenhouse gases that coal produces  
  i fear it 's the industry in which i work that will be judged more harshly because of its impact on the climate
 more harshly than my grandfather 's industry even i work of course in the banking industry  
 which will be remembered for its crisis in two thousand and eight
 a crisis that diverted the attention and finances of governments away from some
  like promises made
 at the copenhagen climate summit in two thousand and nine
 to mobilize one hundred billion dollars a year
 to help developing countries move away from burning fossil fuels and transition to using cleaner energy 
 that promise is already in jeopardy  
 and that 's a real problem
  because that transition to cleaner energy needs to happen sooner rather than later 
 firstly because greenhouse gases once released stay in in the atmosphere for decades  and secondly if a developing economy
 builds its power grid around fossil fuels today it 's going to be way more costly to change later on 
 so for the climate history may judge
 that the banking crisis happened at just
  the wrong time  the story
 need not be this gloomy though 
 three years ago  
 i argued that governments could use the tools deployed to save the financial system to meet other global challenges  
 and these arguments
 are getting stronger
  not weaker with time  let 's take a brief reminder
 of what those tools looked like when the financial crisis hit in two thousand and eight  the central banks of the us and uk
 began buying bonds issued by their own governments in a policy known as quantitative easing 
 depending on what happens to those bonds when they mature this is money printing by another name
  us alone created four trillion dollars ' worth of its own currency 
 this was not done in isolation 
 in a remarkable act of cooperation the one hundred and eighty eight countries that make up the international monetary fund the imf agreed to issue two hundred and fifty billion dollars ' worth of their own currency the special drawing right
 to boost reserves around the world when the financial crisis moved to europe
 the european central bank president mario draghi  promised to do whatever it takes 
 and they did the bank of japan repeated those words that exact same commitment
 to do whatever it takes to reflate their economy
  whatever it takes meant trillions of dollars more in money printing policies that continue today  what this shows
 is that when faced with some global challenges 
 policy makers are able to act collectively with urgency  and
 run the risks of unconventional policies like money printing so
 let 's go back to that original question 
 can we print money for climate finance 
 three years ago  
 the idea of using money in this way was something of a taboo  once you break down and dismantle the idea that money is a finite resource 
 governments can quickly get overwhelmed by demands from their people
  to print more and more money for other causes  education health care welfare even defense  and
 there are some truly terrible historical examples of money printing uncontrolled money printing
 leading to hyperinflation think weimar republic in
  zimbabwe more recently in two thousand and eight when the prices of basic goods like bread are doubling every day  but
 all of this is moving the public debate forward so much so that money printing for the people
 is now discussed openly in the financial media  and even in some political manifestos  
 but it 's important the debate doesn 't stop here with printing national currencies
 because climate change is a shared global problem 
 there are some really compelling reasons
 why we should be printing that international currency that 's issued by the imf to fund it 
 the special drawing right or sdr is the imf 's electronic unit of account
 that governments use
  to transfer funds amongst each other 
 think of it as a peer to peer payment network like bitcoin  but for governments 
 and it 's truly global each of the one hundred and  eighty eight members of the imf
 hold sdr quotas as part of their foreign exchange
  these are national stores of wealth that countries keep to protect themselves against currency crises  
 and that global nature is why at the height of the financial crisis in two thousand and nine  
 the imf issued those extra two hundred and fifty billion dollars
 because
 it served as a collective global action that safeguarded countries large and small in one fell swoop  but here
 here 's the intriguing part more than half of those
 extra sdrs that were printed in two thousand and nine one hundred and fifty billion dollars ' worth went to developed market countries
 who for the most part have a modest need for these foreign exchange reserves because they have flexible exchange rates  
 so those extra reserves that were printed in two thousand and nine
  the end for developed market countries at least weren 't really needed  and they remain unused today  
 so here 's an idea as a first step 
 why don 't we start spending those unused those extra sdrs that were printed in two thousand and nine to combat climate change
  they could for example be used to buy bonds issued by the un 's green climate fund 
 this was a fund created in two thousand and nine following that climate agreement in copenhagen  
 and it was designed to channel funds
 towards developing countries to meet their climate projects 
 it 's been one of the most successful funds of its type  raising almost ten billion dollars  but if we use those extra sdrs that were issued
  it helps governments get back on track to meet that promise of one hundred billion dollars a year that was derailed by the financial crisis 
 it could also it could also serve as a test case 
 if the inflationary consequences of using sdrs in this way are benign it could be used to justify
 the additional extra issuance of sdrs say every five years  again with the commitment that 
  countries would direct their share of the new reserves to the green climate fund 
 printing international money in this way has several
  over printing national currencies  
 the first is it 's really easy to argue that spending money to mitigate climate change benefits everyone  
 no one section of society benefits from the printing press over another that problem of competing claims
 is mitigated 
 it 's also fair to say that because it takes so many countries to agree to issue these extra sdrs 
 it 's highly unlikely that money printing would get out of control
 what you end up with
 is a collective global action
 aimed
 and it 's controlled global action
 aimed at a global good 
 and as we 've learned with the money printing schemes whatever concerns we have can be allayed by rules
  the issuance of these extra sdrs every five years
 could be capped  such that this international currency is never more than five percent
 of global foreign exchange reserves that 's important because it would allay well let 's say the ridiculous concerns that the us might have
 that the sdr could ever challenge the dollar 's dominant role in international finance  and in fact
  i think the only thing that the sdr would likely steal from the dollar under this scheme is its nickname the greenback because
 even with that cap in place  
 the imf could have followed up its issuance its massive issuance of sdrs in two thousand and nine with a further two hundred billion dollars
 of sdrs in two thousand and fourteen
  so
 hypothetically that would mean that developed countries could have contributed
 up to three hundred billion dollars  ' worth of sdrs to the green climate fund 
 that 's thirty times what it has today  and you know as spectacular as that sounds it 's only just beginning
 to look like whatever it takes
 and just to think what amazing things could be done with that money consider this 
 in two thousand and nine  norway promised one billion dollars of its reserves to brazil
 if they followed through on their goals on deforestation that program
 has since delivered a seventy percent reduction
 in deforestation
  in the past decade that 's saving three point two billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions which is the equivalent of taking
 all american cars off the roads for three whole years  so what could we do with three hundred other 
 climate projects like that organized on a global scale
  we could take cars off the roads for a generation so  
 let 's not quibble about whether we can afford to fund climate change  
 the real question is do we care enough about future generations
 to take the very same policy risks we took to
 save the financial system  after all we could do it we did do it and we are doing it today
