  scariest thing you 've ever done  
 or another way to say it is what 's the most dangerous thing that you 've ever done  and
  why did you do it 
 i know what the most dangerous thing is that i 've ever done because nasa does the math you look back to the first five shuttle launches the odds 
 of a catastrophic event during the first five shuttle launches was one in nine  
  shuttle flight  the odds were still now that we look back about one in
  not great odds  so it 's a really interesting day when you wake up at the kennedy space center and you 're going to go to space that day
 because you realize by the end of the day you 're either going to be floating effortlessly gloriously in space or you 'll be dead 
 you go into at the kennedy space center
  heroes got dressed in that neil armstrong and buzz aldrin got suited in
 to go ride the apollo rocket to the moon and i got my pressure suit built around me
 and
 rode down outside in the van heading out to the to the launchpad in the astro van heading out to the launchpad  
 and as you come around the corner at the kennedy space center  
 it 's normally predawn
  and in the distance  lit up by the the huge xenon lights is your spaceship
 the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet  the crew is is sitting in the astro van sort of hushed almost holding hands looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger 
 we ride the elevator up
  and we crawl in on your hands and knees into the spaceship one at a time and you worm your way up into your chair and plunk yourself down
 on your back and
 the hatch is closed  and suddenly what has been
 a lifetime of both dreams and denial is becoming real something that i dreamed
  that i chose to do when i was nine years old is now suddenly within not too many minutes of actually happening  in the astronaut business
 the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle it 's the most complicated flying machine ever built and in the astronaut business we have a saying which is 
 there is no problem so bad that you can 't make it worse 
  and so you 're very conscious in the cockpit you 're thinking about all of the things that you might have to do all the switches and all the wickets you have to go through and as the time gets closer and closer this excitement 
  is building  and then about three and a half minutes before launch  the huge nozzles on the back like the size of big church bells  swing back and forth and the mass of them is such that it sways the whole vehicle like the vehicle is alive underneath you  like
  off its knees or something  and then about thirty seconds before launch the vehicle is completely alive it is ready to go the apus are running the computers are all  self contained it 's ready to leave the planet and fifteen seconds before launch  this happens
  it is incredibly powerful to be on board one of these things
  you are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself it 's shaking you
 so hard you can 't focus on the instruments in front of you it 's like you 're in the jaws of some enormous dog and there 's a foot in the small of your back
 pushing you into space accelerating wildly straight up shouldering your way through the air  and you 're in a
  very complex place paying attention watching the vehicle go through each one of its wickets with a steadily increasing smile on your face  after two minutes those solid rockets
  explode off and then you just have the liquid engines  the hydrogen and oxygen  and it 's as if you 're in a dragster with your foot to the floor and accelerating like you 've never accelerated you get lighter and lighter the force gets on us heavier and heavier it feels
  like someone 's pouring cement on you or something  until finally  after about eight minutes and forty seconds or so 
 we are finally at exactly the right altitude exactly the right speed  the right direction  the engine shut off 
 and we 're weightless  
 and we 're alive it
 's an amazing experience but why would we take that risk 
 why would you do something that dangerous in my case the answer is fairly straightforward
  was inspired as a as a youngster that this was what i wanted to do i watched the first people walk on the moon and to me it was just an obvious thing i want to somehow turn myself into that 
 but the real question is how do you deal with the danger of it and the fear that comes from it  how do you deal with fear versus danger
  and having the goal in mind thinking about where it might lead 
 directed me to a life of of looking at all of the the small details to allow this to become possible to be able to launch and go help build a space station where 
  you are on board a million pound creation that 's going around the world at five miles a second eight kilometers a second around the world sixteen times a day with experiments on board
  that are teaching us
 what the substance of the universe is made of and running two hundred experiments inside  but maybe even more importantly  allowing us
 to see the world in a way
 that is impossible through any other means to be able to look down and have if your jaw could drop it would the
 beauty that is the world itself  and you see because of the speed a sunrise or a sunset every forty five minutes for half a year 
 and the most magnificent part of all that is to go outside on a spacewalk you are in a 
 spaceship that is your spacesuit and you 're going
  space with the world 
 it 's an entirely different perspective you 're not looking up at the universe you and the earth are going through the universe together  
 and you 're holding on with one hand  looking at the world turn beside you it 's roaring silently with with color and texture as it pours by
  if you can tear your eyes away from that and you look under your arm down at the rest of everything it 's
 unfathomable blackness with a
 texture texture you feel like you could stick your hand  into and you are holding on with one hand one link to the other seven billion people and i was outside on my first spacewalk when
 my left eye went
  and i didn 't know why suddenly my left eye slammed shut in great pain and and i couldn 't figure out why why my eye wasn 't working i
 was thinking what do i do next i thought well maybe that 's why we have two eyes so i kept working  but
 unfortunately without gravity
  tears don 't fall  so you just get a bigger and bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it across the bridge
  of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes goosh into your other eye  and now i was completely blind
 outside
 the spaceship  so what 's the scariest thing you 've ever done 
 maybe it 's spiders a lot of people are afraid of spiders i think you should be afraid of spiders spiders are creepy and they 've got long hairy legs
 spiders like this one  the brown recluse it 's horrible if a brown recluse bites you you end with one of these horrible big  necrotic things on your leg and there might be one right now sitting on the 
 chair behind you in fact  and how do you know and so a spider lands on you and you go through this great spasmy attack because spiders are scary but then you could say well is there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not i don 't know are there brown recluses here so if you actually
  do the research  you find out that in the world there are about fifty thousand different types of spiders and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of fifty thousand and if you 're in canada 
  because of the cold winters here in b c there 's about seven hundred and twenty seven hundred and thirty different types of spiders and there 's one one that is venomous and its venom isn 't even
  it 's just kind of like a nasty sting and that spider not only that but that spider has beautiful markings on it it 's like i 'm dangerous i got a big radiation symbol on my back 
 it 's the black widow so if you 're even slightly careful you can avoid running into the one spider and it lives close the ground  you 're walking along you are never going to go through a spider 
  web where a black widow bites you spider webs like this it doesn 't build those it builds them down in the corners and its a black widow because the female spider eats the male
  care about you so in fact  the next time you walk into a spiderweb you don 't need to
 panic and go with your caveman reaction the danger is entirely different than the fear 
 how do you get around it though how do you change your behavior  well next time you see a spiderweb have a good look make sure it 's not a black widow spider and then walk into it 
 and then you see another spiderweb and walk into that one
  just a little bit of fluffy stuff it 's not a big deal and the spider that may come out is no more threat to you than a lady bug or or a
 butterfly  
 and then i guarantee you if you walk through one hundred spiderwebs you will have changed your fundamental human behavior your caveman reaction and
 you will now be able to walk in the park in the morning and not worry about that spiderweb or or into your grandma 's attic or whatever into
  your own basement  
 and you can apply this to anything 
 if you 're outside on a spacewalk and you 're blinded 
 your natural reaction would be to panic i think it would make you nervous and worried but we had considered all the venom  and we had practiced with a whole variety of different spiderwebs we knew everything there is to know about the spacesuit and we trained underwater
 thousands of times and we don 't just practice things going right we practice things going wrong all the time  so that you are constantly walking through those spiderwebs and not just 
  underwater but also in virtual reality labs with the helmet and the gloves so you feel like it 's realistic so when you finally actually get outside on a spacewalk  it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time  and even if you 're blinded your natural
  panicky reaction doesn 't happen instead you kind of look around and go okay  i can 't see but i can hear  i can talk scott parazynski is out here with me he could come over and help me we actually practiced
 incapacitated crew rescue so he could float me like a blimp and stuff me into the airlock if he had to i could find
  it 's not nearly as big a deal and actually if you keep on crying for a while whatever that gunk was that 's in your eye starts to dilute and you can start to see again  and houston if you negotiate with them they will let you then keep working  
 we finished everything on the spacewalk and when we came back inside jeff got some
 cotton batting and took the crusty stuff around my eyes and it turned out it was just the anti fog sort of a mixture of oil and soap that got in my eye  and
 now we use
  's no more tears which we probably should 've been using right from the very beginning 
 laughter but the key to that is
 by looking at the difference between perceived danger and actual danger where is the real risk what is the real thing that you should be afraid of not just a generic fear of bad things
  you can fundamentally change your reaction to things so that it allows you to go places and see things and do things that otherwise would be completely denied to you  where you could see the the hardpan south of the sahara or you can see new york city
 in a way that is almost dreamlike  or the unconscious gingham of eastern europe fields or
 the great lakes as a collection of small
 small puddles 
 you can see the fault lines of san francisco and the way the water pours out under the bridge just entirely different than any other way that you could have if you had not found a way to conquer your fear 
 you see a beauty that otherwise never would have happened
  so that it allows you to
