  these rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years and are responsible for much of whats gone on on our planet this is an example of a real meteorite and you can see all the melting of the iron from the speed and the heat
  a meteorite hits the earth and just how much of it survives and melts 
 from a meteorite from space  
 were over here with an original sputnik this is one of the seven surviving sputniks that was not launched into space this is not a copy the space age began fifty years ago in october  and thats exactly what sputnik looked like  
 and it wouldnt be fun to talk about the space age without seeing a flag that was carried to the moon and back on apollo eleven the astronauts each got to carry about ten silk
  flags in their personal kits they would bring them back and mount them  so this has actually been carried to the moon and back  so thats for fun 
 the dawn of books is of course important  and it wouldnt be interesting to talk about the dawn of books without having a copy of a guttenberg bible  you can see how portable and handy it was to have your own guttenberg
  interesting about the guttenberg bible and the dawn of this technology is not the book  you see the book was not driven
 by reading 
 in one thousand four hundred and fifty five nobody could read  so why did the printing press succeed this is an original page of a guttenberg bible  so youre looking here at one of the first printed books using movable type in the history of man 
 five hundred and fifty years ago we are living
  at the age here at the end of the book  where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it but why is this so interesting heres the quick story 
 it turns out that in the 1450s the catholic church needed money  and so they 
  actually hand wrote these things called indulgences which were forgivenesss on pieces of paper they traveled all around europe and
 sold by the hundreds or by the thousands they got you out of purgatory faster  and when the printing press was invented what they found was they could print indulgences which was the equivalent of printing money  and so all of western europe started buying printing presses in 
 to print out thousands and then hundreds of thousands and then ultimately millions of single small pieces of paper that got you out of middle hell and into heaven that is why the printing press succeeded and that is why
  martin luther nailed his ninety theses to the door because he was complaining that the catholic church had gone amok in printing out indulgences and selling 
  them in every town and village and city in all of western europe so the printing press ladies and gentlemen was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses and had nothing to do with reading more tomorrow i also have pictures coming of the library for those of you that have asked for
  pictures were going to have some tomorrow applause
 instead of showing an object from the stage im going to do something special for the first time we are going to show actually what the library looks like 
 ok so 
 i am married to the most wonderful woman in the world youre going to find out why in a minute because when i went to see eileen this is what i said i wanted to build this is the library of human imagination the room itself is three stories
  tall in the glass panels are five thousand years of human imagination that are computer controlled the room is a theatre it changes colors and all throughout the library are different 
 objects different spaces its designed like an escher print here is some of the lower level of the library where the exhibits constantly change you can walk through you can touch you can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room theres my very own saturn v everybody should
  have one  ok 
 so you can see here in the lower level of the library the books and the objects in the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination there is a glass bridge that you walk across 
  thats suspended in space so its a leap of imagination how do we create part of the question that i have answered is is we create by surrounding
 surrounding ourselves with stimuli with human achievement with history with the things that drive us and make us human the passionate discovery the bones of dinosaurs 
  long gone the maps of space that weve experienced and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination  so hopefully tomorrow ill show one or two more objects 
  from the stage but for today i just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it  and eileen and i are thrilled to open our home and share it with the ted community
  ted is all about patterns in the clouds its all about connections its all about seeing things that everybody else has seen before but thinking about them 
  in ways that nobody has thought of them before and thats really what discovery and imagination is all about 
  but we know it exists because weve been taught to understand this molecule  but we can also look at an enigma machine from the nazis in world war ii that was a coding and decoding machine now
 you might say what does this have to do with this well  this is the code for life and this is a code for death  
  these two
 molecules code and decode and yet looking at them you would see a machine
 and a molecule  but once  youve seen them in a new way  you realize that both of these things really are connected and theyre connected primarily because of this here 
 you see this is a human brain model 
 ok and its rare because we never really get to see a brain we get to see a skull but there it is all of imagination everything that we think we feel we sense comes through the human brain
  and once we create new patterns in this brain once we shape the brain in a new way it never returns to its original shape
