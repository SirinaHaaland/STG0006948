  i have been a police officer for a very very long time and you see these notes in my hand because i 'm also a black preacher and
 if you know anything about black preachers we 'll
  keep going for another twenty minutes laughter
 so i need this to keep pushing this thing forward i 've been a police officer for a very long time and i mean i predated technology i 'm talking about before pagers 
 laugh if you want to but i 'm telling the truth  i predate war on
 our fellow man i mean war on drugs i predate all of that 
 i predate so much and i 've been through ebbs and flows and i 've been through good and bad times and still i absolutely
  love being a police officer  i love being a police officer because it 's always been a calling for me and never a job 
 and even with that my personal truth is that law enforcement
 is in a crisis it 's an invisible crisis and it has been for many many years even though we in law enforcement say you know what
  we can 't arrest our way out of this 
 we say in law enforcement things like yeah it 's illegal to profile you know what in law enforcement we even agree that we have to adopt this thinking and
 become more oriented to community policing  and yet all the while 
 still we continue in the same vein the same vein that contradicts everything that we just admitted
 and so that 's the reason for me several years ago  
 because i was tired of the racism i was tired of discrimination i was tired of the isms and the schisms i was just so tired 
 i was tired of the vicious cycle and i was tired of it even in the beloved agency
 in the department that i still love today  and so my wife and i we sat down and we decided and we targeted a date that we would retire
  we would retire and i would go off into the sunset maybe do ministry full time  love my wife a long time y 'all know what i 'm talking about 
 but we decided that i would retire but then there was a higher power than i 
 there was a love for the city
 that i loved that i grew up in that i was educated in
 a city that pulled my heart back into the system
  so we didn 't retire  we didn 't retire and so what happened was over the next i would say eighteen months nineteen months  
 i had this passion to implement some radical policing  
 and so now over the next nineteen months i shifted and i transcended from being a drug sergeant
  as a drug sergeant
 and went from level to level to level until i find myself as a district commander commander of the worst district in baltimore city 
 we call it the eastern district the most violent district the most impoverished district forty six percent
 unemployment in that district national rating at that time  national rating the aids
  was always on the top ten list for zip codes
 for cities across the nation or just zip codes across the nation the top ten i didn 't say state i didn 't say city that little neighborhood 
 and i said you know what we gotta do something different  
 we gotta do something different we gotta think radical  we gotta think outside the box  and so in order to bring change that i desperately wanted and i desperately felt in my
  i had to start listening to that inner spirit  i had to start listening to that man on the inside that went against everything
 that i had been trained to do  but we still did it we still did it because we listened to that inner spirit  because i realized this  if
 i was to see real police reform
 in the communities that i had authority over for public safety  we had to change our stinkin ' thinkin
 ' we had to change it and so what we did is we
  to think holistically and not paramilitarily so we thought differently  
 and we started to realize that it could never be and never should have been us versus them 
 and so i decided to come to that intersection where i could meet
 all classes all races all creeds all colors where i would meet the businesses and the faith based and the eds the meds and i would meet all the people that made up the communities that i had authority
  over
 so i met them and i began to listen see police have a problem off the top we want to bring things into the community and come up with these extravagant strategies and deployments  
 but we never talk to the community about them 
 and we shove them into the community and say take that 
 but we said we 'd get rid of that stinkin ' thinkin ' so we talked to our communities we said this is your community table we 'll pull up a chair we want to hear from you what 's going to work in your community
 and then some great things started to happen see here 's the thing  i had to figure out a way to shift
 one hundred and thirty cops that were under my tutelage
 from being occupiers of communities to being partners  
 i had to figure out how to do that because  here 's the crazy thing 
 in law enforcement we have evolved into something incredible listen we have become great protectors we know how to protect you
 but we have exercised that arm so much so very much if i was a natural police department
 and i represented a police department you would see this incredible beautiful
  protection that 's who we are but we 've exercised it so much sometimes
 that it has led to abuse it
 's led to coldness and callousness and dehumanized us and we 've forgotten the mantra across this nation is to protect and
 serve  y 'all don 't know that protect and serve 
  's kinda weak it looks sickly it 's withering and it 's dying
 because we 've invested so much in our protective arm  but we forgot
 to treat our communities like they 're our customers like they 're our sons and daughters our brothers and sisters our mothers and fathers 
  along the way we 've gotten out of balance and because we are a proud profession 
 it is very hard for us to look in the mirror and see our mistakes  it 's even harder to make a change  
 and so  as i try to hurry and get through this i need to say this it 's not just law enforcement though 
 because every one of us makes up a community  everybody makes up a community
  and as communities can i say this we have put too much responsibility on law enforcement 
 too much 
 and then we have the audacity and the nerve to get upset with law enforcement when we take action  
 there is no way in the world
 that we as a community should be calling the police
  for kids playing ball in the street 
 no way in the world that we should be calling the police because my neighbor 's music is up too loud because his dog came over to my yard and did a number two there 's no way we should be calling the police  
 but we have surrendered so much of our responsibility
  when i was a little boy coming up in baltimore and listen we played rough in the street i ain 't never see the police come and break us up 
  was the elders it was the parental figures in the community  
 it was those guardians it was that village mentality they came and said stop that and do this and stop that we had mentors
 throughout all of the community  so it takes all of us all of us
 and when i say community i 'm talking about everything that makes up a community even listen because i 'm a preacher  i 'm very hard on the churches  
 because i believe the churches too often have become mia missing in action  i believe they have shifted over
  the last ten twenty years from being community churches where you walk outside your door round the corner and you 're in church they shifted from that and became commuter churches
  so you now have churches who have become disconnected by default from the very community where they 're planted 
 and they don 't take care of that community  i could go on and on but i really need to wrap this up
  we 've all lost that precious gift and i call it relational equity  
 we 've lost it with one another it 's not somebody else 's fault it 's all of our fault  
 we all take responsibility in this  but i say this it 's not too late for all of us to build our cities and nation to make it great again it is never too late  it is never too
  in that district  three years in after putting pastors in the car with my police because i knew this it 's a little secret i knew this  
 it was hard to stay a nasty police officer
 while you 're riding around with a clergy
  so we came up with some incredible initiatives  engagements for our community and police to build that trust back 
 we began to deal with our youth and with those who we consider are on the wrong side of the fence  we knew we had an economic problem  so we began to create jobs  we knew there
 was sickness in our community and they didn 't have access to proper medical care so we 'd partner up we got to that intersection and partnered up with anybody that wanted to partner with us and talked about what we needed holistically never thinking about the crime because at the end of the day 
 if we took care of the needs of the people if we got to the root cause 
 the crime would take care of itself  
 it would take care of itself
  we looked back and we looked over and found out that we were at a 40 year
 historical low our crime numbers our homicides everything had dropped down back to the 1970s and it might go back further but the problem is we only started keeping data since
 and so we gave them some of that 
 and in a short period of time the city went to a  30 year crime low 
 for the first time in thirty years we fell baltimore city to under two hundred homicides one hundred and ninety seven to be exact and we celebrated because we had learned to become
 great servers become great servers first  but i gotta tell you this these last few years
  as much as we had learned
 to become great
 proactive police officers and great relational police officers rather than reactive  these last years have disappointed me 
 they have broken my heart the uprising still hurts 
 it still hurts my heart  because truly i believe that it should 've never happened i believe it should 've never happened if we were allowed
  to continue along the vein that we were in servicing our community  treating them like human beings treating them with respect loving on them first  
 if we continued in that vein  it would 've never happened but somehow we went back to business as usual  
 but i 'm excited again  i 'm excited again because now we have a police commissioner
 who not only talks about
  community policing  
 but he absolutely understands it and more importantly he embraces it so i 'm very excited now listen  i 'm excited about baltimore today  
 because we as many cities i believe shall rise from the ashes  
 i believe
 i truly believe that we will be great again  i believe as we
  continue to wrap arms
 and continue to say we 're in this together because it 's not just an intersection 
 once we meet we now gotta get on the same path for the same goals and this city will become great again this nation will become great again  
 because we have the same goal we all want peace  we all want respect for one another we all want love and i believe we are back on that road  and i 'm so excited about it so listen i thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time  
 god bless you all
