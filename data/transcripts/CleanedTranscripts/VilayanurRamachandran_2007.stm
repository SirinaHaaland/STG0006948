  chris pointed out i study the human brain the functions and structure of the human brain and i just want you to think for a minute about what this entails  here is this
 mass of jelly
  mass of jelly
 you can hold in the palm of your hand and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space it can contemplate the meaning of infinity
 and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity and this peculiar recursive quality
 that we call self awareness which i think is the holy grail of neuroscience of neurology  and hopefully someday
  understand how that happens ok so how do you study this mysterious organ i mean you have one hundred billion
 nerve cells little wisps of protoplasm interacting with each other 
 and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness how does this happen  well  there are many ways of approaching
 the functions of the human brain  one approach
  the one we use mainly is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain where there 's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain  
 what then happens is not
  reduction in all your mental capacities a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability what you get is a highly selective loss of one function with other functions being preserved intact  
 and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function so you can then map function onto structure
 and then find out what the circuitry 's doing to generate that particular function  so  that 's what we 're trying to do 
 so let me give you a few striking examples of this in fact i 'm giving you three examples six minutes each during this talk 
 the first example is an extraordinary syndrome called capgras syndrome if you look at the first slide there 
 that 's the temporal lobes frontal lobes parietal lobes
  lobes that constitute the brain  
 and if you look tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes you can 't see it there is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus  
 and that 's been called the face area in the brain because when it 's damaged  you can no longer recognize people 's faces  you can still recognize them from their voice and say oh yeah that 's
  but you can 't look at their face and know who it is right you can 't even recognize yourself in the mirror  
 i mean you know it 's you because you wink and it winks and you know it 's a mirror  but you don 't really recognize yourself as as yourself 
 ok now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus but there 's another rare syndrome so rare in fact that very few
 physicians have heard about it not even neurologists this is called the capgras delusion and that is a patient who 's otherwise completely normal
  a head injury  comes out of coma otherwise completely normal he looks at his mother and says 
 this looks exactly like my mother this woman but she 's an impostor  she 's some other woman pretending to be my mother 
 now why does this happen  why would somebody and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects  but when he sees his mother his
  most common interpretation of this which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks is a freudian view  and that is that this chap
 and the same argument applies to women by the way but i 'll just talk about guys  
 when you 're a little baby a young baby  you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother this is the so called oedipus complex of freud  
 i 'm not saying i believe this but this is the standard freudian view  
 and then as you grow up the cortex develops and inhibits
 these latent sexual urges towards your mother  thank god or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother  
 and then what happens is there 's a blow to your head damaging the cortex allowing these latent sexual urges
 to emerge flaming to the surface and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother
  my mom how come i 'm being sexually turned on she 's some other woman she 's an impostor it 's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain 
 this has never made much sense to me this argument it 's very ingenious as all freudian arguments are
  exactly like fifi  but it 's some other dog right now you try using the freudian explanation there you 'll
 start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans or some such thing which is quite absurd of course  
 now  what 's really going on so to explain this curious disorder we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual
  in the brain  normally visual signals come in into the eyeballs go to the visual areas in the brain there are in fact thirty areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision 
 and after processing all that the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus
  where you perceive faces  there are neurons there that are sensitive to faces  you can call it the face area of the brain  right i talked about that earlier 
 now when that area 's damaged you lose the ability to see faces right but from that area the message
  cascades into a structure called the amygdala
 in the limbic system the emotional core of the brain  
 and that structure called the amygdala  gauges the emotional significance of what you 're looking at is it prey is it predator is it mate
 or is it something absolutely trivial like a piece of lint  or a piece of chalk  or a i don 't want to point to that but or a shoe or something like that ok  which you can completely ignore 
 so if the amygdala
  is excited and this is something important  the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system your heart starts beating faster you start sweating to dissipate the heat that you 're going to
 create from muscular exertion  
 and that 's fortunate because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating  so i can determine when you 're looking at something whether you 're excited or whether you 're aroused or not
 ok and i 'll get to that in a minute  
 so my idea was when this chap looks at an object  when he looks at his any object for that matter it goes to the visual areas
 and however and it 's processed in the fusiform gyrus and you recognize it as a pea plant  or a table or your mother for that matter  ok  
 and then the message cascades into the amygdala  
 and then goes down the autonomic nervous system  but maybe
  in this chap that wire that goes from the amygdala
 to the limbic system the emotional core of the brain is cut by the accident  
 so because the fusiform is intact  the chap can still recognize his mother and says oh yeah  this looks like my mother 
 but because the wire is cut to the emotional centers he says but how come if it 's my mother i don 't experience
  how do i account for this inexplicable lack of emotions this can 't be my mother  it 's some strange woman pretending to be my mother 
 how do you test this well what you do is if you take any one of you here and put you in front of a screen and measure your galvanic skin response and show pictures on the screen i can measure how you sweat
  when you see an object like a table or an umbrella of course you don 't sweat  if i show you a picture of a lion or a tiger or a pinup you start sweating  right  
 and believe it or not if i show you a picture of your mother
 i 'm talking about normal people you start sweating  you don 't even have to be jewish laughter
 now what happens if you show this patient 
 you take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response 
 tables and chairs and
  lint  nothing happens as in normal people but when you show him a picture of his mother  the galvanic skin response is flat there 's no emotional reaction to his mother  because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut  
 so his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal his emotions are normal he 'll laugh he 'll cry  so
 so forth but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor it 's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do take a bizarre seemingly incomprehensible 
 neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard freudian view is wrong that in fact you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain  by the way if this patient
 how are you where are you there 's no delusion through the phone 
 then she approaches him after an hour he says who are you you look just like my mother ok the reason is there 's a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain
 to the emotional centers  and that 's not been cut by the accident  so this explains why through the phone he recognizes
  he says it 's an impostor  ok
 how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain is it nature  genes or is it nurture  and we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome
 called phantom limb  
 and you all know what a phantom limb is when an arm is amputated  or a leg is amputated for gangrene or you lose it in war for example in the iraq war it 's now a serious problem
 you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing
 arm  and that 's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg in fact you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body believe it or not even with internal viscera i
 've had patients with the uterus removed
 hysterectomy who have a phantom uterus including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate
 time of the month and in fact one student asked me the other day do they get phantom pms
  ripe for scientific enquiry but we haven 't pursued that
  ok  now the next question is what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments one of the things we 've found was about half the patients with phantom limbs
 claim that they can move the phantom it 'll pat his brother on the shoulder  it 'll answer the phone when it rings it 'll wave goodbye these are
  patient 's not delusional he knows that the arm is not there but nevertheless it 's a compelling
 sensory experience for the patient 
 but however about half the patients this doesn 't happen  
 the phantom limb they 'll say but doctor the phantom limb is paralyzed  it 's fixed in a clenched spasm and it 's excruciatingly painful  if only i could move it maybe the pain will be relieved 
 now why would a phantom limb be paralyzed it sounds like an oxymoron but
 when we were looking at the case sheets what we found was
 these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury the actual nerve supplying the arm was severed was cut by say a motorcycle accident  
 so the patient had an actual arm  which is painful in a sling for a few months or a year  
 and then in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm  the surgeon amputates the arm  and then you get a phantom arm with the same
  pains  right  
 and this is a serious clinical problem patients become depressed some of them are driven to suicide  
 ok  so how do you treat this syndrome now why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb when i looked at the case sheet i found that they had an actual arm 
 and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut and the actual arm had been paralyzed and lying in a sling for several months
  the amputation and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom
 itself  why does this happen  when the arm was intact but paralyzed the brain sends commands to the arm the front of the brain saying move 
 but it 's getting visual feedback saying no 
 move no move no move no
  and this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain  and we call this learned paralysis ok the brain learns because of this hebbian associative link 
 that the mere command to move the arm
 creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm  and then when you 've amputated the arm  this learned paralysis carries over into your body image
 and into your phantom  ok  
  how do you help these patients  how do you unlearn the learned paralysis  so you can relieve him of this excruciating  clenching spasm of the phantom arm  
 well  we said what if you now send the command to the phantom  but give him visual feedback that it 's obeying his command 
 right  maybe you can relieve the phantom pain the phantom cramp  how do you do that well virtual reality but that costs millions of dollars  
 so i hit on a way of doing this for three dollars  but don 't tell my funding agencies
 what you do is you create what i call a mirror box you have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle  
 and then you put the phantom so my first patient derek came in 
 he had his arm amputated ten years ago  he had a brachial avulsion 
 so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed lying in a sling for a year  and then the arm was amputated  he had a phantom arm excruciatingly painful and he couldn 't move it it was a paralyzed phantom
  so he came there  and i gave him a mirror like that in a box which i call a mirror box  
 right  and the patient puts his phantom left arm  which is clenched and in spasm on the left side of the mirror  and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror  
 and makes the same posture  
 the clenched posture and looks inside the mirror  
 and what does he experience  he looks at the phantom being resurrected
  because he 's looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror  and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected 
 now i said now look  
 wiggle your phantom your real fingers or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror he 's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving 
 right that 's obvious but the astonishing thing is the patient then says oh my god my phantom is moving again and the pain the clenching spasm is relieved 
 and remember my first
  patient who came in 
 my first patient came in and he looked in the mirror and i said  look at your reflection of your phantom and he started giggling he says i can see my phantom 
 but he 's not stupid he knows it 's not real he knows it 's a mirror reflection but it 's a vivid sensory experience  
  oh my god my phantom is moving again i don 't believe this and my pain is being relieved ok  
 and then i said close your eyes he closes his eyes and move your normal hand 
 oh nothing it 's clenched again ok open your eyes oh my god oh my god it 's moving again so he was like a kid in a candy store  so i said
  ok this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input
  going to get a nobel prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb it 's a
 completely useless ability if you think about it 
 but then i started realizing maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in in neurology like stroke 
 focal dystonias there may be a learned component to this which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror  
  first of all the guy can 't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain i said look derek take it home and practice with it for a week or two maybe after a period of practice you can dispense with the 
  mirror  unlearn the paralysis and start moving your paralyzed arm  and then  relieve yourself of pain so he
  i thought maybe the mirror box was gone 
 he said no no no you know this phantom i 've had for the last ten years  it 's disappeared 
 and i said i got worried i said  my god  i mean i 've changed this guy 's body image what about human subjects ethics and all of that and i said derek does this bother you he said no
  last three days i 've not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain no clenching no phantom forearm pain all those pains are gone away  
 but the problem is i still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder  and your box doesn 't reach so  
 can you change the design and put it on my forehead so i can you know do this and eliminate my phantom fingers he thought i was some kind of magician now why does
  this happen it 's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict 
 it 's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back 
 on the other hand there 's no proprioception muscle signals saying that there is no arm  right  and your motor command saying there is an arm and because of this conflict the brain says to hell with it there is no phantom 
 there is no arm right it goes into a sort of denial it gates the signals and when the arm disappears 
 the bonus
  the pain disappears because you can 't have disembodied pain floating out there in space  
 so that 's the bonus now this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in helsinki so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain and indeed people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation 
 stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers  nothing you can do about it  but it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors this
  also gone through clinical trials helping lots and lots of patients  
 ok  let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk  which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia  
 this was discovered by francis galton in the nineteenth century he was a cousin of charles darwin 
 he pointed out that certain people in the population who are otherwise completely normal had the following peculiarity every time they see a number  it 's colored
  five is blue  seven is yellow  eight is chartreuse nine is indigo ok  
 bear in mind these people are completely normal in other respects or c sharp sometimes tones evoke color  c sharp is blue f sharp is green
  another tone might be yellow  right  
 why does this happen this is called
  mingling of the senses in us all the senses are distinct these people muddle up their senses why does this happen one of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing 
 synesthesia runs in families so galton said this is a hereditary basis a genetic basis  secondly synesthesia is about and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture which is about creativity
 synesthesia is eight times
  novelists and other creative people than in the general population  why would that be i 'm going to answer that question it 's never been answered before  
 ok  
 what is synesthesia what causes it well there are many theories one theory is they 're just crazy 
 now that 's not really a scientific theory so we can forget about it another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads right now 
 there may be some truth to this because it 's much more common here in the bay area than in san diego
  theory is that well  let 's ask ourselves what 's really going on in synesthesia all right so we found
 that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain in the fusiform gyrus  so we said there 's some accidental cross wiring between color
 and numbers in the brain  so every time you see a number you see a corresponding color and that 's why you get synesthesia  
 now remember why does this happen why would there be crossed wires
  some people remember i said it runs in families  that gives you the clue  and that is there is an abnormal gene a mutation
 in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring 
 in all of us  it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else  so every brain region is wired to every other region and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain
 and if that gene mutates then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas and if it 's between number and color you get number color synesthesia if it 's between tone and color you get tone color synesthesia  
 so far so good  
 now what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain  so everything is cross connected 
 well  think about what artists  novelists and poets have in common the ability to engage in metaphorical
  thinking linking seemingly unrelated ideas such as it is the east and juliet is the sun well you don 't say juliet is the sun does that mean she 's a glowing ball of fire
  i mean schizophrenics do that but it 's a different story right  
 normal people say she 's warm like the sun she 's radiant like the sun she 's nurturing like the sun  instantly you 've found the links now
 if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain
  then it 's going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia and hence the eight times more common incidence 
 of synesthesia among poets artists and novelists ok it 's a very phrenological view of synesthesia  the last demonstration can i take one minute
  it here 's what i call martian alphabet just like your alphabet a is a b is b 
 different shapes for different
 phonemes right  here you 've got martian alphabet  one of them is kiki one of them is bouba which one is kiki and which one is bouba how many of you think that 's kiki and that 's bouba raise your hands well it
 's one or two mutants
  how many of you think that 's bouba that 's kiki raise your hands ninety nine percent of you now none of you is a martian how did you do that  it 's because you 're all doing a cross model synesthetic 
  abstraction meaning you 're saying that that sharp inflection ki ki in your auditory cortex  the hair cells being excited kiki  
  very important because what it 's telling you
 is your brain is engaging in a primitive it 's just it looks like a silly illusion  
 but these photons in your eye are doing this shape  and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern  but the brain is able to
 extract the common denominator it 's a primitive form of abstraction  and we now know this happens in the
 fusiform gyrus of the brain because when that 's damaged these people lose the ability to engage in bouba kiki
  but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor
