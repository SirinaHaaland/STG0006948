  a month ago today i stood there  
 ninety degrees south the top of the bottom of the world the geographic south pole and i stood there beside two very good friends of mine richard weber and kevin vallely  together we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the south pole
  took us  thirty three days twenty three hours and fifty five minutes to get there 
 we shaved five days off the previous best time and in the process i became the first person in history to make the entire 
  journey from hercules inlet to south pole  solely on feet without skis
  if you will dragging a sled as you just saw in that video clip with one hundred and seventy pounds of gear in it everything you need to survive
 on your antarctic trek it 's going to be forty below every single day you 'll be in a massive headwind and at some point you 're going to have to cross these cracks in the ice these crevasses
  some of them have a very precarious thin footbridge underneath them that could give way at a moment 's notice taking your sled you into the abyss never to be seen again 
 the punchline to your journey  look at the horizon  
 yes it 's uphill the entire way because the south pole is at ten thousand feet and you 're starting at sea level 
 our journey did not in fact begin at hercules inlet where frozen ocean meets the land of antarctica
 it began a little less than two years ago
  of buddies of mine and i had finished a 
  run across the entire sahara desert  
 and while we were there we learned the seriousness of the water crisis in northern africa we also learned
 that many of the issues facing the people of northern africa affected young people the most i
 came home to my wife after one hundred and eleven days of running in the sand and
  doubt if this bozo can get across the desert  
 we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to but if i 'm going to continue doing these adventures there has to be a reason for me to do them beyond just getting there 
 around that time
 i met an extraordinary human being peter thum who inspired me with his actions he 's trying to find and solve water issues the crisis around the world his dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition a run to the south pole where with an interactive website
  will be able to bring young people students and teachers from around the world on board the expedition with me 
 as active members 
 so we would have a live website that every single day of the  thirty three days we would be blogging telling stories of you know  depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces 
 or we will burn  
 crossing miles and miles of sastrugi frozen ice snowdrifts that could be
 i 'm telling you crossing these things with 170 pound sled that sled may as well have weighed one thousand seven hundred pounds because that 's what it felt like 
 we were blogging to this live website daily to these students that were tracking us as well about 10 hour trekking days 15 hour trekking days  
 sometimes twenty hours of trekking daily to meet our goal
  forty below on our sled incidentally 
 in turn  students people from around the world would ask us questions young people would ask the most amazing questions one of my favorite it 's forty below 
 you 've got to go to the bathroom  where are you going to go and how are you going to do it i 'm
 not going to answer that but i will answer some of the more popular questions where do you sleep  we slept in a tent that was very low to the ground because the winds on antarctica were so
  it would blow anything else away what do you eat one of my favorite dishes on expedition butter and bacon it 's about a million calories  we were burning about eight thousand five hundred a day so we needed it 
 how many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have virtually none all of our equipment including film equipment was charged by the sun 
 and do you get along  
 i certainly hope so because at some point or another on this expedition one of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle and put it in an infected blister
  drain it for you 
 but seriously  seriously we did get along  because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people they were our teammates they were inspiring us the stories we 
  were hearing got us to the south pole the website worked brilliantly as a two way street of communication 
  pretending they were richard ray and kevin 
 amazing  
 we arrived at the south pole  we huddled into that tent forty five below that day i 'll never forget it we looked at each other with these
 these looks of disbelief at what we had just completed  and i remember looking at the guys thinking what do i take from this journey you know seriously
  i take from this journey
