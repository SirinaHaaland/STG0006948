  my name is joshua walters i 'm a performer
  but as far as being a performer  i 'm also diagnosed bipolar 
 i reframe that as a positive because the crazier i get onstage 
 the more entertaining i become 
  was sixteen in san francisco i had my breakthrough manic episode in which i thought i was jesus christ maybe you thought that was
 scary but actually there 's no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you 're jesus christ 
 laughter i was sent to a place
 psych ward  and in the psych ward  everyone is doing their own 
 there 's no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time 
 they 're just practicing one day they 'll get here
  now when i got out i was diagnosed and i was given medications by a psychiatrist
  of you are in the field i can see i can feel your noise 
 the first half of high school was
 the struggle of the manic episode and the second half was
 the overmedications of these drugs where i was sleeping through high school the second half was just
 one big nap pretty much in class
  out i had a choice i could either deny my mental illness
 or
 embrace my mental skillness 
 there 's a movement going on right now to reframe mental illness as a positive at least the hypomanic
 edge part of it now if you don 't know what hypomania is it 's like
 an engine that 's out of control maybe a ferrari engine with no breaks  
 many of the speakers here  many of you in the audience have that creative edge if you know what i 'm talking about 
 you 're driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible and there 's a book
 john gartner john gartner wrote this book called the hypomanic edge
  in which christopher columbus and ted turner and steve jobs and all these business minds have this edge to compete 
 a different book was written not too long ago in the  mid 90s called  
 touched with fire by kay redfield jamison in which it was looked at in a creative sense in which mozart and beethoven and van gogh all have this manic depression that they were suffering with some of them committed suicide
 so it wasn 't all
 the good side of the illness now recently  there 's been
 development in this field and there was an article written in the new york times september two thousand and ten that stated 
 just manic
  just be manic enough in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs that have this kind of spectrum
 you know what i 'm talking about not maybe full bipolar  but they 're in the bipolar spectrum
 where on one side maybe
 you think you 're jesus  and on the other side maybe they just make you a lot of money
 your call  your call  and everyone 's somewhere in the middle  
 everyone 's somewhere in the middle  so maybe 
 you know 
 there 's no such thing
 as crazy  and being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn 't mean you 're crazy but maybe it just means you 're more sensitive
 to what most people can 't see or feel maybe
 no one 's really crazy  everyone is just a little bit mad
  how much depends on where you fall in the spectrum
  how much depends on how lucky you are
