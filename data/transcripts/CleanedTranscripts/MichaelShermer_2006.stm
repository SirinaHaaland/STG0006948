  i 'm michael shermer director of the skeptics society publisher of skeptic magazine we investigate claims of the paranormal  pseudo science fringe groups and cults and claims of all kinds between science and
  and unless you 've been on mars recently you know there 's a lot of that out there  some people call us debunkers which is kind of a negative term but let 's face it there 's a lot of bunk 
 we are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there 
  sort of like the ralph naders of bad ideas trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas i 'll show you an example of a bad idea  i brought this with me this was
 given to us by nbc
  dateline to test  it 's produced by the quadro corporation of west virginia it 's called the quadro two thousand dowser rod 
 this was being sold to high school administrators for $ nine hundred apiece  it 's a piece of plastic with a radio shack antenna attached to it 
 you could dowse for all sorts of things but this particular one was built to dowse
 for marijuana in
  students ' lockers 
 so the way it works is you go down the hallway  
 and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker and then you open the locker so it looks something like this i 'll show you
 sir do you want to empty your pockets please sir 
 so the question was can it actually find marijuana in students ' lockers and the answer is if you open enough of them  yes 
 but in science we have to keep track of the misses not just the hits and that 's probably the key lesson to my short talk here
  work astrologers tarot card readers and so on people remember the hits and forget the misses in science we keep the whole database and look to see if the number of hits somehow
 stands out from the total number you 'd expect by chance in this case we tested it we had two opaque boxes one with 
  government approved thc marijuana and one with nothing and it got it fifty percent of the time 
 which is exactly what you 'd expect with a coin flip model so that 's just a fun
  little example here of the sorts of things we do skeptic is the quarterly publication each one has a particular theme this one is on the future of intelligence are people getting smarter or dumber  
  i have an opinion of this myself because of the business i 'm in but in fact people it turns out are getting smarter three iq points
  with science don 't think of skepticism as a thing or science as a thing are science and religion compatible it 's like are science and plumbing compatible they 're just two different things science is not a thing it 's a verb it 's a way of
 thinking about things it 's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena  i mean what 's more likely 
 that extraterrestrial intelligences or multi dimensional beings travel across vast distances of interstellar space to leave a crop circle in farmer bob 's field in puckerbrush kansas to promote
 it more likely that a reader of skeptic did this with photoshop and in all cases we have to ask 
 what 's the more likely explanation before we say something is out of this world we should first make sure that it 's not in this world what 's more likely that arnold had extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship 
 or that the world weekly news makes
  the same theme is expressed nicely here in this sidney harris cartoon 
 for those of you in the back it says here then a miracle occurs i think you need to be more explicit here in step two 
 this single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments there 's nothing more to it than that 
 you can say a miracle occurs it 's just that it doesn 't explain anything or offer anything there 's nothing to test  it 's the end of the conversation for intelligent design
 creationists
 and it 's true scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers dark energy or dark matter something like that until we figure out what it is we 'll call it this  it 's the beginning 
  of the causal chain for science  for intelligent design creationists it 's the end of the chain 
 perceptual cognitive mistakes or even fakes this is a ufo shot from my house in altadena california 
 looking down over pasadena  and if it looks a lot like a buick hubcap  it 's because it is you don 't
 even need photoshop or high tech equipment you don 't need computers this was shot with a
 throwaway kodak instamatic camera you just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go camera 's ready that 's it 
  although it 's possible that most of these things are fake or illusions or
 or so on  and that some of them are real it 's more likely that all of them are fake like the crop circles on a more serious note in all of science we 're looking for a balance between
 data and theory in the case of
 of galileo he had two problems when he turned his telescope to saturn  
 first of all there was no theory of planetary rings second of all his data was grainy and fuzzy and he couldn 't quite make out what he was looking at
  so he wrote that he had seen i have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies and this is what he  he ended up concluding that he saw  so without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data 
 you can 't have a good good theory it wasn 't solved until one thousand six hundred and fifty five this is christiaan huygens 's book that catalogs all the mistakes people made trying to figure out what was going on with saturn it wasn 't
 till huygens had two things he had a good theory of
  planetary rings and how
 the solar system operated and he had better telescopic more fine grain data in which he could figure out that as the earth is going around faster according to kepler 's laws than saturn then we catch up with it and we see the angles of the rings at different
 different angles there  and that in fact  turns out to be true  the problem with having
  may be loaded with cognitive biases so one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is
 that we have things on a simple level and then i 'll go to more serious ones like we have a tendency to see faces this is the face on mars 
  there was a whole movement to get nasa to photograph that area because
 people thought this was monumental architecture made by martians here 's the close up of it from two thousand and one if you squint you can still see the face and when you 're squinting
  turning that from fine grain to coarse grain so you 're reducing the quality of your data 
 and if i didn 't tell you what to look for you 'd still see the face because we 're programmed by evolution to see faces faces are important for us socially 
 and of course happy faces faces of all kinds are easy to see you
 see the happy face on mars there 
 if astronomers
 were frogs perhaps they 'd see kermit the frog do you see him there little froggy legs or if geologists were elephants  religious 
 discovered by a tennessee baker in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six he charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun till he got
 a cease and desist from mother teresa 's lawyer  
 here 's our lady of guadalupe and our lady of watsonville just down the street or is it up the street from here  tree bark is particularly good because it 's nice and grainy
  branchy black and white splotchy and you can get the  pattern seeking humans are pattern seeking animals  here 's the virgin mary on the side of a glass window in sao paulo 
 here 's when the virgin mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich which i got to actually hold in
 a las vegas casino of course this being america this casino paid $ twenty eight
  but who does it really look like the virgin mary it
 has that sort of puckered lips   1940s era look virgin mary in clearwater florida i actually went to see this one
  there was a lot of people there the faithful come in their
 wheelchairs and crutches and so on we went down and
  give you a size that 's dawkins me and the amazing randi next to this two two and a half story sized image all these candles thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this 
 so we walked around the backside to see what was going on it turns out wherever there 's a sprinkler head and a palm tree  
 you get the effect here 's the virgin mary on the backside  which they started to wipe off i guess you can only have one miracle per building 
 so is it really a miracle of mary or is it a miracle of marge
 and now i 'm going to finish up with
 another example of this with
 auditory illusions  there 's this film white noise with michael keaton about the dead talking back to us by the way the whole business of talking to the dead is not that big a deal anybody can do it turns out it 's getting the dead to talk back that 's the really
 hard part in this case  supposedly these messages are hidden
  in electronic phenomena there 's a  reversespeech com web page where i downloaded this stuff this is the most famous one of all of these here 's the forward
  it is backwards  and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in
  auditory part of your brain to tell you what you 're supposed to hear and then hear it again
  can 't miss it when i tell you what
  end with a positive  nice little story the skeptics is a
 nonprofit educational organization we 're always looking for little good things that people do and in england there 's
 a pop singer one of the top popular singers in england today katie melua  and she wrote a beautiful song it was in the top five
 in two thousand and five called 
  million bicycles in beijing it 's a love story she 's sort of the norah jones of the uk about how she much loves her guy and compared to nine million bicycles and so forth and she has this one passage here
  at least she got it close in america it 'd be we 're six thousand light years from the edge 
 but my friend simon singh the particle physicist now turned science educator  who wrote the book the big bang and so on  uses every chance he gets to promote good science and so he wrote an op ed
 piece in the guardian about katie 's song in which he said well  
 we know exactly how far
  point seven billion light years and it 's not a guess we know within precise error bars how close it is so we can say although not absolutely true it 's pretty close to being true  
 and to his credit katie called him up after this op ed piece came out and said i 'm so embarrassed i was in the astronomy club i should 've known better and she re cut the song 
  so i will end with the new version
