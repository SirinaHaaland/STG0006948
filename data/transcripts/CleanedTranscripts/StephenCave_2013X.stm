  who here remembers when they first realized they were going to die  
 i do i was a young boy  and my grandfather had
  and i remember
 a few days later lying in bed at night trying to make sense of what had happened 
 what did it mean that he was dead where had he gone it was like
 a hole in reality had opened up and swallowed him  
 but then the really shocking question occurred to me if he could die  could it happen to me too 
 could that hole in reality open up and swallow me would it open up beneath my
  bed and swallow me as i slept  
 well 
 at some point all children become aware of death  
 it can happen in different ways of course and usually comes in stages our idea of death develops as we grow older  
 and if you reach back into the dark corners of your memory you might
  remember something like what i felt
 when my grandfather died and when i realized it could happen to me too 
 that sense that behind all of this the void is waiting  
 and this development in childhood
 reflects the development of our species 
 just as there was a point in your development as a child when your sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for you to realize you were
  mortal  
 so at some point in the evolution of our species some early human 's sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough
 for them to become the first human to realize i 'm going to die 
 this is if you like our curse it 's the
 price we pay for being so damn clever we have to live in the knowledge that the worst thing that can possibly happen
 one day surely will the end of all our projects our hopes our dreams of our individual world 
 we each live in the shadow of a personal apocalypse  
 and that 's frightening it 's terrifying  and so we look for a way out and in my case as i was about five years old this meant asking my mum
 now when i first started asking
 what happens when we die the grown ups around me at the time
 answered with a typical english mix of awkwardness and half hearted christianity  
 and the phrase i heard most often was that granddad was now up there looking down on us 
 and if i should die too which wouldn 't happen of course then i too would go up there
 which made death sound a lot like an existential elevator  
 now this didn 't sound very plausible  
 i used to watch a children 's news program at the time  and this was the era of space exploration there were always rockets going up into the sky up into space going up there  
 but none of the astronauts when they came back ever mentioned having met my granddad
 or any other dead
  people 
 but i was scared  and the idea of taking the existential elevator to see my granddad sounded a lot better than being swallowed by the void while i slept  
 and so i believed it anyway even though it didn 't make much sense  
 and this thought process that i went through as a child and have been through many times since including as a grown up is a product of what psychologists
  call a bias now a bias is a way in which we systematically get things wrong 
 ways in which we miscalculate misjudge  distort reality or see what we want to see  
 and the bias i 'm talking about
 works like this confront someone with the fact that they are going to die and they will believe just about any story that tells them it isn 't
  true and they can instead live forever even if it means taking the existential elevator now we can see this
 as the biggest bias of all 
 it has been demonstrated in over four hundred empirical studies now these studies are ingenious but they 're simple they work like this 
 you take two groups of people who are similar in all relevant respects
  you remind one group that they 're going to die but not the other then you compare their behavior 
 so you 're observing how it biases behavior when people become aware of their mortality  
 and every time you get the same result people who are made aware of their mortality
 are more willing to believe stories that tell them they can escape death and live forever  so here 's an
  example one recent study took two groups of agnostics that is people who are undecided in their religious beliefs 
 now one group was asked to think about being dead the other group was asked to think about being lonely 
 they were then asked again about their religious beliefs those who had been asked to think
  about being dead
 were afterwards twice as likely to express faith in god and jesus twice as likely  
 even though the before they were all equally agnostic  but put the fear of death in them and they run to jesus  
 now this shows that reminding people of death biases them to believe regardless of the evidence  and it works not just for
  but for any kind of belief system that promises immortality in some form  whether it 's becoming famous or having children or even nationalism which promises you can live on as part of a greater whole 
 this is a bias that has shaped the course of human history  
 now  the theory behind this bias in the over four hundred studies is called terror management theory
  and the idea is simple it 's just this we develop our worldviews that is the stories we tell ourselves about the world and our place in it 
 in order to help us manage the terror of death 
 and these immortality stories have thousands of different manifestations  
 but i believe that behind the apparent diversity there are actually just four basic forms that these immortality stories can take
  and we can see them repeating themselves throughout history just with slight variations to reflect the vocabulary of the day  
 now i 'm going to briefly introduce these four basic forms of immortality story  and i want to try to give you some sense of the way in which they 're retold by each culture or generation
 using the vocabulary of their day  now  the first story is the simplest we want to avoid death
  and the dream of doing that in this body in this world forever is the first and simplest kind of immortality story  
 and it might at first sound implausible  but actually almost every culture in human history
 has had some myth or legend of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth or something that promises to keep us going forever
  egypt had such myths  ancient babylon ancient india  
 throughout european history we find them in the work of the alchemists and of course we still believe this today only we tell this story using the vocabulary of science  
 so one hundred years ago  hormones had just been discovered 
 and people hoped that hormone treatments were going to cure aging and disease and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells  genetic engineering
  and nanotechnology  but the idea that science can cure death
 is just one more chapter in the story of the magical elixir a story that is as old as civilization  
 but betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir and staying alive forever is a risky strategy when we look back through history
 at all those who have sought an elixir in the past
 the one thing they now have in common is that they 're all dead  
 so we need a backup plan and exactly this kind of plan b is what the second kind of immortality story offers  
 and that 's resurrection  
 and it stays with the idea that i am this body i am this physical organism  
 it accepts that i 'm going to have to die
  despite that i can rise up and i can live again 
 in other words  i can do what jesus did jesus died he was three days in the [ tomb ] and then he rose up and lived again 
 and the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again is orthodox believe not just for christians but also jews and muslims  
 but our desire to believe this story is so deeply embedded
 that we are reinventing it again for the scientific age  for example with the idea of cryonics
 that 's the idea that when you die  you can have yourself frozen  
 and then at some point when technology has advanced enough you can be thawed out and repaired and revived and so resurrected and
 so some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again and other people believe an omnipotent scientist will do it 
 but for others the whole idea of resurrection of climbing out of the grave
  just too much like a bad zombie movie 
 they find the body too messy too unreliable to guarantee eternal life  
 and so they set their hopes on the third more spiritual immortality story  the idea that we can leave our body behind and live on as a soul 
 now the majority of people on earth believe they have
  and the idea is central to many religions  
 but even though in its current form in its traditional form 
 the idea of the soul is still hugely popular nonetheless we are again reinventing it for the digital age  for example with the idea that you can leave your body behind by uploading 
  your mind your essence the real you onto a computer  and so live on as an avatar in the ether  
  particularly neuroscience it suggests that your mind your essence the real you is very much dependent on a particular part of your body that is your brain  
 and such skeptics can find comfort in the fourth kind of immortality story  and that is legacy 
 the idea that you can live on through the echo you leave in the world
  like the great greek warrior achilles who sacrificed his life fighting at troy so that he might win immortal fame  
 and the pursuit of fame is as widespread and popular now as it ever was 
 and in our digital age  it 's even easier to achieve you don 't need to be a great warrior like achilles or a great king or hero all you need is an internet connection and a funny cat 
 but some people prefer to leave a more tangible biological legacy children for example
  or they like they hope to live on as part of some greater whole a nation or a family or a tribe their gene pool  
 but again there are skeptics
 who doubt whether legacy really is immortality woody allen for example who said i don 't want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen i want to live on in my apartment
  so those are the four basic kinds of immortality stories  
 and i 've tried to give just some sense of how they 're retold by each generation with just slight variations to fit the fashions of the day  
 and the fact that they recur in this way 
 in such a similar form but in such different belief systems  suggests i think that we should be skeptical of the truth of any particular version of these stories 
 the fact that some people believe an omnipotent god
 will resurrect them to live again and others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it suggests that neither are really believing this
 on the strength of the evidence  
 rather we believe these stories because we are biased to believe them  and we are biased to believe them because we are so afraid of death
  so the question is 
 are we doomed to lead the one life we have in a way that is shaped by fear and denial 
 or can we overcome this bias  
 well the greek philosopher epicurus thought we could 
 he argued that the fear of death is natural  but it is not rational death he said
  is nothing to us because when we are here death is not and when death is here we are gone 
 now this is often quoted but it 's difficult to really grasp to really internalize because exactly this idea of being gone is so difficult to imagine 
 so two thousand years later another philosopher  ludwig wittgenstein put it like this 
 death is not an event in life we do not live to experience death  and so
  added in this sense life has no end 
 so it was natural for me as a child to fear being swallowed by the void  but it wasn 't rational  
 because being swallowed by the void is not something that any of us will ever live to experience 
 now overcoming this bias is not easy because the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us  yet when we see that the
  fear itself is not rational  
 and when we bring out into the open the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us then we can at least start to try to minimize the influence it has on our lives  
 now i find it helps to see life as being like a book 
 just as a book is bounded by its covers by beginning and end  so our lives are bounded by birth and death
 and even though a book is limited by beginning and end  it can encompass distant landscapes exotic figures fantastic adventures  
 and even though a book is limited by beginning and end  the characters within it know no horizons 
 they only know the moments that make up their story even when the book is closed  
  characters of a book are not afraid of reaching the last page long john silver is not afraid of you finishing your copy of treasure island 
 and so it should be with us  imagine the book of your life 
 its covers its beginning and end and your birth and your death you can only know the moments in between the moments that make up your life 
 it makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers
  before your birth or after your death 
 and you needn 't worry how long the book is or whether it 's a comic strip or an epic  
 the only thing that matters is that you make it a good story
