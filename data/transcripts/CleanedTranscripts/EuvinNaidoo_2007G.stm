  welcome to africa
 or rather i should say welcome home because this is where it all really began isn 't it 
 looking at fossils dating back several millions of years it all points to evidence that life for the human species as we know it
 began right here
 we are on an amazing journey
 the next four days you 're going to hear stories
 of africa the next chapter fantastic tales  anecdotes from speakers but i want to turn that upside down for a moment  
 and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say  
 what 's the worst thing you 've ever heard about africa  and this is not a rhetorical question
  want answers from you go for it the worst
 is about africa the story we have not heard the stories that we want to know and the stories that do exist about positive tales 
 a part of my
 talk is going to be about investment opportunities that exist on this continent to separate the rhetoric from the reality  the fact from the fiction 
 to go to the actual data and statistics that exist about the
 actual things that are happening
  on the ground that make africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you  
 so let 's get going because africa to some degree is on a turnaround 
 a turnaround in terms of how it manages its image and how it takes control of its own destiny 
 and turnarounds are part and parcel of what i have focused on
 for most of my professional career
  all started almost a decade ago 
 as a young consultant at mckinsey & company at their first african office in johannesburg  and there we worked with leading ceos on african issues and african companies
 on turnarounds making the companies not just the best in africa but the best globally  
 but i really formalized this focus on turnarounds when i was completing my mba in the united
  states  it all began with a fantastic phone call it was from rosabeth moss kanter 
 harvard business school guru and a professor of mine and she said i want to write a case euvin
 a case on a public sector leader that has lessons
 for the corporate world and the leader that came to mind was nelson mandela
 because nelson mandela  as he took over power as the first
 democratically elected president of south africa  faced a situation of a country that could have slid into the abyss of chaos  
 but he started the country on a path of a positive cycle 
 now the case nelson mandela change leader became part of the research base
 for a chapter in rosabeth 's new book called confidence
  became a new york times bestseller and topped business week 's hardcover bestseller list 
 and why i tell you this story is because later when i was interviewed on sabc africa on a pan african broadcast they asked what is
 your key lesson or the key thing you enjoy the most because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project
 the lesson from that was that it was africa an african story that was used to share news with the rest of the world of
  what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds africa
 was being used as a success story  
 so i want to share with you a personal story about a turnaround or a transformation and that has to do with me
 because in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four i packed a few things into a backpack
 and headed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career you should have seen my parents ' reaction
 but very soon  i found myself from the southern part of africa in south africa at the very north in egypt  and i sought out the most remote places 
 i went to the siwa oasis that was one of my stops and the siwa oasis is famous for several things but the key thing is that it was the place that alexander the great went to
 when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him and legend has it that alexander
  trekked through this desert  half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm and myth says that he had an audience with the oracle and it foretold his destiny of greatness 
 this was three hundred bc  so africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers 
 now the thing i remember about siwa
 was the magical view of the sky at night with no natural
  light source siva is one of these amazing places that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry 
 fast forward to two thousand and two i 'm sitting in cambridge massachusetts at the healthcare development conference and i see the same picture but from the opposite side 
 a satellite picture looking down at the earth  
 and it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me
 because i 'll never forget it i remember the very
  moment  and i wanted to share that image with you of what i saw at that point 
 the first thing that i saw was north america at night
 glowing  in all its glory  a warm feeling 
 light
  and then i saw it africa  quite literally the dark continent 
 and while africa may be dark the thing that brought
 the message home to me
 was that this is the challenge we are facing  but it 's also the opportunity  
 because whilst africa may be dark other than the few specks that exist north and in the south and other areas
  it 's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there  entrepreneurs dynamic people people with hope
 it was george kimble the geographer who said
 that the only thing dark about africa is our ignorance of it 
 so let 's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer  let 's start unpacking it
 africa
 is the second largest continent  a landmass second from asia  
 it also is the second most populated continent with nine hundred million people  
 in fact coming back to the land mass africa is so big that you could fit in the continental united states  china  and the entire europe into africa and still have space
  africa is home to over one thousand languages
 two thousand is is another estimate that 's out there with over two thousand languages and dialects  
 but you could say invest in africa in over one thousand languages and it wouldn 't make a difference 
 what does the data say  
 as an investment banker i 'm in the
  and the changes that are taking place in capital markets  so i want to share with you some of these
 bellwether signals or signs and winds of change that are sweeping this continent  so let 's start on that and let 's start at the high level on the macro factors 
 inflation in general is coming down across africa that 's the first sign
 in many countries reaching double digit figures  so let 's start looking at some of those 
 i call it my z e n cluster  zambia from two thousand and four to two thousand and six moves from the eighteen percent in inflation to the nine percent
  egypt from the sixteen percent to about eight point four percent  
 nigeria a similar situation from the sixteen percent to the eight percent  single digits  
 more fascinating you have other countries
 south africa  mauritius namibia
  that 's just part of the story you have a similar trend with currencies currencies going through an extreme time of stability  
 but that 's looking at the big picture and the first myth to dispel is that africa
 is not a country it 's made up
  very definition to say invest in africa is a no go it 's meaningless  each country
 has a unique value proposition you can make money you can lose money in africa but
 opportunities boy oh boy they exist and this is what today is about it 's about discussing those very
  so let 's start getting into the countries and into the specific material and data 
 i was recently elected as emeka mentioned as the president of the south african chamber of commerce in america  and i 'm very proud and happy to be in that role because it is 
  a fascinating position to be in to hear this dialogue that 's just increasing in tenor and velocity of
  talk about the gold the minerals the first world infrastructure
 a bit about the other side of it for example south africa was recently voted as the top
 destination for the top one thousand uk companies for offshore call centers same language  timeline  et cetera makes sense 
 other headlines that have recently reached south africa were bain capital and kkr the big boys of private equity
  headline in south africa they have landed quite ominous  but
 what were they there for to acquire assets bing capital 's acquisition of edcon  a large retailer 
 is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy because it is actually a long term play 
 being a retailer  it is a play on the belief that this middle class that 's growing will continue to grow
  that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue 
 but the story of africa  and my focus is beyond south africa
 because there 's so much happening 
 undoubtedly nigeria is clearly a hot spot  challenges and we will hear a lot about nigeria in these four days  but
 looking at goldman sachs ' work
 we had the
  famous bric report  
 the new report the next eleven highlights that by two thousand and twenty nigeria is going to be amongst the top ten economies in the world it 's an investment opportunity  
 think about that 
 is anyone
 our banks our investors seriously thinking about going to nigeria if you haven 't why not what 's going on
  couple of things  i want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets bellwether signs again  
 guarantee trust bank recently issued the first euro bond
 out of africa and this excludes south africa  but the first eurobond the raising of international capital offshore  
 off its own balance sheet  without any sovereign backing
  an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy  without any sovereign backing a nigerian company raising capital offshore  it 's just a sign of things to come looking at the oil industry 
 africa
 provides eighteen percent
 of the u s ' s oil supply with the middle east just sixteen percent it 's an important strategic partner 
 let 's put nigeria in perspective two point two to two point four million barrels of oil a day the same league as kuwait the same league as venezuela
  but with africa let 's start being careful about this and emeka and i have had these discussions we have to move away from what 's called the curse of the commodities 
 because it 's not about oil it 's not about commodities for africa to truly be sustainable we have to move beyond
 to other industries  so let 's unpack those very quickly and i 'm going to move through these very very very fast because i can see that clock counting down 
 what else is going on there
 egypt 
 egypt is launching a first large industrial zone two point eight billion investment the announcement just came out the last few weeks close to the mediterranean  near alexandria
 textiles  petrochemicals it 's being managed by 
 a singaporean based management company so they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse across the industries away from oil let 's look at agriculture
 let 's look at forestry what 's going on there  in tanzania last week we had the launch
 of the east african organic produce
 standard  again  gathering together farmers  gathering together stakeholders in east africa to get standards
 for organic produce better prices it ties in with
  small scale farmers in terms of no pesticides no fertilizers  again  opportunity
 to tackle markets to get that higher price  uganda  the new forest company 
 replanting and redeveloping their forests why is that important 
 as the energy
  needs are met and electricity is needed [ we will need ] poles for rolling out electricity but here is the sweetener in the deal they 're going to be tapping into carbon credits 
 let 's go back to nigeria  
 the banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation from over eighty banks to twenty five banks  strengthening of the system 
 but what 's going on there only ten percent of the country is banked the
 largest population in africa is in nigeria one hundred and
  people  think about that 
 there are only seven hundred atms in the country opportunity  the same for telecoms across the country 
 now let 's look at the continent as a whole people look at the roads for example and they 'd say angola  ninety percent of roads are
 nigeria seventy percent of roads are untarred  zambia eighty percent in general more than fifty percent of roads are untarred this is an opportunity  
 energy needs it 's an opportunity  
 so what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing let 's look at the stock markets in africa if i had to ask you in two thousand and five
 what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world
  to mind 
 in two thousand and five the egyptian stock exchange returned over one hundred and forty five percent  
 what 's going on in some of the other countries let 's look at some two thousand and six numbers  kenya over sixty percent 
 nigeria over forty percent south africa in the twenty percents high ones 
 these are the trends that are taking place
 but in any investment decision the key question is 
 what is my alternative investment 
 because in africa today we are competing globally for capital and global capital is agnostic it
 has no loyalties there 's an overhang of capital
  and the key is yield pickup 
 what africa is providing is a diversification play  and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor that 's aware of what he or she is doing 
 now when looking at africa vis a vis other things and countries in africa vis a vis other things comparisons become important ten years ago
 there were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the standard & poors moody 's and fitch 's 
  sixteen african countries and growing
 have sovereign country ratings  what does this mean take nigeria again  double b minus
 in the league of ukraine and turkey  immediately we have a comparison  
 the backbone of making investment decisions for global
 holders of capital some other figures south africa
 in fact one of the big agencies is setting up an office in africa  why are they doing that 
 because they expect investment to follow so one of the big bellwethers and one of my final points i want to mention is
 the interesting thing i read is that cnbc has launched their first african channel
  african news channel 
 they 're doing it because they are expecting things to happen me and you 
 the investments we are going to be making the investments the world is going to be making that 's the 24 hour news channel dedicated to africa  
 so that 's the change that 's coming down the pipeline 
 so in conclusion
  i want to turn back to that very slide that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago 
 this time [ i 'll ] give you the entire picture that i saw in two thousand and two and ask you
 that when you think about what your role can be in africa  think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent because there are amazing
  and think about the concept of transformation in the back of your mind
 because things can be turned around rather quickly in one thousand eight hundred and ninety nine joseph conrad
 released the heart of darkness a tale of grim horror
 along the congo river  
 if one looks
  on the congo river is one of those bright lights  and that 's the very congo river generating light
 the old heart of darkness now generating light with hydro electric power 
 that is a transformation in power of ideas  
 so the next step over the next four days is us exploring more of these ideas  
 and perchance if you can always keep this picture in your mind  that when we convene maybe
 in the distant future in two thousand and twenty twenty that picture will look very different  thank you
