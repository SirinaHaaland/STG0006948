  thank you 
 two years ago  i stood on the ted stage in arusha tanzania  
 i spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations  it was a simple machine that changed my life 
 before that time
  i had never been away from my home in malawi  
 i had never used a computer  i had never
 seen an internet on the stage that day  i was so nervous my english lost
  i had never been surrounded by so many azungu white people 
 laughter there was a story i wouldn 't tell you then but well  i 'm feeling good right now i would
 like to share that story today  
 we have seven children in my family all sisters  excepting me
 this is me with my dad when i was a little boy  
 before i discovered the wonders of science i was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers 
 like everyone else  we grew maize one year our fortune turned very bad 
 in two thousand and one we
  experienced an awful famine  within five months all malawians began to starve to death 
 my family ate one meal per day at night  
 only three swallows of nsima for each one of us 
 the food passes through our bodies
  we drop down to nothing 
 in malawi the secondary school you have to pay school fees  
 because of the hunger  i was forced to drop out of school  
 i looked at my father and looked at those dry fields  
 it was the future i couldn 't accept  
 i felt very happy to be
  i was determined to do anything possible to receive education  so i went to a library  
 i read books science books  especially physics 
 i couldn 't read english that well i used diagrams and pictures
 to learn the words around them  
  another book put that knowledge in my hands  it said a
 windmill
 could pump water
 and generate electricity 
 pump water meant irrigation a defense against hunger  which we were experiencing by that time  
 so i decided i would build one windmill for myself but i didn 't have materials to
  so i went to a scrap yard
 where i found my materials 
 many people  including my mother said i was crazy 
 i found a tractor fan  shock absorber  pvc pipes  
 using a bicycle frame
 and an old bicycle dynamo  i built my machine it was one light at first
  and then
 four lights 
 with switches and even a circuit breaker modeled after an electric bell  
 another machine
 pumps water for irrigation  queues of people start lining up at my house 
 to charge their mobile
 i could not get rid of them 
 and the reporters came too which lead to bloggers
 and which lead to a call from something called ted  i had never seen an airplane before i had never slept in a hotel
  on stage that day in arusha my english lost  
 i said something like i tried and i made it
