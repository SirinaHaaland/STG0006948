  ask the question you know why is a flying car or maybe more accurately a roadable aircraft possible at this time a number of years ago 
 mr ford
 predicted that flying cars of some form would be available now sixty years later
  to tell you why it 's possible when i was about five years old not very much about a year after mr ford made his predictions  i was living in a rural part of 
  canada on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area 
 scary thing for a young kid to be going through at the end of my first year in school in the summer of that year 
 i discovered a couple hummingbirds that were caught in a shed near my home they
 'd worn themselves out beating themselves against the window  and well they were easy to capture i took them outside and as i let them go that split second even though they
  very tired that second i let them go they hovered for a second then zipped off into the distance  i thought what a great way to get to school 
 for a kid at that age this was like infinite speed disappearing  and i was very inspired by that and so so
 the next over the next six decades believe it or not i 've built a number of aircraft  with the goal of creating something that could do
  for you or me what the hummingbird does and give you that flexibility 
 i 've called this vehicle generically a volantor after the latin word volant meaning to fly in a light  nimble manner
 pilot 's license a powerlift pilot 's license for this type of aircraft it
 's closer than you think it
 's kind of remarkable when you consider that there are no operational powered lift aircraft  so for once perhaps the government is ahead of itself
  the press calls my particular volantor a skycar 
 this is a a little bit earlier version of it that 's why it 's given the x designation
 but it 's a four passenger aircraft that could take off vertically like a helicopter therefore it doesn 't need an airfield on the ground it 's powered electrically  
 it 's actually classified as a motorcycle because of the three wheels which is a great asset because it allows you theoretically to use this on the highways in most states  and actually 
  in all cities so that 's an asset because if you 've got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile
  forget it you 're never going to fly it 
 one could say that a
 helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does  
 and gets around in much the same way and it 's true but a helicopter is a very complex device it 's
 expensive so expensive that very few people could own or use it
  it 's often been described
  because of its fragile fragile nature and its complexity as a series of parts a large number of parts flying in formation 
 laughter another difference and i have to describe this because it 's very personal  
 another great difference between the helicopter and
 the volantor in my case the skycar volantor
 is the experience that i 've had in flying
  both of those in a helicopter you feel and it 's still a remarkable sensation
 you feel like you 're being hauled up from above by a vibrating crane 
 when you get in the skycar and i can tell you there 's only one other person that 's flown it but he had the same sensation you really feel like you 're being lifted up by a magic carpet  
 without any vibration
  the sensation is unbelievable  
 and it 's been a great motivator i only get to fly this vehicle occasionally  and only when i can persuade my stockholders to let me do so  
 but it 's still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time  
 what we really need is something to replace the automobile for those 50 plus mile
  very few people realize that fifty mile plus trips make up eighty five percent of the miles traveled in america  if we can get rid of that then the highways will now be useful to you 
 as contrasted by what 's happening in many parts of
 the world today 
 on this next slide is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure because
  whether i give you a perfect skycar  the perfect vehicle for use it 's going to have very little value to you unless you 've got a system to use it in i 'm sure any of you have asked the question yeah are there great things up there what am i going to do get up there it 's bad enough on a highway what 's it going to be like to be in the air 
 this world that you 're going to be talking about tomorrow is going to be completely integrated you 're not going to be a pilot you 're going to be a passenger and it 's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes
  i can tell you technically we can build skycars my god we went to the moon the technology there was much more difficult than what i 'm dealing with here  
 but we have to have these priority changes we have to have infrastructure to go with this 
 historically you see that we got around two hundred years ago by canals and as that system disappeared were replaced by railroads as that disappeared we came in with highways but if you look at that top corner the highway system you see where we are today 
  are no longer being built 
 and that 's a fact you won 't see any additional highways in the next ten years  
 however the next ten years if like the last ten years we 're going to see thirty percent more traffic  
 and where is that going to lead you to so the issue then i 've often asked is when is it going to happen 
 when are we going to be able to have these vehicles  and of course if you ask me i 'm going to give you a really optimistic view after all i 've been spending sixty years here believing it 's going to happen tomorrow so i 'm not going to
  this i 'd prefer to quote someone else who testified with me before congress and in his position as head of nasa
 put forward this particular vision of the future of this type of aircraft
 now i would argue actually if you look at the fact that on the highways today  you 're only averaging about thirty miles per hour on average according to
  travels at over three hundred miles an hour up to to twenty five thousand feet  and so in effect you could see perhaps a tenfold increase in the in the
 ability to get around as far as speed is concerned  
 unbeknownst to many of you the highway in the sky
  i 'm talking about here has been under construction for ten years  it makes use of the gps you 're familiar with gps in your automobile but
 you may not be familiar with the fact that there 's a gps u s there 's a russian gps  and there 's a new
 gps system going to europe called galileo with those three systems you have what is always necessary a level of redundancy that says if one system fails you 'll still have a way to make sure that you
 being controlled because if you 're in this world where computers are controlling what you 're doing it 's going to be very critical that something can 't fail on you 
 how would a trip in a skycar work well  
 you can 't right now take off from your home because it 's too noisy i mean to be able to take off from your home you 'd have to be extremely quiet  but it 's still fairly quiet  
 you 'd motor electrically to a vertiport which may be a few blocks maybe even a few miles away this is clearly as i said earlier a roadable aircraft
 not going to spend that much time on the road after all  if you can fly like that why are you going to drive around on a highway 
 go to a local vertiport  plug in your destination 
 delivered
 almost like a passenger  you can play computer games  you can sleep you can read on the way this is the world there won 't be you as
  and i know the pilots in the audience aren 't going to like that and i 've had a lot of bad feedback
 from people who who want to be up there flying around and and experiencing that and of course i suppose like recreational parks you can still do that 
 but the vehicle itself is going to be a very very controlled environment  or it 's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system  
 we flew the first vehicle for the international press in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five when i really got it started i was a
 professor at the u c davis system and
 i got a lot of excitement around this and i was able to fund the initiation of the of the program back in that time  
 and then through the various years we invented various vehicles 
 actually the critical point was in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine when we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle how completely stable it was in all circumstances  
 which is of course very critical 
 still not a practical vehicle during all of this but moving in the right direction
  finally in the early part of or actually the middle of
 two thousand and two we flew the four hundred m400 which was the four passenger vehicle in this case here we 're flying it remotely as we always did at the beginning
  and we had very small power plants in it at this time  we are now installing larger powerplants  which will make it possible for me to get back on board
  safest vehicle during the test flight program there 's an old adage
 that applied for the years between 1950s and 1970s when every aeronautical company was working on vertical takeoff aircraft 
 a vertical takeoff aircraft needs an artificial stabilization system that 's essential 
  that brain that flies that aircraft fails  or if the engine fails that vehicle crashes  there is no option to that 
 and the adage that i 'm referring to that applied at that time was that nothing comes down faster than a vtol aircraft upside down 
 that 's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots in fact the aircraft companies gave up on
 vertical takeoff aircraft more or less for a number of years and there 's really only one operational aircraft in the world today that 's a vertical takeoff aircraft as distinct from a helicopter and that 's the hawker harrier jump jet 
 a vertical takeoff aircraft  like the hummingbird 
 has a very high metabolism  which means it requires a lot of energy
 getting that energy is very very difficult it all comes down to that power plant how to get a large amount of power in a small package  
 fortunately dr felix wankel invented the rotary engine a very unique engine it 's round  it 's small 
  it fits exactly where we need to fit it right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system
 very critical in fact that engine for those who are into the automobile know that it recently is applied to the rx8 the mazda  
 and that sportscar won sports car of the year 
 wonderful engine 
 in that application it generates one horsepower per pound which is twice as good as your car engine today  but only half of what we need 
 my company has spent thirty five years and many millions of dollars
 taking that rotary engine which was invented in the late ' 50s and getting it to the point that we get over two horsepower per pound reliably and critical we actually get one hundred and seventy five horsepower into one cubic foot  
 we have eight engines in this vehicle we have four computers we have two parachutes 
  is the critical issue here if you want to stay alive you 've got to have backups and we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine and continued to hover  
 the computers back up each other there 's a voting system if one computer is not agreeing with the other three it 's kicked out of the system  
 and then you have three you still have the triple redundancy if one of those fails you still have a second chance  if you stick around then
 good luck there won 't be a
 more for psychological than real reasons but they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that i 'd
 like to show you an animation in this next one which is one
 element of the skycar 's use but it 's one that demonstrates how it could be used you could think of it personally in your own terms of how you
  i believe that personal transportation in something like the skycar probably in another volantor form as well 
 will be a significant part of our lives as dr goldin says within the next ten years and it 's going to change the demographics in a very significant way  
  miles from san francisco and get there in fifteen minutes you 're going to sell your
  apartment buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain 
 buy a skycar which i think would be priced at that time perhaps in the area of one hundred thousand dollars put money in the bank 
 that 's a very significant incentive for getting out of san francisco  but you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell
  been a real challenge  obviously i 'm dependent on a lot of other people believing in what i 'm doing both financially and in technical help  
 and that has you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you 're doing and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing 
 i characterized
 this emerging technology in an aphorism as it 's described
 which really talks about what i 've experienced and i 'm sure what other people may have experienced in emerging technologies
