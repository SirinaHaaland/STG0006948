  raise your arms and wave back just the way i am kind of a royal wave 
 you can mimic what you can see you can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm soon you 'll be able to look inside your brain
 and program control the hundreds of brain areas that you
  see there i 'm going to tell you about that technology  people have wanted to look inside the human mind the human brain 
 for thousands of years well coming out of the research labs just now for our generation is the possibility to do that people envision this as being very difficult you had to take a spaceship shrink it down inject it into the bloodstream it was terribly dangerous 
 you could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries 
 but now we have a real
  technology to do this we 're going to fly into my colleague peter 's brain we 're going to do it 
  using mri  we don 't have to inject anything  we don 't need radiation 
 we will be able to fly into the anatomy of peter 's brain literally fly into his body but more importantly we can look into his mind when peter moves his arm that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of peter 's mind taking place
  seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms 
 that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains what 's new is that that process has typically taken
 days or months of analysis we 've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds and that allows us to let peter to look at his brain in real time as he 's inside the scanner he
  thousand points of activation per second if he can see this pattern in his own brain he can learn how to control it there
 have been three ways to try to impact the brain 
 the therapist 's couch  pills and the knife this is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have we all know
 that as we form thoughts they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains chronic pain
  is an example if you burn yourself you pull your hand away  but if you 're still in pain in six months ' or six years ' time it 's because these circuits are producing pain that 's no longer helping you 
 if we can look at the activation in the brain that 's producing the pain we can form 3d models and watch in real time the brain process information 
 and then we can select the areas that produce the pain  so put your arms back up and flex your bicep
  now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing what you 're seeing here is we 've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient 
 this may shock you but we 're literally reading this person 's brain in real time they 're watching their own brain activation and they 're controlling the pathway that produces their pain 
 they 're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates as they do it in the upper left is a display that 's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain
  being controlled 
 when they control their brain  they can control their pain this is an investigational technology but in clinical trials we 're seeing a forty four to sixty four percent decrease in chronic pain patients
