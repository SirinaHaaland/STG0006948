  's deceptively large there 's actually only about twenty people on each page
 because we have the name address and telephone number of every single person  
 and in fact everybody 's listed twice because it 's sorted once by name and once by email address
  obviously a very small community  
 there were only two other dannys on the internet then i knew them both we didn 't all know each other but we all kind of trusted each other
  and that that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network  and there was a real sense that
 we could depend on each other to do things so just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community let me tell you what it was like to
 register a domain name in the early days
  just so happened that i got to register the third domain name on the internet  so i could have anything i wanted other than bbn com and
 so i picked
 but then i thought you know there 's a lot of really interesting names out there  maybe i should register a few extras just just in case  
 and then i thought nah that wouldn 't
  attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days and in fact it wasn 't just the people on the network 
 but it was actually kind of built into the protocols
 of the internet itself so the basic idea of i p or internet protocol and the way that the the routing algorithm that used it
  were fundamentally from each according
 to their ability to each according to their need 
 and so if you had some extra bandwidth you 'd deliver a message for someone if they had some extra bandwidth they would deliver a message for you you 'd kind of depend on people to do that and that was
 that was the building block it was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the cold war by the defense department
 but
 it obviously worked really well  and
 we all saw what happened with the internet it was incredibly successful 
 in fact  it was so successful that there 's no way that these days you could make a book like this
  my rough calculation is it would be about
  miles thick 
 but of course you couldn 't do it because we don 't know the names of all the people with internet with internet or email addresses 
 and even if we did know their names i 'm pretty sure that they would not want their name  address and telephone number
 published to everyone so the fact is that there 's a lot of bad guys on the internet these days  and so we dealt with that by making
  little things that aren 't really the internet but are made out of the same building blocks  but we 're still basically building it out of those same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust  
 and that means that it 's vulnerable to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen or certain kinds of deliberate attacks but even the mistakes
  can be bad so for instance  in all of asia recently  it was
 impossible to get youtube for a little while because pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring youtube
 in its internal network they didn 't intend to screw up asia  but they did because of the way that the protocols work 
 another example that may have affected many of you in this audience
  you may remember a couple of years ago all the planes west of the mississippi were grounded because a single routing card in salt lake city
 had a bug in it now  you don 't really think that
 our airplane system depends on the internet and in some sense it doesn 't i 'll come back to that later  
 but the fact is that people couldn 't take off because something was going wrong on the internet and the router card was
 was down  and so there are many of those things that start to happen
  there was an interesting thing that happened last april all of a sudden a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole internet including
 a lot of the traffic between u s military installations started getting re routed through china  so for a few hours it all passed through china  
 now  china telecom says it was just an
  possible that it was the way things work  but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they if they wanted to and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes 
 imagine how vulnerable the system is to
 deliberate attacks  so if somebody really wanted to attack the united states or western civilization these days they 're not going to do it with tanks
  probably do is something very much like
 the attack that happened on the iranian nuclear facility  nobody has claimed credit for that there was basically a factory of industrial machines  
 it didn 't think of itself as being on the internet it thought of itself as being disconnected from the internet but it was possible for somebody to
  drive in there or something like that and software got in there that causes the centrifuges in that case to actually destroy themselves 
 now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant  
 and so there 's a lot of i 'm sure you 've read a lot in papers about worries about cyberattacks and
 defenses against those but the fact is
 people are mostly focused on defending the computers on the internet  and there 's been surprisingly little attention to defending the internet itself as a communications medium
 and i think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that because it 's actually kind of fragile  so actually  
 in the early days back when it was the arpanet there were actually times there was a particular time it failed completely
 because one single message processor actually got a bug in it and
  the way the internet works is the routers
 are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places  and this one processor because of
 a broken card decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time so in other words it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it 
  the fastest way to get a message anywhere was to send it to this guy who would
 send it back in time and get it there super early so every every message in the internet started
 getting switched through this one node and of course that clogged everything up everything started breaking 
 the interesting thing was  though  that the sysadmins were able to fix it but
 they they had to basically turn every single thing on the internet off now of course you couldn 't do that today i mean  everything off
  's like the service call you get from the cable company except for the whole world 
 now  in fact they couldn 't do it for a lot of reasons today one of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use ip protocol and use things like skype and so on that go through the the internet right now  
 and so in fact we 're becoming dependent on it
 for more and more different things like
 when you take off from
  really not thinking you 're using the internet  when you pump gas you really don 't think you 're using the internet
 what 's happening increasingly though is these systems are beginning to use the internet  most of them aren 't based
 on the internet yet but they 're starting to use the internet for service functions for administrative functions  and so if you take something like the cell phone system
  still relatively independent of the internet
 for the most part internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it
 in terms of some of the control
 and administrative functions and it 's so tempting to use these same building blocks because they work so well they 're cheap they 're repeated and so on so all of our systems more and more 
 are starting to use the same technology and starting to depend on this technology 
 and so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship
  to the other that 's crazy it was never designed to do things like that so we 've built this system where
 we understand all the parts of it but we 're using it in a very very different way than we expected to use it and it 's gotten a very very different scale than it was designed for and
 in fact nobody really
  exactly understands all the things it 's being used for right now it 's turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system where we 've designed all the parts
 but nobody really exactly understands
 how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have  
 and so if you hear an expert talking about the internet and saying it can do this or it does do this or it will do that you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might
 treat the comments of an economist about the
  economy or a weatherman about the weather or something like that  they have an informed opinion  but it 's changing so quickly that even the experts don 't know exactly what 's going on  
 so if you see one of these maps of the internet  
 it 's just somebody 's guess  nobody really knows what the internet is right now because it 's different than it was an hour ago  it 's constantly changing
  it 's constantly reconfiguring  
 and the problem with it is i think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system 
 where we take a system that 's basically
 built on trust 
 was basically built for a smaller scale system and we 've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate  
 and so right now i think it 's literally
  that we don 't know what the consequences of an effective 
  attack
 on the internet would be and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year and worse next year and so on but so what we need is a plan b there is no plan b right now there 's no
  clear backup system that we 've very carefully kept to be independent of the internet  made out of completely different sets of
 but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the internet or the hospitals have to order fuel fuel oil this doesn 't need to be a 
 government project it 's actually relatively simple to do technically because it can use
 existing fibers that are in the ground existing wireless infrastructure it 's basically a matter of deciding to do it but people won 't decide to do it
 until they recognize the need for it and that 's the problem that we have right now  so there 's
 been plenty of people 
 plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years but it 's very hard to get people focused on plan b when plan a seems to be working
 so well  
  starting to depend on the internet and how vulnerable it is we could get focused on
 just wanting this other system to exist  
 and i think if enough people say yeah i would like to use it i 'd like to have such a system then it will get built it 's not that hard a problem it could definitely be done by people in this room  
 and so
  i think that this is actually of all the problems you 're going to hear about at the conference this is probably one of the very easiest to fix 
 so i 'm happy to get a chance to tell you about it  thank you very much
