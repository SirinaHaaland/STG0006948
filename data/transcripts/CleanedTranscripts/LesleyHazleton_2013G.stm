  writing biography
 is a strange thing to do 
 it 's a journey into the foreign territory of somebody else 's life 
 a journey an exploration that can take you places you never dreamed of going
 and still can 't quite
  believe you 've been especially if like me you 're an agnostic jew
 and the life you 've been exploring is that of muhammad 
 five years ago for instance  i found myself waking each morning in misty seattle to what i knew was an impossible
  actually happened
 one desert night half the world and almost half of history away what happened that is on the night in the year six hundred and ten
 when muhammad received the first revelation of the koran on a mountain just outside mecca 
 this is the core mystical moment of islam and as such
 yet the question wouldn 't let go of me  
 i was fully aware that for someone as secular as i am just asking it could be seen as pure
 chutzpah 
 and i plead guilty as charged  because all exploration
  physical or intellectual is inevitably in some sense an act of transgression of crossing boundaries 
 still some boundaries are larger than others 
 so a human encountering the divine as muslims believe muhammad did 
 to the rationalist this is a matter not of fact but of wishful
  and like all of us i like to think of myself as rational which might be why when i looked at the earliest accounts we have of that night 
 what struck me even more than what happened
 was what did not happen 
 muhammad did not come floating off the mountain as though walking on air  he did not run down
  he did not radiate light and joy  there were no choirs of angels no music of the spheres  no elation no ecstasy no
 golden aura surrounding him  no sense of an absolute  fore ordained role as the messenger of god 
 that is  he did none of the things that might make it easy to cry foul to put down
  the whole story as a pious fable quite the contrary  
 in his own reported words  he was convinced at first
 that what had happened couldn 't have been real 
 at best he thought it had to have been a hallucination a trick of the eye or the ear perhaps or his own mind working against him
  at worst  possession
 that he 'd been seized by an evil jinn a spirit out to deceive him even to crush the life out of him 
 in fact he was so sure that he could only be majnun  possessed by a jinn 
 that when he found himself still alive his first impulse was to finish the job himself 
 to leap off the highest cliff
 and escape the terror
 of what he 'd experienced by putting an end to all experience 
 so the man who fled down the mountain that night
 trembled not with joy
 but with a stark  primordial fear  he was overwhelmed not with conviction but by doubt
  and that panicked disorientation that sundering of everything familiar that daunting
 awareness of something beyond human comprehension can only be called a terrible
 awe  
 this might be somewhat difficult to grasp now that we use the word
  to describe a new app or a viral video 
 with the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake we 're protected from real awe  
 we close the doors and hunker down convinced that we 're in control  or at least  hoping for control  
 we do our best to ignore the fact that we don 't always
  and that not everything can be explained 
 yet whether you 're a rationalist or a mystic 
 whether you think the words muhammad heard that night came from inside himself or from outside 
 what 's clear is that he did experience them  and that he did so with a force that would shatter his sense of himself and his world
 and transform this otherwise modest man into a radical advocate
  for social and economic justice  
 fear
 was the only sane response the only human response 
 too human for some 
 like conservative muslim theologians who maintain that the account of his wanting to kill himself shouldn 't even be mentioned despite the fact that it
  in the earliest islamic biographies  
 they insist that he never doubted for even a single moment let alone despaired  
 demanding perfection they refuse to tolerate human imperfection
  as i read those early accounts  i realized it was precisely muhammad 's doubt that brought him alive for me 
 that allowed me to begin to see him in full to accord him the integrity of reality 
 and the more i thought about it the more it made sense that he doubted 
 because doubt is essential to faith
  faith  
 if this seems a startling idea at first consider that doubt  as graham greene once put it 
 is the heart of the matter  
 abolish all doubt  and what 's left is not faith  but absolute  
  you 're certain that you possess the truth inevitably offered with an implied uppercase t
 and this certainty quickly devolves into dogmatism and righteousness 
 by which i mean a demonstrative overweening pride in being so very right
  it has to be one of the multiple ironies of history
 that a favorite expletive of muslim fundamentalists is the same one once used by the christian fundamentalists known as crusaders
  because their absolutism is in fact the opposite of faith 
 in effect  they are the infidels 
 like fundamentalists of all religious stripes they have no questions only answers  
 they found the perfect antidote to thought and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith
  they don 't have to struggle for it like jacob wrestling through the night with the angel 
 or like jesus in his forty days and nights in the wilderness or like muhammad not only that night on the mountain but throughout his years as a prophet 
 with the koran constantly urging him not to despair  
 and condemning those who most loudly proclaim
 that they know everything there is to know
  that they and they alone are right and
 yet we 
 the vast and still far too silent majority have ceded the public arena
 to this extremist minority we 've allowed judaism to be claimed by violently messianic west bank settlers
 christianity by homophobic hypocrites and misogynistic bigots  islam by
 suicide bombers  
 and we 've allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that no matter whether they claim to be christians jews or muslims militant extremists are none
  they 're a cult all their own blood brothers steeped in other people 's blood 
 this isn 't faith  
 it 's fanaticism and we have to stop confusing the two  we have to recognize that real faith
 has no easy answers it 's difficult and stubborn
 it involves an ongoing struggle a continual questioning of what we think we know a wrestling with issues and ideas 
 it goes hand in hand with doubt  in a never ending conversation with it 
 and sometimes in conscious defiance of it 
 and this conscious defiance is why i
  i as an agnostic can still have faith  
 i have faith for instance that peace in the middle east is possible despite the
  mass of evidence to the contrary  
 i 'm not convinced of this i can hardly say i
  i can only have faith in it commit myself that is to the idea of it  
 and i do this precisely because of the temptation to throw up my hands in resignation and retreat into silence 
 because
 despair is 
 if we call something impossible we act in such a way that we make it so
  for one refuse to live that way 
 in fact most of us do 
 whether we 're atheist or theist or anywhere in between or beyond for that matter 
 what drives us is that despite our doubts
 and even because of our doubts we reject the
  we insist on faith in the future and in each other 
 call this naive if you like 
 call it impossibly idealistic if you must but one thing is sure 
 call it human 
 could muhammad have so
  radically changed his world without such faith  without the refusal to cede to the arrogance of closed minded certainty  
 i think not 
 after keeping company with him as a writer for the past five years  i can 't see
 that he 'd be anything
 but utterly outraged
 at the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak and act in his name in the middle east and elsewhere today
 he 'd be appalled at the repression of half the population because of their gender 
 he 'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism  
 he 'd call out terrorism for what it is not only criminal but an obscene travesty of everything he
  believed in and struggled for 
 he 'd say what the koran says  
 anyone who takes a life takes the life of all humanity  
 anyone who saves a life saves the life of all humanity  
  he 'd commit himself fully to the hard and thorny process
 of making peace  thank you
