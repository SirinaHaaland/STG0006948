  talk to you today about a whole new way to think about sexual activity and sexuality education by comparison
 if you talk to someone today in
  about sexual activity
 you 'll find pretty soon you 're not just talking about sexual activity you 're also talking about baseball
 because baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor that americans use to think about and talk about sexual activity
 and we know that because there 's all this language in english that seems to be talking about baseball but that 's really talking about
  sexual activity so for example
 you can be a pitcher or a catcher and that corresponds to whether you perform a sexual act or receive a sexual act of
 course there are the bases which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order
 ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of
  orgasm at least for the guy laughter
 you can strike out which means you don 't get to have any sexual activity
 and if you 're a benchwarmer you might be a virgin or somebody who for whatever reason isn 't in the game maybe because of your age or because of your ability or because of your skillset
 a bat 's a penis and a nappy dugout is a vulva or a
  vagina
 a glove or a catcher 's mitt is a condom
 a switch hitter is a bisexual person and we gay and lesbian folks play for the other team
 and then there 's this one if there 's grass on the field play ball
 and that usually refers to if a young person specifically often a young woman is old enough to have
  pubic hair she 's old enough to have sex with
 this baseball model is incredibly problematic it 's sexist it 's heterosexist it 's competitive it 's goal directed and it can 't result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults
 so we need a new model
 i 'm here today to offer you that new model
 and it 's based on
 pizza
  pizza is something that is universally understood and that most people associate with a positive experience so let 's do this let 's take baseball and pizza and compare it when talking about three aspects of sexual activity
 the trigger for sexual activity what happens during sexual activity and the expected outcome of sexual activity
 so when do you play baseball you play baseball when it 's
  season and when there 's a game on the schedule it 's not exactly your choice
 so if it 's prom night or a wedding night or at a party or if our parents aren 't home hey it 's just batter up
 can you imagine saying to your coach uh i 'm
 not really feeling it today i think i 'll sit this game out that 's just not the way it happens and when you get together to play baseball immediately you
  with two opposing teams one playing offense one playing defense somebody 's trying to move deeper into the field that 's usually a sign to the boy somebody 's trying to defend people moving into the field that 's often given to the girl
 it 's competitive we 're not playing with each other we 're playing against each other and when you show up to play baseball nobody needs to talk about what we 're going to do or how this baseball game might be good
  for us everybody knows the rules you just take your position and play the game
 but when do you have pizza
 well you have pizza
 when you 're hungry for pizza it starts with an internal sense an internal desire or a need huh
 i could go for some pizza
  and because it 's an internal desire we actually have some sense of control over that i could decide that i 'm hungry but know that it 's not a great time to eat
 and then when we get together with someone for pizza we 're not competing with them
 we 're looking for an experience that both of us will share that that 's satisfying for both of us and when you get together for pizza with somebody what 's the first thing you do you talk about it
 you talk about what you want you talk about what you like you may even negotiate it how do you feel about pepperoni laughter
 not so much i 'm kind of a mushroom guy myself well maybe we can go half and half
 and even if you 've had pizza with somebody for a very long time
 don 't you still say things like should we get the usual laughter or maybe something a little more adventurous
 okay so when you 're playing baseball so if we talk about during sexual activity when you 're playing baseball you 're just supposed to round the bases in the proper order one at a time you can 't hit the ball and run to right field
 that doesn 't work and you also can 't get to second base and say i like it here i 'm going to stay here
 no and also of course with baseball there
  's like the specific equipment and a specific skill set not everybody can play baseball it 's pretty exclusive
 okay but what about pizza when we 're trying to figure out what 's good for pizza isn 't it all about
 what 's our pleasure there are a million different kinds of pizza there 's a million different toppings there 's a million different ways to eat pizza and none of them are wrong they 're different
 and in this case difference is good
  because that 's going to increase the chance that we 're having a satisfying experience
 and lastly what 's the expected outcome of baseball well in baseball you play to win
 you score as many runs as you can there 's always a winner in baseball and that means there 's always a loser in baseball
 but what about pizza well in pizza we 're not really there 's no winning how do you
  win pizza
 you don 't
 but you do look for are we satisfied
 and sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or on different days
 and we get to decide when we feel satisfied if we 're still hungry we might have some more if you eat too much though you just feel gross
  what if we could take this pizza model and overlay it on top of sexuality education
 a lot of sexuality education that happens today is so influenced by the baseball model and it sets up education that can 't help
 but produce unhealthy sexuality in young people
 and those young people become older people but if we could create sexuality education
  that was more like pizza
 we could create education that invites people to think about their own desires to make deliberate decisions about what they want
 to talk about it with their partners and to ultimately look for not some external outcome
 but for what feels satisfying and we get to decide that you may have
  in the baseball and pizza comparison under the baseball it 's all commands they 're all exclamation points
 but under the pizza model they 're questions and who gets to answer those questions you do
 i do
 so remember when we 're thinking about sexuality education and sexual activity baseball you 're out pizza is the way to think
  about healthy satisfying sexual activity and good comprehensive sexuality education thank you very much for your
