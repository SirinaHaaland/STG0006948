  organic chemists make molecules  very complicated molecules  by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules and reverse engineering  
 and as a chemist one of the things i wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is could we make a really cool universal
 chemistry set in essence could we app chemistry  
 now what would this mean and how would we do it  
 well to start to do this we took a 3d printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side
 and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware
  and so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time  we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry  
 now what could this mean  well if we can embed
 biological and chemical networks like a search engine so if you have a a cell that 's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill if you have this embedded in your device at the same time
  do the chemistry you may be able to make drugs in a new way  
 so how are we doing this in the lab  well it requires software it requires hardware and it requires chemical inks  and so the really cool bit is the idea is 
  that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer and you download the blueprint the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it
  in the device  and so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software  
 so what could this mean  well  ultimately it could mean that you could print your own medicine  
 and this is what we 're doing in the lab at the moment but to take baby steps to get there  first of all we want to look at drug design and production or drug discovery and manufacturing  because if we can manufacture
  it after we 've discovered it we could deploy it anywhere you don 't need to go to the chemist anymore 
 we can print drugs at point of need 
 we can download new diagnostics say a new super bug has emerged you put it in your search engine  and you create the drug to treat the threat  
 so this allows you on the fly
  but perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells with your genes and your environment and you print your own personal medicine  
 and if that doesn 't seem fanciful enough  where do you think we 're going to go  well 
 you 're going to have your own personal matter fabricator  beam me up scotty
