  thank you very much that was whistling  i 'm trying to do this in english
  the age of four  about four my dad was always whistling around the house and i just thought that 's part of communication in my
 family so i whistled along with him  and actually until i 
 i always annoyed and irritated people with whistling
  to be honest my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior 
 i whistled alone i whistled in the classroom i whistled on bike  i whistled everywhere
  and i also whistled at a christmas eve party with my family in law and
 they had some in my opinion  terrible christmas music  and when i hear music that i don 't like i try
  but it can also sound like this 
 but
 during a christmas party at dinner actually it 's very annoying so my sister in law asked me a few times please stop whistling and i just couldn
  at one point and i had some wine i have to admit that at one point i said if there was a contest i would join and two weeks later i
 received a text message you 're going to america 
 so ok i 'm going to america  i would love to but why  so i immediately called her up of course she googled and
 she found this world whistling
  she didn 't expect me to go there and
 i would have lost my face i don 't know if that 's correct english but the dutch people here will understand what i mean 
 laughter i lost my face and
 she thought he will never go there but actually i did  so i went to louisburg north carolina southeast of
 the united states  and
 i entered the world of whistling  
 and i also entered the world championship  and i won there in two thousand and four 
 that was great fun of course  and to defend my title
  well let 's go back in two thousand and five and i won again 
 then i couldn 't participate for a few years and in two thousand and eight i entered again in japan tokyo  and i won again  so
 what what happened now is i 'm standing here in rotterdam in the beautiful city on a big stage  and i 'm talking about whistling  and actually i earn my money whistling  at the moment  
 so i quit my day job as a nurse
 and
 i try to live my dream well actually it was never my dream but it sounds so good 
 ok  i 'm not the only one whistling here you say huh what do you mean well actually  you are going to whistle along
  and then always the same thing happens people are watching each other and think oh my god why can i go away no you can 't 
 actually it 's very simple the track that i will whistle is called fte de la belle 
 it 's about eighty minutes long 
 no no no it 's four minutes long  and i want to first rehearse with you your whistling
  whistle the tone 
 sorry i forgot one thing you whistle the same tone as me
  technicians to start the music and if it 's started i just point where you whistle along  and we will see what happens
  i 'm so used to that i start it myself
  propose i do that myself
