  usually remember the names of our doctors  but often we forget the names of our nurses 
 i remember one i had breast cancer a few
  and somehow i managed to get through the surgeries and the beginning of the treatment just fine  
 i could hide what was going on everybody didn 't really have to know  
 i could walk my daughter to school  i could go out to dinner with my husband  i could fool people  
 but then my chemo was scheduled to begin and that terrified me because i knew that i was going to lose every
 single hair on my body because of the kind of chemo that i was going to have 
 i wasn 't going to be able to pretend anymore as though everything was normal
  i was scared i knew what it felt like to have everybody treating me with kid gloves and i just wanted to feel normal  
 i had a port installed in my chest  i went to my first day of chemotherapy  and i was an emotional wreck 
 my nurse
  walked in the door  
 and every bone in my body was telling me to get up out of that chair and take for the hills  but joanne looked at me and talked to me like we were old friends  
 and then she asked me where 'd you get your highlights done 
 and i was like are you kidding me you 're going to talk to me about my hair when i 'm on the verge of losing it i was kind of
  and with a shrug of her shoulders she said it 's gonna grow back 
 and in that moment she said the one thing i had overlooked and that was that at some point my life would get back to normal she really believed that 
 and so i believed it too 
 now  worrying about losing your hair when you 're fighting cancer may seem silly at first but
 it 's not just that you 're worried about how you 're going to look
  it 's that you 're worried that everybody 's going to treat you so carefully  
 joanne made me feel normal for the first time in six months 
 we talked about her boyfriends we talked about looking for apartments in new york city  and we talked about my reaction to the chemotherapy all kind of mixed in together  
 and i always wondered how did she so instinctively
 know just how to talk to me
 joanne staha and my admiration for her marked the beginning of my journey into the world of nurses 
 a few years later i was asked to do a project that would celebrate the work that nurses do 
 i started with joanne  and i met over one hundred nurses across the country  
 i spent
  and filming nurses for a book and a documentary film 
 with my team we mapped a trip across america that would take us to places dealing with some of the biggest public health issues facing our nation
 aging  war  poverty  prisons  
 and then we went places where we would find the largest concentration of patients dealing with those issues 
 then we asked
  hospitals and facilities to nominate nurses who would best represent them 
 one of the first nurses i met was bridget kumbella bridget was born in cameroon the oldest of four children 
 her father was at work when he had fallen from the fourth floor and really hurt his back 
 and he talked a lot about what it was like to be flat on your back and not get the kind of care
  that you need and that propelled bridget to go into the profession of nursing 
 now as a nurse in the bronx she has a really diverse group of patients that she cares for from all walks of life  and from all different religions 
 and she 's devoted her career to understanding the impact of our cultural differences when it comes to our health 
 she spoke
  of a patient a native american patient that she had
 that wanted to bring a bunch of feathers into the icu 
 that 's how he found spiritual comfort 
 and she spoke of advocating for him and said that patients come from all different religions and use all different kinds of objects for comfort  
 whether it 's a holy rosary or a symbolic feather it all needs to be supported
 this is jason short  
 jason is a home health nurse in the appalachian mountains and his dad had a gas station and a repair shop when he was growing up 
 so he worked on cars in the community that he now serves as a nurse 
 when he was in college it was
 just not macho at all to become a nurse so he avoided it for years he drove trucks for a little while  but his
  life path was always pulling him back to nursing 
 as a nurse in the appalachian mountains jason goes places that an ambulance can 't even get to in this photograph he 's standing in what used to be a road  
 top of the mountain mining flooded that road  and now the only way for jason to get to the patient living in that house with black lung disease
 is to drive
 against the current up that creek 
 the day i was with him we ripped the front fender off the car 
 the next morning he got up put the car on the lift fixed the fender and then headed out to meet his next patient 
 i witnessed jason caring for this gentleman with such enormous
  and i was struck again by how intimate the work of nursing really is 
 when i met brian mcmillion he was raw he had just come back from a deployment
 and he hadn 't really settled back in to life in san diego yet
 he talked about his experience of being a nurse in germany and taking care of the soldiers coming right off the battlefield
  very often he would be the first person they would see when they opened their eyes in the hospital  
 and they would look at him as they were lying there missing limbs  and the first thing they would say
 is when can i go back i left my brothers out there 
 and brian would have to say you 're not going anywhere you 've already given enough brother 
 brian is both a nurse and a soldier who 's seen combat
  so that puts him in a unique position to be able to relate to and help heal the veterans in his care 
 this is sister stephen  and she runs a nursing home in wisconsin called villa loretto and the entire circle of life can be found under her roof 
 she grew up wishing they lived on a farm so
 given the opportunity to adopt local
  farm animals she enthusiastically brings them in 
 and in the springtime those animals have babies  
 and sister stephen uses those baby ducks  goats and lambs as animal therapy for the residents at villa loretto who sometimes can 't remember their own name  
 but they do rejoice in the holding of a baby lamb
  the day i was with sister stephen  i needed to take her away from villa loretto to film part of her story  
 and before we left she went into the room of a dying patient 
 and she leaned over and she said i have to go away for the day  but if jesus calls you you go you go straight
  i was standing there and thinking
 it was the first time in my life i witnessed that you could show someone you love them completely
 by letting go we don 't have to hold on so tightly  
 i saw more life rolled up at villa loretto than i have ever seen at any other time at any other place in my life  
 we live in a complicated time when it comes to our health care
 it 's easy to lose sight of the need for quality of life not just quantity of life 
 as new life saving technologies are created we 're going to have really complicated decisions to make 
 these technologies often save lives  but they can also prolong pain and the dying process 
 how in the world are we supposed to navigate
  these waters  we 're going to need all the help we can get 
 nurses have a really unique relationship with us because of the time spent at bedside  
 during that time a kind of emotional intimacy develops 
 this past summer on august nine  my father died of a heart attack my mother was devastated  and she
  couldn 't imagine her world without him in it 
 four days later she fell she broke her hip 
 she needed surgery and she found herself fighting for her own life 
 once again i found myself on the receiving end of the care of nurses
 this time for my mom my brother and my sister and i stayed by her side for the next three days in
  the icu 
 and as we tried to make the right decisions and follow my mother 's wishes  
 we found that we were depending upon the guidance of nurses  
 and once again they didn 't let us down 
 they had
 amazing insight in terms of how to care for my mom in the last four days of her life they brought her comfort
 and relief from pain 
 they knew to encourage my sister and i to put a pretty nightgown on my mom 
 long after it mattered to her but it sure meant a lot to us 
 and they knew to come and wake me up just in time
 for my mom 's last breath  and then they knew how long to leave me in the room with my mother after she died
 i have no idea how they know these things  but i do know that i am eternally grateful
 that they 've guided me once again thank you so very much
