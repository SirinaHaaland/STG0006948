  all humans will be intimate with death at least once in their lives  but what if that intimacy began long before you faced your own
  what would life be like if the dead literally lived alongside you 
 in my husband 's homeland in the highlands of sulawesi island in eastern indonesia  
 there is a community of people that experience death not as a singular event
 but as a gradual social process in tana
  the most important social moments in people 's lives  the focal points of social and cultural interaction
 are not weddings or births or even family dinners  but funerals  
 so these funerals are characterized by elaborate rituals that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt based on the amount of animals
  water buffalo
 that are sacrificed and distributed in the name of the deceased  
 so this cultural complex surrounding death  the ritual enactment of the end of life has made death  the most visible 
 and remarkable aspect of toraja 's landscape  
  lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks 
 funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair  where commemorating someone who 's died
 is not so much a private sadness but more of a publicly shared transition  
 and it 's a transition that 's just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remembrance of the dead
  so every year thousands of visitors come to tana toraja to see as it were this culture of death
  and for many people these grandiose ceremonies and the length of the ceremonies
 are somehow incommensurable with the way that we face our own mortality in the west  
 so even as we share death as a universal experience
  same way the world over
  and as an anthropologist i see these differences in experience being rooted in the cultural and social world through which we define the phenomena around us
 so where we see an
  death as an irrefutable biological condition 
 torajans see the expired corporeal form as part of a larger social genesis  
 so again the physical cessation of life
 is not the same as death in fact a member of society is only truly dead
 when the extended family can agree upon and marshal the
  resources necessary to hold a funeral ceremony that is considered appropriate in terms of resources for the status of the deceased  
 and this ceremony has to take place in front of the eyes of the whole community with everyone 's participation  
 so after a person 's physical death  their body is placed in a special room in the traditional residence which is called the tongkonan
  and the tongkonan is symbolic not only of the family 's identity
 but also of the human life cycle from birth to death  so essentially the shape of the building that you 're born into is the shape of the structure which carries you to your ancestral resting place  
  until the funeral ceremony which can be held years after a person 's physical death
  the deceased is referred to as to makala a sick person 
 or to mama a person who is asleep  
 and they continue to be a member of the household 
 they are symbolically fed and cared for and the family at this time will begin a number of ritual injunctions which communicates to
  the wider community around them that one of their members is undergoing the transition from this life
 into the afterlife known as puya  
 so i know what some of you must be thinking right now 
 is she really saying that these people live with the bodies of their dead relatives  and that 's exactly what i 'm saying
  instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction we have to this idea of proximity to bodies proximity to death  
 or how this notion just does not fit into our very biological or medical sort of definition of death  
 i like to think about what the torajan way of viewing death encompasses of the human experience that the medical definition leaves out
 i think that torajans socially recognize and culturally express
 what many of us feel to be true
 despite the widespread acceptance of the biomedical definition of death  
 and that is that our relationships with other humans their impact on our social reality
  doesn 't cease with the termination of the physical processes of the body 
 that there 's a period of transition as the relationship between the living and the dead is transformed
 but not ended  so torajans express this idea of this enduring relationship by lavishing love
  and attention on the most visible symbol of that relationship the human body  
 so my husband has fond memories of talking to and playing with and generally being around his deceased grandfather  
 and for him there is nothing unnatural about this 
 this is a natural part of the process as the family comes to terms with the transition
 in their
  relationship to the deceased  and this is the transition from relating to the deceased as a person who 's living
 to relating to the deceased as a person who 's an ancestor  and here you can see these wooden effigies of the ancestors  so these are people who have already been buried already had a funeral ceremony 
 these are called tau tau  
 so the funeral ceremony itself embodies this relational
  perspective on death  it ritualizes the impact of death on families and communities  and it 's also a moment of 
 it 's a moment when people think about who they are their place in society and their role in the life cycle
  in accordance with torajan cosmology 
 there 's a saying in toraja that all people will become grandparents  
 and what this means is that after death  we all become part of the ancestral line that anchors us between the past and the present
 and will define who our loved ones are into the future
  so essentially we all become grandparents to the generations of human children that come after us
 and this metaphor of membership in the greater human family is the way that children also describe the money that they invest in these sacrificial 
  buffaloes that are thought to carry people 's soul from here to the afterlife and children will explain that they will invest the money in this because they want to repay their parents the debt for all of the years their parents spent
 investing and caring for them but the sacrifice of buffalo
 and the ritual display of wealth also exhibits the status of the deceased and by extension  the deceased 's family 
 so at funerals  relationships are reconfirmed but also transformed
 in a ritual drama that highlights the most salient feature about
  death in this place  its impact on life
 and the relationships of the living 
 so all of this focus on death doesn 't mean that torajans don 't aspire to the ideal of a long life 
 they engage in many practices thought to confer good health and survival to an advanced age  
 but they don 't put much stock in
  in efforts to prolong life in the face of debilitating illness
 or in old age  it 's said in toraja that everybody has sort of a predetermined amount of life it 's called the sunga ' 
 and like a thread it should be allowed to unspool to its natural end  
 so by having death as a part of the cultural and social fabric
 of life people 's everyday decisions about their health and healthcare are affected  
 the patriarch of my husband 's maternal clan  nenet katcha 
 is now approaching the age of one hundred as far as we can tell  
 and there are increasing signs that he is about to depart on his own journey for puya
 and his death will be greatly mourned 
 but i know that my husband 's family looks forward to the moment when they can
 ritually display
 what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives  
 when they can ritually recount his life 's narrative  weaving his story into the history
  of their community his story
 is their story 
 his funeral songs will sing them a song about themselves  
 and it 's a story that has no discernible beginning no foreseeable end  it 's a story that goes on
 long after his body no longer does
  people ask me if i 'm frightened or repulsed by
 participating in a culture where the physical manifestations of death greet us at every turn  
 but i see something profoundly transformative in experiencing death as a social process and not just a
  the relationship between the living and the dead has its own drama in the u s healthcare system  
 where decisions about how long to stretch the thread of life are made based on our emotional and social ties with the people around us 
 not just on medicine 's ability to prolong life 
 we like the torajans
  base our decisions about life on the meanings
 and the definitions that we ascribe to death  
 so i 'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience should run out and adopt the traditions of the torajans it might be a little bit difficult to put into play in the united states
  but i want to ask what we can gain from seeing physical death not only as a biological process
 but as part of the greater
 human story what would it be like to look on the expired human form with love
 because it 's so intimately a part of who we all are if we could expand our definition of death to encompass life  
 we could experience death
 as part of life
 and perhaps face death with something other than
  fear
 perhaps one of the answers to the challenges that are facing the u s healthcare system particularly in the end of life care 
 is as simple as a shift in perspective and the shift in perspective in this case would be to look at the social life of every
  it might help us recognize that the way we limit our conversation about death to something that 's medical or biological is reflective of a larger culture that we all share
 of avoiding death being afraid of talking about it 
 if we could entertain and value
 other kinds of knowledge about life  including other definitions of death
 has the potential to change the discussions that we have about the end of life  
 it could change the way that we die  but more importantly  it could transform
 the way that we live
