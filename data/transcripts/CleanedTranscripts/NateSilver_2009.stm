  for the first time in the united states a predominantly white group of voters voted for an
  american candidate for president and in fact barack obama did quite well he won three hundred and seventy five electoral votes and he won about seventy million
 popular votes more than any other presidential candidate of any race of any party in history if you compare how obama did against how john kerry had done four years earlier
 democrats really like seeing this transition here where almost every state becomes bluer becomes more democratic even states obama lost like out west those states became more blue in the south
 in the northeast almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there
 one exception is in massachusetts that was john kerry 's home state no big surprise obama couldn 't do better than kerry there or in arizona which is john mccain 's home
 obama didn 't have much improvement but there is also this part of the country kind of in the middle region here this kind of
 arkansans tennessee oklahoma west virginia region now if you look at ninety six bill clinton the last democrat to actually win
 how he did in ninety six you see real big differences in this part of the country right here the kind of appalachians ozarks highlands region as i call it twenty or thirty point swings from how 
  bill clinton did in ninety six to how obama did in two thousand and eight yes bill clinton was from arkansas but these are very very profound differences
  like arkansas you know there is a book written called what 's the matter with kansas but really the question here obama did
 relatively well in kansas he lost badly but every democrat does he lost no worse than most people do
 but yeah what 's the matter with arkansas
 and when we think of arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations we think of a bunch of
 rednecks quote unquote with guns and we think people like this probably don 't want to vote for people who look like this and are named barack obama we think it 's a matter of race and is
  this fair are we kind of stigmatizing people from arkansas and this part of the country and the answer is it is at least partially fair we know that race was a factor and the reason why we know that is because
 we asked those people
 actually we didn 't ask them but when they conducted exit polls in every state in thirty seven states out of the fifty they asked a question that was pretty direct about race they asked this question
 in deciding your vote for president today was the race of the candidate a
  factor
 we 're looking for people who said yes race was a factor moreover it was an important factor in my decision and people who voted for john mccain as a result of that factor maybe 
  in combination with other factors and maybe alone we 're looking for this behavior among white voters or really
 white voters said yes one of the big reasons why i voted against barack obama is because he was an african american if those people had voted for obama even half of them obama would have won louisiana 
 safely same is true with i think all of these states you see at the top of the list meanwhile california new york we can say oh we 're enlightened but you know certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted i suppose manifestation of racially based voting
  here is the same data on a map you kind of see the relationship between the redder states of where more people responded and said yes barack obama 's race was a problem for me you see
 comparing the map to ninety six you see an overlap here this really seems to explain why barack obama did worse in this one part of the country so we have to ask why is racism 
  predictable in some way is there something driving this is it just about some weird stuff that
  on in arkansas that we don 't understand and kentucky or are there more systematic factors at work and so we can look at a bunch of different variables
 these are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time things like income and religion education which of these seem to drive
 this manifestation of racism in this big national experiment we had on november fourth
  and there are a couple of these that that have strong predictive relationships one of which is
 education where you see the states
 with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red and you see this part of the country the appalachians region is less educated it 's just a fact and you see the relationship there with the racially based voting patterns
 the other variable that 's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in
 states that are more rural even some of the states like new hampshire and
  maine they exhibit a little bit of this racially based voting against barack obama so it 's the combination of these two things it 's education and the type of neighbors that you have which we 'll talk about more 
  in a moment the thing about states like arkansas and tennessee is that they 're both very rural and they are educationally impoverished
  to drill down a little bit more now into something called the general social survey this is conducted by the university of chicago every other year and they ask a series of really interesting questions in two thousand they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes
 one simple question they asked is does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood we can see different types of communities that the results are quite different in
  percent of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race but in rural communities only about thirty percent probably because if you live on a farm you might not have a lot of neighbors period 
  but nevertheless you 're not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you so what we 're going to do now
 and we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes not a lot of difference this was
 eight years ago some people were more republican back then but you see democrats versus republican not a big difference based on who your neighbors are and even some questions about race for example affirmative action which is kind of a political question a policy question about race if you will
 not much difference here affirmative action is not very popular frankly with white voters period but people with black
  neighbors and people with mono racial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really
 but if you probe a bit deeper get a bit more personal if you will
 do you favor a law banning interracial marriage there is a big difference people who don 't have neighbors of a different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do just based
  on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you and likewise they asked not in two thousand but in the same survey in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six would you not vote for a qualified black president
 you see people without neighbors who are african american were much more likely to say that would give me a problem so it 's really not even about urban versus rural it 's about who you live with racism is predictable and it 's predicted by
 interaction or lack thereof with people unlike
  you people of other races so if you want to
 address it the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races i have a couple of very obvious i suppose ideas for maybe how to do that
 i 'm a big fan of cities especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups i think cities facilitate more networking and casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis but
  not everyone wants to live in a city certainly not a city like new york so we can think more about things like street grids this is the neighborhood where i grew up in east lansing michigan it 's a traditional midwestern community which means you have real grid 
  you have real neighborhoods and real trees and real streets you can walk on and you interact a lot with your neighbors people you like people you might not know
  starbucks and stuff like that i think that actually
 this type of urban design which became more prevalent in the one thousand nine hundred and seventys and one thousand nine hundred and eightys i think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under ronald reagan
 but also here is another idea we have
 is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from new york abroad but frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from
  study for a semester at the university of arkansas and vice versa do it at the high school level
 literally there are people who might be in school in arkansas or tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from
 another part of the country or of another racial group i think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do
 get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise but the point is this is
  all good news because when something is
 predictable
 it is what i call designable you can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism if we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesn 't we can start to design solutions to it so that 's all i have to say thank you very
  now
