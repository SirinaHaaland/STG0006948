  six months ago  i got an email from a man in israel who had read one of my books 
 and the email said you don 't know me  but i 'm your 12th cousin 
 and it said i have a family tree with eighty thousand people on it including you
  marx and several european aristocrats 
 now i did not know what to make of this part of me was like okay when 's he going to ask me to wire ten thousand dollars to his nigerian bank right 
 i also thought eighty thousand relatives do i want that i have enough trouble with
  the ones i have already  and i won 't name names but you know who you are 
 but another part of me said this is remarkable  here i am alone in my office but i 'm not alone at all i 'm connected to eighty thousand 
  people around the world and that 's four madison square gardens full of cousins
  but they 're all related to me 
 so this email inspired me to dive into genealogy 
 which i always thought was a very staid and proper field  but it turns out it 's going through a fascinating revolution and a controversial one 
 partly this is because of dna and genetic testing  but partly  it 's because of the internet
 there are sites that now take the wikipedia approach to family trees collaboration
  and crowdsourcing and what you do is you load your family tree on and then these sites search to see if the a j jacobs in your tree
 is the same as the a j jacobs in another tree and if it is then you can combine 
 and then you combine and combine and combine until you get these massive mega family trees with thousands of people on them 
 or even millions i
  on something on geni called the world family tree  which has no less than a
  you are on it whether you know it or not and you can see the links
 here 's my cousin gwyneth paltrow  she has no idea i exist but
 we are officially cousins we have just seventeen links between us  and
 there 's my cousin barack obama
  he is my aunt 's fifth great aunt 's husband 's father 's wife 's seventh great nephew so
 practically my old brother  
 and my cousin of course the actor kevin bacon 
 who is my first cousin 's twice removed 's wife 's niece 's husband 's first cousin once removed 's niece 's husband  
 so six degrees of kevin bacon  plus or minus several degrees
 now i 'm not boasting because all of you have famous people and historical figures in in your tree because we are all connected 
 and seventy five million may seem like a lot but in a few years it 's quite likely we will have a family tree with all almost all seven
  does it really matter what 's the importance  and i do think it is important and i 'll give you five reasons why really quickly first it 's got scientific value 
 this is an unprecedented history of the human race  
 and it 's giving us
 valuable data about how diseases are inherited how people migrate and there 's a team of scientists
  mit right now studying the world family tree 
 number two  it brings history alive  i found out i 'm connected to albert einstein  so i told my seven year old son that and
 he was totally engaged now albert einstein is not some
 dead white guy with weird hair he 's uncle albert 
 and my son wanted to know
 what did he say what is e = mc squared also it 's not all good news  i found a link to jeffrey dahmer the serial killer  
 but i will say that 's on my wife 's side so
 i want to make that clear  sorry honey 
 number three interconnectedness we all come from the same ancestor
 and you don 't have to believe the literal bible version
  scientists talk about
 y chromosomal adam and
 mitochondrial eve  and these were about one hundred thousand to three hundred thousand years ago we all have a bit of their dna in us they are our 
 continue that for about seven thousand times grandparents  and so that means we literally all are biological cousins as
  the farthest cousin you have on earth is about a 
 it 's not just ancestors we share  descendants 
 if you have kids  and they have kids look how quickly the descendants accumulate so in ten twelve generations you 're going to have thousands of offspring and millions of offspring  
 number four a
  i know that
 there are family feuds i have three sons so i see how they fight  
 but i think that there 's also a human bias to treat your family a little better than strangers  i think this tree is going to be bad news for bigots because
 they 're going to have to realize that they are cousins with thousands of people in whatever ethnic group they happen to to have
  issues with and i think you look back at history 
 and a lot of the terrible things we 've done to each other is because one group thinks another group is sub human 
 and you can 't do that anymore we 're not just part of the same species we 're part of the same family 
 we share ninety nine point nine percent of our dna 
 now the final one is
 number five a democratizing effect some genealogy has an elitist strain like people say
  i 'm descended from mary queen of scots and you 're not so you cannot join my country club but
 that 's really going to be hard to do now because everyone is related i 'm descended from mary queen of scots
 by marriage but still  so
 it 's really a fascinating time in the history of family because
 it 's changing so fast there is gay marriage and sperm donors and there 's intermarriage
  on an unprecedented scale and this makes some of my more conservative cousins a little nervous
 but i actually think it 's a good thing  i think the more inclusive the idea of family is the better 
 because then you have more potential caretakers  and as my aunt 's eighth cousin
 twice removed hillary clinton
  so i have all these hundreds and thousands millions of new cousins i thought what can i do with this information  and that 's when i decided 
 why not throw a party  so that 's what i 'm doing  and you 're all invited
  next year next summer i will be hosting what i hope is the biggest and best family reunion in history
 i want you there i want you there it 's going to be at the new york hall of science  which is
 a great venue  but it 's also on the site of the former world 's fair  which is  i think 
 very appropriate because i see this as a family reunion meets a world 's fair there 's going to be exhibits and food music  paul mccartney
  is eleven steps away so i 'm hoping he brings his guitar 
 he hasn 't rsvp 'd yet but fingers crossed  and there is going to be a day of speakers of fascinating cousins
 it 's early but i 've already  i 've got some lined up  
 cass sunstein my cousin who is perhaps the most brilliant legal scholar will be
  he was a former member of the obama
 administration and on the other side of the political spectrum  george h w bush  number forty one the father he has agreed to participate
 and nick kroll the comedian and dr oz and many more to come 
 and of course the most important is that you i want you guys there  and i invite you to to
  figure out how you 're on the family tree  because these are big issues family and tribe and i i don 't know all the answers  but i have a lot of smart relatives  
 including you guys so together i think we can figure it out only together can we solve these big problems so from
 cousin to cousin i thank you i can 't wait to see you
