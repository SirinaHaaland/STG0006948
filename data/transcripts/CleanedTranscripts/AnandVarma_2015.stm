  my backyard in berkeley california
 until last year i 'd never kept bees before  but national geographic asked me to photograph a story about them and i
 decided to be able to take compelling images i should start keeping bees myself 
 and as you may know bees pollinate one third of our food crops  and lately they 've been having a really hard time 
 so as a photographer i wanted to explore what this problem really looks like  so i 'm going
  to show you what i found over the last year  this furry little creature
 is a fresh young bee halfway emerged from its brood cell 
 and bees right now are dealing with several different problems including pesticides  diseases  and habitat loss  
 but the single greatest threat is a parasitic mite from
  and this pinhead sized mite crawls onto young bees and sucks their blood  
 this eventually destroys a hive because it weakens the immune system of the bees 
 and it makes them more vulnerable to stress and disease 
 now bees are the most sensitive when they 're developing inside their brood cells  and i wanted to know what that process really looks like  
 so i teamed up with a bee lab at u c davis and figured out
  how to raise bees in front of a camera i 'm going to show you the first twenty one days of a bee 's life condensed into sixty seconds 
 this is a bee egg
 as it hatches into a larva  and those newly hatched larvae
 swim around their cells feeding on this white goo that nurse bees secrete for them
  then their head and their legs slowly differentiate as they transform into pupae here
 's that same pupation process and you can actually see the mites running around in the cells  
 then the tissue in their body reorganizes
 and the pigment slowly develops in their eyes
 the last step of the process is their skin shrivels up
 and they sprout hair
  as you can see halfway through that video the mites were running around on the baby bees 
 and the way that beekeepers typically manage these mites is they treat their hives with chemicals  
  that 's bad news  so researchers are working on finding alternatives to control these mites 
 this is one of those alternatives it 's an experimental breeding program at the usda bee lab in baton rouge  
 and this queen and her attendant bees are part of that program 
 now 
 the researchers figured out that some of the bees have a natural ability to fight mites so they set out to breed a line of
 mite resistant bees this is what it takes to breed bees in a lab the virgin queen is sedated
 and then artificially inseminated using this precision instrument 
 now this procedure allows the researchers to control exactly which bees are being crossed  
 but there 's a tradeoff in having this much control they succeeded in breeding
 mite resistant bees  but in that process those bees started to lose traits like their gentleness and their ability to store honey  
 so to overcome that problem these researchers are now collaborating with commercial beekeepers 
 this is bret adee opening one of his seventy two thousand beehives  he and his brother run the largest beekeeping operation in the world  
 the usda is integrating their mite resistant bees into his operation
 with the hope that over time they 'll be able to select the bees that are not only  mite resistant
 but also retain all of these qualities that make them useful to us  
 and to say it like that makes it sound like we 're manipulating and exploiting bees and the truth is we 've been doing that for thousands of years
  we took this wild creature and put it inside of a box  practically domesticating it 
 and originally that was so that we could harvest their honey  
 but over time we started losing our native pollinators our wild pollinators  and there are many places now where those wild pollinators can no longer meet the pollination
  so these managed bees have become an integral part of our food system 
 so when people talk about saving bees my interpretation of that is we need to save our relationship to bees 
 and in order to design new solutions 
 we have to understand the basic biology of bees
 and understand the effects of stressors
  we sometimes cannot see in other words we have to understand bees up close  thank you
