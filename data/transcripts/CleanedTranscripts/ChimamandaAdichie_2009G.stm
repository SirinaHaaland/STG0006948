  i would like to tell you a few personal stories about
 what i like to call the danger of the single story 
 i grew up on a university campus in eastern nigeria  my mother says that i started reading at the age of two
 i think four is probably close to the truth 
 so i was an early reader  and what i read were british and american children 's books 
 i was also an early writer  
 and when i began to write at about the age of seven stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read 
 i wrote exactly the kinds of stories i was reading
  all my characters were white and blue eyed they played in the snow  they ate apples 
 and they talked a lot about the weather  how lovely it was that the sun had come out 
 now this despite the fact that i lived in
  had never been outside nigeria 
 we didn 't have snow  we ate mangoes  and we never talked about the weather because there was no need to 
 my characters also drank a lot of ginger beer  because the characters in the british books i read drank ginger beer 
 never mind that i had no idea what ginger beer was 
 and for many years afterwards i would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer  but that is another story  what this
  i think is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story  particularly as children 
 because all i had read were books in which characters were foreign 
 i had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which i could not personally identify  
 now things changed when i discovered african books
  books there weren 't many of them available and they weren 't quite as easy to find as the foreign books but
 because of writers like chinua achebe and camara laye  i went through a mental shift in my perception of literature  i realized that people like me  
 girls with skin the color of chocolate whose
 kinky hair could not form
  could also exist in literature  i started to write about things i recognized  
 now i loved those american and british books i read they stirred my imagination they opened up new worlds for me  
 but the unintended consequence was that i did not know that people like me could exist in literature  
 so what the discovery of african writers did for me was this it saved me
 from having a single story of what books are 
 i come from a conventional middle class nigerian family  my father was a professor  my mother was an administrator  
 and so we had as was the norm
 live in domestic help who would often come from nearby rural villages so the year i turned eight we got a new house boy 
 his name was fide
  the only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor  
 my mother sent yams and rice and our old clothes to his family  
 and when i didn 't finish my dinner my mother would say finish your food don 't you know people like fide 's family have nothing 
 so i felt enormous pity
 for fide 's family  then one saturday we went to his
  village to visit and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made i was startled 
 it had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something 
 all i had heard about them was how poor they were so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor 
 their poverty was my single story of them 
 years later i thought about this when i
  nigeria to go to university in the united states  i was nineteen 
 my american roommate was shocked by me 
 she asked where i had learned to speak english so well  and was confused when i said that nigeria happened to have english as its official language  
 she asked if she could listen to
  was consequently very disappointed when i produced my tape of mariah carey 
 she assumed that i did not know how to use a stove  
 what struck me was this she had felt sorry for me even before she saw me 
 her default position toward me as an african was a kind of patronizing
  my roommate had a single story of africa a single story of catastrophe 
 in this single story there was no possibility of africans being similar to her in any way no possibility of feelings more complex than pity no possibility of a connection as human equals 
 i must say that before i went to the u s i didn 't consciously identify as
  but in the u s whenever africa came up people turned to me never mind that i knew nothing about places like namibia  
 but i did come to embrace this new identity and in many ways i think of myself now as african  although i still get quite irritable when
 africa is referred to as a country the most recent example being my
 otherwise wonderful flight from lagos two days ago in which
 there was an announcement on the virgin flight
  after i had spent some years in the u s as an african  i began to understand my roommate 's response to me 
 if i had not grown up in nigeria  and if all i knew about africa were from popular images i too would think
 that africa was a place of beautiful landscapes  beautiful
  and incomprehensible people fighting senseless wars dying of poverty and aids  unable to speak for themselves
 and waiting to be saved by a kind white foreigner  
 i would see africans in the same way that i as a child had seen fide 's family 
 this single story of africa ultimately comes i think from western literature  now here is a quote from
 the writing of a london merchant called john lok who sailed to west
 and kept
 a fascinating account of his voyage 
 after referring to the black africans as beasts who have no houses he writes 
 they are also people without heads having their mouth and eyes in their breasts 
  i 've laughed every time i 've read this and one must
 admire the imagination of john lok  
 but what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling african stories in the west 
 a tradition of sub saharan africa as a place of negatives of difference of darkness of people who in the words of the wonderful poet
 rudyard kipling are half devil  
  and so i began to realize that my american roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of this single story  
 as had a professor  who once told me that my novel was not authentically african 
 now i was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel that it had failed
 in a number of places
  but i had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something called african authenticity in fact i did not know what african authenticity was 
 the professor told me that my characters
 were too much like him an educated and middle class man my characters drove cars they were not starving  
 therefore they were not authentically african  
 but i must quickly add that i too am just as guilty in the question of
  the single story  a few years ago i visited mexico from the u s 
 the political climate in the u s at the time was tense and there were debates going on about immigration 
 and as often happens in america immigration became synonymous with mexicans 
 there were endless stories of mexicans as people who were
 fleecing the healthcare system sneaking across the border
  being arrested at the border that sort of thing  
 i remember walking around on my first day in guadalajara  
 watching the people going to work rolling up tortillas in the marketplace smoking  laughing  
 i remember first feeling slight surprise  and then i was overwhelmed with
  i realized that i had been so immersed in the media coverage of mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind the abject immigrant 
 i had bought into the single story of mexicans and i could not have been more ashamed of myself 
 so that is how to create a single story  show a people
 as one thing as only one thing over and over again and that is what they become it is impossible to talk about the single story
  without talking about power 
 there is a word  an igbo word that i think about whenever i think about the power structures of the world and it is nkali 
 it 's a noun that loosely translates to to be greater than another 
 like our economic and political worlds stories too are defined
 by the principle of nkali  how they are told who tells them
 when they 're told how many stories are told are really dependent on power 
 power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person  but to make it the definitive story of that person  
 the palestinian poet mourid barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with
  start the story with the arrows of the native americans and not with the arrival of the british and you have an entirely different story  
 start the story with the failure of the african state  and not with the colonial creation of the african state  and you have an entirely different
  i recently spoke at a university where a student told me that it was such a shame that nigerian men were
 physical abusers like the father character in my novel i told him that i had just read a novel called american psycho
  obviously i said this in a fit of mild irritation but
 it would never have occurred to me to think that just because i had read a novel
 in which a character was a serial killer that he was somehow representative of all americans 
  this is not because i am a better person than that student  but because of america 's cultural and economic power i had many stories of america  i had read tyler and updike and steinbeck and gaitskill 
 i did not have a single story of america 
 when i learned some years ago that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful  
 i began to think about how i could invent horrible things my parents had done to me
  but the truth is that i had a very happy childhood  full of laughter and love in a very close knit family  
 but i also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps  my cousin polle
 died because he could not get adequate healthcare  one of my closest friends okoloma died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have
  i grew up under repressive military governments that devalued education so that sometimes my parents were not paid their salaries  
 and so as a child i saw jam disappear from the breakfast table  
 then margarine disappeared  
 then bread became too expensive  then milk became rationed  
 and most of all a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives 
 all of these stories make me who i am
 but to insist on only these negative stories is to flatten my experience
 and to overlook the many other stories that formed me the single story creates stereotypes and the problem
 with stereotypes is not that they are untrue  but that they are incomplete they make one story become the only story
  course africa is a continent full of catastrophes there are
 immense ones such as the horrific rapes in congo and depressing ones such as the fact that five thousand people apply for one job vacancy in nigeria  
 but there are other stories
 that are not about catastrophe  and it is very important it is just as important to talk about them
  i 've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person  
 the consequence of the single story is this it robs people of dignity 
 it makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult it emphasizes how we are different
 rather than how we are similar so what if before
  my mexican trip i had followed the immigration debate from both sides the u s and the mexican  
 what if my mother had told us that fide 's family was poor
 and hardworking  
 what if we had an african television network that broadcast diverse african stories all over the world 
 what the nigerian writer chinua achebe calls a balance of stories 
 what if my roommate knew
  a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house 
 now the conventional wisdom was that nigerians don 't read literature he disagreed he felt
 that people who could read would read if you made literature affordable and available to them  
 shortly after he published my first novel i went to a tv station in lagos to do an interview  and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said
 i really liked your novel  i didn 't like the ending now you must write a sequel and this is what will happen 
 and she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel 
 i was not only charmed i was very moved  here was a woman part of the ordinary masses of nigerians who were not supposed to be readers 
 she had not only read the book but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified
  in telling me what to write in the sequel  
 now what if my roommate knew about my friend funmi iyanda a fearless woman who hosts a tv show in lagos and is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget  
 what if my roommate knew
 about the heart procedure that was performed in the lagos hospital last week
  what if my roommate knew about contemporary nigerian music  talented people singing in english and pidgin and igbo and yoruba and ijo 
 mixing influences from jay z to fela to bob marley to their grandfathers  
 what if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband 's
  what if my roommate knew about nollywood  
 full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds 
 films so popular that they really are the best example of nigerians consuming what they produce  
 what if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider who has just started her own business selling hair extensions 
 or about the
  millions of other nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail but continue to nurse ambition 
 every time i am home i am confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most nigerians our failed infrastructure our failed government  
 but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive despite the government rather than because of it 
 i teach writing workshops in lagos every summer and it is amazing to me how many people apply how many people
 are eager to write to tell stories my nigerian publisher and i have just started a non profit called farafina trust and
 we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist and
 providing books for state schools that don 't have anything in their libraries and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops in reading and writing for all the people who are eager to tell
  our many stories stories matter 
 many stories matter stories have been used to dispossess and to malign  but stories can also be used to empower
 and to humanize stories can break the dignity of a people but stories can also repair that broken dignity 
  the american writer alice walker wrote this about her southern relatives who had moved to the north she introduced them to a book about the southern life that they had left behind 
 they sat around reading the book themselves listening to me read the book and a kind of paradise
 was regained i would like to end with this thought that when we reject the single story  when we realize that there is never
 a single story about any place we regain a kind of paradise  thank you
