  martin luther king
 did not say i have a nightmare when he inspired the civil rights movements  
 he said i have a dream 
 and i have a dream i have a dream that we can
  stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare  
 and this is going to be a challenge  because if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times  
 nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic i think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times the
  it 's a beautiful piece of filmmaking but everything is desolate everything is dead  and just a father and son
 trying to survive walking along the road  
 and i think the environmental movement of which i am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future 
 for too long we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what 's going to happen we have focused on the
  have focused on the problems  and we have not thought enough about the solutions 
 we 've used fear if you like to grab people 's attention and any psychologist will tell you
 that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism it 's part of the fight and flight
  that when an animal is frightened
 think of a deer a deer freezes very very still poised to run away and i think that 's what we 're doing
 when we 're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change people are freezing and running away
 because we 're using fear  and i think the environmental movement has to grow up
 and start to think about what progress is
  would it be like to be improving the human lot and one of the problems that we face i think is that the only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress
 is a financial definition of what progress is an economic definition of what progress is
 that somehow if we get the right numbers to go up we 're going to be better off  whether that 's on the stock market
  's with gdp
 and economic growth that somehow life is going to get better this is somehow appealing to human greed
 instead of fear
 that more is better  come on in the western world we have enough  maybe some parts of the world don 't but we have enough  
 and we 've know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations in fact the architect
 of our national accounting system simon kuznets in the 1930s said that a nation 's welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income 
 but we 've created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff  
 and indeed this is probably historical and it had its time in the second world war we needed to produce a lot of stuff  and indeed we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff
  that we destroyed a lot of europe and we had to rebuild it afterwards  and so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce  but as early as one thousand nine 
 this visionary man  robert kennedy at the start of his ill fated presidential campaign  gave the most eloquent deconstruction
  of gross national product that ever has been and he finished his talk with the phrase that the gross national product
 measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile 
 how crazy is that that our measure of progress our dominant measure of progress in society  is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile 
 i believe if kennedy was alive today he would be asking statisticians such as
  myself
 to go out and find out
 what makes life worthwhile  he 'd be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon
 such important things as social justice sustainability and people 's well being and actually social scientists have already gone out
  and asked these questions around the world 
 this is from a global survey  it 's asking people what do they want  and unsurprisingly people all around the world
 say that what they want
 is happiness for themselves for their families their children their communities  okay they think money is slightly important  it 's there  
 but it 's not nearly as important as happiness and it 's not nearly as important
  as love we all need to love and be loved in life it 's not nearly as important as health we want to be healthy and live a full life 
 these seem to be natural human aspirations 
 why are statisticians not measuring these why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms 
 instead of just how much stuff we have 
 and really this is what i 've done with my adult life is think about how do we measure happiness how do we measure well being how can we do that within environmental limits
 and we created at the organization that i work for the new economics foundation something we call the happy planet index  
 because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy why don 't we create a measure of progress that shows that 
 and what we do is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens 
 that should be the goal of every nation
  on the planet  but we have to remember
 that there 's a fundamental input to that  and that is how many of the planet 's resources we use  
 we all have one planet we all have to share it it is the ultimate scarce resource 
 the one planet that we share and economics is very interested in
  when it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome it thinks in terms of efficiency 
 it thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck  
 and this is a measure of how much well being we get for our planetary resource use 
 it is an efficiency measure and probably the easiest way to show you
 that is to show you this graph  running horizontally along the graph is ecological footprint
  which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet more is bad 
 running vertically upwards is a measure called happy life years 
 it 's about the well being of nations it 's like a happiness adjusted 
 it 's like quality and quantity of life in nations and the yellow dot there you
  is the global average 
 now there 's a huge array of nations around that global average to the top right of the graph  are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well being 
 but they 're using a lot of planet to get there  
 they are the u s a other western countries going across in those triangles and a few gulf states in there actually  
 conversely at the bottom left of the graph  are countries that are not producing much
  in hobbesian terms life is short and brutish there the average life expectancy in many of these countries is only forty years  
 malaria  hiv aids are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world 
 but now for the good news there are some countries up there yellow
  that are doing better than global average that are heading up towards the top left of the graph  this is an aspirational graph  we want to be top left where good lives don 't cost the earth  they 're latin american  
 the country on its own up at the top
 is a place i haven 't been to maybe some of you have costa rica  
 costa rica average life expectancy is
  they are according to the latest gallup world poll the happiest nation on the planet
 than anybody  more than switzerland and denmark  they are the happiest place they are doing that on a quarter of the resources
 that are used typically in [ the ] western world a quarter
 of the resources what 's going on there what 's happening in costa rica
 we can look at some of the data ninety nine percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources 
 their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by two thousand and twenty one 
 they
 abolished the army in one thousand nine hundred and forty nine and they invested in social
  they have one of the highest literacy rates in latin america and in the world 
 and they have that latin vibe don 't they they have the social connectedness 
 the challenge is that possibly and the thing we might have to think about is that the future
 might not be
 north american might not be western european it might be latin american  
  is to pull the global average up here 
 that 's what we need to do  and if we 're going to do that we need to pull countries from the bottom  and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph  
 and then we 're starting to create
 a happy planet that 's one way of looking at it another way of looking at it is looking at time trends we don 't have good data going back for every country in the world but for some
  and this is the trend in well being over that time a small increase  but this is the trend in ecological footprint  
 and so in strict happy planet methodology we 've become less efficient
 at turning our ultimate scarce resource
 into the outcome we want to and the point really is is that i think  probably everybody in this room would like society to get to
 something happening it
 's actually not very long away it 's half a human lifetime away a child entering school today will be my age in two thousand and fifty this is not the very distant future 
 this is what the  u k government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like  
  not business as usual  that is changing our business that is changing the way we
 create our organizations we do our government policy and we live our lives and the point is we need to carry on increasing well being 
 no one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce none of us i think want human progress to stop i think we want it to carry
 i think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing  
 and i think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in  i think this is what they want they want quality of life to keep increasing they want to hold on
 to what they 've got  and if we 're going to engage them i think that 's what we 've got to do 
 and that means we have to really increase efficiency even more now that 's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that but the point is we need to turn those
  and this is where i think we can take a leaf out of systems theory systems engineers where they create feedback loops put the right information at the right point of time 
 human beings are very motivated by the now 
 you put a smart meter in your home  and you see how much electricity you 're using right now how much it 's costing you your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly 
 what would that look like for society  why is
  on the radio news every evening i hear the ftse one hundred the dow jones the dollar pound ratio i don 't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news  
 and why do i hear that  why don 't i hear how much energy britain used yesterday or american used yesterday  
 did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions that 's how you create a collective goal 
 you put it out there into the media and start thinking about it  and we need positive feedback loops
 for increasing well being at a government
  they might create national accounts of well being at a business level you might look at the well being of your employees which we know is really linked to creativity which is linked to innovation and we 're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues 
 at a personal level we need these nudges too  maybe we don 't quite need the data but we need reminders in the u k we
  have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day
 and how much exercise we should do never my best thing 
 what are these for happiness what are the five things that you should do every day to be happier we did a project for the government office of science a
 couple of years ago a big program called the foresight program lots and lots of people involved lots of experts everything evidence based a huge tome  
 but a piece of work we did was on what five positive actions can you do to improve well being in your life
 and the point of these is they are not quite the secrets of happiness  but they are things that i think happiness will flow out the side from and the first of these
 is to connect is that your social relationships are the most important
 cornerstones of your life do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do and energy keep building
  the second one is be active the fastest way out of a bad mood  step outside go for a walk turn the radio on and dance 
 being active is great for our positive mood  the third one
 is take notice 
 how aware are you of things going on around the world  the seasons changing people around you do you notice what 's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge 
 based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness cognitive behavioral therapy [ very ] strong for our well being
 the fourth is keep learning
 and keep is important learning throughout the whole life course 
 older people who keep learning and are curious  
 they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down but it doesn 't have to be formal learning it 's not knowledge based it 's more curiosity it
 can be learning to cook a new dish  
  picking up an instrument you forgot as a child keep learning 
 and the final one is that most anti economic of activities  but give 
 our generosity our altruism our compassion are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain we feel good if we give 
 you can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning you tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people 
  their happiness at the end of the day those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves 
 and these five ways  
 which we put onto these handy postcards  
 i would say don 't have to cost the earth  they don 't have any carbon content  they don 't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied 
 and so i think it 's really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth
  now  martin luther king on the eve of his death gave an incredible speech 
 he said i know there are challenges ahead there may be trouble ahead
  but i fear no one i don 't care  i have been to the mountain top  and i have seen the promised land now
 he was a preacher  but i believe the environmental movement and in fact
  to go to the top of the mountain top  and it needs to look out and it needs to see the promised land or the land of promise  
 and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want 
 and not only that we need to create a great transition to get there  and we need to pave that great
  transition with good things human beings
 want to be happy pave them with the five ways  and we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them something like the happy planet index  
 and then i believe
 that we can all create a world we all want where happiness does not cost the earth
