  and societies are getting grayer 
 you hear about it all the time you read about it in your newspapers you hear about it on your television sets  sometimes i 'm concerned that we hear
  about it so much that
 we 've come to accept longer lives with a kind of a complacency even ease  
 but make no mistake longer lives can
 and i believe will
 improve quality of life
 at all ages  now to put this in perspective let me just zoom out for a minute more years
 were added to average life expectancy in the
  century
 than all years
 added
 across all prior millennia of human evolution combined
  in the blink of an eye  we nearly doubled the length of time that we 're living 
 so if you ever feel like you don 't have this aging thing quite pegged don 't kick yourself  it 's brand new
 and because fertility rates fell across that very same period that life expectancy was going up 
 that pyramid that has always represented the distribution of age in the population with many young ones at the bottom winnowed to a tiny peak 
 of older people who make it and survive to old age is being reshaped
  and now if you 're the kind of person who can get chills from population statistics 
 these are the ones that should do it because what that means is that for the first time in the history of the species 
 the majority of babies born in the developed world
 are having the
  no genetically hardier than our ancestors were ten thousand years ago this increase in life expectancy is the remarkable product of culture
 the crucible that holds science and technology and 
 changes in behavior that improve health and well being through cultural changes our ancestors largely
  largely eliminated early death so that people can now live out their full lives now there are problems associated with aging
 diseases poverty loss of social status it 's hardly time to rest on our laurels  
 but the more we learn about aging the clearer it becomes that a sweeping downward course is grossly inaccurate 
 aging brings some
  rather remarkable improvements increased knowledge expertise
 and emotional aspects of life improve 
 that 's right older people are happy
  cdc recently conducted a survey where they asked respondents simply to tell them whether they experienced significant psychological distress in the previous week and fewer 
 older people answered affirmatively to that question than middle aged people and younger people as well  
  stress worry anger
 all decrease with age 
 now social scientists call this the paradox of aging i mean  after all aging is not a piece of cake  
 so we 've asked all sorts of questions to see if we could undo this finding
  we 've asked whether it may be that the current generations of older people
 are and always have been the greatest generations 
 that is that younger people today may not typically experience these improvements as they grow older  
 we 've asked well maybe older people are just trying to put a positive spin on an otherwise depressing existence 
 but the more we 've tried to disavow this finding the more evidence we find to support it
 years ago my colleagues and i embarked on a study where we followed the same group of people over a 10 year period originally the sample was aged eighteen to ninety four 
 and we studied whether and how their emotional experiences changed as they grew older our participants would carry electronic pagers for a week at a
  them throughout the day and evenings at random times and every time we paged them we 'd ask them to answer several questions on a one to seven scale how happy are you right now how sad are you right now how frustrated are you right now 
 so that we could get a sense of the kinds of emotions and feelings they were having in their day to day lives  
 and using this intense study of individuals we find that it 's not one particular generation that 's doing better than the others
  but the same individuals over time come to report relatively greater positive
 experience now you see this slight downturn at very advanced ages  and there is a slight downturn but at no point does it return to the levels we see in early adulthood 
 now
 it 's really too simplistic
 to
  say that older people are happy 
 in our study they are more positive but they 're also more likely than younger people to experience mixed emotions
 sadness at the same time you experience happiness you know that tear in the eye when you 're smiling at a friend 
 and other research has shown that older people seem to engage with sadness more comfortably
  accepting of sadness than younger people are and we suspect that this may help to explain why older people are better than than younger people at solving hotly charged emotional conflicts and debates 
 older people can view injustice with compassion  but not despair
  and all things being equal older people direct their cognitive resources like attention and memory to positive information more than negative 
 if we show older middle aged younger people images like the ones you see on the screen  
 and we later ask them to recall all the images that they can older people  but not younger people remember
  more positive images than negative images  
 we 've asked older and younger people to view faces in laboratory studies some frowning some smiling older people look toward the smiling faces and away from the frowning angry faces
 in day to day life this translates into greater enjoyment and satisfaction 
 but as social scientists we continue to ask about possible alternatives we 've said well maybe older people report more
  positive emotions because they 're cognitively impaired 
 we 've said could it be that positive emotions are simply easier to process than negative emotions and so you switch to the positive emotions 
 maybe our neural centers in our brain are degraded such that we 're unable to process negative emotions anymore  
 but that 's not the case the most
  mentally sharp
 older adults are the ones who show this positivity effect the most 
 and under conditions where it really matters older people do process the negative information just as well as the positive information  so
 how can this be well in our research  we 've found that these changes are grounded fundamentally
 in the uniquely
  human ability to monitor time
 not just clock time and calendar time but lifetime  
 and if there 's a paradox of aging 
 it 's that recognizing that we won 't live forever changes our perspective on life in positive ways  
 when time horizons are long and nebulous as they typically are in youth people are constantly preparing trying to soak
  up all the information they possibly can taking risks exploring  we might spend time with people we don 't even like
 because it 's somehow interesting
 we might learn something unexpected we go on blind dates 
 you know after
  if it doesn 't work out there 's always tomorrow people over fifty
 don 't go on blind dates 
 as we age our time horizons grow shorter and our goals change  
 when we recognize that we don 't have all the time in the world we see our priorities most
  we take less notice of trivial matters  we savor life we
 're more appreciative more open to reconciliation 
 we invest in more emotionally important parts of life and life gets better 
 so we 're happier day to day but that same shift in perspective leads us to have less tolerance than ever for
  by two thousand and fifteen there will be more people in the united states over the age of sixty than under fifteen 
 what will happen to societies that are top heavy with older people the numbers
 won 't determine the outcome culture will if we invest
  in science and technology and find solutions for the real problems that older people face
 and we capitalize on the very real strengths
 of older people  then added years of life can dramatically improve quality of life
 at all ages  
 societies with millions of talented emotionally stable citizens who are healthier and better educated than any generations before
  them armed with knowledge about the practical matters of life and motivated to solve the big issues
 can be better societies than we have ever known  
 my father who is ninety two likes to say let 's stop talking only about how to save the old folks and
  start talking about how to get them to save us all
