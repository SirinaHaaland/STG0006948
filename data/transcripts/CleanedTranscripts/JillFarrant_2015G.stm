  i believe that the secret to producing extremely drought tolerant crops  which should go some way to providing food security in the world lies in
 resurrection plants  pictured here in an extremely
  you might think that these plants look dead  but they 're not give them water and they will resurrect green up start growing in twelve
 to forty eight hours 
 now why would i suggest that producing drought tolerant crops will go towards providing food security well 
 the current world population is around seven billion  and it 's estimated that
  be between nine and ten billion people with the bulk of this growth
 happening in africa  the food and agricultural organizations of the world have suggested that we need a seventy percent increase
 in current agricultural practice to meet that demand
 given that plants are at the base of the food chain  most of that 's going to have to come from plants
 that percentage of seventy percent does not take into consideration the potential effects of climate change
 this is taken from a study by dai published in two thousand and eleven
 where he took into consideration all the potential effects of climate change and expressed them amongst other things increased aridity due to lack of rain or infrequent rain
 the areas in red shown here are areas that until recently
 have been very successfully used for agriculture but cannot anymore because
  of lack of rainfall this is the situation that 's predicted to happen in two thousand and fifty 
 much of africa in fact much of the world is going to be in trouble 
 we 're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food 
 and preferably among them some drought tolerant crops  the other thing to remember about africa is that most of their
  crops is not the easiest thing in the world and the reason for this is water 
 water is essential to life on this planet all living  actively metabolizing
 organisms from microbes to you and i are comprised predominately of water  all life reactions happen in water 
 and loss of a small amount of water results in death  you and i are sixty five percent water we lose one percent of that we die
 but we can make behavioral changes to avoid that 
 plants can 't they 're stuck in the ground  
 and so in the first instance they have a little bit more water than us about ninety five percent water 
 and they can lose a little bit more than us like ten to about seventy percent depending on the species  
 but for short periods
  most of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss 
 so extreme examples of resistors can be found in succulents  they tend to be small 
 very attractive  but they hold onto their water at such great cost that they grow extremely slowly 
 examples of avoidance of water loss are found in trees and shrubs  
 they send down very deep roots mine subterranean water supplies and just keep flushing it through them at all times keeping themselves hydrated
 on the right is called a baobab it 's also called the 
 simply because the proportion of roots to shoots is so great that it looks like the tree has been planted upside down 
 and of course the roots are required for hydration of that plant 
 and probably the most common strategy of avoidance is found in annuals
  make up the bulk of our plant food supplies 
 up the west coast of my country for much of the year you don 't see much vegetation growth  but come the spring rains  you get this  
 flowering of the desert 
 the strategy in annuals is to grow only in the rainy season 
 at the end of that season they produce a seed which is dry eight to ten percent water  but very much alive  
 and anything that is that dry and still alive we call
 in the desiccated state what seeds can do is lie in extremes of environment for prolonged periods of time the next time the rainy season comes
  they germinate and grow and the whole cycle just starts again  
 it 's widely believed that the evolution of 
  seeds allowed the colonization and the radiation of flowering
  but back to annuals as our major form of food supplies  wheat  rice and maize form ninety five percent
 of our plant food supplies 
 and it 's been a great strategy because in a short space of time you can produce a lot of seed seeds are energy rich so there 's a lot of food calories you can store it in times of
 plenty for times of famine  but there 's a downside  the vegetative tissues the roots and leaves
  of of annuals do not have much by way of inherent resistance avoidance or tolerance characteristics they just don 't need them they grow in the rainy season and they 've got a seed
 to help them survive the rest of the year  
 and so despite concerted efforts in agriculture to make crops with improved properties of resistance avoidance and tolerance
 particularly resistance and avoidance because we 've had good models to understand how those work
  we still get images like this maize crop in africa  two weeks without rain and it 's dead 
 there is a solution 
 resurrection plants  
 these plants can lose ninety five percent of their cellular water  remain in a dry dead like state for months to years and give them water
  like seeds these can withstand extremes of environmental conditions  
 and this is a really rare phenomenon there are only one hundred and thirty five flowering plant species that can do this i 'm going to show you a video of the resurrection process
 of these three species in that order  and at the bottom there 's a time
  axis so you can see how quickly it happens
  years trying to understand how they do this how do these plants dry without
 and i work on a variety of different resurrection plants  shown here in the hydrated and dry states for a number of reasons 
 one of them is that each of these plants serves as a model for a crop that i 'd like to make drought tolerant 
 so on the extreme top left  for example is a grass it 's called eragrostis nindensis it 's
 got a close relative called 
  it 's a staple food in ethiopia it 's gluten free and it 's something we would like to make drought tolerant 
 the other reason for looking at a number of plants is that at least initially i wanted to find out do they do the same thing 
 do they all use the same mechanisms to be able to lose all that water and not die  
 so i undertook what we call a systems biology approach in order to get a comprehensive understanding of desiccation tolerance 
 in which we look at everything from the molecular to the whole plant
 for example we look at things like changes in the plant anatomy as they dried out and their ultrastructure 
 we look at the transcriptome which is just a term for a technology in which we look at the genes that are switched on or off in response to drying  
 most genes will code for proteins  so we look at the proteome  what are the proteins made in response to drying 
 some proteins would code for enzymes which make metabolites  so we look at the
  now this is important
 because plants are stuck in the ground they use what i call a highly tuned chemical arsenal
 to protect themselves from all the stresses of their environment  so it 's important that we look at the chemical changes
 involved in drying  and at the last study that we do at the molecular level we look at the  lipidome the lipid changes
  in response to drying  
 and that 's also important because all biological membranes are made of lipids they 're held as membranes because they 're in water  take away the water those membranes fall apart 
 lipids also act as signals to turn on genes then we use physiological and biochemical studies to try and understand the function of the 
 that we 've actually discovered in our other studies  and then use all of that to try and understand how the plant copes with its natural environment
 i 've always had the philosophy that i needed a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance
 in order to make a meaningful suggestion for a biotic application  
 i 'm sure some of you are thinking by biotic application does she mean she 's going to make genetically modified crops and
 the answer to that
 question is depends on your definition of genetic modification 
 all of the crops that we eat today wheat rice and maize 
 are highly genetically modified from their ancestors  but we don 't consider them gm because they 're being produced by conventional breeding  
 if you mean am i going to put resurrection plant genes into crops  your answer is yes in the essence of time we have tried that approach more appropriately
  have spearheaded that approach and i 'm going to show you some data soon  
 but we 're about to embark upon an extremely ambitious approach in which we aim to turn on whole suites of genes that are already present in every crop they 're
 just never turned on under extreme drought conditions  
 i leave it up to you to decide whether those should be called gm or not 
 i 'm going to now just give you some of the data from that first
  approach and in order to do that i have to explain a little bit about how genes work 
 so you probably all know that genes are made of double stranded dna it 's wound very tightly into chromosomes that are present in every cell of your body or in a plant 's body
 if you unwind that dna  you get genes  and each gene has a promoter 
  the gene coding region  and then a terminator which indicates that this is the end of this gene  the next gene will start 
 now promoters are not simple on off switches they normally require a lot of
  of things to be present and correct before that gene is switched on  so what 's typically done in biotech studies is that we use an inducible promoter
  we know how to switch it on we couple that to genes of interest and put that into a plant and see how the plant responds  
 in the study that i 'm going to talk to you about my collaborators used a drought induced promoter which we discovered in a resurrection plant
 the nice thing about this promoter is that we do nothing the plant itself senses drought 
 and we 've used it to drive antioxidant genes from resurrection plants
  all stresses particularly drought stress 
 results in the formation of free radicals or reactive oxygen species which are highly damaging and can cause crop death  
 what antioxidants do is stop that damage  
 so here 's some data from a maize strain that 's very popularly used in africa to the left of the arrow are plants without the genes to the right plants with the antioxidant genes 
 after three weeks without watering the
  ones with the genes do a hell of a lot better  
 now to the final approach  my research has shown that there 's considerable similarity
 in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in seeds and resurrection plants  so i ask the question are they using the same genes 
 or slightly differently phrased are resurrection plants using genes evolved in seed desiccation tolerance in their roots and leaves have they
  retasked these seed genes
 in roots and leaves of resurrection plants 
 and i answer that question 
 as a consequence of a lot of research from my group and recent collaborations from a group of henk hilhorst in the netherlands  mel oliver in the united states and julia buitink
 in france the
 answer is yes that there is a core set of genes that are involved in both and i 'm going to illustrate this very crudely for maize  where the
  chromosomes below the off switch represent all the genes that are required for desiccation tolerance 
 so as maize seeds dried out at the end of their period of development they switch these genes on 
 resurrection plants switch on the same genes when they dry out 
 all modern crops therefore have these genes in their roots and leaves they just never switch them on they only switch them on in seed tissues
 so what we 're trying to do right now is to understand the environmental and cellular signals that switch on these genes in resurrection plants  
 to mimic the process in crops 
 and just a final thought 
 what we 're trying to do very rapidly is to repeat what nature did in the evolution of resurrection plants some ten to forty million years ago 
 my plants and i thank you for your attention
