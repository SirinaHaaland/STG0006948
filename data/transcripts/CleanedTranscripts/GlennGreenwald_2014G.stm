  an entire genre of youtube videos devoted to an experience which i am certain that everyone in this room has had it entails an individual who thinking they 're alone 
  engages in some expressive behavior wild singing gyrating dancing some
  mild sexual activity
 only to discover that in fact they are not alone that there is a person watching and lurking  the discovery of which causes them to immediately cease what they were doing 
 in horror the sense of shame and humiliation in their face is palpable it 's the sense of this is something i 'm willing to do only if no one else is watching
  this is the crux of the work on which i have been singularly focused for the last sixteen months the question of why privacy matters a question that has arisen
 in the context of a global debate  enabled by the revelations of edward snowden that the united states and its partners unbeknownst to the entire world 
 has converted the internet once heralded as an unprecedented
  tool of liberation and democratization  into an unprecedented zone of mass indiscriminate surveillance 
 there is a very common sentiment that arises in this debate  even among people who are uncomfortable with mass surveillance which says that there is no real harm that comes from
  invasion because only people who are engaged in bad acts have a reason to want to hide and to care about their privacy  
 this worldview is implicitly grounded in the proposition that there are two kinds of people in the world good people and bad people 
 bad people are those who plot terrorist attacks or who engage in violent criminality and therefore have reasons to want to hide what they 're doing have reasons to care about their privacy but by contrast good people are people who go to
  work come home raise their children watch television  they use the internet not to plot bombing attacks but to read the news or exchange recipes or to plan 
  their kids ' little league games and those people are doing nothing wrong and therefore have nothing to hide and no reason to fear the government monitoring them 
  people who are actually saying that are engaged in a very extreme act of 
  what they 're really saying is i have agreed to make myself such a harmless and unthreatening and uninteresting person that i actually don 't fear having the government know what it is that i 'm doing 
 this mindset has found what i think is its purest expression in a two thousand and nine interview with the longtime ceo of google eric schmidt who when asked
  about all the different ways his company is causing invasions of privacy for hundreds of millions of people around the world said this he said if you 're doing something that you don 't want 
 other people to know  maybe you shouldn 't be doing it in the first place 
  important they don 't actually believe it  
 and the way you know that they don 't actually believe it is that while they say with their words that privacy doesn 't matter with their actions they take all kinds of steps to safeguard their privacy 
  they put passwords on their email and their social media accounts  they put locks on their bedroom and bathroom doors all steps designed to prevent other people from entering what they
  consider their private realm and knowing what it is that they don 't want other people to know  
 the very same eric schmidt the ceo of google ordered his employees at google to cease speaking with the online internet magazine cnet
  after cnet published an article full of personal private information
  it obtained exclusively through google searches and using other google products 
 laughter this same division can be seen with the ceo of facebook mark zuckerberg who in an infamous interview in two thousand and ten pronounced that privacy is no longer a social norm 
 last year  mark zuckerberg and his new wife purchased not only their own house but also all four adjacent houses in palo alto
  for a total of thirty million dollars in order to ensure that they enjoyed a zone of privacy that prevented other people from monitoring what they do in their personal lives  
 over the last sixteen months as i 've debated this issue around the world every single time somebody has said to me i don 't really worry about invasions of privacy because i don 't have anything to hide i
  say the same thing to them i get out a pen  i write down my email address i say here 's my email address what i want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts not just the nice respectable work one in your name but all of them  
 because i want to be able to just troll through what it is you 're doing online read what i want to read and publish whatever i find interesting after all if you 're not a bad person if you 're doing nothing wrong you should have nothing to hide 
 not a single person has taken me up on that offer
 i check that
 email account religiously all the time it 's a very desolate place
 and there 's a reason for that which is that we as human beings  even those of us who in words disclaim the importance of our own privacy  instinctively understand the profound importance of it 
 it is true
  that as human beings we 're social animals which means we have a need for other people to know what we 're doing and saying and thinking which is why we voluntarily publish information about ourselves online  
 but equally essential to what it means to be a free and fulfilled human being is to have a place that we can go and be free of the judgmental eyes of other people 
 there 's a reason why we seek that out
  reason is is that all of us not just terrorists and criminals all of us have things to hide 
 there are all sorts of things that we do and think that we 're willing to tell our physician or our lawyer or our psychologist or our spouse or our best friend that we would be mortified for the rest of the world
  to learn 
 we make judgments every single day about the kinds of things that we say and think and do that we 're willing to have other people know and the kinds of things that we say and think and do that we don 't want 
 anyone else to know about people can very easily in words claim that they don 't value their privacy  
  breathing air or drinking water  
 the reason is that when we 're in a state where we can be monitored  where we can be watched our behavior changes dramatically the range of behavioral options 
  that we consider when we think we 're being watched severely reduce 
  of discipline there are dozens of psychological studies that prove
 that when somebody knows that they might be watched  the behavior they engage in is vastly more conformist and compliant human shame is a very powerful motivator as is the desire to avoid it 
 and that 's the reason why people when they 're in a state of being watched make decisions not that are the byproduct of their own
  agency
 but that are about the expectations that others have of them or the mandates of societal orthodoxy  
 this realization was exploited most powerfully for pragmatic ends by the 
  18th century philosopher jeremy bentham who set out to resolve an important problem ushered in by the industrial
  for the first time institutions had become so large and centralized that they were no longer able to monitor and therefore control each one of their individual members  and the solution that he devised 
 was an architectural design originally intended to be implemented in prisons that he called the panopticon 
  of them at all times  and crucial to this design
 was that the inmates could not actually see into the panopticon into the tower  and so they never knew if they were being watched or even when  and what made him 
  so excited about this discovery was that that would mean that the prisoners would have to assume that they were being watched at any given moment  which would be the ultimate enforcer for
  obedience and compliance 
 the 20th century french philosopher michel foucault realized that that model could be used not just for prisons but for every institution that seeks to control human behavior 
 schools hospitals factories  workplaces and what he said was that this mindset this framework discovered by
  the key means of societal control for modern western societies which no longer need the overt weapons of tyranny punishing or imprisoning or killing 
  dissidents or legally compelling loyalty to a particular party because mass surveillance creates
 than brute force could ever be 
 the most iconic work of literature about surveillance and privacy is the george orwell novel one thousand nine hundred and eighty four which we all learn in school and therefore it 's almost become a cliche 
  in fact whenever you bring it up in a debate about surveillance people instantaneously dismiss it as inapplicable and what they say is
  moment and that has nothing to do with the surveillance state that we face 
 that is an actual fundamental misapprehension of the warnings that orwell issued in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four the warning that he was issuing was about a surveillance state not that monitored everybody 
  at all times but where people were aware that they could be monitored at any given moment here is how orwell 's narrator winston smith described the surveillance system that they faced
 there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment he went on to say at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to you had 
  to live  did live from habit that became instinct in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard and except in darkness every movement scrutinized
  similarly posit that there 's an invisible all knowing authority who because of its omniscience  always watches whatever you 're doing which means you never have a private moment the ultimate enforcer for obedience to its dictates 
 what all of these seemingly disparate works recognize the conclusion that
  is that a society in which people can be monitored at all times is a society that breeds conformity and obedience and submission which is why every tyrant the most overt to the most subtle craves that system  
 conversely  even more importantly 
 it is a realm of privacy  the ability to go somewhere where we can think and reason and interact and speak without the judgmental eyes of others being cast
  upon us 
 in which creativity and exploration and dissent exclusively reside and that is the reason why when we allow a society 
 to exist in which we 're subject to constant monitoring we allow the essence of human freedom
 something wrong have things to hide and therefore reasons to care about privacy is that it entrenches two very destructive messages two destructive lessons 
 the first of which is that the only people who care about privacy the only people who will seek out privacy are by definition bad people 
  the most important of which is that when you say somebody who is doing bad things you probably mean things like plotting a terrorist attack or engaging in violent criminality 
 a much narrower conception of what people who wield power mean when they say doing bad things for them doing bad things typically means doing something that poses meaningful challenges to the exercise of our own power
 the other really destructive and i think even more insidious lesson that comes from accepting this mindset
 is there 's an implicit bargain
 that people who accept this mindset have accepted and that bargain is this if you 're willing to render yourself sufficiently harmless sufficiently unthreatening to those who wield political power  then and only then
  you be free of the dangers of surveillance it 's only those who are dissidents who challenge power who have something to worry about 
 there are all kinds of reasons why we should want to avoid that lesson as well  you may be a person who right now  doesn 't want to engage in that behavior but at some point in the future you might 
 even if you 're somebody
  you never want to the fact that there are other people who are willing to and able to resist and be adversarial to those in power dissidents and journalists and activists and a whole 
  range of others is something that brings us all collective good that we should want to preserve 
  but how it treats its dissidents and those who resist orthodoxy  
 but the most important reason is that a system of mass surveillance suppresses our own freedom in all sorts of ways it renders off limits all kinds of behavioral choices without our even knowing that it 's happened  
 the renowned socialist activist rosa luxemburg once said he who does not move
 does not notice his chains we can try and render the
  chains of mass surveillance invisible or undetectable but the constraints that it imposes on us do not become any less potent  thank you very much
  thank you the case is rather convincing i have to say but i want to bring you back to
 the last sixteen months and to edward snowden for a few questions if you don 't mind the first one is is personal to you we have all read about
 the arrest of your partner david miranda in london
  other difficulties but i assume that
 in terms of personal engagement and risk that the pressure on you is not that easy to take on the biggest sovereign
 organizations in the world tell us a little bit about that glenn greenwald 
 you know i think one of the things that happens is that people 's courage in this regard gets contagious
  and so although i and the other journalists with whom i was working were certainly aware of the risk the united states continues to be the most powerful country in the world and doesn 't appreciate it when you disclose
  thousands of their secrets on the internet at will seeing somebody who is a 
 ordinary person who grew up in a very ordinary environment exercise the degree of principled courage that edward snowden risked knowing that he was going to go to prison for the rest of his life 
 or that his life would unravel inspired me and inspired other journalists and inspired i think people around the world including future whistleblowers to
  that they can engage in that kind of behavior as well bg i 'm curious about your relationship with ed snowden because
 you have spoken with him a lot and you certainly continue doing so but in your book you never call him edward  nor ed you say snowden how come gg you know 
 i 'm sure that 's something for a team of psychologists to
  i don 't really know  the reason i think that one of the important
 objectives that he actually had one of his i think most important tactics was that he knew that one of the ways to distract attention from the substance of the revelations would be to try and personalize the focus on him and for that reason he stayed out of the media
 he tried not to ever have his personal life subject to examination and so i think calling him snowden
 is a way of just identifying him
  as this important historical actor rather than trying to personalize him in a way that might distract attention from the substance moderator so his revelations your analysis the work of other journalists 
 have really
 developed the debate and many governments for example have reacted including in brazil with projects and programs to reshape a little bit the design of the internet etc
  lot of things going on in that sense  
 but i 'm wondering for you personally what is the endgame at what point will you think  well actually we 've succeeded in moving the dial gg 
 well i mean  the endgame for me as a journalist is very simple which is to make sure that every single document that 's newsworthy and that ought to be disclosed ends up being disclosed and that secrets that should never have been kept in the first place end up uncovered to
  that 's the essence of journalism and that 's what i 'm committed to doing as somebody who finds mass surveillance odious for all the reasons i just talked about and a lot more
  i mean i look at this as work that will never end until governments around the world are no longer able to subject entire populations to monitoring and surveillance unless they convince some 
 court or some entity that the person they 've targeted has actually done something wrong to me that 's the way that privacy
  so snowden is very as we 've seen at ted is very articulate in presenting and portraying himself as a defender of
 democratic values and democratic principles but then many people really find it difficult to believe that
 those are his only motivations they find it difficult to believe that there was no money involved that he didn 't sell some of those secrets even to china and to and to russia  
 which are clearly not
  many people in the room are wondering the same the same question 
 do you consider it possible there is that part of snowden we 've not seen yet gg no i consider that absurd and idiotic 
 if you wanted to and
 i know you 're just playing devil 's advocate  but
 if you wanted to sell secrets to another country which he could have done and become extremely rich doing so the last thing you would do is take those secrets
  and give them to journalists and ask journalists to publish them because it makes those secrets worthless people who want to enrich themselves do it secretly by selling secrets to the government but i think there 's one important point worth making which is 
 that accusation comes from people in the u s government from people in the media who are loyalists to these various governments and i think a lot of times when people make accusations like that
  about other people oh he can 't really be doing this for principled reasons he must have some corrupt nefarious reason they 're saying a lot more about themselves than they are the target of their accusations because those
 people the ones who make that accusation  they themselves never act for any reason other than corrupt reasons so they assume that everybody else is plagued by the same disease of soullessness as they are
