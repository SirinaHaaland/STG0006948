  is the next universal language 
 in the seventies  it was punk music that drove the whole generation in the eighties it was probably money  
 but for my generation of people software is the interface to our imagination and our world
 and that means that we need a radically radically more diverse set of people to build those products to not see computers as mechanical 
  and lonely and boring and magic to see them as things that they can tinker and turn around and twist and so forth 
 mad teenage crush on an older man 
 and the older man in question just happened to be the then vice president of the united states mr al gore  
 and i did what every single teenage girl would want to do i wanted to somehow express all of this love so i built him a website it 's over here 
 and in two thousand and
  there was no tumblr there was no facebook there was no pinterest so i needed to learn to code in order to express all of this longing and loving  
 and that is how programming started for me  it started as a means of 
 just like when i was smaller i would use crayons and legos  and when i was older i would use guitar lessons and and theater plays  
 but then there were other things to
  irregular verbs and coming up with  make believe worlds and and bertrand russell and his philosophy  
 and i started to be one of those people who felt that computers are boring and technical and lonely 
 here 's what i think today little girls don 't know that they are not supposed to like computers little girls are amazing
  they don 't know that they are not supposed to like computers  
 it 's the parents who do it
 's us parents who feel like computer science is this esoteric  weird science discipline that only belongs
 to the mystery makers that it 's almost as far removed from everyday life
  nuclear physics 
 and they are partly right about that 
 there 's a lot of syntax and controls and data structures and algorithms and practices  protocols and paradigms in programming and we as a 
  made computers smaller and smaller we 've built layers and layers of abstraction on top of each other between the man and the machine to the point that we no
  have any idea how computers work or how to talk to them
  and we do teach our kids how the human body works we teach them how the combustion engine functions and we even tell them that if you want to really be an astronaut you can become one 
 but when the kid comes to us and asks so what is a bubble sort algorithm or
  how does the computer know what happens when i press ' play ' how does it know which video to show or linda is internet a place 
 we adults we grow oddly silent 
 it 's magic some of us say it 's too complicated the others say  
 well it 's neither  it 's not magic and it 's not complicated  it all just happened really really really fast 
 computer scientists built these amazing beautiful machines but they made them
  very very foreign to us and also the language we speak to the computers so that we don 't know how to speak to the computers anymore without our fancy user interfaces  
 and that 's why no one recognized that when i was conjugating french irregular verbs i was actually practicing my pattern recognition skills  
 and when i was excited about knitting i actually was following a sequence of symbolic commands that included loops inside of them  and that
  bertrand russell 's lifelong quest to find an exact language between english and mathematics found its home inside of a computer  
 i was a programmer but no one knew it 
 the kids of today they tap  swipe and pinch their way through the world  but unless we give them tools to build with computers we are raising only consumers instead of creators 
 this whole quest
  led me to this little girl her name is ruby she is six years old she is completely fearless imaginative and a little bit bossy 
 and every time i would run into a problem in in trying to teach myself programming like what is object oriented design or what is garbage collection 
 i would try to imagine how a six year old little girl would explain
  and i wrote a book about her and i illustrated it and the things ruby taught me go like this ruby taught me that you 're not supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed 
 and even the biggest of the problems are a group of tiny problems stuck together  and ruby also introduced me to her friends 
 the colorful side of the internet culture she has friends like the snow leopard who is beautiful but doesn 't want to play with the
  and she has friends like the green robots that are really friendly but super messy 
 and she has friends like linux the penguin who 's really ruthlessly efficient but somewhat hard to understand and idealistic foxes and so on 
 in ruby 's world you learn technology through play 
 and for instance computers are really good at repeating stuff so the way ruby would teach loops goes like this this is
  you learn counter loops by repeating that four times and you learn while loops by repeating that sequence while i 'm standing on one leg  and you learn until loops by repeating that sequence until mom gets really mad 
 and most of all you learn that there are no ready answers 
 when coming up with the curriculum for ruby 's world i needed to really ask the kids how they see the world
 and what kind of questions they have and i would organize play testing sessions  
 i would start by showing the kids these four pictures  
 i would show them a picture of a car a grocery store a dog and a toilet and i would ask which one of these do you think is a computer 
 and the kids would be very conservative and go 
  none of these is a computer  i know what a computer is it 's that glowing box in front of which mom or dad spends way too much time 
 but then we would talk and we would discover that actually a car is a computer it has a navigation system inside of it 
 and a dog a dog might not be a computer but it has a collar and the collar might have a computer inside of it 
 and grocery stores they have so many different kinds
  like the cashier system and the burglar alarms and kids you know what in japan toilets are computers and there 's even hackers who hack them 
 and we go further and i give them these little stickers with an on off button on them and i tell the kids
 today you have this magic ability to make anything in this room into a computer 
 and again the kids go sounds really hard i don 't know the right answer for this but i tell them don 't worry your parents
  don 't know the right answer either  they 've just started to hear about this thing called the internet of things 
 but you kids you are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world where everything is a computer 
 and then i had this little girl who came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said this bicycle lamp if it were a computer
  that 's a really good idea what else could it do and she thinks and she thinks and she goes 
 if this bicycle lamp were a computer we could go on a biking trip with my father and we would sleep in a tent
 and this biking lamp could also be a movie projector 
 and that 's the moment i 'm looking for the moment when the kid realizes that the world is definitely not ready yet that a really awesome way of making the world more
  ready is by building technology and that each one of us can be a part of that change 
 final story we also built a computer  and we got to know
 the bossy cpu and the
 helpful ram and rom that help it remember things and
 after we 've assembled our computer together  we also design an application for it and my favorite story is this little boy  he 's six years old and
  thing in the world is to be an astronaut 
 and the boy  he has these huge headphones on and he 's completely immersed in his tiny paper computer because you see he 's built his own intergalactic planetary navigation application 
 and his father the lone astronaut in the martian orbit is on the other side of the room and the boy 's important mission is to bring the father safely back to earth
 and these kids are going to have a profoundly different view of the world and the way we build it with technology  
 finally the more approachable the more inclusive  
 and the more diverse we make the world of technology the more colorful and better the world will look like 
 so imagine
  a world where the stories we tell about how things get made don 't only include the 
  silicon valley boys but also kenyan schoolgirls and norwegian librarians  
 imagine a world where the little ada lovelaces of tomorrow who live in a permanent reality of 1s and 0s they grow up to be very
  and brave about technology they embrace the powers and
 the opportunities and the limitations of the world a world of technology that is
 wonderful  whimsical and a tiny bit weird 
 when i was a girl  i wanted to be a storyteller  
 i loved make believe worlds and my favorite thing to do was to wake up in the mornings in moominvalley 
 in the afternoons i would roam around the
  would go to sleep in narnia 
 and programming turned out to be the perfect profession for me  
 i still create worlds instead of stories  i do them with code 
 programming gives me this amazing power to build my whole little universe with its own rules and paradigms and practices  
 create something out of nothing with the pure power of logic  thank you
