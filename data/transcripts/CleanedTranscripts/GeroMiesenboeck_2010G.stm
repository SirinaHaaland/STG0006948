  a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the dragonball z
  if you look very carefully you see that his skull has been replaced with a transparent plexiglas dome
 so that the workings of his brain can be observed and also controlled with light that 's exactly what i do
 optical mind control but in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination
  my motives are not sinister i control the brain in order to understand how it works 
 now wait a minute you may say how can you go straight to controlling the brain
 without understanding it first isn 't that putting the cart before the horse 
 many neuroscientists agree with this view and think that understanding will come from more detailed
  if we could record the activity of our neurons  we would understand the brain 
 but think for a moment what that means 
 even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times  we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns 
 and that 's so difficult chances are we 'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them 
 take a look at what brain activity might look like
 in this simulation each black dot is one nerve cell 
 the dot is visible whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse  there 's ten thousand neurons here 
 so you 're looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach 
 your brains are about one hundred million times more complicated
  in a pattern like this is you 
 your perceptions your emotions your memories your plans for the future  
 but we don 't know where  since we don 't know how to read the pattern we don 't understand the code used by the brain 
 to make progress  we need to break the code but how
  will tell you
 that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean  it 's essential to be able to play with them to rearrange them at will 
 so in this situation too to decode the information contained in patterns like this 
 watching alone won 't do  we need to rearrange the pattern  
 in other words  instead of
  the activity of neurons  we need to control it 
 it 's not essential that we can control the activity of all neurons in the brain 
 just some the more targeted our interventions the better and i 'll show you in a moment how we can achieve the necessary precision  and since i 'm realistic rather than grandiose 
 i don 't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries 
 i 'm by no means the first person to realize
 how powerful a tool intervention is the history of attempts to tinker with the function of the nervous system is long and illustrious  
 it dates back at least two hundred years to galvani 's famous experiments in the late 18th century and beyond
  sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude it
 's hard to do in animals that run around and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously  
 so around the turn of the last century i started to think wouldn 't it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn
  so instead of inserting a wire into one spot of the brain re engineer the brain itself
 so that some of its neural elements become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals such as a flash of light 
 such an approach would literally in a flash of light overcome many of the obstacles to discovery first it 's clearly
  wireless form of communication 
 and second just as in a radio broadcast you can communicate with many receivers at once you don 't need to know where these receivers are 
 and it doesn 't matter if these receivers move just think of the stereo in your car  
 it gets even better for it turns out that we can fabricate
 the receivers out of materials that are encoded
  each nerve cell with the right genetic makeup
 will spontaneously produce a receiver that allows us to control its function i hope you 'll appreciate
 the beautiful simplicity of this concept there 's no high tech gizmos here just biology
 revealed through biology now let 's take a look at these miraculous
  in the nervous system 
 but these pores here are special  
 they are coupled to light receptors similar to the ones in your eyes 
 whenever a flash of light hits the receptor the pore opens an electrical current is switched on and the neuron fires electrical impulses because the
 light activated pore is encoded in dna  we can achieve incredible precision 
 this is because although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes 
 different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells 
 you can exploit this to make sure that only some neurons contain our light activated pore and others don 't so in this cartoon  the bluish white cell in the
 upper left corner does not respond to light because it lacks the light activated pore 
 the approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain 
 in this example  each electrical impulse each deflection on the trace is caused by a brief pulse of light 
 and the approach of course also works
 in moving behaving animals
  this is the first ever such experiment sort of the optical equivalent of galvani 's 
 it was done six or seven years ago by my then graduate student susana lima  susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left
 so that just two out of the two hundred thousand cells in its brain expressed the light activated pore 
 you 're familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustrate you when you try to swat
  the fly  they trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air and fly away whenever you move your hand in position 
 and you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect the animal jumps it spreads its wings it vibrates them but it can 't actually take off because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates 
 now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see
  susana did
 a simple but brutally effective experiment she cut the heads off of her flies 
 these headless bodies can live for about a day  but they don 't do much
 they just stand around and and groom excessively so it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity
  anyway as you 'll see in a moment  susana was able to turn on the flight motor of what 's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies
 and get some of the headless bodies to actually take off and fly away 
 they didn 't get very
  since we took these first steps the field of optogenetics has exploded  and there are now hundreds of labs using these approaches 
 and we 've come a long way since galvani 's and susana 's first successes
 in making animals twitch or jump we can now actually interfere with their psychology in rather profound ways as i 'll show you in my last example
  which is directed at a familiar question life is a string of choices
 creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next we cope with this pressure
 by having brains  and within our brains decision making centers that i 've called here the actor 
 the actor implements a policy that takes into account
 the state of the environment and the context in which we operate our actions change the environment
  or context and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop  now to put some neurobiological meat
 on this abstract model we constructed a simple one dimensional world for our favorite subject  fruit flies 
 each chamber in these two vertical stacks contains one fly the left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors and a security
  camera watches as the flies pace up and down between them 
 here 's some such cctv footage whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odor streams meet  it has to make a decision 
 it has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor or whether to cross the midline and try something
  these decisions are clearly a reflection of the actor 's policy  now
 for an intelligent being like our fly this policy is not written in stone
 but rather changes as the animal learns from experience we can incorporate such an element of adaptive intelligence into our model
 by assuming that the fly 's brain contains not only an actor  but a different group of cells
  running commentary on the actor 's choices you can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain 's equivalent of the catholic church
  is a key ingredient in what makes us intelligent  
 so we set out to identify the cells in the fly 's brain that played the role of the critic and
 the logic of our experiment was simple we thought if we could use our optical remote control
 to activate the cells of the critic  we should be able artificially to nag the actor into changing its policy
  the fly should learn from mistakes
 that it thought it had made but in reality it had not made  so we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered
 with cells that were light addressable and then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices  
 and whenever they made one of the two choices  chose one odor in this case the blue one over the orange one
  we switched on the lights
  if the critic was among the optically activated cells  
 the result of this intervention should be a change in policy the fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced odor 
 here 's what happened
 in two instances we 're comparing two strains of flies each
  of them having about one hundred light addressable cells in their brains shown here in green on the left and on the right 
 what 's common among these groups of cells is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine  
 but the identities of the individual 
  neurons are clearly largely different on the left and on the right optically activating these hundred or so cells into two strains of flies
 has dramatically different consequences if you look first at the
  behavior of the fly on the right you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odors meet  it marches straight through 
 as it did before its behavior is completely unchanged but the behavior of the fly on the left is very different 
 whenever it comes up to the midpoint it pauses it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment and then it
  turns around this means that the policy that the actor implements now includes an instruction to avoid the odor that 's in the right half of the chamber 
 this means that the critic must have spoken in that animal and that the critic must be contained among the 
  neurons on the left but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right through many such experiments
  to narrow down the identity of the critic
 to just twelve cells 
 these twelve cells as shown here in green send
 the output to a brain structure called the mushroom body which is shown here in gray 
 we know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the critic 's commentary is the actor so this anatomy suggests that the mushroom bodies have
  to do with action choice  based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies this makes perfect sense in fact  it makes so much sense
 that we can construct an electronic toy circuit
 that simulates the behavior of the fly  in this electronic toy circuit the mushroom body neurons are symbolized
 by the vertical bank of blue leds in the center of the board
 these led 's are wired to sensors that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air 
 each odor activates a different combination of sensors which in turn activates a different odor detector in the mushroom body  
 so the pilot in the cockpit of the fly  the actor can tell which odor is present
 simply by looking at which of the blue leds lights up
 what the actor does with this information depends on its policy  which is stored in the strengths of the connection between the odor detectors
 and the motors that power the fly 's evasive actions 
 if the connection is weak the motors will stay off and the fly will continue straight on its course  if the connection is strong the motors will turn on
 and the fly will initiate a turn
  now consider a situation in which
 the motors stay off the fly continues on its path
 and it suffers some painful consequence such as getting zapped in a situation like this we would expect the critic to speak up
 and to tell the actor to change its policy  we have created such a situation artificially by turning on the critic with a flash of light
  that caused a strengthening of the connections between the currently active odor detector
 and the motors so the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors
 and to trigger
 an evasive maneuver 
 i don 't know about you but i
 find it exhilarating to see how vague psychological notions evaporate
 and give rise to a physical mechanistic understanding of the mind even if it 's the mind of the fly  this is one piece of good news  
 the other piece of good news for a scientist at least is that much remains to be discovered in the experiments i told you
  about we have lifted the identity of the critic  but we still have no idea how the critic does its job come to think of it knowing when you 're wrong
 without a teacher or your mother telling you is a very hard problem there are some ideas in computer science and in artificial intelligence
 as to how this might be done
  but we still haven 't solved a single example
 of how
 intelligent behavior springs from the physical interactions in living matter i think we 'll get there in the not too distant future  thank you
