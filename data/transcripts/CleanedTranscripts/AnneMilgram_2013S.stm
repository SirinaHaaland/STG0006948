  i became the attorney general of the state of new jersey  
 before that i 'd been a criminal prosecutor first in the manhattan district attorney 's office  and then at the united states department of justice 
 but when i became the attorney general two things happened that changed the way i see criminal
 the first is that i asked what i thought were really basic questions  
 i wanted to understand who we were arresting who we were charging and who we were putting in our nation 's jails and prisons  
 i also wanted to understand if we were making decisions in a way that made us safer  
 and i couldn 't get this
  it turned out that most big criminal justice agencies like my own didn 't track the things that matter 
 so after about a month of being incredibly frustrated i walked down into a conference room that was filled with detectives
 and stacks and stacks of case files 
 and the detectives were sitting there with yellow legal pads taking notes  they were trying to get the information i was looking for by going through case by case for the past five years
  as you can imagine when we finally got the results  they weren 't good  
 it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office in trenton 
 the second thing that happened is that i spent the day in the camden new jersey police department now at that time camden new jersey was the most dangerous city in america
  i ran the camden police department because of that 
 i spent the day in the police department  and i was taken into a room with senior police officials all of whom were working hard and trying very hard to reduce crime in camden  
 and what i saw in that room as we talked about how to reduce crime 
 were a series of officers with a lot of little yellow sticky notes  and they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on a board  
 and one of them said we had a robbery two weeks ago we have no suspects
 and another said we had a shooting in this neighborhood last week we have no suspects 
 we weren 't using data driven policing we were essentially trying to fight crime with yellow post it notes  
 now both of these things made me realize fundamentally that we were failing  
 we didn 't even know who was in our criminal justice system we didn 't have any data about the things that mattered and we
  didn 't share data or use analytics or tools to help us make better decisions and to reduce crime 
 and for the first time i started to think about how we made decisions 
 when i was an assistant d a and when i was a federal prosecutor  i looked at the cases in front of me  and i generally made decisions based on my instinct and my experience when
 became attorney general i could look at the system as a whole  and what surprised me is that i found that that was exactly how we were doing it across the entire system
 in police departments in prosecutors 's offices in courts and in jails 
 and what i learned very quickly is that we weren 't doing a good job  
 so i wanted to do things differently  
 i wanted to introduce data and analytics and rigorous statistical analysis into our work in short i wanted to moneyball criminal justice
 now moneyball as many of you know is what the oakland a 's did where they used smart data and statistics to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games  
 and they went from a system that was based on baseball scouts who used to go out and watch players and use their instinct and experience the scouts ' instincts and experience to pick players from one to use 
  smart data and rigorous statistical analysis to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games
 it worked for the oakland a 's and it worked in the state of new jersey  
 we took camden off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in america 
 we reduced murders there by forty one percent  which actually means thirty seven lives were saved  
 and we reduced all crime in the city by twenty six percent  
 we also changed the way we did criminal prosecutions  so we went from doing low level drug crimes that were outside our
  building to doing cases of statewide importance 
 on things like reducing violence with the most violent offenders  prosecuting street gangs  gun and drug trafficking  and political corruption  
 and all of this matters greatly  
 because public safety to me is the most important function of government 
 if we 're not safe we can 't be educated we can 't be healthy  we can 't do any of the other things we want to do in our lives
  and we live in a country today where we face serious criminal justice problems  we have twelve million arrests every single year 
 the vast majority of those arrests are for low level crimes like misdemeanors  seventy to eighty percent  
 less than five percent of all arrests are for violent crime 
 yet we spend
  that 's b for billion dollars a year on state and local corrections costs  
 right now today we have two point three million people in our jails and prisons  
 and we face unbelievable public safety challenges because we have a situation in which two thirds of the people in our jails are there waiting for trial  they haven 't yet been convicted of a crime 
 they 're just waiting for their day in court
  percent of people come back 
 our recidivism rate is amongst the highest in the world  
 almost seven in ten people who are released from prison will be rearrested in a constant cycle of crime and incarceration  
 so when i started my job at the arnold foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions  and i came back to thinking about how we had used data and analytics to transform the way we did criminal justice in new jersey  
 and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today
  i feel the exact same way that i did about the state of new jersey when i started there which is that we absolutely have to do better  and i know that we can do better  
 so i decided to focus on using data and analytics
 to help make the most critical decision in public safety and that decision is the determination of whether when
  whether they pose a risk to public safety and should be detained or whether they don 't pose a risk to public safety and should be released  
 everything that happens in criminal cases comes out of this one decision it impacts everything  
 it impacts sentencing it impacts whether someone gets drug treatment  it impacts crime and violence  
 and when i talk to judges around the united states which i do all the time now  they all say the same thing which is that we put dangerous people in jail  and we let
 nonviolent people out 
 they mean it and they believe it 
 but when you start to look at the data which by the way the judges don 't have when we start to look at the data what we find time and time again is that this isn 't the case 
 we find low risk offenders which makes up fifty percent of our entire criminal justice population
  we find that they 're in jail take leslie chew who was a texas man who stole four blankets on a cold winter night 
 he was arrested  and he was kept in jail on three thousand five hundred dollars bail an amount that he could not afford to pay  
 and he stayed in jail for eight months until his case came up for trial at a cost to taxpayers of more than nine thousand dollars and at the other
  doing an equally terrible job  the people who we find are the 
 offenders  the people who we think have the highest likelihood of committing a new crime if they 're released  we see nationally that fifty percent of those people are being released  
 the reason for this is the way we make decisions judges have the best intentions when they make these decisions about risk but they 're making them subjectively 
  they 're like the baseball scouts twenty years ago who were using their instinct and their experience to try to decide what risk someone poses  
 they 're being subjective  and we know what happens with subjective decision making  which is that we are often wrong 
 what we need in this space are strong data and analytics 
 what i decided to look for was a strong data and analytic risk assessment tool something that would let judges actually understand with a scientific and objective way what the risk was that was posed
  by someone in front of them i looked all over the country and i found that between five and ten percent of all u s jurisdictions actually use any type of risk assessment tool  
 and when i looked at these tools i quickly realized why  they were unbelievably expensive to administer  they were 
 they were limited to the local jurisdiction in which they 'd been
  so basically they couldn 't be scaled or transferred to other places  
 so i went out and built a phenomenal team of data scientists and researchers and statisticians to build a universal risk assessment tool  
 so that every single judge in the united states of america can have an objective scientific measure of risk 
 in the tool that we 've built  what we did was we collected one point five million cases from all around the united states from cities from counties from every single state in the country the federal
  districts  and with those one point five million cases which is the largest data set on pretrial in the united states today we were able to basically find that there were 
  risk factors that we could look at to try to figure out what mattered most  
 and we found that there were nine specific things that mattered all across the country and that were the most highly predictive of risk and so we built a universal risk assessment
  tool  
 and it looks like this 
 as you 'll see we put some information in but most of it is incredibly simple it 's easy to use it focuses on things like the defendant 's prior convictions whether they 've been sentenced 
  to incarceration  whether they 've engaged in violence before whether they 've even failed to come back to court  
  for the first time and i think this is incredibly important  we can predict whether someone will commit an act of violence if they 're released  and that 's the single most important thing that judges say when you talk to them  
 and third we can predict whether someone will come back to court  
 and every single judge in the united states of america can use it because it 's been created on a universal data set
  what judges see if they run the risk assessment tool is this it 's a dashboard 
 at the top you see the new criminal activity score  six of course being the highest 
 and then in the middle you see elevated risk of violence what that says is that this person is someone who has an elevated risk of violence that the judge should look twice at 
 and then towards the bottom you see the failure to appear score  which again is the likelihood that someone will come back to court  
 now i want to say something really important it 's not that i think we
  should be eliminating the judge 's instinct and experience from this process  i don 't 
 i actually believe the problem that we see and the reason that we have these incredible system errors where we 're incarcerating low level nonviolent people and we 're releasing high risk dangerous people is that we don 't have an objective measure of risk  
 but what i believe should happen is that we should take that data driven risk assessment
 and combine
  that with the judge 's instinct and experience to lead us to better decision making 
 the tool went statewide in kentucky on july one and we 're about to go up in a number of other u s jurisdictions 
 our goal quite simply is that every single judge in the united states will use a data driven risk tool within the next five years we
 're now working on risk tools for prosecutors and for police officers as well to try to take a system
  runs today in america the same way it did fifty years ago based on instinct and experience  and make it into one that runs on data and analytics 
 now the great news about all this  and we have a ton of work left to do  and we have a lot of culture to change but the great news about all of it is that we know it works  
 it 's why google is google  and it 's why all these baseball teams use moneyball to win games
 the great news for us as well is that it 's the way that we can transform the american criminal justice system 
 it 's how we can make our streets safer  we can reduce our prison costs  and we can make our system much fairer and more just 
 some people call it data science  i call it moneyballing criminal justice  thank you
