  my job at twitter is to ensure user trust  protect user rights and keep users safe  both from each other and at times from themselves 
 let 's talk about what scale looks like at twitter  
 back in january
  two thousand and nine we saw more than two million new tweets each day on the platform 
 january two thousand and fourteen 
 more than five hundred million we were seeing two million tweets in less than six minutes that 's a
  vast majority of activity on twitter
 puts no one in harm 's way there 's no risk involved my job is to root out and prevent activity that might 
 sounds straightforward right you might even think it 'd be easy given that i just said the vast majority of activity on twitter puts no one in harm 's way 
 why spend so much time searching for potential
  calamities in innocuous activities 
 given the scale that twitter is at
 a one in a million chance happens five hundred times a day it
 's the same for other companies dealing at this sort of scale for us  edge cases those
 rare situations that are unlikely to occur are more like norms
 ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone there 's no threat involved maybe people are documenting travel landmarks like australia 
  's heart reef or tweeting about a concert they 're attending or sharing pictures of cute baby animals  
  nine nine nine percent that tiny percentage of tweets remaining works out to roughly
 one hundred and fifty thousand per month 
 the sheer scale of what we 're dealing with makes for a challenge you know what else makes my role particularly challenging 
 people do weird
  and i have to figure out what they 're doing why and whether or not there 's risk involved often without much in terms of context or background 
 i 'm going to show you some examples that i 've run into during my time at twitter these are all real examples of situations that at first seemed cut and dried but the truth of the matter was something altogether different 
 the details
  if you saw a tweet that only said this 
 you might think to yourself that looks like abuse after all why would you want to receive the message yo bitch 
 now  i try to stay relatively hip
 to the latest trends and memes
  i knew that yo bitch was also often a common greeting between friends as well as being a popular breaking bad reference 
 i will admit that i did not expect to encounter a fourth use case  
 it turns out it is also used on twitter when people are role playing
  and in fact in that case it 's not only not abusive it 's technically just an accurate greeting 
 so okay  determining whether or not something is abusive without context  definitely hard  
 let 's look at spam  
 here 's an example of an account engaged in classic spammer behavior  sending the exact same message to thousands
  people while this is a mockup i put together using my account we see accounts doing this all the time 
 seems pretty straightforward  we should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior  
 turns out there 's some exceptions to that rule  
 turns out that that message could also be a notification you signed up for that the international space station is passing overhead because you
  wanted to go outside and see if you could see it you 're not going to get that chance if we mistakenly suspend the account thinking it 's spam 
 okay  let 's make the stakes higher  
 back to my account  
 again exhibiting classic behavior  this time it 's sending the same message and link this is often indicative of something called phishing  somebody trying to steal another person 's
  account information by directing them to another website 
 that 's pretty clearly not a good thing  we want to and do suspend accounts engaging in that kind of behavior  
 so why are the stakes higher for this  
 well this could also be a bystander at a rally who managed to record a video
  of a police officer beating a non violent protester who 's trying to let the world know what 's happening  
 we don 't want to gamble on potentially silencing that crucial speech by classifying it as spam and suspending it 
 that means we evaluate hundreds of parameters when looking at account behaviors and even then we can still get it wrong and have to reevaluate  
 now  given the sorts of challenges i 'm up
  it 's crucial that i not only predict but also design protections for the unexpected 
 and that 's not just an issue for me or for twitter it 's an issue for you  it 's an issue for anybody who 's building or creating something that you think is going to be amazing and will let people do awesome things  
 so what do i do 
 i pause and i think 
 how could all of this
 go horribly wrong
 i visualize
 catastrophe  
 and that 's hard  there 's a sort of inherent cognitive dissonance in doing that like when you 're writing your wedding vows at the same time as your prenuptial agreement 
 but you still have to do it particularly if you 're marrying five hundred million tweets per day what do i mean by
  visualize catastrophe 
 i try to think of how something as benign and innocuous as a picture of a cat could lead to death and what to do to prevent that 
 which happens to be my next example this is my cat  eli  
 we wanted to give users the ability to add photos to their
  a picture is worth a thousand words you only get one hundred and forty characters you add a photo to your tweet look at how much more content you 've got now  
 there 's all sorts of great things you can do by adding a photo to a tweet 
 my job isn 't to think of those it 's to think of what could go wrong 
 how could this picture
 lead to my death  
 well  here 's one possibility
  there 's more in that picture than just a cat  
 there 's geodata 
 when you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera  there 's a lot of additional information saved along in that image in fact this image also contains the equivalent of this 
 more specifically  this 
 sure it 's not likely that someone 's going to try to track me down and do me harm based upon image data associated with a picture i took of my cat
  but i start by assuming the worst
  will happen that 's why when we launched photos on twitter we made the decision to strip that 
 if i start by assuming the worst and work 
  backwards i can make sure that the protections we build work for both expected and unexpected use cases  given that i spend my days
 and nights imagining the worst that could happen  it wouldn 't be surprising if my worldview was gloomy 
 it 's not the vast majority of interactions i see
 and i see a lot believe me
 are positive people reaching out to help or to connect or share information with each other it 's just
  that for those of us dealing with scale for those of us tasked with keeping people safe  
 we have to assume the worst will happen  because for us a one in a million chance
 is pretty good odds thank you
