  to understand the world that live in we tell stories  
 and while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it 
 all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online 
 but video
 has been left out 
 it arrived on the web in a small box and there it has remained completely disconnected from the data and the content all around it 
 in fact in over a decade on the web the only thing that has changed about video is the size of the box and the quality of the picture 
 popcorn changes all of that it 's an online tool that allows anyone to combine
  video with content pulled live directly from the web  
 videos created with popcorn behave like the web itself  dynamic full of links and completely remixable  
 and finally allowed to break free from the frame i
 want to give you a demo of a prototype that we 're working on that we 'll launch later this fall
  be completely free  and it will work in any browser  
 so every popcorn production begins with the video  and so i 've made a short 20 second clip using a newscaster template
 that we use in workshops  so let 's watch it we 'll go back and i 'll show you how we made it  
 hi  and welcome to my newscast i 've added my location with a google map
 and it 's live  so try moving it around you can add pop ups with live links and custom icons
  pull in content from any web service like flickr  or add articles and blog posts with links out to the full content 
 so let 's go back and i 'll show you what you saw there was a lot there 
 so this is the timeline and if you 've ever edited video you 're familiar with this but instead of clips in the timeline what you 're looking at is web events pulled into the video 
 now in this popcorn production we 've got
  the title card we 've got a google map that shows up picture in picture then popcorn lets it push outside the frame and take over the whole screen 
 there are two pop ups bringing you some other information  and a final article
 with a link out to the original article let 's go to this google map and i 'll show you how you can edit it all you do 
  i 've set it to toronto because that 's where i 'm from let 's set it to something else  
 popcorn immediately goes out onto the web  talks to google grabs the map  and puts it in the display 
 and it 's exactly the same for the people who watch your production  and it 's live it 's not an image so you click on it you zoom in right down to street view if you want to 
 now in the video i mentioned adding a live feed  which we can do right now so let 's add
 a live feed from flickr  go over to the right hand side  grab flickr from the list of options  drag it into the timeline  
 and put it where you 'd like it to go  
 and it immediately goes out to flickr and starts pulling in images based on the tags now my developers really like ponies  and so they 've set that as the default tag 
 let 's try something else
 maybe something a bit more relevant to today
  today 
 now here are live images being pulled straight from the feed if you come and watch this a week from now this will be completely different dynamic just like the web  and just like the web 
  everything is sourced so click your link and you go straight to flickr and see the source image  
  's completely remixable it also means there 's no proprietary software all you need is a web browser
