  good morning 
 when i was a little boy  i had an experience that changed my life and is in fact why i 'm here today  
 that one moment one moment profoundly affected how i think about art design and engineering
 as background i was fortunate enough to grow up in a family of loving and talented artists in one of the world 's great cities 
 my dad john ferren who died when i was fifteen 
 was an artist by both passion and profession as is my mom rae  
 he was one of the new york school abstract expressionists who together with his contemporaries
 invented american modern art and contributed to moving the american zeitgeist towards modernism in the 20th century 
 isn 't it remarkable that after thousands of years of people doing mostly representational art  
 that modern art comparatively speaking is about fifteen minutes old  yet now pervasive 
 as with many other
  important innovations those radical ideas required no new technology just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment plus resiliency in the face of 
  near universal criticism and rejection in our home art was everywhere  it was like oxygen around us and necessary for life 
 as i watched him paint dad taught me that art was not
 about being decorative  but was a different way of communicating ideas and in fact one that could bridge the worlds of knowledge and insight  
 given this rich artistic environment you 'd assume that i would have been compelled to go into the family business  but no  
 i followed the path of most kids who are genetically programmed to make their parents crazy i had no interest in
  becoming an artist certainly not a painter  what i did love was electronics and machines
 taking them apart building new ones and making them work  
 fortunately my family also had engineers in it and with my parents these were my first role models  
 what they all had in common was they worked very very hard my grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal kitchen cabinet
  factory in brooklyn 
 on weekends we would go together to cortlandt street  which was new york city 's radio row 
 there we would explore massive piles of surplus electronics and for a few bucks bring home treasures like norden bombsights and parts from the first
  tube based computers  i found these objects both useful and fascinating  i learned about engineering and how
  things worked not at school but by taking apart and studying these fabulously complex devices  i did this for hours every day  apparently avoiding electrocution 
 life was good  
 however  every summer sadly the machines got left behind while my parents and i traveled overseas to experience history art and design  
 we visited the great
  museums and historic buildings of both europe and the middle east 
 but to encourage my growing interest in science and technology  they would simply drop me off in places like the london science museum where i would wander endlessly for hours by myself
 studying the history of science and technology  then when i was about nine years old we went to rome
  one particularly hot summer day  we visited a  drum shaped building that from the outside was not particularly interesting 
 my dad said it was called the pantheon a temple for all of the gods  it didn 't look all that special from the outside as i said but
 when we walked inside i was immediately struck by three things first of all it was pleasantly cool despite the oppressive heat outside
 it was very dark the only source of light being an big open hole in the roof  dad explained that this wasn 't a big open hole but it was called the oculus an eye to the heavens  
 and there was something about this place  i didn 't know why that just felt special 
 as we walked to the center of the room  i looked up at the heavens through the oculus this was the first church that i 'd been to that provided an
 unrestricted view between god and man  
 but i wondered what about when it rained dad may have called this an oculus but it was in fact a big hole in the roof  
 i looked down and saw floor drains had been cut into the stone floor 
 as i became more accustomed to the dark i was able to make out details of the floor and the surrounding walls no big deal here
  just the same statuary stuff that we 'd seen all over rome 
 in fact it looked like the appian way marble salesman showed up with his sample book showed it to hadrian and hadrian said we 'll take all of it 
 but the ceiling was amazing it looked like a buckminster fuller geodesic dome
  i 'd seen these before and bucky was friends with my dad it was modern high tech impressive a huge 
  clear span which not coincidentally was exactly its height 
 i loved this place  it was really beautiful and unlike anything i 'd ever seen before so i asked my dad when was this built 
 he said about two thousand years ago and i said
  you see i assumed that this was a modern roof that had been put on because the original was destroyed in some  long past war  he said it 's the original roof 
 that moment changed my life and i can remember it as if it were yesterday 
 for the first time i realized people were smart two thousand years ago 
 laughter this had never crossed my mind  i mean
  the pyramids at giza  we visited those the year before  and sure they 're impressive nice enough design but look give me an unlimited budget twenty thousand to forty thousand laborers 
 and about ten to twenty years to cut and drag stone blocks across the countryside  and i 'll build you pyramids too  
  and incidentally  it is still the largest unreinforced concrete dome that 's ever been built 
 to build the pantheon took some miracles  by miracles i mean things that are technically barely possible 
 very high risk and might not be actually accomplishable at this moment in time
  certainly not by you 
 for example here are some of the pantheon 's miracles 
 to make it even structurally possible  they had to invent super strong concrete and to control weight varied the density of the aggregate as they worked their way up the dome 
 for strength and lightness the dome structure used five rings of coffers  each of diminishing size which imparts a dramatic forced perspective to the design
  it was wonderfully cool inside because of its huge thermal mass natural convection of air rising up through the oculus and a venturi effect when wind blows across the top of the building 
 i discovered for the first time that light itself has substance
  the shaft of light beaming through the oculus was both beautiful and palpable and i realized
  for the first time that light could be designed further that of all of the forms of design visual design  
 they were all kind of irrelevant without it because without light you can 't see any of them 
 i also realized that i wasn 't the first person to think that this place was really special 
  and the ravages of time to become what i believe is the longest continuously occupied building in history  
 largely because of that visit i came to understand that contrary to what i was being told in school 
 the worlds of art and design were not in fact incompatible with science and engineering  
 i realized when combined
  you could create things that were amazing that couldn 't be done in either domain alone 
 but in school with few exceptions they were treated as separate worlds and they still are 
 my teachers told me that i had to get serious and focus on one or the other  
 however  urging me to specialize only caused me to really appreciate those polymaths like
  leonardo da vinci  
 benjamin franklin people who did exactly the opposite  and this led me to embrace and want to be in both worlds  
 so then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity like the pantheon actually happen  
 someone themselves  perhaps hadrian needed a brilliant creative vision  
 they also needed the storytelling and leadership
  skills necessary to fund and execute it 
 and a mastery of science and technology with the ability and knowhow to push existing innovations even farther  
 it is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least five miracles the
 problem is no matter how talented rich or smart you are you
 only get one to one and a half miracles  that 's it that 's the quota  then you run out of time money enthusiasm  whatever 
 remember most people can 't even imagine one of these technical miracles and you need at least five to make a pantheon 
 in my experience these rare visionaries who can think across the worlds of
  design and engineering have the ability to notice when others have provided enough of the miracles to bring the goal within reach  
 driven by the clarity of their vision  they summon the courage and determination to deliver the remaining miracles
 and they often take what other people think to be insurmountable obstacles and turn them into features take the oculus of the pantheon 
 by insisting that it be in the design it meant you couldn 't use much
  of the structural technology that had been developed for roman arches  
 however  by instead embracing it and rethinking weight and stress distribution they came up with a design that only works if there 's a big hole in the roof 
 that done you now get the aesthetic and design benefits of
  and that critical direct connection with the heavens not bad 
 these people not only believed that the impossible can be done but that it must be done 
 enough ancient history 
 what are some recent examples of innovations that combine creative design and technological advances in a way so profound that they
 will be remembered a thousand years from now well 
 putting a man on the moon was a good one and returning him safely to earth wasn 't bad either
  talk about one giant leap it 's hard to imagine a more profound moment in human history than when we first left our world to set foot on another  
 so what came after the moon one is tempted to say that today 's pantheon is the internet
  i actually think that 's quite wrong or at least it 's only part of the story 
 the internet isn 't a pantheon  it 's more like the invention of concrete 
 important absolutely necessary to build the pantheon  and enduring  but entirely insufficient by itself  
 however  just as the technology of concrete was critical in realization of the
  new designers will use the technologies of the internet to create novel concepts that will endure the
 smartphone is a perfect example  soon the majority of people on the planet will have one and the idea of connecting everyone to both knowledge and each other will endure  
 so what 's next what imminent advance will be the equivalent of the pantheon  
 thinking about this i rejected many very plausible and dramatic breakthroughs to come  such as curing
  cancer why  because 
  are anchored in designed physical objects ones that inspire by simply seeing and experiencing them and will continue to do so indefinitely 
 it is a different kind of language like art  
 these other vital contributions that extend life and relieve suffering are of course critical and fantastic
  but they 're part of the continuum of our overall knowledge and technology like the internet  
 so what is next  perhaps counterintuitively i 'm guessing it 's a visionary idea from the late 
 that 's been revived every decade since autonomous vehicles now you 're thinking give me a break how can a fancy version of cruise
  control
 be profound 
 much of our world has been designed around roads and transportation these were as essential to the success of the roman empire as the interstate highway system to the prosperity and development of the united states 
 today these roads that interconnect our world are dominated by cars and trucks that have remained largely unchanged
  for one hundred years 
 although perhaps not obvious today  autonomous vehicles will be the key technology that enables us to redesign our cities and by extension civilization  
 here 's why  
 once they become ubiquitous  each year these vehicles will save tens of thousands of lives in the united states alone and
 a million globally 
 automotive energy consumption and air pollution will be cut dramatically  
 much of the road congestion in and out of our cities will disappear 
 they will enable compelling new concepts in how we design cities work and the way we live 
 we will get where we 're going faster
 and society will recapture
  vast amounts of lost productivity now spent sitting in traffic basically polluting  
 but why now why do we think this is ready  
 because over the last thirty years people from outside the automotive industry have spent countless billions creating the needed miracles  but for entirely different purposes  
 it took folks like darpa  universities and companies completely outside of the automotive
  industry to notice that if you were clever about it autonomy could be done now 
 so what are the five miracles needed for autonomous vehicles 
 one  you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is this was solved neatly by the gps system global positioning system that the u s government put in place  
 you need to know where all the roads are what the rules are and where you 're going
  the various needs of personal navigation systems in car navigation systems  and web based maps address this  
 you must have near continuous communication with high performance computing networks and with others nearby to understand their intent 
 the wireless technologies developed for mobile devices with some minor modifications are completely suitable to solve this
  probably want some restricted roadways to get started that
 both society and its lawyers agree are safe to use for this this will start with the hov lanes and move from there 
 but finally  you need to recognize people signs and objects machine vision special sensors and high performance computing can do
  lot of this but it turns out a lot is not good enough when your family is on board  occasionally humans will need to do sense making 
 for this you might actually have to wake up your passenger and ask them what the hell that big lump is in the middle of the road 
 not so bad and it will give us a sense of purpose in this new world 
 besides  once the first drivers explain to their confused car that the giant chicken at the fork in the road is actually a restaurant
  and it 's okay to keep driving  every other car on the surface of the earth will know that from that point on 
 five miracles mostly delivered and now you just need a clear vision of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles with seductively beautiful and new 
  functional designs plus a lot of money and hard work to bring it home  
  handful of years away  and i predict that autonomous vehicles will permanently change our world over the next several decades 
 in conclusion  i 've come to believe that the ingredients for the next  pantheons are all around us just waiting for visionary people with 
  the broad knowledge multidisciplinary skills and intense passion to harness them to make
 their dreams a reality  
 but these people don 't spontaneously pop into existence they need to be nurtured and encouraged from when they 're little kids  
 we need to love them and help them discover their passions  we need to encourage them to work hard and help them understand that failure is a necessary ingredient for success as is perseverance  
 we need to help them
  to find their own role models  and give them the confidence to believe in themselves and to believe that anything is possible  
 and just as my grandpa did when he took me shopping for surplus and just as my parents did when they took me to science museums we need to encourage them to find their own path even if it 's very different from our own
  but a cautionary note  we also need to periodically pry them away from their modern miracles the computers phones tablets game machines and tvs  take them out into the sunlight
 so they can experience both the natural and design wonders of our world our planet and our civilization 
 if we don 't they won 't understand what these precious things are that someday they will be resopnsible for protecting and improving  
 we also need
  them to understand something that doesn 't seem adequately appreciated in our increasingly  tech dependent world that art and design are not luxuries  nor somehow incompatible with science and engineering  
 they are in fact essential to what makes us special 
 someday if you get the chance  perhaps you can take your kids to the actual pantheon
  as we will our daughter kira to experience firsthand the power of that astonishing design  
 which on one otherwise unremarkable day in rome  reached two thousand years into the future to set the course for my life
