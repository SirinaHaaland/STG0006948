  tori murden mcclure left nags head north carolina for france 
 that 's her boat the american pearl it 's twenty three feet long and just six feet across at its widest point  
 the deck was the size of a cargo bed of a ford
 f 150 pickup truck  tori and her friends built it by hand and it weighed about one thousand eight hundred pounds her plan
 was to row it alone across the atlantic ocean
 no motor no sail
 something no woman and no american had ever done before this would be her route over three thousand six hundred miles across the open north atlantic ocean 
 professionally tori worked as a
  administrator for the city of louisville kentucky her hometown
 but her real passion was exploring this was not her first big expedition 
 several years earlier she 'd become the first woman to ski to the south pole  
 she was an accomplished rower in college even competed for a spot on the one thousand nine hundred and ninety two u s olympic team but this
  day at sea at this point she 'd covered over one thousand miles had had no radio contact in more than two weeks following
  a storm that disabled all her long range communications systems just five days in most days looked like this at
 this point she 'd rowed over two hundred thousand strokes  fighting the current and the wind some days she traveled as little as fifteen feet 
 yeah  and as frustrating as those days were other days
 were like this
  even some sea turtles  after two weeks with no human contact tori was able to contact a local cargo ship via vhf radio
  weather report didn 't tell her was that she was rowing right into the path of hurricane danielle in the worst hurricane season on record in the north
  nearly three months at sea she 'd covered over three thousand miles  she was two thirds of the way there 
 but in the storm the waves were the size of a seven story building her boat kept capsizing some of them were
  flipping her end over end and rowing became impossible

 and her bravery stuck with me and i 'm adapting her story into a musical called row when
 tori returned home  she was feeling disheartened  she was broke
  she was having a hard time making the transition back into civilization 
 in this scene she sits at home the phone is ringing her friends are calling but she doesn 't know how to talk to them 
 she sings this song it 's called dear heart
  of kentucky burned in the moonlight
  the sky was so cloudy i walked to a party where people i know
