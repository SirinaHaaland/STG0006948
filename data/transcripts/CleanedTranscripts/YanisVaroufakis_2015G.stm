  in the west we make a colossal mistake
 taking it for granted  
 we see democracy not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is but we see it as part of our society 's furniture
  we tend to think of it as an intransigent given  
 we mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy it doesn 't 
 singapore 's lee kuan yew and his great imitators in beijing have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt
 that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism
  while politics remains 
 indeed democracy is receding in our neck of the woods here in europe  
 earlier this year  while i was representing greece the newly elected greek government
 in the eurogroup as its finance minister i was told in no uncertain terms that
 our nation 's democratic process our elections could not be
  allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in greece 
 at that moment i felt that there could be no greater vindication of lee kuan yew 
 or the chinese communist party indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything
  i want to present to you
 an economic case for an authentic democracy  i want to ask you to join me in believing again
 that lee kuan yew the chinese communist party and indeed the eurogroup are wrong
 in believing that we can dispense with democracy
 that we need an authentic boisterous democracy and without
 democracy
 our societies will be nastier our future bleak
 and our great new technologies wasted  
 speaking of waste  allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak i call it the twin peaks paradox one peak 
 you understand you know it you recognize it is the mountain of debts that has been casting
  shadow over the united states europe  the whole world we all recognize the mountain of debts 
 but few people discern its twin 
 a mountain of idle cash
 belonging to rich savers and to corporations too terrified to invest it
 into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can
  extinguish the mountain of debts
 and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs like green energy  now let me give you two numbers  
 over the last three months in the united states  in britain and in the eurozone  we have invested collectively  three point four trillion dollars
 on all the
  and so on and so forth $ three point four trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it
 to the $ five point one trillion
 that has been slushing around in the same countries in our financial institutions doing absolutely nothing during the same period
 except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices
 so a mountain of debt
 and a mountain of idle cash form twin peaks failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets  
 the result is stagnant wages 
 more than a quarter of 25 to
  in america in japan and in europe out of work and consequently  low aggregate demand
  which in a never ending cycle reinforces the pessimism of the investors 
 who fearing low demand  reproduce it by not investing exactly like oedipus ' father 
 who terrified by the prophecy of the oracle that his son would grow up to kill him  
 unwittingly engineered the conditions that ensured that oedipus  his son would kill him 
 this is my quarrel with
  capitalism 
 its gross wastefulness all this idle cash should be energized to improve lives to develop human talents and indeed 
  to finance all these technologies green technologies which are absolutely essential for saving planet earth 
  democracy  aristotle defined democracy as the constitution
 in which the free and the poor  being in the majority control government  now of course athenian democracy excluded
 too many women migrants and of course the slaves  but it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient athenian democracy
 on the basis of whom
  it excluded  
 what was more pertinent and continues to be so about ancient athenian democracy
 was the inclusion of the working poor  who not only
 acquired the right to free speech  but more importantly  crucially 
 they acquired the rights to political judgments that were afforded equal weight
 of state now of course athenian democracy didn 't last long 
 like a candle that burns brightly  it burned out quickly  
 and indeed  our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient athens they have their roots in the magna carta in the one thousand six 
 glorious revolution  indeed in the american constitution  whereas athenian democracy was focusing on the
  masterless citizen
 and empowering the working poor 
 our liberal democracies are founded on the magna carta tradition which was after all a charter for masters  
 and indeed liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible to separate fully the political sphere from the
  so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere  leaving the economic sphere the corporate world if you want as 
  zone  
 now in our democracies today 
 this separation of the economic from the political sphere the moment it started happening 
 it gave rise to an inexorable epic struggle between the two with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere
  eating into its power have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be it 's not because their dna has degenerated 
 it is rather because one can be in government today and not in power because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere which is separate 
  i spoke about my quarrel with capitalism if you think about it it is a little bit like a population of predators 
 that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on 
 that in the end they starve  similarly the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere to such an extent
 that it is undermining itself causing economic crisis corporate power is
  increasing political goods are devaluing  inequality is rising aggregate demand is falling and ceos of corporations are too scared
 to invest the cash of their corporations  so
 the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy  the taller the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human resources
 and humanity 's wealth  
 clearly if this is right  
 we must reunite the political and economic spheres and better do it with a demos being in control like in ancient athens except without the slaves
 or the exclusion of women and migrants 
 now  this is not an original idea the marxist left had that idea one hundred years ago and it didn 't go very well did it
 the lesson that we learned from the soviet debacle is that
 only by a miracle will the working poor be
 reempowered as they were in ancient athens without creating new forms of brutality and waste  
 but there is a solution  
 eliminate the working poor capitalism 's doing it by replacing
 with automata  androids robots  the problem is that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate  automation
 makes the twin peaks taller the waste loftier and the social conflicts deeper  including soon 
  we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres but we 'd better do it
 by democratizing the reunified sphere  lest we end up with a
  the technological innovations it is spawning 
 the more interesting question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a matrix dystopia or something much closer to a star 
  trek like society where machines serve the humans and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe and indulging in long debates about the
  meaning of life in some ancient 
  high tech agora  i think we can afford
 to be optimistic  but what would it take what would it look like
 to have this star  trek like utopia instead of the matrix like dystopia  
  in practical terms allow me to share just briefly a couple of examples 
 at the level of the enterprise imagine a capital market where you earn capital as you work 
 and where your capital
 follows you from one job to another from one company to another and the company whichever one you happen to work at at that time is
 solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment then all income stems from capital from profits and the very
 concept of wage labor becomes obsolete 
 no more separation between those who own but do not work in the company
 and those who work but do not own the company no more
  investment and saving indeed no towering twin peaks at the level of the global political economy imagine for a moment
 that our national currencies have a free floating exchange rate  with a universal 
 global  digital currency one that is issued by
 the international monetary fund
 of all humanity  and imagine further that all international trade
 is denominated in this currency let 's call it the cosmos in units of cosmos
 with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund a sum of cosmos units
 proportional to the country 's trade deficit or indeed to a country 's trade surplus
  and imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies  especially in parts of the world
 where investment funding is scarce this is not a new idea it 's what effectively john maynard keynes proposed in 
 the bretton woods conference
  the problem is that back then they didn 't have the technology to implement it now we do  especially in the context of a reunified
 sphere the world that i am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian in that it prioritizes empowered
 individuals marxist  since it will have confined to the dustbin of history the division between capital and labor
  and keynesian  global keynesian  
 but above all else it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy  
 will such a world dawn
  or shall we descend into a matrix like dystopia  
 the answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively it
  is our choice and we 'd better make it democratically
  relevance in what i just said  then marx is relevant because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is
 if we don 't do it  then technological innovation is going to create such a massive fall in aggregate demand what larry summers refers to
 as
 secular stagnation with this crisis migrating from one part of the world as it is now it will destabilize not only our democracies
  but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy  so if this analysis holds water then marx is absolutely relevant but so is hayek 
 that 's why i 'm a libertarian marxist and so is keynes so that 's why i 'm totally confused
  greek philosopher kind of thing to say yv that was einstein actually bg during your talk you mentioned singapore and china and last night at the speaker dinner you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the west looks at china 
 would you like to share that yv well there 's a great degree of hypocrisy  
 in
 our liberal democracies we have a semblance of democracy it 's because we have confined as i was saying in my talk
 democracy to the political sphere while leaving the one sphere where all the action is the economic sphere a completely
  stuart mill  john stuart mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process so what you are seeing now in china
 is a very similar process to the one that we had in in britain during the industrial revolution especially the transition from the first to the second 
 and to be
 castigating china for doing that which the west did in the
 i am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience
 as the finance minister of greece earlier this year yv i knew this was coming bg yes bg 
 six months after how do you look back at the first half of the year yv 
 extremely exciting from a personal point of view  and very disappointing
 because we had an opportunity
 to reboot the eurozone not just greece the eurozone  to move away from
 the complacency and the constant denial that there was a massive and there is a massive architectural fault line going through the eurozone  
 which is threatening massively the whole of the european union process we had an opportunity on the basis of the greek program which by the way
  was the first program to manifest that denial
 to put it right and unfortunately the powers in the eurozone  in the eurogroup 
 chose to maintain denial but you know what happens  this is the experience of the soviet union when you try to
 to keep alive an economic system that architecturally cannot survive through political will and
  through authoritarianism you may succeed in prolonging it but when change happens it happens very abruptly and catastrophically bg what kind of change are you foreseeing yv 
 well there 's no doubt that if we don 't change the architecture of the eurozone the eurozone has no future bg did
 you make any mistakes when you were finance minister
 anything else for that matter who tells you after six months in a job especially
 in such a stressful situation that they have made no mistake they 're dangerous people of course i made mistakes the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of a loan agreement in the end of february  
 i was imagining that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors to find common ground and there wasn 't they were simply
 in crushing our government just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines that were running through the eurozone  and because they didn 't want to admit
  that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in greece we lost one third of our nominal gdp this is worse than the great depression and no one has come clean from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy to say
  a colossal mistake bg despite all this and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion you seem to be remaining quite pro european yv absolutely look my criticism
 of the european union and the eurozone
 comes from a person who lives and breathes europe my greatest fear is that the eurozone
  will not survive because if it doesn 't the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed will be
 demonic and they will destroy the european union and that will be catastrophic not just for europe
 but for the whole global economy we are probably the largest economy
 in the world  
 and if we allow ourselves to fall into a route of the postmodern one thousand nine hundred and thirty 's which seems to me to be what we are doing 
 then that will be detrimental to the future of europeans and
 bg we definitely hope you are wrong on that point yanis thank you for coming to ted
