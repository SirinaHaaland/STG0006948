  economists have been exploring people 's behavior for hundreds of years 
 how we make decisions how we act individually and in groups how we exchange value
  they 've studied the institutions that facilitate our trade like legal systems corporations  marketplaces  
 but there is a new technological institution that will fundamentally change how we exchange value  
 and it 's called the blockchain  
 now that 's a pretty bold statement but if you take nothing else away from this talk i actually want you to remember that while blockchain
  technology is relatively new  
 it 's also a continuation of a very human story and the story is this 
 as humans we find ways to lower uncertainty about one another so that we can exchange value 
 now one of the first people to really explore the idea of institutions as a tool in economics to
  lower our uncertainties about one another and be able to do trade was the nobel economist douglass north 
 he passed away at the end of two thousand and fifteen but north pioneered what 's called new institutional economics 
 and what he meant by institutions were really just formal rules like a constitution  and informal constraints like bribery
  these institutions are really the grease that allow our economic wheels to function  and we can see this play out over the course of human history 
 if we think back to when we were hunter gatherer economies we really just traded within our village structure  
 we had some informal constraints in place  but
 we enforced all of our trade with violence or social repercussions
  as our societies grew more complex and our trade routes grew more distant  we built up more formal institutions institutions like banks for currency  
 governments  corporations  
 these institutions helped us manage our trade as the uncertainty and the complexity grew
  and our personal control was much lower eventually with the internet we put these same institutions online  
 we built platform marketplaces like amazon  ebay alibaba just faster institutions that act as middlemen to facilitate human economic activity 
 as douglass north saw it institutions are a tool to lower uncertainty so that we can connect and exchange
  all kinds of value in society  and i believe we are now entering a further and radical evolution
 of how we interact and trade 
 because for the first time  we can lower uncertainty not just with political and economic institutions like our banks our corporations
  but we can do it with technology alone 
 so what is the blockchain  
 blockchain technology is a decentralized database that stores a registry of assets and transactions across a peer to peer network  
 it 's basically a public registry of who owns what and who transacts what 
 the transactions are secured through cryptography and over time that transaction history gets
 locked in blocks of data that are then cryptographically linked together and secured 
 this creates an immutable unforgeable record
 of all of the transactions across this network this record is replicated on every computer that uses the network  
 it 's not an app
 it 's not a company
  i think it 's closest in description to something like wikipedia  
 we can see everything on wikipedia  it 's a composite view that 's constantly changing and being updated 
 we can also track those changes over time on wikipedia  and
 we can create our own wikis because at their core  they 're just a data infrastructure on wikipedia
 it 's an open platform that stores words and images and the changes to that data over time 
 on the blockchain you can think of it as an open infrastructure that stores many kinds of assets  
 it stores the history of custodianship  ownership and location for assets like the digital currency bitcoin other
  assets like a title of ownership of ip  
 it could be a certificate a contract  real world objects  even personal identifiable information 
 there are of course other technical details to the blockchain  but at its core that 's how it works
  it 's this public registry that stores transactions in a network
 and is replicated so that it 's very secure and hard to tamper with  which brings me to my point
 of how  blockchains lower uncertainty
 and how they therefore promise to transform our economic systems in radical ways  
 so uncertainty is kind of a big term
  but i want to go through three forms of it that we face in almost all of our everyday transactions where blockchains can play a role  we face uncertainties like not knowing who we 're dealing with 
 not having visibility into a transaction and not having recourse if things go wrong  
 so let 's take the first example not knowing who we 're dealing with  say i want to buy a
  the first thing i 'm going to do is look up who i 'm buying from 
 are they a power user do they have great reviews and ratings or do they have no profile at all 
 reviews ratings checkmarks 
 these are the attestations about our identities that we cobble together today and use to lower uncertainty about who we 're dealing
  but the problem is they 're very fragmented think about how many profiles you have
 allow for us to create an open global platform on which to store any attestation about any individual from any source 
 this allows us to create a 
 portable identity
  more than a profile it means you can selectively reveal
 the different attributes about you that help facilitate trade or interaction 
 for instance that a government issued you an id or that you 're over twenty one 
 by revealing the cryptographic proof that these details exist and are signed off on 
 having this kind of portable identity around the physical world and
  the digital world means we can do all kinds of human trade in a totally new way  
 so i 've talked about how  blockchains could lower uncertainty in who we 're dealing with 
 the second uncertainty that we often face is just not having transparency into our interactions  
 say you 're going to send me that smartphone by mail i want some degree of transparency i want to know that the product i bought
 is the same one that arrives in the mail and that there 's some record for how it got to me this is true not just for electronics like smartphones but for many kinds of goods and data things like medicine  
 luxury goods 
 any kind of data or product that we don 't want tampered with 
 the problem in
  especially those that produce something complicated like a smartphone is they 're managing all of these different vendors across a horizontal supply chain 
 all of these people that go into making a product they don 't have the same database they don 't use the same infrastructure  and so it becomes really hard to see transparently a product evolve over time 
 using the blockchain  we can create a shared reality across
 by this i mean all of these nodes in the network do not need to know each other or trust each other because they each have the ability to monitor and validate the chain for themselves 
 think back to wikipedia  it 's a shared database  
 and even though it has multiple readers and multiple writers at the same time  it has one single truth 
  we can create that using blockchains we can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly
 without actually creating that central authority  
 so all of these vendors all sorts of companies can interact using the same database without trusting one another 
 it means for
  we can have a lot more transparency as a real world object travels along we can see its digital certificate or token move on the blockchain  
 adding value as it goes 
 this is a whole new world in terms of our visibility  
 so i 've talked about how blockchains can lower our uncertainties about identity
 and how they change what we mean about transparency in long distances and complex trades
  like in a supply chain 
 the last uncertainty that we often face is one of the most open ended and it 's reneging 
 what if you don 't send me the smartphone can i get my money back
 blockchains allow us to write code 
 binding contracts between individuals and then guarantee that those contracts will bear out without a third party
  enforcer  
 so if we look at the smartphone example you could think about escrow 
 you are financing that phone  but you don 't need to release the funds until you can verify that all the conditions have been met you got the phone 
 i think this is one of the most exciting ways that  blockchains lower our
  because it means to some degree we can collapse institutions and their enforcement  
 it means a lot of human economic activity can get
 collateralized and automated  
 and push a lot of human intervention to the edges the places where information moves from the real world to the blockchain  
 i think what would probably floor douglass north about this
  use of technology
 is the fact that the very thing that makes it work the very thing that keeps the blockchain secure and verified 
 is our mutual distrust  
 so rather than all of our uncertainties slowing us down and requiring institutions
 like banks our governments our corporations
  we can actually harness all of that collective uncertainty
 and use it to collaborate and exchange more and faster and more open 
 now i don 't want you to get the impression that the blockchain is the solution to everything  even though the media has said that it 's going
  it 's also going to solve the counterfeit drug problem
 and potentially save the rainforest 
 the truth is this technology is in its infancy 
 and we 're going to need to see a lot of experiments take place and probably fail before we truly understand all of the use cases for our economy  
 but there are tons of people working on this from financial institutions to technology companies
 start ups and universities and one of the reasons is that it 's not just an economic
 evolution  it 's also an innovation in computer science
 blockchains give us the technological capability of creating
 a record of human exchange of exchange of currency of
  all kinds of digital and physical assets  even of our own personal attributes in a totally new way  
 so in some ways  they become a technological institution that has a lot of the benefits of the traditional institutions we 're used to using in society  
 but it does this in a
  it does this by converting a lot of our uncertainties into certainties  
 so i think we need to start preparing ourselves  because we are about to face a world
 where distributed autonomous institutions have quite a significant role  thank you
  i think i understood that
 it 's coming it offers a lot of potential  and it 's complex 
 what is your estimate for estimate for the rate of adoption bettina warburg 
 i think that 's a really good question  my lab is
 pretty much focused on going the enterprise and government route first
 because in reality blockchain is a complex technology how many of you actually understand how the internet works  but you use it every day  
 so i think we 're sort of facing the same john sculley idea of technology should either be invisible or beautiful 
 and blockchain is kind of neither of those things right now so it 's better suited for
 either really early adopters who kind of get it and can tinker around
  around or
 for finding those best use cases like identity or asset tracking or smart contracts that can be used at that level of an enterprise or government
