  is interconnected 
 as a shinnecock indian i was raised to know this 
 we are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of long island near the town of southampton in new york 
 when i was a little girl
  girl my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun
 on a hot summer day there were no clouds in the sky  
 and after a while i began to perspire 
 and he pointed up to the sky  and he said look 
 do you see that that 's part of you up there that 's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the
  rain that feeds the plants that feeds the animals 
 in my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life 
 i started storm chasing in two thousand and eight after my daughter said mom you should do
  and so three days later  driving very fast  
 i found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell  capable of producing
  hail and spectacular tornadoes  although only two percent actually do 
 these clouds can grow so big up to
  fifty miles wide
 and reach up to sixty five thousand feet into the atmosphere 
 they can grow so big blocking all daylight making it very dark and ominous standing under them  
 storm chasing is a very tactile experience there 's a warm moist wind blowing at your back
 and the smell of the earth the wheat the grass
 the charged particles and then there are the colors in the clouds
 of hail forming the greens and the turquoise blues  
 i 've learned to respect the lightning my hair used to be straight
  is their movement the way they swirl and spin and undulate with their lava  lamp like mammatus clouds 
 they become lovely monsters 
 when i 'm photographing them  i cannot help but remember my grandfather 's lesson 
 as i stand under them  i see not just a cloud but understand that what i have the privilege to witness
  the same forces the same process in a  small scale version that helped to create our galaxy  our solar system 
 our sun and even this very planet 
 all my relations thank you
