  but this is not how i started when i was seven years old  i remember watching television and seeing people throwing rocks  and thinking
  this must be a fun thing to do 
 so i got out to the street and threw rocks not realizing i was supposed to throw rocks at israeli cars  instead i ended up stoning my neighbors ' cars 
 they were not enthusiastic about my patriotism  
 this is my picture with my brother  this is me the little one and i know what you 're thinking you used to look cute what the heck happened to you 
 but my brother who is older than me was arrested when he was eighteen
  to prison on charges of throwing stones 
 he was beaten up when he refused to confess that he threw stones  and as a result had internal injuries that caused his death soon after he was released from prison 
 i was angry i was bitter  and all i wanted was revenge  
 but that changed when i was eighteen  i decided that i needed hebrew
  to get a job  and going to study hebrew in that classroom was the first time i ever met jews who were not soldiers  
 and we connected over really small things like the fact that i love country music  which is really strange for palestinians  
 but it was then that i
 i realized also that we have a wall of anger of hatred
 and of ignorance that separates us  
 i decided that it doesn 't matter what happens to me what really matters is how i deal with it and therefore  i decided to dedicate my life
 to bringing down the walls that separate people i do so through many
  tourism is one of them but also media and education  and you might be wondering really can tourism
 change things can it bring down walls yes tourism is the best sustainable way
 to bring down those walls and to create a sustainable
 way of connecting with each other and creating friendships 
 in two thousand and nine i cofounded mejdi tours a social enterprise that aims to connect people 
 with two jewish friends by the way
  way  and
 what we 'll do the model we did for example in jerusalem we would have two tour guides 
 one israeli and one palestinian guiding the trips together telling history and narrative and archaeology and conflict from totally different perspectives  
 i remember running a trip together with a friend named kobi jewish congregation from chicago the trip was in jerusalem and we took them
 to a refugee camp
  refugee camp and there we had this amazing food by the way this is my mother  
 she 's cool  and that 's the palestinian food called maqluba it means upside down you cook it with rice and chicken and you flip it upside down it 's the best meal ever 
 and we 'll eat together then we had a joint band israeli and palestinian musicians and we did some
 left both sides  they were crying because they did not want to leave three years later those relationships still exist 
 imagine with me if the one billion people who travel internationally every year travel like this not being taken in the bus from one side to another 
 from one hotel to another
  pictures from the windows of their buses of people and cultures but actually connecting with people you know i remember having a muslim group from
 the u k going to the house of an orthodox jewish family 
 and having their first friday night dinners that sabbath dinner and eating together hamin which is a jewish food a stew  just having the connection of realizing after a while that
 a hundred years ago their families came out of the same place in northern africa
  this is not a photo profile for your facebook this is not disaster tourism this is the future of travel and i invite you to join me to do that to 
  change your travel we 're doing it all over the world now from ireland to iran to turkey  and we see ourselves going everywhere to change the world thank you
