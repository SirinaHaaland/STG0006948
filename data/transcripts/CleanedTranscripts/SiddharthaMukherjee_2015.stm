  i want to talk to you about
 the future of medicine but before i do that i want to talk a little bit about the past now  throughout
 much of the recent history of medicine we 've thought about illness and treatment
 in terms of a profoundly
 profoundly simple model  in fact the model is so simple
 that you could summarize it in six words have disease take pill  kill something  
 now  the reason for the dominance of this model
 is of course the antibiotic revolution 
  many of you might not know this but we happen to be celebrating the hundredth year of the introduction of antibiotics into the united states but what you do know
 is that that introduction was nothing short of transformative  here you had
 a chemical either from the natural world or artificially synthesized in the laboratory  and it would course through your body it would
  its target lock into its target a microbe or some part of a microbe and then turn off a lock and a key
 with exquisite deftness exquisite specificity  
 and you would end up taking a previously fatal lethal disease a pneumonia  syphilis  
 tuberculosis and transforming that into a curable or treatable illness 
 you have a pneumonia
  penicillin  you kill the microbe and you cure the disease  so seductive
 was this idea  so potent
 the metaphor of lock and key and killing something that it really swept through biology it was a transformation like no other  
 and we 've really spent the last one hundred years
 trying to replicate that model over and over again
 in noninfectious diseases in chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and heart disease  and it 's worked  but it 's only worked
 partly  let me show you  you know  if you take the entire universe of all chemical reactions in the human body every chemical
  that your body is capable of 
 most people think that that number is on the order of a million let 's call it a million  
 and now you ask the question what number or fraction of reactions can actually be targeted
 by the entire pharmacopoeia all of medicinal chemistry that number is two hundred and fifty  
 the rest is chemical darkness  in other words
  zero point zero two five percent of all chemical reactions in your body are actually targetable by this lock and key mechanism  
 you know if you think about
 human physiology as a vast
 global telephone network with interacting
 nodes and interacting pieces 
 then all of our medicinal chemistry is operating on one tiny corner at the edge the outer edge of that network
  like
 all of our pharmaceutical chemistry is a pole operator in
 wichita  kansas who is tinkering with about ten or fifteen telephone lines
 so what do we do about this idea  what if we reorganized this approach  
 in fact it turns out that the natural world gives us a sense of how one
  one might think about illness in a radically different way  rather than disease medicine  target  
 in fact the natural world is organized hierarchically upwards not downwards but upwards  and we begin
 with a
  and these organs coalesce to form things called humans  and these organisms ultimately live
 in environments  which are partly self regulating and partly
 what 's nice about this scheme this hierarchical scheme building upwards rather than downwards is that it allows us to think
  about illness as well
 in a somewhat different way  take a disease like cancer  
 since the 1950s we 've tried rather desperately
 to apply this lock and key model to cancer  we 've tried to
 kill cells using a variety of
 chemotherapies or targeted therapies  and as most of us know that 's worked
  for diseases like leukemia it 's worked for some forms of breast cancer  but eventually you run
 to the ceiling of that approach  and it 's only in the last ten years or so that we 've begun to think about using the immune system  
 remembering that in fact the cancer cell doesn 't grow in a vacuum it actually grows in a human organism and could you use the
  the fact that human beings have an immune system to attack cancer in fact it 's led to the some of the most spectacular new medicines in cancer  
 and finally there 's the level of the environment isn 't there 
 you know we don 't think of cancer as altering the environment but let me give you an example of a profoundly carcinogenic environment
 it 's called a prison  you take
 loneliness you take depression you take confinement and you add to that
 rolled up in a little white sheet of paper 
 one of the most potent neurostimulants that we know  called nicotine and you add to that one of the most potent addictive substances that you know  
 and you have a 
  environment  but you can have anti carcinogenic environments too there are attempts to
  change the hormonal milieu for breast cancer for instance  we 're trying to change the metabolic milieu
 for other forms of cancer or take another disease like depression  again  working upwards  since the 
  we 've tried again desperately to turn off molecules that operate between nerve cells serotonin  
 dopamine and tried to cure depression that way and that 's worked  
  and we now know that what you really probably need to do is to change the physiology of the organ the brain  rewire it remodel it 
 and that of course we know study upon study has shown that talk therapy does exactly that and study upon study has shown that talk therapy combined with medicines pills 
 really is much more effective than either one alone
 can we imagine
 a more immersive environment that will change depression can you
 lock out the signals that elicit depression  again  moving upwards
 along this hierarchical chain of organization what 's really at stake perhaps here
 is not the medicine itself but a metaphor  rather than killing something  in the case of the great chronic degenerative diseases
 kidney failure
  maybe what we really need to do is change the metaphor to growing something  and that 's the key perhaps to reframing our thinking about medicine now this idea
 of changing 
 of creating a perceptual shift as it were came home to me to roost in a very very personal manner about ten years ago about ten years ago i 've been a runner most of my life i went
  saturday morning run i came back and woke up and i basically couldn 't move my right knee was swollen up and you could hear that ominous crunch of bone against bone 
 and one of the perks of being a physician is that you get to order your own mris and
 i had an mri the next week  and it looked like that essentially the meniscus of cartilage
 that is between bone had been completely torn and the bone itself had been shattered now  if you 're looking at me
  feeling sorry let me tell you a few facts if i was to take an mri of every person in this audience 
 sixty percent of you would show signs of bone degeneration and cartilage degeneration like this eighty five percent of all women
 by the age of seventy would show moderate to severe cartilage degeneration 
 fifty to sixty percent of the men in this audience would also have such signs so this is a very common disease well  the second
  perk of being a physician is that you can get to experiment on your own ailments  so about ten years ago we began we brought this process into the laboratory  
 and we began to do simple experiments mechanically trying to fix this degeneration we tried to inject
 chemicals into the knee spaces of animals to try to reverse
 cartilage degeneration and to put a short summary on a very long and painful process
  essentially it came to naught  nothing happened 
 and then about seven years ago we had a research student from australia  the nice thing about australians is that they 're habitually used to looking at the world upside down 
 and so
 dan dan suggested to me you know maybe it isn 't a mechanical problem maybe it isn 't a chemical problem
  it 's a stem cell problem 
 in other words he had two hypotheses number one there is such a thing as a skeletal stem cell a skeletal stem cell that builds up the entire vertebrate skeleton 
 bone cartilage and the fibrous elements of skeleton just like there 's a stem cell in blood just like there 's a stem cell in the nervous system and two that maybe that the degeneration or dysfunction of this stem cell is what 's causing
  we looking for a pill when we should have really been looking for a cell  
 so we switched our models  and now we began to look for skeletal stem cells  
 and to cut again a long story short about five years ago we found these cells  
 they live inside the skeleton here 's a schematic and then a real photograph of one of them the white stuff is bone and these red
  columns that you see and the yellow cells are cells that have arisen from one single skeletal stem cell columns of cartilage  columns of bone coming out of a single cell 
 these cells are fascinating they have four properties  
 number one
 is that they live where they 're expected to live they live just underneath the surface of the bone underneath cartilage you know in biology it 's location location location
  appropriate areas and form bone and cartilage that 's one here 's an interesting property you can take them out
 of the vertebrate skeleton  you can culture them in petri dishes in the laboratory  and they are dying to form cartilage remember how we couldn 't form cartilage for love or money these cells are dying to form cartilage they form their own furls of cartilage around themselves  
  number three the most efficient repairers of fractures that we 've ever encountered this is a little bone a mouse bone that we fractured
 and then let it heal by itself these stem cells have come in and repaired in yellow the bone in white the cartilage almost completely 
 so much so that if you label them
 with a fluorescent dye you can see them like some kind of peculiar cellular glue coming into the area of a fracture
  fixing it locally and then stopping their work now  the fourth one is the most ominous and that is that their numbers
 decline precipitously  precipitously  tenfold  fiftyfold as you age  
 and so what had happened really is that we found ourselves in a perceptual shift  
 we had gone hunting for pills but we ended up finding theories  and in some ways we had hooked ourselves back onto this idea cells
  environments because we were now thinking about bone stem cells we were thinking about arthritis in terms of
 a cellular disease  
 and then the next question was are there organs can you build this as an organ outside the body can you implant cartilage into areas of trauma  
 and perhaps most interestingly  can you ascend right up and create
  we know that exercise remodels bone but come on none of us is going to exercise so could you imagine ways of passively loading and unloading bone
 so that you can recreate or regenerate degenerating cartilage  and perhaps more interesting and more importantly the question is can you apply this model more globally outside medicine what 's at stake as i said before is not
  but growing something  and it raises a series of i think some of the most interesting questions
 about how we think about medicine in the future could your medicine be a cell
 and not a pill  
 how would we grow these cells what we would we do to stop the malignant growth of these cells we heard about the problems of unleashing growth 
  implant suicide genes into these cells to stop them from growing 
 could your medicine be an organ that 's created outside the body and then implanted into the body  could that stop some of the degeneration 
 what if the organ needed to have memory
 in cases of of diseases of of the nervous system
 some of those organs had memory  how could we implant those memories back in could we store these organs would each organ have to be developed for an individual human being and put back
  and perhaps
 most puzzlingly could your medicine be an environment  
 could you patent an environment  you know
 in every culture  shamans have been using environments as medicines  could we imagine that for our future i
 've talked a lot about models i began this talk with models so let me end with some thoughts about model building that 's what we do as
  scientists you know  when an architect
 builds a model  he or she is trying to show you a world in miniature  
 but when a scientist is building a model  he or she is trying to show you the world in metaphor  
 he or she is trying to create a new way of seeing  the former is a scale shift  the latter is a perceptual shift
 created such a perceptual shift
 in our way of thinking about medicine that it really colored distorted very successfully the way we 've thought about medicine for the last hundred years 
 but we need new models
 to think about medicine in the future  that 's what 's at stake  you know there 's a popular trope
 out there that the reason we haven 't had the transformative
 impact on the treatment of illness is because we don 't have powerful enough drugs  and that 's partly true  
 but perhaps the real reason is that we don 't have powerful enough ways of thinking about medicines  
 it 's certainly true that it would be lovely
 to have
  but perhaps what 's really at stake are three more intangible m 's mechanisms models  
 metaphors  
 thank you 
 chris anderson i really like this metaphor
 how does it link in there 's a lot of talk
 in
 of medicine that we have all this data and that medical treatments of the future will be for you specifically your genome your current context
  does that apply to this model you 've got here 
 we 've thought about personalization of medicine very much in terms of genomics
  that 's because the gene is such a dominant metaphor again to use that same word in medicine today
  we think the genome will drive the personalization of medicine but of course the genome is just the bottom of a long chain of being as it were  
 that chain of being really the first organized unit of that is the cell so if we are really going to deliver in medicine in this way we have to think of personalizing cellular therapies
  and then personalizing
 organ or organismal therapies and ultimately personalizing immersion therapies for for the environment so i think at every stage  you know there 's that metaphor  there 's turtles all the way  well in this there 's personalization all the way ca so when you say
 medicine could be a cell and not a pill
 you 're talking about potentially your own cells sm absolutely ca so converted to stem cells perhaps tested against all kinds of
 drugs or something and
  's no perhaps this is what we 're doing this is what 's happening and in fact  
 we 're slowly moving not away from genomics  but incorporating genomics into what we call
