  no one will ever pay you what you 're worth  
 no one will ever pay you what you 're worth  
 they 'll only ever pay you what they think you 're worth  and you control their thinking
 not like this although that would be cool 
 that would be really cool  
 instead like this 
 clearly defining and communicating your value are essential to being paid well for your excellence  
 anyone here want to be paid well
  this talk is for everyone it
 's got universal applicability it 's true if you 're a business owner 
 if you 're an employee if you 're a job seeker it 's true if you 're a man or a woman 
 now i approach this today through the lens of the woman business owner because in my work i 've observed that women underprice more so than men 
 the gender wage gap is a well traveled narrative in this
  according to the bureau of labor statistics a woman employee earns just eighty three cents
 for every dollar a man earns  what may surprise you is that this trend continues even into the entrepreneurial sphere 
 a woman business owner earns just eighty cents
 for every dollar a man earns 
 in my work i 've often heard women express that they 're uncomfortable communicating their value  especially early on in business ownership  
 they say things like i don 't like to toot my own horn
 i 'd rather let the work speak for itself 
 i don 't like to sing my own praises 
 i hear very different narratives in working with male business owners  and i think this difference is costing women twenty cents on the dollar i
 'd like to tell you the story of a consulting firm that helps their clients dramatically improve their profitability 
  that company is my company after my first year in business i saw the profit increases
 that my clients were realizing in working with me and i realized that i needed to reevaluate my pricing 
 i was really underpriced relative to the value i was delivering it 's hard for me to admit to you because i 'm a pricing consultant 
 laughter it 's what i do i help companies price for value
  's what i saw and so i sat down
 to evaluate my pricing evaluate my value 
 and i did that by asking key value questions 
 what are my clients ' needs and how do i meet them what is my unique skill set that makes me better qualified to serve my clients  
 what do i do that no one else does  what problems do i solve for clients  what value do i
  i answered these questions and defined the value that my clients get from working with me 
 calculated their return on investment and what i saw was that i needed to double my price double it now i confess to you
 this terrified me 
 i 'm supposed to be the expert in this but i 'm not cured  
 i knew the value was there  i was convinced the value was there  and i was still scared out of my wits  what if nobody would pay me
  that  what if clients said that 's ridiculous you 're ridiculous was i really worth that 
 not my work mind you but me 
 was i worth that i
 'm the mother of two beautiful little girls who depend upon me i 'm a single mom  
 what if my business fails  what if i fail  
 but i know how to take my own medicine
 the medicine that i prescribe to my clients  i had done the homework  i knew the value was there  so when prospects came  
 i prepared the proposals with the new higher pricing and sent them out
 and communicated the value how 's the story end clients continued to hire me and refer me and recommend me and i 'm still here
  i share this story because doubts and fears are natural and normal but they don 't define our value 
 and they shouldn 't limit our earning potential i
 'd like to share another story about a woman who learned to communicate her value
 and found her own voice  she runs a successful web development company and employs several people when she
  first started her firm and for several years thereafter  she would say i have a little web design company 
 she 'd actually use those words with clients i have a little web design company 
 in this and in many other small ways she was diminishing her company in the eyes of prospects and clients and diminishing herself 
 it was really impacting her ability to earn what she was worth
  i believe her language and her style communicated that she didn 't believe she had much value to offer 
 in her own words she was practically giving her services away  and so she began her journey
 to take responsibility for communicating value to clients and changing her message one thing i shared with her is that it 's so important
  to find your own voice a voice that 's authentic and true to you don
 't try to channel your sister in law just because she 's a great salesperson or your neighbor who tells a great joke if that 's not who you are 
 give up this notion that it 's tooting your own horn  make it about the other party  focus on serving and adding value and it won 't feel like bragging  
 what do you love about what you do what excites you about the work that you do
 you connect with that communicating your value will come naturally 
 so she embraced her natural style found her voice and changed her message 
 for one thing she stopped calling herself a little web design company  
 she really found a lot of strength and power in communicating her message  
 she 's now charging three times as much for web design and her business is growing
 she told me about a recent meeting with a gruff and sometimes difficult client who had called a meeting questioning progress on search engine optimization  
 she said in the old days that would have been a really intimidating meeting for her but her mindset was different 
 she said  she prepared the information sat down with the client 
 said this isn 't about me it 's not personal it 's about the client  she took them through the data through the numbers
 laid out the trends and the progress in her own voice and in her own way  
 but very directly said here 's what we 've done for you the client sat up and took notice and said ok i got it 
 and she said in describing that meeting i didn 't feel scared
 or panicky or small which is how i used to feel instead i feel like
  i got this i know what i 'm doing i 'm confident ' 
 being properly valued is so important you can hear in this story that the implications
 range far beyond just finances into the realm of
 today i 've told two stories one about defining our value and the other about
  communicating our value and these are the two elements to realizing our full earning potential  that 's the equation and if
 you 're sitting in the audience today
 and you 're not being paid what you 're worth i 'd like to welcome you into this equation 
 just imagine what life could be like  how much more we could do how much more we could give back how much more we could plan for the future
  validated and respected we would feel if we could earn our full potential  realize our full value 
 no one will ever pay you what you 're worth they 'll only ever pay you what they think you 're worth  and you control their thinking  thank you
