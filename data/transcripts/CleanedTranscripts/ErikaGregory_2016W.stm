  let me ask you all a question 
 how much weapons grade nuclear material do you think it would take to level a city the size of san francisco 
 how many of you think it would be an amount about the size of this suitcase
  and how about this minibus all
 right well actually under the right circumstances an amount of highly enriched uranium about the size of your morning latte
 would be enough to kill one hundred thousand people instantly  
 hundreds of thousands of others would become horribly ill and parts of the city would be uninhabitable for years
  years  if not for decades  but you can forget that nuclear latte because today 's nuclear weapons
 are hundreds of times more powerful even than those we dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki  
 and even a limited nuclear war involving say tens of nuclear
  could lead to the end of all life on the planet  so it 's really important
 that you know
 that right now we have over fifteen thousand nuclear weapons in the hands of nine nations and if you live in a city
 or near a military facility one is likely pointed right at you 
 in fact if you live in any of the rural areas where nuclear weapons are stored
  globally one is likely pointed at you 
 about one thousand eight hundred of these weapons are on high alert  which means they can be launched within fifteen minutes
 of a presidential command  so
 i know this is a bummer of an issue and maybe you have that what was it psychic fatigue that we heard about a little bit earlier  so i 'm going to switch gears for
  just a second and i 'm going to talk about my imaginary friend who i like to think of as jasmine 
 just for a moment 
 jasmine at the age of twenty five is part of a generation that is more politically and socially engaged than anything we 've seen in fifty years  
 she and her friends think of themselves as change agents and leaders and activists 
 i think of them as generation possible
 they regularly protest about the issues they care about but nuclear weapons are not one of them  which makes sense because jasmine was born 
 at the end of the cold war so she didn 't grow up hearing a lot about nuclear weapons  
 she never had to duck and cover under her desk at school for jasmine a fallout shelter is an app in the android store 
 nuclear weapons help win games
  and that is really a shame  
 because right now we need generation possible to help us make some really important decisions about nuclear weapons  
 for instance will we further reduce our nuclear arsenals globally  or will we spend
  a trillion dollars 
 to modernize them so they last throughout the 21st century so that by the time jasmine is my age she 's talking to her children and maybe even her grandchildren about the threat of nuclear holocaust  
 and if you 're paying any attention at all to cyberthreats or for instance if you 've read about the stuxnet virus
 or for god 's sake if you 've ever had an email account or a yahoo account or a phone hacked you can imagine the whole new world
  of hurt that could be triggered by modernization in a period of cyberwarfare  
 now if you 're paying attention to the money 
 a trillion dollars could go a long way to feeding and educating and employing people all of which could reduce the threat of nuclear war to begin with 
 so 
 this is really crucial right now
 because nuclear weapons
 they 're vulnerable 
 we have solid evidence that terrorists are trying to get ahold of them just this last spring when four
 retirees and two taxi drivers were arrested in the republic of georgia for trying to sell nuclear materials for two hundred million dollars 
 they demonstrated that the black market for this stuff is alive and well
  and it 's really important because there have been dozens of accidents involving nuclear weapons and i bet most of us have never heard anything about them 
 just here in the united states we 've dropped nuclear weapons on the carolinas twice 
 in one case  one of the bombs which fell out of an air force plane didn 't detonate because the nuclear core was stored somewhere else on the plane 
 in another case
 the weapon did arm when it hit the ground and five of the switches designed to keep it from detonating failed  luckily the sixth one didn 't 
 but if that 's not enough to get your attention 
 black brant incident that 's when russian radar technicians saw what they thought was a us nuclear missile streaking towards russian airspace
  it later turned out to be a norwegian rocket collecting data about the northern lights  
 but at that time russian president boris yeltsin came within five minutes
 of launching a 
 retaliatory nuclear attack against the united states 
 so 
  most of the world 's nuclear nations
 have committed to getting rid of these weapons of mass destruction  but consider this the treaty on the 
 of nuclear weapons  which is the most widely adopted arms control treaty in history with one hundred and ninety signatories  
 sets no specific date by which the world 's nuclear armed nations
  rid of their nuclear weapons
  now  when john f kennedy sent a man to the moon and decided to bring him back or decided to do both those things he didn 't say hey whenever you guys get to it 
 he gave us a deadline he gave us a challenge that would have been incredible just a few years earlier  
 and with that challenge he inspired scientists and marketers  astronauts and
  he gave us a vision but along with that vision he also tried to give us and most people don 't know this either
 he tried to give us a partner in the form of our fiercest cold war rival the soviet union 
 because part of kennedy 's vision for the apollo program was that it be a cooperation not a competition with the soviets and apparently  nikita
  but before that cooperation could be realized  kennedy was assassinated  and that part of the vision was deferred  but
 the promise of joint innovation between these two nuclear superpowers
 wasn 't totally extinguished 
 which is the year that jasmine was born and the soviet union fell
  these two nations engaged in a project
 that genuinely does seem incredible today in the truest sense of that word  
 which is that the us sent cash to the russians when they needed it most to secure loose nuclear nuclear materials and to employ out of work nuclear scientists 
 they worked alongside american scientists to convert weapons grade uranium into the type of fuel that can be used for nuclear power instead
 they called it megatons to megawatts so the result is that for over twenty years our two nations
 had a program that meant that one in ten lightbulbs in the united states was essentially fueled by former russian warheads  
 so
  together these two nations did something truly audacious  but the good news is the global community has the chance to do something
 just as audacious today 
 to get rid of nuclear weapons and to end the supply of the materials required to produce them 
 some experts tell me would take thirty years  it would take a renaissance of sorts
  the kinds of innovation that for better or worse underpinned both the manhattan project which gave rise to nuclear weapons and the megatons to megawatts program 
 it would take design constraints these are fundamental to creativity  things like a platform for international collaboration 
 a date certain  which is a forcing mechanism 
 and a positive
  happens to be the 100th anniversary of the birth of nuclear weapons in the new mexico desert  
 but it 's also an important date for another reason 
 it 's predicted to be the advent of the singularity a new moment in human
  where the lines between artificial intelligence and human intelligence blur  where computing and consciousness become almost indistinguishable
 and advanced technologies help us solve the 21st century 's greatest problems hunger energy  poverty  
 ushering in an era of abundance 
 and we all get to go to space on our way to becoming
  really believe this vision are the first to say they don 't yet know precisely how we 're going to get there  but the values behind their vision
 and the willingness to ask how might we have inspired a generation of innovators 
 they 're working backward from the outcomes they want using the
  of collaborative design they 're busting through obstacles they 're redefining what we all consider possible 
 but here 's the thing 
 that vision of abundance isn 't compatible
 with a world that still relies
 the foundations for the 22nd century it has to be about strategies for mutually assured prosperity
 or at the very least  mutually assured survival now  every day i get to meet
 people who are real pioneers in the field of nuclear threats as you can see  many of them are young women
  they 're doing fiercely interesting stuff like mareena robinson snowden here who is developing new ways better ways to detect nuclear warheads  which will help us overcome a critical hurdle to international disarmament 
 or melissa hanham who is using satellite imaging to make sense of what 's going on around far flung nuclear
  or we have beatrice fihn in europe  who has been campaigning to make nuclear weapons illegal in international courts of law  and just won a big victory at the un last week 
 and yet  
 and yet 
 with all of our talk in this culture about moon shots  too few members of generation possible and those of us who mentor them
 are taking on nuclear weapons
 it 's as if there 's a taboo  
 but i remember something kennedy said that has really stuck with me 
 and that is something to the effect that humans can be as big as the solutions to all the problems we 've created 
 no problem of human destiny he said is beyond
 human beings i believe that and i bet a lot of you here believe that
 too and i know generation possible believes it  
 so it 's time to commit to a date 
 let 's end the nuclear weapons chapter on the 100th anniversary of its inception  
 after all by two thousand
  we will have held billions of people hostage to the threat of nuclear annihilation  surely one hundred years will have been enough  
 surely a century of economic development and the development of military strategy will have given us better ways to manage global conflict  
 surely if ever there was a global moon shot worth supporting 
  in the face of real threats for instance north korea 's recent nuclear weapons tests which fly in the face of sanctions
 reasonable people disagree
 about whether we should maintain some number of nuclear weapons to deter aggression  
 but the question is what 's the magic number is it a thousand is it a
  and then we have to ask  who should be responsible for them 
 i think we can agree however that having fifteen thousand of them represents a greater global threat to jasmine 's generation than a promise  
 so it 's time we make a promise
 of a world in which we 've broken the stranglehold that nuclear weapons have on our imaginations 
 in which we invest in the creative solutions that come from working backward from
  future we desperately want  rather than plodding forward from a present that brings all of the mental models and biases of the past with it it
 's time we pledge our resources as leaders across the spectrum
 to work on this old problem in new ways to ask how might we
  how might we make good on a promise of greater security for jasmine 's generation
 in a world beyond nuclear weapons  i truly hope you will join us thank you
