  i started my way around six years ago with ironic
  am still performing in front of the camera and trying to be brave like wonder woman i focus on balancing
  'm going to tell you about my project  which is named desperate romantics they 're my artifacts  or paintings from
  but have an interesting story 
 this boy is a professional dancer only twelve years old but at secondary school he hides his dancing classes and is wearing the mask of brutality 
 trying to be united with the rest of his classmates like a storm
  trooper has no personality  but this boy has goals and dreams but hides it to be socially accepted 
 because being different isn 't easy  especially in russia  
 next portrait interpretation is metaphoric and this is nikita a security guard
  quoting hulk from the movie but i 've never seen him angry  he hides his sensitivities and romantic side because in russia among guys that 
  's not cool to be romantic  but it 's cool to be surrounded with women and look like an aggressive hulk
  new meaning and new temptation about it
 sometimes i would compare facial features and playing with words irony  
 iron man  ironing man 
  i bring social issues which surround me in russia into the conversation interesting fact about marriage in russia  that most of the eighteen 
  girls are already ready and dream to get married  we 're taught from childhood  successful marriage means successful life 
 so most of the girls kind of fight to get a good
  for russian society  i 'm an old maid
 and hopeless to ever get married  
 that 's why you see me in a mexican fighter mask in the wedding dress  all desperate in my garden 
 but remember  irony is the key 
 and this is actually to motivate girls to fight for goals for dreams and change stereotypes
 be brave be ironic it helps be funny and create some
