  two thousand and seven i decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development 
 our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work  they should be able to choose between at least a
 handful of different cities that were all competing
 to attract new residents  now we 're a long way away from that goal right now there are billions of people in developing countries
 who don 't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them  but the amazing thing about cities is they 're worth so much more than it costs to build them  
 so we could easily supply the world
  maybe hundreds of new cities  now
 this might sound preposterous to you if you 've never thought about new cities but just substitute apartment building for cities  
 imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them the other half aren 't there yet 
 you could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments 
 but you know what you 'd run into is those apartments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and
 the distractions of
 so it 's extremely hard to do all of those additions but you could go out someplace brand new build a brand new
 apartment building as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way  so i proposed that
 governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities
  gave them a name charter cities  
 later i learned that at about this same time javier and octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in honduras  
 they knew that about seventy five thousand hondurans every year would leave to go to the united states  
 and they wanted to ask what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in honduras 
 at one point javier said to octavio what if we took some of our empty land what if we just gave it to an
  embassy
 give some to the u s embassy give some to the the canadian embassy and then if people want to go work under the rules of canada or under the rules of the united states they can go get jobs do everything they do on 
  those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to canada or the u s to do in
 the summer of two thousand and nine honduras went through a wrenching
  at the next regularly scheduled election  pepe lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised
 reform but reconciliation as well  he asked octavio to be his chief of staff 
 meanwhile i was getting ready to give a talk at tedglobal  
 through a process of refinement  trial and error a lot of user testing i tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials
 the first point was the importance of rules like those rules that say you can 't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders 
 we pay a lot of attention to new technologies but it takes technologies and rules to get progress  and it 's usually the rules that hold us back 
 in the fall of two thousand and ten a friend from guatemala sent octavio a link to the tedtalk
  showed it to javier  they called me they said let 's present this to the to the leaders of our country so in december we met in miami in a hotel conference room 
 i tried to explain this point about how valuable
 cities are how much more valuable they are than they cost and i used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like new york city notice land that 's worth thousands
  of dollars in some cases  per square meter  but it was a fairly abstract discussion  and at some point
 when there was a pause octavio said paul maybe we could watch the tedtalk 
 laughing so the tedtalk laid out in very simple terms a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land a charter
 that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in to go live under those rules or not  
 so i was asked by the the president of honduras
 who said that we need to do this project this is important this could be the way forward for our country  
 i was asked to come to tegucigalpa and talk again on january fourth and fifth  
 so i presented
 lecture that included a slide like this which tried to make the point that if you want to create a lot of value in a city it has to be very big 
 this is a picture of denver  and the outline is the new airport that was built in denver this airport alone covers more than one hundred square kilometers  so i was trying to persuade 
  the hondurans if you build a new city you 've got to start with a site that 's at least one thousand square kilometers
  's more than two hundred and fifty hundred thousand acres 
 everybody applauded politely the faces in the audience were very serious
 and attentive the leader of the congress came up on stage and said professor romer thank you very much for your lecture  
 but maybe we could watch the tedtalk  
 i 've got it here on my laptop
  so i sat down  
 and they played the tedtalk  and it got to the essence which is that a new city could offer new choices for people there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in honduras  instead of hundreds of miles away in the north  
 and it also involved new choices for leaders  because the leaders in the government there in honduras would need help from partner countries who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this
  charter and the enforcement so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced 
 and the insight of president lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in honduras
  who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust we went and looked at a site this picture 's from there it easily could hold
 a thousand square kilometers  and
 shortly thereafter on january 19th they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions 
 in a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis the vote in the congress in
 favor of this constitutional amendment was one hundred and twenty four to one 
 all parties all factions in society backed this 
 to be part of the constitution you actually have to pass it twice in the congress on february  17th they passed it again with another vote of one hundred and fourteen to one
  immediately after that vote 
 on february 21st to the 24th a delegation of about thirty hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business 
 one is south korea this
  is a picture of a big new city center that 's being built in south korea bigger than downtown boston everything you see there was built in four years after they spent four years getting the permits
  the other place that 's very interested in city building is singapore  they 've actually built two cities already in china and are preparing the third 
 so if you think about this practically  here 's where we are they 've got a site they 're already thinking about this site for the second city
  they 're putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in and also an external legal system one country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there 
 there 's designers and builders of cities who are very interested they even can bring with them some financing  
 but the one thing you know they 've already solved is that there 's lots of tenants there 's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the americas
  especially in a place with a free trade zone  and there 's lots of people who 'd like to go there
 around the world there 's seven hundred million people who say they 'd like to move permanently someplace else right now there 's a million a year who leave latin america to go to the united states  
 many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing sadly sometimes there are even children who
  are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven 't seen in some cases for a decade  
 so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in honduras or to build a dozen of these or a hundred of these around the world what kind of an idea 
  is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents
  this is an idea worth spreading and my friends from honduras asked me to say thank you ted
