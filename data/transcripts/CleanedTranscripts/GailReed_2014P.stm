  i want to tell you how twenty thousand remarkable young people from over one hundred countries ended up in cuba
 and are transforming health in their communities
  ninety percent of them would never have left home at all if it weren 't for a scholarship to study medicine in cuba
 and a commitment to go back to places like the ones they 'd come from
 remote farmlands mountains  ghettos
 to become doctors for people like themselves to walk the walk 
 havana 's latin american medical school it 's the largest medical school in the world graduating
  thousand young doctors since its first class of two thousand and five with nearly ten thousand more in the pipeline 
 its mission to train physicians for the people who need them the most the over one billion
 who have never seen a doctor the people who live
 and die
 under every poverty line ever invented
  its students defy all norms they 're the school 's biggest risk and and also its best bet  
 they 're recruited from the poorest most broken places on our planet
 by a school that believes they can become not just the good but the excellent physicians their communities desperately need 
 that they will practice where most doctors don 't in places
  not only poor but oftentimes dangerous carrying venom antidotes in their backpacks or navigating neighborhoods
 riddled by drugs gangs and bullets their home ground 
 the hope is that they will help transform access to care the health picture in impoverished areas  and even the way medicine itself is learned
  and practiced and
 that they will become pioneers in our global reach for universal health coverage surely a tall order 
 two big storms and this notion of walk the walk prompted creation of elam back in 
 the hurricanes georges and mitch had ripped through the caribbean and central
  america  leaving thirty thousand dead and two and a half million homeless 
 hundreds of cuban doctors volunteered for disaster response but
 when they got there they found a bigger disaster whole communities with no healthcare 
 doors bolted shut on rural hospitals for lack of staff and just
 too many babies dying before their
  birthday 
 what would happen when these cuban doctors left 
 new doctors were needed to make care sustainable but where would they come from where would they train 
 in havana  the campus of a former naval academy was turned over to the cuban health ministry
 to become the latin american medical school elam
  tuition room and board and a small stipend were offered to hundreds of students
 from the countries hardest hit by the storms 
 as a journalist in havana i watched the first ninety seven nicaraguans arrive in march one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine 
 settling into dorms barely refurbished and helping their professors not only sweep out the classrooms but move in the desks and the chairs and the microscopes
 over the next few years governments throughout the americas requested scholarships for their own students 
 and the congressional black caucus asked for and received
 hundreds of scholarships for young people from the usa  today  among the twenty three thousand
 are graduates from eighty three countries in the americas
  africa and asia and enrollment has grown to one hundred and twenty three nations 
 more than half the students are young women they come from one hundred ethnic groups speak fifty different languages who director margaret chan said 
 for once 
 if you are poor female or from an indigenous population you have a distinct advantage
  ethic that makes this medical school unique 
 luther castillo comes from san pedro de tocamacho on the atlantic coast of honduras there
 's no running water no electricity there and to reach the village you have to walk for hours
 or take your chances in a pickup truck like i did skirting the waves of the atlantic
  luther
 was one of forty tocamacho children who started grammar school the sons and daughters of a black indigenous people known as the garfuna 
 twenty percent of the honduran population  
 the nearest healthcare was fatal miles away  
 luther had to walk three hours every day to middle school only
  seventeen made that trip only five went on to high school  and only one to university 
 luther to elam  among the first crop of garfuna graduates 
  doctors had preceded them in all of honduran history  now there
 need big solutions  sparked by big ideas imagination and audacity but also solutions that work 
 elam 's faculty had no handy evidence base to guide them 
 so they learned the hard way by doing and correcting course as they went 
 even the brightest students from these poor communities
 weren 't academically
  prepared for six years of medical training so a bridging course was set up in sciences then came language  these were mapuche 
 indigenous peoples who learned spanish as a second language or haitians who spoke creole so spanish became part
  even so in cuba 
 the music the food  the smells just about everything was different 
 so faculty became family elam home  
 religions ranged from indigenous beliefs to yoruba muslim and christian evangelical  
 embracing diversity became a way of life 
  so many countries asked for these scholarships 
 first they just don 't have enough doctors and where they do their distribution is skewed against the poor  
 because our global health crisis is fed by a crisis in human resources 
 we are short four to seven million health workers just to meet basic needs 
 and the problem is everywhere
  doctors are concentrated in the cities  where only half the world 's people live 
 and within cities not in the shantytowns or south l a 
 here in the united states where we have healthcare reform  we don 't have the professionals we need by two thousand and twenty we will be short
  part of the problem the united states is the number one importer of doctors from developing countries  
 the second reasons students flock to cuba is the island 's own health report card  relying on strong primary care 
 a commission from the lancet rates cuba among the best
  countries in health save the children ranks cuba the best country in latin america to become a mother 
 cuba has similar life expectancy and lower infant mortality than the united states with fewer disparities  
 while spending per person one
  what we do on health here in the usa 
  elam is tough but eighty percent of its students graduate the subjects are familiar basic and clinical sciences
 but there are major differences first 
 training has moved out of the ivory tower and into clinic classrooms and neighborhoods  the kinds of places most of these grads will practice  
 sure they have lectures
  on day one 
 second students treat the whole patient 
 mind and body in the context of their families their communities and their culture
  third  they learn public health to assess their patients ' drinking water housing  social and economic
  that a good patient interview
 and a thorough clinical exam provide most of the clues for diagnosis  saving costly technology for confirmation  
 and finally they 're taught over and over again the importance of prevention  especially as chronic diseases cripple health
  also comes with a team approach as much how to work in teams
 as how to lead them with a dose of humility  
 upon graduation these doctors share their knowledge with nurse 's aids midwives  community health workers 
 to help them become better at what they do not to replace them 
 to work with shamans and traditional
  healers 
 elam 's graduates are they proving this audacious experiment right  
 dozens of projects give us an inkling of what they 're capable of doing take the garfuna grads 
 they not only went to work back home but they organized their communities to build honduras ' first indigenous hospital
  with an architect 's help residents literally raised it from the ground up 
 the first patients walked through the doors in december two thousand and seven  and since then the hospital has received nearly one million patient visits  
 and government is paying attention  upholding the hospital as a model
 of rural public health for honduras
 elam 's graduates are smart strong
 and also dedicated 
 haiti  january two thousand and ten 
 the pain people buried under thirty million tons of rubble overwhelming 
 three hundred forty cuban doctors were already on the ground long term
 more were on their way many more were needed at elam students worked round the clock
 to contact two thousand graduates as a result hundreds arrived in haiti
  countries ' worth from mali in the sahara to st lucia bolivia chile and the usa
  they spoke easily to each other in spanish and listened to their patients in creole
 thanks to haitian medical students flown in from elam in cuba many stayed for months  even through the cholera epidemic 
 hundreds of haitian graduates
 had to pick up the pieces  
 overcome their own heartbreak  and then pick up the burden of building a new public health system for haiti  today with aid of
  organizations and governments from norway to cuba to brazil  dozens of new health centers have been built staffed 
 and in thirty five cases headed by elam graduates  
 yet the haitian story also illustrates some of the bigger problems faced in many countries take a
  haitian graduates by two thousand and twelve when cholera struck nearly half working in the public health sector
 but one quarter unemployed and one hundred and ten had left haiti altogether 
 so in the best case scenarios 
 these graduates are staffing and thus strengthening public health systems 
 where often they 're the only doctors around
  in the worst cases there are simply not enough jobs in the public health sector where most poor people are treated 
 not enough political will not enough resources not enough anything
 just too many patients with no care  the grads face pressure from their families too  desperate to make ends meet
  so when there are no public sector jobs these new mds decamp into private practice or go abroad to send money home 
 worst of all in some countries medical societies influence accreditation bodies not to honor the elam degree  
 fearful these grads will take their jobs or reduce their patient loads and income 
 it 's not a question of competencies here in the usa the california
  medical board accredited the school after rigorous inspection 
 and the new physicians are making good on cuba 's big bet  
 passing their boards and accepted into highly respected residencies from new york to chicago to new mexico 
 two hundred strong they 're coming back to the
  and also dissatisfied 
 as one grad put it in cuba 
 we are trained to provide quality care with minimal resources  
 so when i see all the resources we have here  and you tell me that 's not possible i know it 's not true 
 not only have i seen it work i 've done the work 
 elam 's graduates
  from right here in d c and baltimore have come from the poorest of the poor
 to offer health education
 and a voice to their communities they 've done the heavy lifting  now we need to do our part
 to support the twenty three thousand and counting all of us
 foundations  residency directors 
  to step up we need to do much more globally to give these new doctors the opportunity to prove their mettle  
 they need to be able to take their countries  ' licensing exams  they need jobs in the public health sector
 or in nonprofit health centers to put their training and commitment to work
  they need the chance to be the doctors their patients need 
 to move forward  we may have to find our way back
 to that pediatrician who would knock on my family 's door on the south side of chicago when i was a kid who made house calls 
 who was a public servant 
 these aren 't such new ideas of what medicine should be what 's new
  new is the scaling up
 and the faces of the doctors themselves an elam graduate is more likely to be a she than a he 
 in the amazon  peru or guatemala an indigenous doctor in the usa a doctor of color
 who speaks fluent spanish she is well trained can be counted on
 and shares the face and culture of her patients 
 and she deserves our support surely  
 because whether by subway  mule or canoe  she is teaching us to walk the walk
