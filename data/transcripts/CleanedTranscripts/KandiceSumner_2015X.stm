  i want to talk to you
 about my kids now i know everyone thinks that their kid is the most fantastic the most beautiful kid that ever lived 
 but mine really are
  i have six hundred and ninety six kids and they are the most intelligent inventive 
 innovative  brilliant and powerful kids that you 'll ever meet 
 any student i 've had the honor of teaching in my classroom
 is my kid 
 however  because their real parents aren 't rich and i argue because they are mostly of color 
 they will seldom get to see in themselves the awesomeness that i see in them
  what i see in them is myself or what would have been myself i am the daughter of two hardworking
  parents who chose careers
 as public servants my father a minister my mother an educator wealth was never the primary ambition in our house  
 because of this lack of wealth we lived in a neighborhood that
  lacked wealth  and henceforth a school system that lacked wealth  
 luckily however we struck the educational jackpot in a voluntary desegregation program that buses inner city kids black and brown out to suburban schools rich and white 
 at five years old i had to take an
 bus ride to a faraway place to get a better education 
 at five years old  i thought everyone had a life just like mine  
 i thought everyone went to school and were the only ones using the brown crayons to color in their family portraits while everyone else was using the peach colored ones 
 at five years old  i thought everyone was just like me but as i got older  i started noticing things like 
 how come my neighborhood
 friend don 't have to wake up at five o 'clock in the morning and go to a school that 's an hour away  
 how come i 'm learning to play the violin while my neighborhood friends don 't even have a music class why
 were my neighborhood friends learning and reading material that i had done two to three years prior 
  as i got older  i started to have this
 unlawful feeling in my belly like i was doing something that i wasn 't supposed to be doing taking something
 that wasn 't mine 
 receiving a gift  but with someone else 's name on it 
 all these amazing things that i was being exposed to and experiencing i felt
 i wasn 't really supposed to have i wasn 't supposed to have a library fully equipped
 athletic facilities or safe fields to play in 
 i wasn 't supposed to have theatre departments with seasonal plays and concerts digital visual performing arts 
 i wasn 't supposed to have fully resourced biology or chemistry labs school buses that brought me door to door 
 freshly prepared school lunches
 or even air conditioning these are things my
  kids don 't get 
 you see as i got older while i was grateful for this amazing opportunity that i was being given 
 there was this ever present pang of 
 but what about everyone else there are thousands of other kids just like me who deserve this too why doesn 't everyone
  get this why is a high quality education only exclusive to the rich it was like i had some sort of
 survivor 's remorse all of my neighborhood friends were experiencing an educational train wreck that i was
 saved from through a bus ride i was like an educational moses screaming let my people go to high quality schools
  i 'd seen firsthand how the other half was being treated and educated i 'd seen the educational promised land and i could not for the life of me justify the disparity 
 i now teach in the very same school system from which i sought refuge  
 i know firsthand the tools that were given to me as a student
  and now as a teacher i don 't have access to those same tools to give my students  there have been countless nights when i 've cried
 in frustration  anger
 and sorrow  
 because i can 't teach my kids the way that i was taught  
 because i don 't have access to the same resources or tools that were used to teach me 
 my kids deserve so much better 
 we sit and we keep banging our heads against this
  term achievement gap achievement gap is
 it really that hard to understand why these kids perform well and these kids don 't  i mean really  
 i think we 've got it all wrong  
 i think we as gloria ladson billings says should flip our paradigm and our language and call it what it really is it
 's not an achievement gap
  an education debt 
 for all of the foregone schooling resources that were never invested in the education of the black and brown child over time 
 a  little known secret in american history is that the only american institution created specifically for
 people of color is the american slave trade
 and some would argue the prison system but that 's another topic for another ted talk 
 the public school system of this country was built bought and paid for using commerce generated from the slave trade and slave labor
 were enslaved and prohibited from schooling their labor established the very institution from which they were excluded 
 ever since then  every court
  case educational policy reform has been an attempt to retrofit the design rather than just stopping and acknowledging we 've had it all wrong from the beginning 
 an oversimplification of american educational history all right just bear with me 
 blacks were kept out you know the whole slavery thing with the help of philanthropic white
 they built their own schools separate but equal was ok  but while we all know things were indeed separate 
 they were in no ways equal enter brown  v the board of education of topeka kansas in one thousand nine 
 legal separation of the races is now illegal but very few people pay attention
 to all of the court cases since then
  that have undone the educational promised land for every child that brown  v board intended 
 some argue that today our schools are now more segregated than they ever were before we tried to desegregate them in the first place 
 teaching my kids about desegregation
  the little rock nine the civil rights movement is a real awkward moment in my classroom when i have to hear the voice of a child ask 
 if schools were desegregated in 
  are no white kids here 
 these kids aren 't dumb  they know exactly what 's happening and what 's not they know that when it comes to schooling
  black lives don 't matter and they never have 
 for years i tried desperately to cultivate in my kids a love of reading 
 i 'd amassed a modest classroom library of books i 'd accumulated from secondhand shops thrift stores  attics you know  
 but whenever i said those dreadful
  take out a book and read you 'd think i 'd just declared war it was torture 
 one day  after i 'd heard about this website called donorschoose where classroom teachers create wish lists of items they need for their classroom
 and anonymous donors fulfill them i figured i 'd go out on a limb
 and just make a wish list of the teenager 's
  over two hundred brand new books were sent to my room piece by piece every day there were new deliveries and my kids would exclaim with glee
  the whole experience hit home for me when one of my girls as she peeled open a crisp paperback said ms sumner
 you know  i figured you bought these books ' cause you teachers are always buying us stuff  but to know that a stranger
  even know  cares this much about me
 is pretty cool knowing that strangers will take care of you
 is a privilege my kids aren 't afforded 
 ever since the donation there has been a steady stream of kids signing out books to take home and then returning them with the exclamation
  take out a book and read kids rush to my library it wasn 't that they didn 't want to read  but instead they 'd gladly read
 if the resources were there 
 institutionally speaking our public school system has never done right by the black and brown child 
 we keep focusing on the end results or test results and getting frustrated
  get to a catastrophe and we wonder how did it get so bad how did we get here really 
 if you neglect a child long enough you no longer have the right
 to be surprised when things don 't turn out well stop being perplexed or confused or befuddled
 by the achievement gap  the income gap  the incarceration rates
  rates or whatever socioeconomic disparity is the new it term for the moment the problems we have as a country
 are the problems we created as a country 
 the quality of your education is directly proportionate to your access to college your access to jobs your access to the future
  until we live in a world where every kid
 can get a high quality education no matter where they live or the color of their skin there are things we can do
 on a macro level 
 school funding should not be decided by property taxes or some funky economic equation where rich kids continue to benefit from state aid
  while poor kids are continuously having food and resources taken from their mouths  
 governors  senators mayors city council members
 if we 're going to call public education public education then it should be just that 
 otherwise  we should call it what it really is poverty insurance 
 public education keeping poor kids poor since
 believe that education is the great equalizer then it should be just that 
 equal and equitable  until then there 's no democracy in our democratic education 
 on a mezzo level  
 historically speaking the education of the black and brown child has always depended on the philanthropy of others and unfortunately today it still does
  if your son or daughter or niece or nephew or neighbor or little timmy down the street
 goes to an affluent school challenge your school committee to adopt an impoverished school or an impoverished classroom 
 close the divide by engaging in communication and relationships that matter
  when resources are shared they 're not divided they 're multiplied  
 and on a micro level  if you 're a human being donate 
 time  money resources opportunities
 is in your heart there are websites like donorschoose that recognize the disparity and actually
 want to do something about it 
 what is a carpenter with no tools what is an actress with no stage 
 what is a scientist with no laboratory what is a doctor
 with no equipment i 'll tell you they 're my kids shouldn 't they be your kids
