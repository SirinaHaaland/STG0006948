  i spent
 the better part of a decade looking at
 american responses to mass atrocity and genocide  and
 i 'd like to start by sharing with you one moment that to me sums up what there is to know
  about american and democratic responses to mass atrocity and that moment came on april 
 so fourteen years ago almost in the middle of the rwandan genocide in which eight hundred thousand people would be systematically
 exterminated by the rwandan government and some
  in the new york times the paper reported that somewhere between two hundred thousand and three hundred thousand people had already been killed in the genocide it was in the paper
 not on the front page it was a lot like the holocaust coverage it was buried
 in the paper rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy  and amazingly genocide itself was not seen as
  honest moment occurred and that was that an american congresswoman named patricia schroeder from colorado
 met with a group of journalists  and one of the journalists said to her  what 's up what 's going on
 in the u s government two to three hundred thousand people have just been exterminated in the last couple of weeks in rwanda it 's two weeks into the genocide at that time but of course at that time you don 't know
 how long it 's going to last and the journalist said  why is there so little response
  response out of washington why no hearings no denunciations no people getting arrested in front of
 the rwandan embassy or in front of the white house 
 what 's the deal and she said  she was so honest she said it 's a great question 
 all i can tell you is that in my congressional office in colorado and my office in washington we 're getting hundreds and hundreds of
  calls about the endangered
 ape and gorilla population in rwanda  but nobody is calling about the people 
 the phones just aren 't ringing about the people and
 the reason i
 give you this moment is there 's a deep truth in it and that truth is or was in the
  that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements  we didn 't have an endangered people 's movement 
 we had holocaust education in the schools most of us were groomed
 not only on images of of nuclear catastrophe but also on
 images and knowledge of the holocaust there 's a museum of course on the mall in washington right next to lincoln
  and yet the politicization of never again the operationalization of never again had never occurred
 in the  20th century  and that 's what that moment with patricia schroeder i think shows that if
 we are to bring about an end to the world 's worst atrocities  we have to make it such there has
  to be a role there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs in response to
 massive crimes against humanity  and so forth so that was the 20th century  now here and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon
 there is good news  amazing news  in the 21st century  and that is that 
 that looks destined in fact to be permanent it grew up in response to the atrocities in darfur
  it is comprised of students there are something like three hundred anti genocide chapters on college campuses around the country 
 it 's bigger than the anti apartheid
  there are something like five hundred high school chapters
 devoted to stopping
 the genocide in darfur  evangelicals have joined it
  jewish groups have joined it hotel rwanda watchers have joined it 
 it is a cacophonous movement to call it a movement as with all movements perhaps is a little misleading  it 's diverse  it 's got a lot of different approaches  
 it 's got all the ups and the downs of movements  but it has been amazingly successful in one regard 
 in that it it has become it has
  congealed into this endangered people 's movement that was missing in the  20th century  it sees itself such as it is the it  as
 something that will create the impression that there will be political cost there will be a political price to be paid 
 for allowing genocide  for not having an heroic imagination
  for not being an upstander but for being in fact a bystander now
  because it 's student driven there 's some amazing things that the movement has done they have launched a divestment campaign
 that has now convinced i think fifty five universities in twenty two states to divest their holdings
 of stocks with regard to companies doing business in sudan they have a 
  number this is going to sound very kitsch  but for those of you who may not be
  but interested in doing something about genocide  you 
  you type in your zip code  and you don 't even have to know who your congressperson is it will refer you
 directly to your congressperson to your u s senator to your governor where divestment legislation is pending
 they 've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide
 i think the most innovative thing they
  and it takes students to introduce genocide grades so what you now have when a congress is in session is members of congress calling up these
 and saying i 'm just told i have a d minus on genocide  what do i do to get a c  i just want to get a c help me 
 and the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that and there 's always something to do
 now what this movement has done is it has extracted from
 the bush administration from the united states at a time of massive  over stretch military financial diplomatic
 a whole series of commitments to darfur that no other country in the world is making  for instance  the referral of the crimes in darfur to the international criminal
  administration doesn 't like 
 the expenditure of three billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep basically the people who 've been displaced from their homes by the sudanese government by the so called janjaweed the militia to keep those people alive
 until something more durable can be achieved and recently or now not that recently about six months ago the authorization of a peacekeeping force
 of  twenty six thousand that will go and that 's all the bush administration 's leadership and it 's all because of this bottom up pressure and the fact that the phones haven
 from the beginning of this crisis
  the bad news however to this question of will evil prevail is that evil lives on 
 the people in those camps are surrounded on all sides by so called janjaweed these men on horseback with spears and kalashnikovs 
 women who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid in order to feed their families humanitarian aid the dirty secret of it is it has to be
  really to be edible
 are themselves subjected to rape which is a tool of the genocide that is being used 
 and the peacekeepers i 've mentioned  the force has been authorized
 but almost no country on earth has stepped forward since the authorization to actually put its troops or its police in harm 's way  
 so we have achieved an awful lot relative
  and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding as we sit here as we speak
   why the limits to the movement why is what has been achieved  or what what the movement has done been necessary but not sufficient
 to the crime  i think there are a couple there are many reasons but a couple just to focus on briefly  the first is that the movement such as it is  stops
  at america 's borders it is not a global movement  it does not have
 too many compatriots abroad who themselves are asking their governments to do more to stop genocide  
 and the holocaust culture that we have in this country makes americans sort of more prone to  i think want to bring never again
 to life  the guilt that the clinton administration
 expressed that bill clinton expressed over rwanda created a space in our society for a consensus that rwanda was bad
  wrong and we wish we had done more and that is something that the movement has taken advantage of european governments for the most part haven 't acknowledged
 responsibility and there 's nothing to kind of to push back and up against
  so this movement if it 's to be durable and global will have to cross borders  and you will have to see other citizens in democracies
  not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide  but actually making it such 
 governments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude naturally or eagerly  
 as we saw they haven 't even gravitated towards protecting our ports or reigning in loose nukes  why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself towards distant suffering 
 so one reason is it hasn 't gone global the second is of course that at this time in particular in america 's history  we have a credibility
  problem a legitimacy problem in international institutions it is structurally really really hard to do as the bush administration rightly does which is to denounce
 genocide on a monday
 and then describe water boarding on a tuesday as a no brainer and then turn up on wednesday and look for troop commitments  now other
 countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved let me be clear they 're in some ways using
 the bush administration as an alibi  
 but it is essential for us to be a leader in this sphere  of course to restore our standing and our leadership in the world  
 the recovery 's going to take some time  
 we have to ask ourselves what now  what do we do going forward as a country and as citizens in relationship to the world 's worst places the world 's worst suffering
  and the kinds of killers that could come home to roost
 sometime in the future  the place that i turned to answer that question was
 to a man that
 many of you may not have ever heard of and that is a brazilian named sergio vieira de mello
 who as chris said was blown up in iraq in two thousand and three  he was the victim of the
 first ever suicide bomb in iraq it 's hard to remember but there was actually a time
 in the summer of two thousand and three even after the u s invasion where apart from looting civilians were relatively safe in iraq 
 now who was sergio sergio vieira de mello was his name
  in addition to being brazilian  he was described to me before i met him in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four as someone who was a cross between james bond on the one hand
 and bobby kennedy on the other
 and in the u n 
 you don 't get that many people who actually manage to merge those qualities he was james bond like in that he was ingenious  
 he was drawn to the flames
 he chased the flames he was like a moth to the flames something of an adrenalin junkie
 he was successful with women
  because in some ways one could never tell if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist or an idealist masquerading as a realist as people always wondered about bobby kennedy and john kennedy
 in that way what he was was a decathlete of nation building of problem solving of troubleshooting
 in the world 's worst places and in the world 's most broken places in failing states  
  precisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist
 on the horizon and precisely the kinds of places where
 most of the world 's suffering tends to get concentrated these are the places he was drawn to 
 he moved with the headlines he was in the u n for thirty four years he joined at the age of twenty one 
 started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the ' 70s were wars of independence and decolonization  he was there in
  bangladesh dealing with the outflow of millions of refugees the largest refugee flow in history up to that point  he was in sudan when the civil war broke out there
 he was in cyprus right after the turkish invasion he was in mozambique for the war of independence  
 he was in lebanon amazingly he was in lebanon the u n base was used palestinians staged attacks out from behind the u n base
  israel then invaded
 and overran the u n base sergio was in beirut
 when the u s embassy was hit by the first ever suicide attack against the united states people date the beginning of this new era to nine eleven but surely one thousand nine hundred and eighty three with the attack on the us embassy and the marine barracks which sergio witnessed
 those are in fact in some ways the dawning of the of the era that we find ourselves in today from lebanon he went to bosnia in
  was the first person to negotiate with the khmer rouge talk about evil prevailing i mean here he was in the room with the embodiment
 of evil in cambodia he negotiates with the serbs  he actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil and trying to convince evil that it doesn 't need to prevail
 that he earns the nickname not sergio but serbio while he 's living in the balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations he then goes
  to rwanda and to congo in the aftermath of the genocide and he 's the guy who has to decide
 huh  ok the genocide is over eight hundred thousand people have been killed the people responsible are fleeing into neighboring countries into congo into tanzania 
 i 'm sergio i 'm a humanitarian and i want to feed those well i don 't want to feed the killers but i want to feed the two million people who are with them  so we 're going to go we 're going to set up camps
 uh oh the killers are within the camps well i 'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves let me go door to door to the international community and see if anybody will give me police
 or troops to do the separation and their response of course was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm 's way to do that
 nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps  so then you have to make the decision do you turn off the international spigot of life support
  and risk two million civilian lives  or do you continue feeding the civilians knowing that the genocidaires are in the camps literally sharpening sharpening their knives
 for future battle what do you do it 's all lesser evil terrain in these broken places  late 
  is the cause du jour he 's the guy put in charge he 's the paul bremer or the jerry bremer of first kosovo and then east timor he governs the places
  's the viceroy  he has to decide on tax policy on currency on border patrol
  on policing he has to make all these judgments he 's a brazilian in these places he speaks seven languages he 's been
 up to that point in fourteen war zones so he 's positioned to make better judgments perhaps than people who have never done that kind of work but nonetheless  
 he is the cutting edge of our experimentation with doing good
 with very few resources being brought to
  bear in again  the world 's worst places and then after timor nine eleven has happened he 's named u n human rights commissioner and he has to balance liberty and security and figure out  what do you do when the most powerful country in the united nations is
 bowing out of the geneva conventions bowing out of international law do you denounce well if you denounce you 're probably never going to get back in the room  
 maybe you stay reticent maybe you try to charm
  bush and that 's what he did 
 and in so doing he earned himself unfortunately his final and tragic appointment to iraq the one that resulted in his death 
 one note on his death  which is so devastating 
 is that despite predicating the war on iraq on a link between saddam hussein and terrorism in nine eleven 
 believe it or not the bush
  the invaders did no planning no  pre war planning to respond to terrorism so sergio this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil and how to deal with brokenness 
 lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue 
 stateless the guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career like a refugee because he represents the u n if you represent everyone in some ways you represent no one you 're
  what the american the most powerful military in the history of mankind was able to muster for his rescue believe it or not 
 was literally these heroic two american soldiers went into the shaft building was shaking one of them had been at nine eleven and lost his buddies
 on september 11th and yet went in and risked his life in order to save sergio but all they had was a woman 's handbag literally one of those basket handbags
 and they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at
  and created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building
 in the interests of rescuing this person the person we most need to turn to now this shepherd 
 at a time when so many of us feel like we 're lacking guidance 
 and this was the pulley system this was what we were able to muster for sergio the good news  for what it 's worth is after sergio and twenty one others were killed that day in the attack on the u n 
 the military created a search and rescue unit that had the cutting
  equipment the shoring wood  the cranes the things that you would have needed to do the rescue but it was too late for sergio 
 i want to wrap up but i want to close with what i take to be the four lessons from sergio 's life on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing which is how i would have framed
 the question here 's this guy who
  head start thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with we as citizens are grappling with now
  what do we take away first i think is
 his relationship to in fact evil is something to learn from 
 he over the course of his career changed a great deal he had a lot of flaws but he was very adaptive i think that was his greatest quality  
 he started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers he would charge up to people who were violating international law and he would say
  violating this is the u n charter don 't you see it 's unacceptable what you 're doing 
 and they would laugh at him because he didn 't have the power of states  the power of any military or police he just had the rules he had the norms and he tried to use them  
 and in lebanon southern lebanon in ' eighty two he said
 to himself and to everybody else i will never use the word unacceptable 
  i will never use it i will try to make it such but i will never use that word again but he lunged in the opposite direction he started as i mentioned to
 get in the room with evil to not denounce 
 and became almost obsequious when he won the nickname serbio for instance and even when he negotiated with the khmer rouge
 would black box what had occurred prior to entering the room  but by the end of his life  i think he had struck a balance that we as a country can learn from 
 be in the room  don 't be afraid of
  talking to your adversaries but don 't bracket
 what happened before you entered the room don 't black box history don 't check your principles at the door
  and i think that 's something that we have to be in the room whether it 's nixon going to china or khrushchev and kennedy or reagan and gorbachev all the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by
  going into the room and it doesn 't have to be an act of weakness 
 you can actually do far more to build an international coalition against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room and showing to the rest of the world that that person that regime is the problem and that you the united states are not the problem 
 second take away from sergio 's life briefly
  what i take away and this in some ways is the most important
  exhibited a reverence for dignity
 that was really really unusual
  at a micro level the individuals around him were visible he saw them 
 at a macro level  he thought you know we talk about democracy promotion but we do it in a way sometimes that 's an affront to people 's dignity 
 we put people on humanitarian aid and we boast about it because we 've spent three billion it 's incredibly important those people would no longer be alive
  states for instance hadn 't spent that money in darfur  
 but it 's not a way to live if we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens and as individuals with relation to the people around us 
 and as a country if we could inject a regard for dignity into our dealings with other countries 
 it would be something of a revolution 
 third point  very briefly  he talked a lot about freedom
  and i recognize there is so much to be afraid of there are so many genuine threats in the world  but what sergio was talking about is let 's calibrate
 our relationship to the threat let 's not hype the threat  let 's actually see it clearly we have reason to be afraid of of melting ice caps we have reason to be afraid
 that we haven 't secured loose nuclear material in the former soviet union let 's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and
  but not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic of a fear in times of fear for instance one of the things sergio used to say is fear is a bad advisor  
 we lunge towards the extremes when we aren 't operating and trying to again calibrate our relationship to the world around us fourth and final point he somehow because he was working in all the world 's worst places and all lesser evils 
 had a humility  of course  and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him i mean such an acute awareness of how hard it was how sisyphean
 this task was of mending  and yet aware of that complexity humbled by it
 he wasn 't paralyzed by it and we as citizens as we go through this experience of the kind of 
 the crisis of confidence crisis of competence crisis of legitimacy i think there 's a temptation to pull back from the world and say 
  iraq we don 't know what we 're doing we can 't afford
 to pull back from the world it 's a question of how
 to be in the world and the lesson i think of the anti genocide movement that i mentioned that is a partial success but by no means
 has it achieved what what it has set out to do it 'll be many decades probably before that happens
 but is that if we want to see change  we have to become the change  we can 't rely upon our institutions to do the work of of necessarily talking to adversaries on their
  own without us creating a space for that to happen  for having respect for dignity and for bringing that combination of humility and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility 
 to our dealings with the rest of the world  so will evil prevail is that the question  i think the short answer is no not unless we let it
