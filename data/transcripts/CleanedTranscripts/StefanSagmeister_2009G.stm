  i run a design studio in new york  every seven years i close it for one year to pursue
 some little experiments things that are always difficult to accomplish during the regular working year  in that year
 not available for any of our clients 
 we are totally closed and as you can imagine  it is a lovely and very energetic time 
 i originally had opened the studio in new york to combine my two loves  music and design and we created
 videos and packaging for many musicians that you know and for even more that
  you 've never heard of 
 as i realized just like with many many things in my life that i actually love  i adapt to it  and i get 
 over time bored by them 
 and for sure in our case our work started to look the same you see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book quite the similar idea
  book in a die cut so i decided
 to close it down for one year also is the knowledge that right now we spend about in the 
 years of our lives learning then there is another forty years
 that 's really reserved for working and then tacked on at the end of it are about fifteen years for retirement
  and i thought it might be helpful to basically cut off five of those retirement years and intersperse them in between those working years 
 that 's clearly
  probably even more important is that
 the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large rather than just
 benefiting a grandchild or two 
 there is a fellow tedster who spoke two years ago  jonathan haidt who defined his work into three different levels  and they rang very true for me i can see my work as a job
  i do it for money i likely already look forward to the weekend on thursdays and i probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism 
 in a career i 'm definitely more engaged  but at the same time there will be periods when i think is all that really hard work really
 worth my while 
 while in the third one in the calling very much likely i would do it also if i wouldn 't be financially compensated for it  
 i am not a religious person myself but
 i
 did look for nature  i had spent my first sabbatical in new york city looked for something different for the second one  
 europe and the u s didn 't really feel enticing because i knew them too
  asia it was the most beautiful landscapes i had seen in asia were sri lanka and bali 
 sri lanka still had the civil war going on so bali it was  it 's a wonderful 
 society i arrived there in september two thousand and eight and pretty much started to work right away there is
 wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself however the first thing that i needed was
 mosquito repellent typography because they were definitely around heavily  
 and then i needed some sort of way to be able to get back to all the wild dogs that surround my house  and
 attacked me during my morning walks  so we created this series of
  on one tee shirt  as a little retaliation with a just ever so slightly
 menacing message on the back of the shirt 
 just before i left new york i decided
 i could actually renovate my studio  and then just leave it all to them  and i don 't have to do anything so
  i looked for furniture  and it turned out that
 all the furniture that i really liked  i couldn 't afford  
 and all the stuff i could afford i didn 't like so one of the things that we pursued in bali was pieces of furniture 
 this one of course still works with the wild dogs it 's not quite
 finished yet  and i think by the time this lamp came about
  i had finally made peace with those dogs 
 then there is a coffee table i also did a coffee table  
 it 's called be here now  it includes three hundred and thirty compasses 
 and we had custom espresso cups made
 that
 hide a magnet inside and make those compasses go
  crazy always centering on them  then this is a fairly
 talkative  verbose kind of chair  
 i also started meditating for the first time in my life in bali  
 and at the same time i 'm extremely aware how boring it is to hear about other people 's happinesses  so i will
 not really go
  too far into it  
 many of you will know this tedster  danny gilbert  
 whose book actually i got it through the ted book club i think it took me four years to finally read it while on sabbatical  
 and i was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical
  and i 'll show you a couple of people
 that did well by pursuing sabbaticals this is ferran adria many people think he is right now the best chef in the world with his restaurant north of barcelona el bulli 
 his restaurant is open seven months every year he closes it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff his latest numbers are fairly impressive 
 he
  can seat eight thousand people and he has two point two million requests for reservations 
 if i look at my cycle seven years one year sabbatical it 's twelve point five percent of my time 
 and if i look at companies that are actually more successful than mine
 there is some good successes scotch tape came out of this program 
 as well as art fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for 3m 
 google of course very famously gives twenty percent for their software engineers to pursue
  anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical
  that 's about
 five percent of everybody so i 'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up talk to them
 about if it was successful or not i 've found that
 finding out about what i 'm going to like in the future my very best way is to talk
  to people who have actually done it much better than myself envisioning it  
 when i had the idea of doing one the process was i made the decision and i put it into my daily planner book  
 and then i told as many many people as i possibly could about it so that there was no way that i could chicken
  in the beginning on the first sabbatical it was rather
 was rather disastrous  
 i had thought that i should do this without any plan that this vacuum of time somehow would
 be wonderful and enticing for idea generation it was not  i just without a plan  i just reacted to
 little requests not work requests
  those i all said no to but other little requests sending mail to japanese design magazines and things like that so i became my own intern and
 i very quickly
 made a list of the things i was interested in put them in a hierarchy  divided them into
  chunks of time and then made a plan very much like in grade school 
 what does it say here monday eight to nine story writing  nine to ten future thinking 
 was not very successful and so on and so forth and that actually specifically as a starting point of the first sabbatical  worked really well for me  what came out of it  
 i really got close to design again  i had fun 
  seen over the long term it was actually successful because of the improved quality we could ask for higher prices  
 and probably most importantly  basically everything we 've done in the seven years following the first sabbatical came out of thinking
 of that one single year  and i 'll show you a couple of
 projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical one of the strands of thinking i was involved in was that
  sameness is so incredibly overrated this whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few strand of companies and not for everybody else
 we were asked to design an identity for casa da musica the rem 
 music center in porto in portugal and even though i desired to do an identity that doesn
  't use
 the architecture 
 i failed at that and mostly also because i realized out of a rem koolhaas presentation to the city of porto where he talked about a conglomeration 
  of various layers of meaning  which i understood after i translated it from architecture speech in to regular
  basically as logo making  and i understood that the building itself was a logo  so then it became quite easy we put a mask on it  
 looked at it deep down in the ground  checked it out from all sides  
 west north  south  east  top and bottom  
 colored them in a very particular way by having a friend of mine
 write a piece of software the casa da musica logo generator that 's connected to a scanner
  you put any image in there like that beethoven image and the software in a second will give you the casa da musica beethoven logo  
 which when you actually have to design a beethoven poster comes in handy because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same so it will always fit together conceptually of course
  's music is performed 
 it gets its own logo or philip glass or lou reed or the chemical brothers who all performed there get their own casa da musica logo it works the same internally
  with the president or the musical director  whose casa da musica portraits wind up on their business cards 
 the truck they go on tour with or there 's a smaller contemporary
 orchestra twelve people that remixes its own title  
 and one of the handy things that came about was that you could take the logo type and create advertising out of it like this donna toney poster or chopin
  or mozart or la monte young 
 you can take the shape and make typography out of it you can grow it underneath the skin 
 you can have a poster for a family event in front of the house or a rave underneath the house
 or a weekly program  as well as educational services
  until that point i had been mostly involved or used the language of design
 for promotional purposes  which was fine with me on one hand i have nothing against selling my parents are
 both salespeople but i did feel that
 i spent so much time learning this language why do i only
  there must be something else  and the whole series of work came out of it  
 some of you might have seen it  i showed some of it at earlier teds before under the title things i 've learned in my life so far 
 i 'll just show two now 
 this is a whole wall of bananas at different ripenesses on the opening day in this gallery in new york it says 
  this is after a week  
 after two weeks  three weeks  four weeks  five weeks and you see the self confidence almost comes back but not quite 
 these are some pictures visitors sent to me 
 and then the city of amsterdam gave us a plaza and asked us to do something 
 we used the stone plates as a grid for
  our little piece 
 we got two hundred and fifty thousand coins from the central bank 
 at different darknesses so we got brand new ones shiny ones  medium ones and very old  dark ones  
 and with the help of one hundred volunteers over a week  created this fairly floral
  obsessions make my life worse and my work better 
 and the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between should i really take as much money 
  as i can or should i leave the piece intact as it is right now 
  one hundred volunteers a good number of the
 neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it so
 when it was finally done and in the first night a guy came with big plastic bags and
 scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry one of the neighbors called the police  and the amsterdam police in all their wisdom
  and they wanted to protect the artwork  and they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters 
 i think you see you see them sweeping you see them sweeping right here that 's the police getting rid of it all
 so after eight hours that 's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing
  a bigger project in bali it 's a movie about happiness and here we asked some nearby pigs to do the titles for us 
 they weren 't quite slick enough so we asked the goose to do it again and hoped she would do somehow a more elegant or pretty job  
 and i think she overdid it  just a bit too ornamental 
 and my studio is very close to the monkey forest
  and the monkeys in that monkey forest looked actually fairly happy  so we asked those guys to do it again they
 did a fine job but had
 a couple of readability problems  
 so of course whatever you don 't really do yourself doesn 't really
  be working on for the next two years  so
 it 's going to be a while and of course you might think that doing a film on happiness
 might not really be worthwhile then you can of course always go and see this guy
