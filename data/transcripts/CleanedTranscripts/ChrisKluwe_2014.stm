  and professional football have to do with empathy and what is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow now unfortunately
 i 'm only going to answer one of those questions today so please try and contain your disappointment 
 when most people think about augmented reality  they think about minority report and tom cruise waving his hands in the air  but augmented reality is not science 
  fiction augmented reality is something that will happen in our lifetime  and it will happen because we have the tools to make it happen and people need to be aware of that because augmented reality will change our lives
  just as much as the internet and the cell phone now how do we get to augmented reality step one is the step i 'm wearing right now google glass  
 i 'm sure many of you are familiar with google glass 
 what you may not be familiar with is that google glass is a device that will allow you to see what i see it will allow you to experience what it is like to be a professional athlete on the field 
  the only way you can be on the field is for me to try and describe it to you i have to use words i have to create a framework that you then fill in with your imagination 
 with
 google glass 
 we can put that underneath a helmet and we can get a sense of what it 's like to be running down the field at one hundred miles an hour your blood pounding in your ears 
 you can get a sense of what it 's like
 to have a
  trying to decapitate you with every ounce of his being  and i 've been on the receiving end of that and it doesn 't feel very good 
 now  i have some footage to show you of what it 's like to wear google glass underneath the helmet to give you a taste of that unfortunately it 's not nfl practice footage because the nfl thinks emergent technology is what happens when a submarine surfaces  
  so as you can see  small taste of what it 's like to get tackled on the football field
  from the perspective of the tacklee now you may have noticed there are some people missing there  the rest of the team we have some video of that courtesy of the university of washington
  but this is nowhere what it 's like to be on the nfl 
 fans want that experience fans want to be on that field they want to be their favorite players and they 've already talked to me on youtube they 've talked to me on twitter saying hey can you get this on a quarterback can you get this on a running back we want that experience 
 well once we have that experience with
  and google glass  how do we make it more immersive how do we take that next step well we take that step by going to something called the oculus rift which i 'm sure many of you are also familiar with 
 the oculus rift has been described as one of the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created and that is not empty hype i 'm going to show you why that is not empty hype with this video
  that is the experience of a man on a roller coaster in fear of his life 
 what do you think that fan 's experience is going to be when we take
  the video footage of an adrian peterson bursting through the line shedding a tackler with a stiff arm before sprinting in for a touchdown  
 what do you think that fan 's experience is going to be when he 's messi sprinting down the pitch putting the ball in the back of the net or federer serving in wimbledon 
 what do you think his experience is going to be when he is going down the side of a mountain at over seventy miles an hour as an olympic downhill skier 
 i think adult diaper sales may surge
  not yet augmented reality this is only virtual reality v r how do we get to augmented reality a r 
 we get to augmented reality when coaches and managers and owners look at this information streaming in that people want to see and they say how do we use this to make our teams 
  better how do we use this to win games because teams always use technology to win games  they like winning it makes them money
  technology in the nfl in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five the baltimore colts put a wristband on their quarterback to allow him to call plays quicker  
 they ended up winning a super bowl that year  other teams followed suit more people watched the game because it was more exciting it was faster in one
 thousand nine hundred and ninety four the nfl put helmet radios into the helmets of the quarterbacks and later the defense
  more people watched games because it was faster it was more entertaining 
 in two thousand and twenty three imagine you 're a player walking back to the huddle  and you have your next play displayed right in front of your face on your clear plastic visor that you already wear right now  
 no more having to worry about forgetting plays no more worrying about having to memorize your playbook  you just go out and react  and coaches really want this because
  missed assignments lose you games  and coaches hate losing games losing games gets you fired as a coach they don 't want that 
 but augmented reality is not just an enhanced playbook 
 augmented reality is also a way to take all that data and use it in real time to enhance how you play the game  
 what would that be like well a very simple setup would be a camera on each corner
  the stadium looking down giving you a bird  's eye view of all the people down there  
 you also have information from helmet sensors and accelerometers technology that 's being worked on right now  
 you take all that information and you stream it to your players the good teams stream it in a way that the players can use the bad ones have information overload that determines good teams from bad 
 and now your i t department is just as important as your scouting department and
  is not for nerds anymore it 's also for jocks who knew 
 what would that look like on the field  well  imagine you 're the quarterback you take the snap and you drop back you 're scanning downfield for an open receiver 
 all of a sudden a bright flash on the left side of your visor lets you know  blind side linebacker is blitzing in normally you wouldn 't be able to see him but the augmented reality system lets you know  you step up into the pocket another flash alerts you to an open
  you throw the ball but you 're hit right as you throw the ball comes off track you don 't know where it 's going to land  however on the receiver 's visor he sees a patch of grass light up and he knows to readjust 
 he goes catches the ball sprints in touchdown  crowd goes wild and the fans are with him every step of the way watching from every perspective  
  tons of people watch because
 people want this experience fans want to be on the field they want to be their favorite player 
 augmented reality will be a part of sports because it 's too profitable not to 
 but the question i ask you is is that 's all that we 're content to use augmented reality for 
 are we going to use it solely for our panem our circenses our entertainment as normal 
 because i believe that we can use augmented reality for something more i believe we can use augmented reality
  reality as a way to foster more empathy within the human species itself by literally showing someone what it looks like to walk a mile in another person 's shoes 
 we know what this technology is worth to sports leagues 
 it 's worth revenue to the tune of billions of dollars a year  but what is this technology worth to a teacher in a classroom
 trying to show a bully just how harmful his actions are from the
  perspective of the victim what is this technology worth to a gay ugandan or russian trying to show the world what it 's like living under persecution 
 what is this technology worth to a commander hadfield or a neil degrasse tyson
 trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of quarterly reports and kardashians  
 ladies and gentlemen
  augmented reality is coming  
 the questions we ask  the choices we make and the challenges we face are as always up to us
