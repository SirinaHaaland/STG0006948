  was trying to think how is sync connected to happiness and it occurred to me that
 for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing we we like to dance together
  we like singing together and so if you 'll put up with this i would like to
 enlist your your help with a a first experiment today the experiment is
 and i notice by the way that when you applauded that you did it in a typical north american way that is you were raucous and incoherent
  it didn 't even occur to you to clap in unison
 do you think you could do it i would like to see if this audience would no you haven 't practiced as far as i know
 can you get it together to clap in sync
 whoa now that 's what we call emergent behavior
 so i didn 't expect
  that but i mean i mean i expected you could synchronize it didn 't occur to me you you 'd increase your frequency it 's interesting
 so what do we make of that first of all we know that you 're all brilliant
 this is a room full of intelligent people highly sensitive some trained musicians
  out there
 is that what enabled you to synchronize so so to put the question a little more seriously
 let 's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did for spontaneous synchronization
 do you need for instance to be as smart as you are
 do you even need a brain at all
 just to synchronize do
  you need to be alive
 i mean that 's a spooky thought right inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves
 it 's real
 in fact i
 'll try to explain today that that sync is maybe one of if not one of the most perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature it extends from the subatomic scale
 to the farthest reaches of the cosmos
 it 's a deep tendency toward order in
  nature that that opposes what we 've all been taught about entropy i mean i 'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong it 's not but there is a countervailing force in the universe the tendency towards spontaneous order
 and so
 that 's our theme now to get into that
 let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately when you hear that we 're talking about synchrony in nature which is the the glorious example of
  birds that flock together or or fish swimming in organized schools so
 these are not particularly intelligent creatures and yet as we 'll see they they exhibit beautiful ballets
 this is from a bbc show called predators
  to swarm to avoid predators to confuse predators let me
 be quiet for a second
 this behavior wondering how it could be possible
 we 're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony
 these creatures are not choreographed they 're choreographing themselves
 and only today is science starting to figure out how it works
  model made by ian kuzan a researcher at oxford that shows how swarms work there are just three simple rules
 first all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors second all the individuals have a tendency to line up
 and third they 're all attracted to each other but they try to keep a small distance apart
 and
  when you build those three rules in automatically you start to see swarms that look very much like fish schools or or bird flocks
 now fish like to stay close together about a body length apart
 birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart but except for that differences
 the rules are the same for both
 now all this
  changes when a predator enters the scene
 there 's a fourth rule when a predator 's coming
 get out of the way
 here on the model you see the predator attacking
 the prey move out in random
  directions and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again so there 's this constant splitting and reforming
 and you see that in nature
 keep in mind that although it looks as if
 each individual is acting to cooperate what 's really going on is a
  kind of selfish darwinian behavior each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers
 that is out of the
 the desire to save itself each creature is following these rules and that leads to something that 's safe for all of them even though it looks like they 're thinking as a group
  might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm so you can think of several
 as i say if you 're in a swarm your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group
 there are many eyes to spot danger and you 'll see
 in the
 example with the starlings with the birds when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them that actually waves of panic can propagate
 sending messages over great distances you 'll see let 's see it 's coming up possibly at the very
 maybe not information can be can be sent over half a kilometer away in a very short time through this mechanism
 yes it 's happening here see if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm
 it 's beautiful the birds are are we sort of understand we think from that computer model what 's going on as i say it 's just those three simple rules plus the one
  about watch out for predators there doesn 't seem to be anything mystical about this
 we don 't however really understand at a mathematical level i 'm a mathematician we would like to be able to understand better
 i mean i showed you a computer model but a computer is not understanding a computer is in a way just another experiment we would really like to have a deeper insight into how this
 works and to understand
 you know exactly where this organization comes from how do the rules give rise to the patterns
 there is one case that we have begun to understand better and it 's the case of fireflies
 if you see fireflies in north america like so many north american sorts of things they tend to be independent operators they ignore each other
 they each do their own thing flashing on and off paying no attention to their neighbors
 but in southeast asia places like thailand or malaysia or borneo
 there 's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies you can see it every night along the river banks
 the trees mangrove trees are filled with fireflies communicating with light
 specifically it 's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together in perfect synchrony
 to reinforce a message to the females and the message as you can imagine is come hither
 mate with me
 in a second i 'm going to show you a slow motion of a single firefly
 so that you can get a sense this is a single frame
 then on and then off a thirtyth of a second there and then watch this whole river bank and watch how precise the synchrony is
  is
 on more on and then off
 the combined light from these beetles these are actually tiny beetles is so bright that fishermen 
  out at sea can use them as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers
  western travelers like sir francis  doctorake went to thailand and came back with with tales of this unbelievable spectacle
 no one believed them we don 't see anything like this in europe or in the west
 and for a long time even after it was documented it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it
 or
 you know a human being 's tendency to see patterns where there are
  none but i hope you 've convinced yourself now with this nighttime video that they really were very well well synchronized
 okay well the issue then is do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order and i 've already hinted that the answer is no
 well you don 't have to be a whole creature you can even be just a single cell
  your pacemaker cells in your heart right now they 're keeping you alive every beat of your heart depends on this this crucial region the sinoatrial node
 which has about ten thousand independent cells that would each beep
 have an electrical rhythm a voltage up and down
 to send a signal to the ventricles to pump now your pacemaker is not a single cell it 's this democracy of ten thousand cells that all have to fire in unison for the pacemaker to work correctly
 i don 't want to give you
  the idea that synchrony is always a good idea if you have epilepsy there is an instance of billions of brain cells or at least millions discharging in pathological concert
 so so this tendency towards order is not always a good thing
 you don 't have to be alive you don 't have to be even a single cell if you if you look for instance at how lasers work
 that would be a case of atomic synchrony
 in a laser
 what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here is that this light is incoherent many different colors and different frequencies
 sort of like the way you clapped initially
 but if you were a laser it would be rhythmic applause it would be all atoms pulsating in unison emitting light of one color one frequency
 now comes the very risky part of my talk which is to demonstrate that inanimate
  things can synchronize hold your breath for me what i have here are two empty water bottles
 this is not keith barry doing a magic trick this is a klutz just playing with some water bottles i have some metronomes here
  can you hear that
 all right so i 've got a metronome and it 's the world 's smallest metronome the well i shouldn 't advertise anyway
 so this is the world 's smallest metronome i 've set it on the fastest setting and i 'm going to now take another one set to the same setting
 we can try this first if i just put them on the table together there 's no reason for them to synchronize and they
  probably won
 't maybe you 'd better listen to them i 'll stand here
 what i 'm hoping is that they might just drift apart because their frequencies aren 't perfectly the same
  right they did they were in sync for a while but then they drifted apart
 and the reason is that they 're not able to communicate now you might think that 's a bizarre idea how can metronomes communicate
 well they can communicate through mechanical forces so i 'm going to give them a chance to do that i also want to wind this
 one up a bit how can they communicate i 'm going to put them on a movable platform which is the
 the guide to graduate study at cornell okay so
 here it is let 's see if we can get this to work
 my wife pointed out to me that it will work better if i put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over
 all right so there we go let 's see
 ok i 'm not trying
  to cheat let me start them out of sync
 no hard to even do that
 'll just put those
 right there now that might seem a bit whimsical but
 this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order
 sometimes has unexpected consequences and a clear case of that was something that happened in london in the year two thousand
 the millennium bridge was supposed to be the pride of london a beautiful new
 footbridge
  erected across the thames first river crossing in over one hundred years in london
 there was a big competition for the design of this bridge and the winning
 proposal was submitted by an unusual team in the ted spirit actually of an architect
 perhaps the greatest architect in the united kingdom lord norman foster working with an artist a sculptor sir anthony caro and an
  engineering firm
 ove arup and together they submitted a design based on
 lord foster 's vision which was he remembered as a kid reading flash gordon comic books
 and he said that when flash gordon would come to an abyss he would shoot what today
  across the thames
  design of this bridge and
