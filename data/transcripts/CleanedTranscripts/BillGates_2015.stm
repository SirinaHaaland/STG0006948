  when i was a kid  the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war 
 that 's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement  filled with cans of food and water
  when the nuclear attack came we were supposed to go downstairs  hunker down and eat out of that barrel
  today the greatest risk of global catastrophe
 doesn 't look like this instead it looks like this 
 if anything kills over ten million people
 in the next few decades it 's most likely
 to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war 
 not missiles  but microbes  
 now  part of the reason for this is that we 've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents  
 but we 've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic we
 're not ready
 for the next epidemic
  's look at ebola i 'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper  lots of tough challenges i followed it carefully through the
 case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication 
 and as you look at what went on  the problem wasn 't that there was a system that didn 't work well enough the problem was that we didn 't have
  at all in fact there 's some pretty obvious
 key missing pieces  
 we didn 't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go who would have gone  seen what the disease was seen how far it had spread 
 the case reports came in on paper it was very delayed before they were put online and they were
  we didn 't have a medical team ready to go  we didn 't have a way of preparing people now 
  did a great job orchestrating volunteers  but even so we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries  
 and a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of
  there was no one there to look at treatment approaches 
 no one to look at the diagnostics no one to to figure out what tools should be used as an example we could have taken the blood of survivors  processed it 
 and put that plasma back in people to protect them
 but that was never tried  so there was a lot that was missing and these things are really a global failure
  the  who is funded to monitor epidemics  but not to do these things i talked about 
 now in the movies it 's quite different there 's a group of handsome epidemiologists
 ready to go they move in they save the day  but that 's just pure hollywood
  the failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than ebola
 let 's look at the progression of ebola over this year 
 about ten thousand people died  and nearly all were in the three west african countries  
 there 's three reasons why it didn 't spread more the first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers
 they found the people and they prevented more infections the second is the nature of the virus ebola does not spread through the air  
 and by the time you 're contagious most people are so sick that they 're bedridden  
 third  it didn 't get into many urban areas and that was just luck  if it had gotten into a lot more urban areas
  case numbers would have been much larger  so next time we might not be so lucky you can have a virus
 where people feel well enough while they 're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market  
 the source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like ebola or it could be bioterrorism so there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse
  let 's look at a model
 of a virus spread through the air  like the spanish flu back in one thousand nine hundred and eighteen 
 so here 's what would happen it would spread throughout the world very very quickly  
 and you can see over thirty million people died from that epidemic  
 so this is a serious problem we should be concerned  but in fact
  we can build a really good response system  
 we have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here 
 we 've got cell phones to get information from the public and get information out to them  we have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they 're moving  
 we have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines
  vaccines that fit for that
 pathogen 
 so we can have tools but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system  and we need preparedness 
 the best lessons i think on how to get prepared are again what we do for war 
 for soldiers we have full time waiting to
  we have reserves that can scale us up to large numbers
 nato has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly  nato does a lot of war games to check are people well trained do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies so they are absolutely ready to go 
 so those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic
 what are the key pieces  first we need strong health systems in poor countries
 that 's where mothers can give birth safely  kids can get all their vaccines but also where we 'll see the outbreak very early on 
 we need a medical reserve corps  lots of people who 've got the training and background who are ready to go with the expertise  
 and then we need to pair those medical
  taking advantage of the military 's ability to move fast do logistics and secure areas  
 we need to do simulations  germ games not war games  so that we see where the holes are 
 the last time a germ game was done in the united states was back in two thousand and one  and it didn 't go so well so far the score is germs one 
  we need lots of advanced r  & d in areas of vaccines and diagnostics  there are some big breakthroughs like the adeno associated virus that could work very very quickly  
 now i don 't have an exact budget for what this would cost  but i 'm quite sure it 's very modest
 compared to the potential harm the world bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic global wealth will go down
 by over three trillion dollars
 and we 'd have millions and millions of deaths 
 these investments offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic  the primary healthcare the r  & d those things would reduce global health equity
 and make
 the world more just as well as more safe  
  so i think this should absolutely be a priority  
 there 's no need to panic  we don 't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement  
 but we need to get going  because time is not on our side 
 in fact if there 's one positive thing that can come out of the ebola epidemic  
 it 's that it can serve as an early warning a wake up call to get ready  
 if we start now  we can be ready for the next epidemic
