  let 's say you despise western democracy 
 democracy in all its trappings free elections town halls  endless debates about the proper
  too unpredictable too constraining for your taste and the way these democracies band together and lecture everyone else about
 individual rights and freedoms it gets under your skin  so what to do about it  
 you can call out the hypocrisy and failures of western democracies and
 explain how your way is better but that 's never really worked for you what if
  you could get
 the people whose support is the very foundation of these democracies
 to start questioning the system make the idea occur in their own minds that
 democracy and its institutions are failing them their elite are corrupt puppet masters and the country they knew is in free fall 
 to do that
  infiltrate the information spheres of these democracies you 'll need to turn their most powerful asset an open mind
 into their greatest vulnerability you 'll need people to question the truth  
 now you 'll be familiar of hacking and leaks that happened in two thousand and
  one was the democratic national committee 's networks and the personal email accounts of its staff  later released on wikileaks  
 after that various online personas like a supposed romanian cybercriminal who didn 't speak romanian  
 aggressively pushed news of these leaks to journalists 
 the media took the bait they were consumed by how much the dnc hated
  at the time it was that narrative that far outshined the news that a group of russian government sponsored hackers who we called advanced persistent threat 
 for short was carrying out these operations against the us 
 and there was no shortage of evidence this group of russian government hackers hadn 't just appeared out of nowhere in two thousand and sixteen we had started tracking this group back in
  used to compromise its victims ' networks demonstrated a thoughtful well resourced effort
 that had taken place for now over a decade in moscow 's time zone from about nine am to six pm
 apt28 loved to prey on the emails and contacts of journalists
  all targets with an undeniable interest to the russian government we weren 't the only ones onto this governments research teams across the world 
 were coming to similar conclusions and observing the same types of operations 
 but what russia was doing in two thousand and sixteen went far beyond espionage 
 the dnc hack was just one of many where stolen data
  was posted online accompanied by a sensational narrative 
 then amplified in social media for lightning speed adoption by the media 
 this didn 't ring the alarm bells that 
  was trying to interfere with the credibility of another 's internal
  did we not see this coming why did it take months before americans understood that they were under a 
 information attack  
 the easy answer is politics  the obama administration was caught in a perfect catch 22 
 by raising the specter that the russian government was interfering in the us presidential campaign the administration risked appearing to meddle
  in the campaign itself  
 but the better answer i think is that the us and the west were utterly unequipped to recognize and respond to a modern information operation 
 despite the fact that the us had wielded information
 with devastating success in an era not so long ago  look  so while the us and the
  west spent the last twenty years caught up in cybersecurity what networks to harden  which infrastructure to deem critical 
 how to set up armies of cyber warriors and cyber commands
 russia was thinking in far more consequential terms  
 before the first iphone even hit the shelf
  the russian government understood the risks and the opportunity that technology provided and 
 and instant communication it provided us  
 as our realities are increasingly based on the information that we 're consuming at the palm of our hand and from the news feeds that we 're scanning and the hashtags and stories that we see trending 
 the russian government was the first to recognize how this evolution
 had turned your mind
  into the most exploitable device on the planet  
 and your mind is particularly exploitable if you 're accustomed to an unfettered flow of information 
 now increasingly curated to your own tastes  
 this panorama of information that 's so interesting to you gives a state or anyone for that matter a perfect back door into your
  mind it
 's this new brand of state sponsored information operations that can be that much more successful more insidious and harder for the target audience that includes the media
 to decipher and characterize if you can get a hashtag trending on twitter  or chum the waters with
 fake news directed to audiences primed to receive it  or drive journalists to dissect terabytes of email for a cent of impropriety all tactics used in russian operations
 then you 've got a shot at effectively camouflaging your operations in the mind of your target 
 this is what russia 's long called reflexive control it 's the ability to use
  information on someone else so that they make a decision on their own accord that 's favorable to you 
 this
 image control and perception management and it 's conducted by any means with any tools network based or otherwise that will achieve it 
 take this for another example in early february two thousand and fourteen a few weeks before russia would invade crimea a phone call is posted on youtube
 in it there 's two us diplomats they sound like they 're playing kingmaker in ukraine
  and worse they curse the eu for its lack of speed and leadership in resolving the crisis
  the media covers the phone call and then the ensuing diplomatic backlash
 leaves washington
  it creates a fissured
 response and a feckless attitude towards russia 's land grab in ukraine  mission accomplished  
 so while hacked phone calls and emails and networks keep grabbing the headlines  the real operations are the ones
 that are influencing the decisions you make and the opinions you hold  all in the service of
  this is power in the information age  
 and this information is all that much more seductive 
 all that much easier to take at face value and pass on when it 's authentic 
 who 's not interested in the truth that 's presented in phone calls and emails
 that were never intended for public
  but how meaningful is that truth if you don 't know why it 's being revealed to you 
 we must recognize that this place where we 're increasingly living  which we 've quaintly termed cyberspace 
 isn 't defined by ones and zeroes but by information and the people behind it 
 this is far more than a network of computers and devices  this is a network composed of minds
 interacting with computers and devices
 and for this network 
 there 's no encryption there 's no firewall 
 no two factor authentication no password complex enough to protect you 
 what you have for defense is far stronger it 's more adaptable it 's always running the latest version
  it 's the ability to think critically call out falsehood  press for the facts 
 and above all you must have the courage
 to unflinchingly pursue the truth
