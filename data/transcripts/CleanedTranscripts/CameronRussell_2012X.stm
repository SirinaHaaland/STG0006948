  my name is cameron russell  and for the last
 little while i 've been a model  actually for ten years
  i feel like there 's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now
 because i should not have worn this dress so
 luckily i brought an outfit change  this is the first outfit change on the ted stage so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it i think
  if some of the women were really horrified when i came out you don 't have to tell me now but i 'll find out later on twitter
  note that i 'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me
 in a very brief ten seconds not everybody gets to do that these heels are very uncomfortable  so
 good thing i wasn 't going to wear them 
 the worst part is putting this sweater over my head because that 's when you 'll all laugh at me  so don 't do anything while it 's over my head
 so  why did i do that 
 that was awkward 
 well 
 hopefully not as awkward as that picture  
 image is powerful
  but also image is superficial 
 i just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds  
 and in in this picture i had actually never had a boyfriend in real life
  i was totally uncomfortable and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand
 in that guy 's hair 
 and of course barring surgery
  or the fake tan that i got two days ago for work 
 there 's very little that we can do to transform how we look 
 and how we look  though it is superficial and immutable has a huge impact on our lives
  so today for me being fearless
 means being honest and i am on this stage because i am a model i am on this stage because i am a pretty
  in my industry we call that a sexy girl
  i 'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me but with an honest twist  so the first question is how do you become a model
  i always just say oh i was scouted but that means nothing 
 the real way that i became a model
 is i won a genetic lottery  and i am the recipient of a legacy  and maybe you 're wondering what is a legacy well 
 for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as
  health and youth and symmetry that we 're biologically programmed to admire  but also as tall slender figures  and femininity
 and white skin and this is a legacy that was built for me and it 's a legacy that i 've been cashing out on
  and i know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point and maybe there are some fashionistas who are like
  wen and first i commend you on your model knowledge very impressive 
 but unfortunately i have to inform you that in two thousand and seven a very inspired nyu ph d student counted
 all the models on the runway every single one that was hired  and of the six hundred and seventy seven models that were hired only twenty seven or
  the next question people always ask is can i be a model when i grow up and the first answer is i don 't know they don 't put me in charge of that 
 but the second answer and what i really want to say to these little girls is why you know you can be anything you could be the president of the united states or the inventor of the next internet or
 a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet which would be awesome because you 'd be the first one
  because i 'm not in charge of anything and you could be the editor in chief of american vogue or the ceo of h & m or the next steven meisel
  saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the powerball when you grow up it 's
 out of your control  and it 's awesome  and it 's not a
 career path 
 i will demonstrate for you now ten years of accumulated model knowledge  because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons it can just be distilled right now so 
 if the photographer is right there  the light is right there like a nice hmi and the client says we want a walking shot this leg goes first nice and long this arm goes back this arm goes forward the head is at three quarters and you just go back and forth just do that and then you look back at your imaginary
  it will look something like this 
 hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle that was i don 't know what happened there
  unfortunately after you 've gone to school and you have a rsum and you 've done a few jobs you can 't say anything anymore so
 if you say you want to be the president of the united states  but your rsum reads underwear
  people give you a funny look the next question is do they retouch all the photos and yeah they pretty much retouch all the photos  but that is only a small component of what 's happening 
 this picture is the very first picture that i ever took and it 's also the very first time that i had worn a bikini  and i didn 't even have my period yet i know we 're getting personal  but
 i was a young girl this is what i looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier here 's me on the same day as this shoot my friend got to come
  here 's me at a slumber party a few days before i shot french vogue here 's me on the soccer team and in v magazine 
 and here 's me today  
 and i hope what you 're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me they are constructions 
 and they are constructions by a group of professionals by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and
 the next question people always ask me is do you get free stuff 
 i do have too many 8 inch heels which i never get to wear except for earlier
  but the free stuff that i get is the free stuff that i get in real life and that 's what we don 't like to talk about
  i grew up in cambridge and one time i went into a store and i forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free 
 when i was a teenager i was
  with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course we got pulled over and all it took was a sorry officer and we were on our way
  and i got these free things because of how i look not who i am and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are 
 i live in new york and last year of the one hundred and forty thousand teenagers that were stopped and frisked
  and latino and most of them were young men and
 there are only one hundred and seventy seven thousand young black and latino men in new york so for them it 's not a question of will i get stopped but how many times will i get stopped when will i get stopped 
 when i was researching this talk  i found out that of the 13 year old girls in the united states
 don 't like their bodies and that number goes to seventy eight % by the time that they 're seventeen  so the last question people
  ask me is 
 what is it like to be a model and i think the answer that they 're looking for is if you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair 
 you will be so happy and fabulous 
 and when we 're backstage we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that we say it 's really amazing to travel  and it 's amazing to get to work with
  and those things are true but they 're only one half of the story because the thing
 that we never say on camera that i have never said on camera is i am insecure and i 'm insecure because i have to think about what i look like
 every day
  and if you ever are wondering if i have thinner thighs and shinier hair will i be happier 
  you just need to meet a group of models because they have the thinnest thighs the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes and they 're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet
  when i was writing this talk  i found it very difficult to strike an honest balance because on the one hand 
 i felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say look i 've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor 
 and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with and it doesn 't always make me happy 
 but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy
 of gender and racial oppression when i am one of the biggest beneficiaries  but
 i 'm also happy and honored to be up here and i think that it 's great that i got to come
 before ten or twenty or thirty years had passed and i 'd had more agency in my career because maybe then i wouldn 't tell the story of how i got my first job  
 or maybe i wouldn 't tell the story of how i paid for college which seems so important right now
  takeaway to this talk i hope it 's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image
 in our perceived successes and our perceived failures
