  in two thousand and two a group of treatment activists met
 to discuss the early development of the airplane  
 the wright brothers in the beginning of the last century had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly
  fly  they also had taken out numerous patents on essential parts of the airplane they were not the only ones that was
 common practice in the industry  and those who held patents on airplanes were defending them fiercely and suing competitors left and right  
 this actually wasn 't so great
  for the development of the aviation industry  and this was at a time that in particular the u s government was interested in ramping up
 the production of military airplanes  so there was a bit of a conflict there the u s government decided to take action 
 and forced those patent holders
 to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of
  what has this
 got to do
 with this 
 in two thousand and two  nelson otwoma a kenyan social scientist 
 discovered he had hiv and needed access to treatment 
 he was told
 that a cure did not exist
  he heard was lethal 
 and treatment was not offered  this was at a time that treatment actually existed in rich countries  
 aids had become a chronic disease people in our countries here in europe in north america were living with hiv  healthy lives 
 not so for nelson he wasn 't rich enough 
 and not so for his three year old son who he discovered a year later also had hiv
  decided to become a treatment activist and join up with other groups in two thousand and two  they were facing
 a different battle  prices for
 drugs needed to treat hiv  cost about twelve thousand [ dollars ] per patient per year
  the patents on those drugs were held by a number of western pharmaceutical companies
 that were not necessarily willing
 to make those patents available when you have a patent you can exclude anyone else from making
  led to patent wars breaking out all over the globe  
 luckily those patents did not exist everywhere 
 there were countries that did not recognize pharmaceutical product patents such as india  
 and indian pharmaceutical companies started to produce so called generic versions
  medicines and make them available available in the developing world and within a year the price had come down from ten thousand
 dollars per patient per year to three hundred and fifty dollars per patient per year and today that same triple pill cocktail is available for sixty dollars per patient per year and of course
 that started to have an enormous effect on the number of people who could afford
 access to those medicines treatment programs became possible  funding became available and the number of people
 on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very
 rapidly  today  eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs
  are infected with hiv never has this number been so high but actually this is good news  because what it means is people stop dying people who have access to these drugs stop dying  and there 
  's something else they also stop passing on the virus this is fairly recent science that has shown that what that means is we have the tools to break the back of
  things have changed first of all  the rules have changed  today  all countries
 are obliged to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least twenty years  this is as a result of the
 the intellectual property rules of the world trade organization  so what india did
  is no longer possible  second  the practice of patent holding companies have changed  here you see
 the patent practices before the world trade organization 's rules before 
  antiretroviral drugs this is what you see today
  and this is in developing countries so what that means is unless we do something deliberate
 and unless we do something now we will very soon be faced
 with another drug price crisis  because new drugs are developed new drugs go to market but these medicines are patented
 in a much wider range of countries so unless we act  unless we do something
  we will soon be faced [ with ] what some have termed the treatment
 time bomb it isn 't only
 the number of drugs that are patented there 's something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away this shows you
 a patent landscape this is the landscape of one medicine  
 so you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to
  invest in the development of this product unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available you will probably choose
 to do something else again deliberate action is needed so surely
 if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes
  we should be able to do something similar
 to tackle the hiv  aids epidemic  and we did in two thousand and ten unitaid
 established the medicines patent pool
 for hiv  
 and this is how it works
  that develop new medicines
 patent those inventions  
 but make those patents available to the medicines patent pool the medicines patent pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents 
 that can be generic manufacturers it can also be not for profit drug development agencies for
  those manufacturers can then sell those medicines at much lower cost
 to people who need access to them to treatment programs that need access to them 
 they pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property 
 there is one key difference
  with the airplane patent pool  the medicines patent pool
 is a voluntary mechanism 
 the airplane patent holders were not left a choice whether they 'd license their patents or not they were forced to do so 
 that is something that the medicines patent pool cannot do it relies on the willingness
 of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and
  them available for others for others to use today  nelson otwoma
 is healthy he has access
 to antiretroviral drugs his son will soon be fourteen years old  nelson is a member of the expert
  advisory group of the medicines patent pool  and he told me not so long ago ellen  we rely
 in kenya and in many other countries on the medicines patent pool to make sure
 that new medicines
 also become available to us that new medicines  without delay become available to us
  give you an example in august of this year the united states drug agency approved a new 
 aids medication the company gilead  that holds the patents has licensed licensed the intellectual property to the medicines patent pool  
 the pool is already working
  two months later 
 with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product can go to market at low cost where and when it is needed this is unprecedented  
 this has never been done before the rule is about a 10 year delay for a new product to go to market in developing countries if at all  
 this has never been seen before  
 nelson 's
 's expectations are very high  and quite rightly so he and his son will need access to the next generation of antiretrovirals
 and the next throughout their lifetime so that he
 and many others in kenya and other countries can continue to live healthy
  to the medicines patent pool
