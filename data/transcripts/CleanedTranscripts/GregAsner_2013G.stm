  technology can change our understanding of nature 
 take for example the case of lions 
 for centuries it 's been said that female lions do all of the hunting out in the open savanna and male lions do nothing until it 's time for dinner 
 you 've heard this too i can tell
  tell 
 well recently i led an airborne mapping campaign in the kruger national park in south africa 
 our colleagues put gps tracking collars on male and female lions and we mapped their hunting behavior from the air 
 the lower left shows a lion sizing up a herd of impala for a kill  
 and the right shows
  that 's how far the lion can see in all directions until his or her view is obstructed by vegetation  
 and what we found is that male lions are not the lazy hunters we thought them to be they just use a different strategy  
 whereas the female lions hunt out in the open savanna over long distances usually during the day 
 male lions use an ambush strategy in dense vegetation and often at night 
 this video shows
  the actual hunting viewsheds of male lions on the left and females on the right 
 red and darker colors show more dense vegetation and the white are wide open spaces  and this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level of hunting male and female lions 
 all of a sudden you get a very clear understanding of the very spooky conditions under which
  because it emphasizes how little we know about nature 
 there 's been a huge amount of work done so far to try to slow down our losses of tropical forests and we are losing our forests at a rapid rate as shown in red on the slide  
 i find it ironic that we 're doing so much yet these areas are fairly unknown to
  so how can we save what we don 't understand 
 now i 'm a global ecologist and an earth explorer with a background in physics and chemistry and biology and a lot of other boring subjects  
 but above all i 'm obsessed with what we don 't know about our planet 
 so i created this the carnegie airborne observatory  or cao it may look like a plane with a fancy paint job but i packed it with over one thousand kilos
  and a very motivated staff
 of earth scientists and pilots two
 of our instruments are very unique  one is called an imaging spectrometer that can actually measure the chemical composition of plants as we fly over them  
 another one is a set of lasers very high powered lasers that fire out of the bottom of the plane  sweeping across the ecosystem and measuring it at nearly five hundred thousand times per second
  here 's an image of the golden gate bridge in san francisco not far from where i live although we flew straight over this bridge we imaged it in 3d captured its color in just a few seconds  
 but the real power of the cao is its ability to capture the actual building blocks of ecosystems  
 this is a small town in the amazon imaged with the cao we can slice through our data and see for example the 3d structure of the vegetation and the buildings
 or we can use the chemical information to actually figure out how fast the plants are growing as we fly over them  the hottest pinks are the fastest growing plants 
 and we can see biodiversity in ways that you never could have imagined this is what a rainforest might look like as you fly over it in a hot air balloon 
 this is how we see a rainforest in kaleidoscopic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another
 but you have to remember that these trees are literally bigger than whales  and what that means is that they 're impossible to understand just by walking on the ground below them  
 so our imagery is 3d 
 it 's chemical it 's biological  
 and this tells us not only the species that are living in the canopy  but it tells us a lot of information about the rest of the species that occupy the rainforest  
  created the cao in order to answer questions that have proven extremely challenging to answer from any other vantage point  such as from the ground or from satellite sensors  
 i want to share three of those questions with you today  
 the first questions is how do we manage our carbon reserves in tropical forests 
 tropical forests contain a huge amount of carbon in the trees  and we need to keep that carbon in those forests if
  going to avoid any further global warming  unfortunately global carbon emissions from deforestation
 now equals the global transportation sector that 's all ships  airplanes trains and automobiles combined  so it 's understandable
 that policy negotiators have been working hard to reduce deforestation
  but they 're doing it on landscapes that are hardly known to science  
 if you don 't know where the carbon is exactly in detail  how can you know what you 're losing  basically we need a high tech accounting system 
 with our system we 're able to see the carbon stocks of tropical forests in utter detail  
 the red shows  obviously closed canopy tropical forest and then you see the cookie cutting or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens 
 it 's like cutting a cake except this cake
  is about whale deep  
 and yet we can zoom in and see the forest and the trees at the same time  
 and what 's amazing is even though we flew very high above this forest later on in analysis we can go in and actually experience the treetrops leaf by leaf branch by branch just as the other species that live
 in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves we 've been using the technology
  explore and to actually put out the first carbon geographies in high resolution in faraway places like the amazon basin and not so faraway places like the united states and central america 
 what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to take 
  tour of the carbon landscapes of peru and then panama  
 the colors are going to be going from red to blue red is extremely high carbon stocks your largest cathedral
  forests you can imagine and blue are very low carbon stocks  and let me tell you peru alone is an amazing place totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography until today  
 we can fly to this area in northern peru and see super high carbon stocks in red and the amazon river and floodplain cutting right through it 
 we can go to an area of utter devastation caused by deforestation
  and the virus of deforestation spreading out in orange  we can also fly to the southern andes
 to see the tree line and see exactly how the carbon geography ends as we go up into the mountain system  
 and we can go to the biggest swamp in the western amazon it 's a watery dreamworld akin to jim cameron 's avatar 
 we can go to one of the smallest tropical countries panama and see also a huge range of carbon variation from high in red to low in blue
  most of the carbon is lost in the lowlands  but what you see that 's left in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds is the stuff that 's up in the mountains 
 one interesting exception to this is right in the middle of your screen  you 're seeing the buffer zone around the panama canal that 's in the reds and yellows the canal authorities are using force to protect their watershed and global commerce 
 this kind of carbon mapping has transformed conservation
 and resource policy development it 's really advancing our ability to save forests and to curb climate change 
 my second question how do we prepare for climate change in a place like the amazon rainforest  
 let me tell you i spend a lot of time in these places and we 're seeing the climate changing already  temperatures are increasing  and what 's really happening is we 're getting a lot of droughts  recurring droughts 
  with red showing an area about the size of western europe 
 the amazon was so dry in two thousand and ten that even the main stem of the amazon river itself dried up partially as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide 
 what we found is that in very remote areas these droughts are having a big negative impact on tropical
  for example these are all of the dead trees in red that suffered mortality following the two thousand and ten drought this area happens to be on the border of peru and brazil  totally unexplored  almost totally unknown scientifically 
 so what we think as earth scientists is species are going to have to migrate with climate change from the east in brazil all the way west into the andes and up into the mountains in order to minimize their exposure to climate change 
 one of the problems with
  this is that humans are taking apart the western amazon as we speak look at this 
 gash in the forest created by gold miners 
 you see the forest in green in 3d and you see the effects of gold mining down below the soil surface 
 species have nowhere to migrate in a system like this obviously  
 if you haven 't been to the amazon you should go it 's an amazing experience every time
  matter where you go you 're going to probably see it this way on a river  
 but what happens is a lot of times the rivers hide what 's really going on back in the forest itself 
 we flew over this same river imaged the system in 3d the forest is on the left and then we can digitally remove the forest and see what 's going on below the
  and in this case we found gold mining activity all of it illegal set back away from the river 's edge as you 'll see in those strange pockmarks coming up on your screen on the right 
 don 't worry we 're working with the authorities to deal with this and many many other problems
 in the region  so in order to put together a conservation plan for these unique important corridors like the western amazon and the andes amazon
  we have to start making
 geographically explicit plans now how do we do that if we don 't know the geography of biodiversity in the region if it 's so unknown to science  
 so what we 've been doing is using the laser guided spectroscopy from the cao to map for the first time the biodiversity of the amazon rainforest  
 here you see actual data showing different species in different colors reds are one type of species blues
  are another and greens are yet another  
 and when we take this together and scale up to the regional level 
 we get a completely new geography of biodiversity unknown prior to this work 
 this tells us where the big biodiversity changes occur from habitat to habitat and that 's really important because it tells us a lot about where species may migrate to and migrate from as the climate
  and this is the pivotal information that 's needed by decision makers to develop protected areas in the context of their regional development plans 
 and third and final question is how do we manage biodiversity on a planet of protected ecosystems  
 the example i started out with about lions hunting that was a study we did
 behind the fence line of a protected area in south africa  and the truth is much of africa 's nature is going to persist into the future in protected
  areas like i show in blue on the screen 
 this puts incredible pressure and responsibility on park management they need to do and make decisions that will benefit all of the species that they 're protecting  
 some of their decisions have really big impacts for example how much and where to use fire as a management tool 
  how to deal with a large species like elephants  which may if their populations get too large have a negative impact on the ecosystem and on other species  
 and let me tell you these types of dynamics really play out on the landscape 
 in the foreground is an area with lots of fire and lots of elephants  wide open savanna in blue  and just a few trees as we cross this fence line now we 're getting into an area that has had protection from fire and zero elephants  
 dense vegetation a radically different
  ecosystem 
 and in a place like kruger the soaring elephant densities are a real problem  
 i know it 's a sensitive issue for many of you and there are no easy answers with this  
 but what 's good is that the technology we 've developed and we 're working with in south africa for example is allowing us to map every single tree
  and then through repeat flights we 're able to see which trees are being pushed over by elephants in the red as you see on the screen  and how much that 's happening in different types of landscapes in the savanna 
 that 's giving park managers a very first opportunity to use tactical management strategies that are more nuanced and don 't lead to those extremes that i just showed you 
 so really the way we 're looking at protected areas nowadays is to think of it
  as tending to a circle of life where we have fire management elephant management those impacts on the structure of the ecosystem 
 and then those impacts affecting everything from insects up to apex predators like lions 
 going forward i plan to greatly expand the airborne observatory  i 'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit so we can manage the entire planet with technologies like this 
  then you 're going to find me flying in some remote place that you 've never heard of i just want to end by saying that technology is absolutely critical to managing our planet  
 but even more important is the understanding and wisdom to apply it thank you
